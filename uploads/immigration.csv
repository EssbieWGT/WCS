Police named Jose Castro-Rivera, 24, of Honduras, as the deceased individual.

Agents were conducting a vehicle stop as part of a “targeted, intelligence-based immigration enforcement operation” when the man “resisted heavily and fled the scene onto a busy highway,” according to the Department of Homeland Security.

Castro-Rivera was then hit by a pickup truck on Interstate 254 at the Military Highway Interchange in Norfolk, according to Virginia State Police, who were not involved in the chase but are investigating the death.

ICE officers attempted to give the 24-year-old CPR at the scene, though he succumbed to his injuries, DHS said.

“The officer then informed the three detained aliens that their friend had deceased,” according to the agency. “He then grieved and prayed with them.”

A similar death occurred in August, when Roberto Carlos Montoya Valdez of Guatemala died after running onto a highway in Monrovia, California, during a chase involving immigration agents.

As part of the Trump administration’s deportation push, masked agents in unmarked cars have been surged to cities around the country and have often used aggressive, raid-style tactics against crowds in public places like Home Depot parking lots. Last month, more than two-thirds of those in ICE detention had no prior criminal conviction.

In September, a 79-year-old U.S. citizen and car wash owner sued federal immigration officials, alleging masked officers shoved him to the ground, dogpiled on top of him, and held him without charges or medical attention for 12 hours during a raid on his business.

Earlier this month, a federal judge in Illinois temporarily barred agents from using rubber bullets, tear gas, and chemical munitions on protesters and journalists, following a lawsuit from press associations and faith leaders accusing Donald Trump’s administration of “a pattern of extreme brutality.”

At least 20 people have died in immigration detention this year, the deadliest in decades.

CHICAGO – More than 200 people participated in the 2025 Illinois Together Against Hate: Human Rights in Action Conference on Oct. 21 in Champaign, Illinois. The Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR), the Illinois Commission on Discrimination and Hate Crimes (CDHC), and the City of Champaign’s Equity & Engagement Department collaborated efforts to amplify conversations and strengthen partnerships to combat hate.

The event served as a powerful, in-person gathering for community members, civil rights advocates, and human rights professionals to share actionable tools, innovative strategies, and impactful connections that drive lasting change.

The keynote address was delivered by Dr. Cynthia Miller-Idriss, a leading scholar and author on extremism and radicalization, and founder of the Polarization & Extremism Research & Innovation Lab (PERIL) at American University.

Attendees participated in sessions and workshops covering topics ranging from understanding discrimination protections in Illinois to emerging, evidence-based strategies for preventing hate and extremism.

Acts of hate are defined as those that target people based on their actual or perceived race, creed, color, religion, ancestry, gender, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability, citizenship, immigration status, or national origin. Hate incidents are categorized into hate crimes, bias-motivated civil rights violations, and hateful, but legal expressions.

Officials urgently call on all residents to report acts of hate through the Help Stop Hate initiative—a safe, confidential service that provides support and resources. Almost one year since the program’s launch in October 2024, it serves as a vital lifeline for survivors, offering immediate relief through anonymous reporting, trauma-informed care, and connections to services—such as legal aid—to fill gaps where traditional systems fall short.

“The spread of hate and human rights violations is inextricably bound to the erosion of our democracy,” said IDHR Director Jim Bennett. “We are seeing acts of hatred and violence compound. By convening these important conversations, we are taking practical steps to make all Illinoisans safer. We will lead by example, showing America and the world that there is another way forward—one that honors our shared humanity and rejects the politics of fear and division.”

“At a time when presidential rhetoric emboldens extremists and targets vulnerable communities, we are encouraging Illinoisans to take action by reporting all acts of hate,” said CDHC Executive Director Elana Kahn, “This conference represents a critical step forward in amplifying conversations and partnerships. By working together, residents alongside local and state leaders can move the needle on hate and take practical steps to protect our democracy.”

Help Stop Hate is a statewide priority that supports targeted individuals while informing new policies for confronting hate. However, underreported acts of hate limit the ability to prevent and respond to hate effectively. Progress hinges on support from every Illinoisan.

“Illinois is at the forefront of state efforts to counter and prevent hate and the violence that comes from it,” said Dr. Cynthia Miller-Idress. “This event comes at exactly the right time and gives me hope that the urgency and commitment Illinois brings to this issue will shine a light for the rest of the country.”

Help Stop Hate allows Illinoisans to report acts of hate safely and anonymously, with no affiliation to law enforcement or immigration authorities. Personal information will only be shared with law enforcement if legally required and will never be shared with immigration agencies.

Illinoisans can report online to Help Stop Hate anytime in seven languages: English, Spanish, Polish, Mandarin, Tagalog, Arabic or Hindi. The phone line is open between noon and 9 p.m. CT, Monday to Friday, to English and Spanish speakers. Additional translation services are arranged as needed.

Over the last several months, Nicholas Pierce’s work as an asylum, refugee and deportation defense lawyer on the Front Range has meant playing catch-up. The immigration policies and orders that seem to come on a near-daily basis from the federal government have been hard to keep up with.

In a recent interview, Pierce tried to make sense of the latest effort by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which activists said was called “Freaky Friday,” offering unaccompanied immigrant children cash to self deport, and potentially depriving them of the right to hearings. A local human services agency had reached out to him earlier in the day asking how it would impact the young immigrants in their care.

He couldn’t answer. Instead he had to turn to others, including a contact at ICE, to figure it out.

“It is, in a lot of ways, much worse than what I had anticipated, much faster than I had anticipated,” Pierce said about the impact the president’s immigration crackdown has had on Colorado. “I was an immigration lawyer during the first Trump administration, and there was just a lot more checks and balances in the system.”

With about 400 cases on his plate through his Denver-based firm Amistad Law, Pierce said he’s seen firsthand how families and communities are being torn apart. He said many have had their legal statuses stripped away, through things like ending Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans — many of whom sought refuge in Colorado. Others, he said, have chosen to go into hiding for fear of being detained when appearing for their asylum interviews.

Pierce, who is a former U.S. Army Reserve service member and whose work receives state funding through the Colorado Refugee Support Program, is one of hundreds of Coloradans polled by CPR News and other outlets in the Colorado News Collaborative who have expressed either complete opposition to or frustration with some of the ways Trump has carried out his campaign promise to close the southern border and reduce the number of undocumented immigrants living in the country.

A small number we heard from say they support the president’s actions, calling them necessary to free up government resources for things like housing and Medicaid for citizens or protect the country from socialism.

Since the beginning of the year, the Trump administration has increased immigration raids across U.S. cities, including in Colorado, escalated tactics like sending the National Guard to back up ICE in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., and reversed Biden-era policies, including allowing arrests at schools and churches.

What Coloradans are saying about immigration

In the survey circulated by Colorado newsrooms, including CPR News, a majority of the nearly 400 respondents said that, even if they supported some of the president’s stated goals, they opposed some of the immigration enforcement tactics currently being used by federal agents.

Specifically, Coloradans take issue with federal agents violating due process and not focusing on deporting the “worst of the worst” criminals.

“I have no problem with deporting those convicted of felonies, but ambushing families is despicable,” said a woman in Grand Junction.

“I am in favor of the overall goal, but I do take issue with some of the practices,” said a man from Broomfield. “Treat people as human beings, even if they are criminals.”

A man in Durango summarized it like a report card. He gave efforts to close the border an A+, deporting criminals a C-, visa restrictions a D-, the use of Immigration and Customs Enforcement an F and described the use of the National guard as illegal. He said Trump also failed in the area of “Politicalization.”

“Deport criminals not workers,” said a woman in Durango. ICE tactics like “unmarked cars, civilian clothes, refusal to identify themselves should be eliminated.”

“It’s a waste of time to deport people contributing to the economy,” said a man in Colorado Springs. “I’m more concerned with the affordability of housing and health care.”

“The response has been too extreme and brutal,” said a woman in Colorado Springs. “It targets too many law-abiding, legal, U.S. residents,: denying due process to detainees.”

Evergreen resident Norman Sherbert said he believed the president was carrying out what he promised to do when elected and correct the previous administration’s actions.

“I’m not here to tell the government how to do their job,” Sherbert elaborated via email. “All I know is that 11 or 12 million illegal immigrants coming into our country, seeing pictures of the masses of people standing at our borders, and hearing of children without guardianship being used to gain entrance into the U.S. is not good policy. And, in the long run over the next generations, will have a deteriorating effect on our society and way of life.”

Sherbert sees the administration’s extreme measures as a necessary way to right the situation with the limited time and resources it has.

At a flea market in Colorado Springs on a recent weekend, JoAnn Antaya said she believed Trump wanted to help people during his first administration but doesn’t agree with the tactics being used today.

A German-born American who remembered how difficult it was to adjust to a new culture as a child, Antaya believes society has lost its compassion.

“We do not care about our fellow man,” Antaya, 63, said. “So it’s easy to put a wall between here and Mexico because you know what? They have nothing to do with you. Heaven forbid if you should hand them a crust of bread. No, I’m not happy with my country.

“It’s like they’re not compromising. They’re not coming to a happy medium. They’re just combative. And that’s all it is: Argument, argument, argument.”

What the polls say about immigration concerns

Opinion polling suggests how Coloradans feel about immigration has a lot to do with where they live.

A poll from the Colorado Health Foundation released earlier this year looked at top issues facing Coloradans. It surveyed over 2,300 people across the state.

It found that “illegal immigration” was a major concern for about half of the residents surveyed, though the extent of the concern depended on where respondents lived, lower in urban areas (39 percent), versus suburban (58 percent) and rural (65 percent).

Ninety percent of respondents on the Eastern Plains believe illegal immigration is a problem in Colorado compared to 46 percent in Denver metro.

On the flip side, 20 percent of all respondents said the mistreatment of immigrants was an “extremely serious” concern compared to 42 percent of respondents saying it was “not too serious.”

Broken down by region, that concern fluctuated, with 44 percent of urban respondents saying mistreatment is extremely or very serious compared to 30 percent of suburban respondents and 23 percent of rural respondents.

“The regional, the urbanity and the partisanship seemed to really be driving how folks react to those problems and react differently to the two different framings that we tested,” said Lucia Del Puppo, senior vice president with the research firm that conducted the Pulse Poll.

CHF spokesperson Katie Peshek says Pulse Poll findings are shared with policymakers to help them understand the real issues residents are facing and prioritize those concerns.

“With a third of poll respondents pointing to government and politics as the state’s leading challenge, it’s clear that on issues like immigration, the cost of living and housing, Coloradans are ready for real action and solutions,” Peshek said.

Meanwhile, a national Gallup poll released this summer found that only 30 percent of Americans say immigration should be reduced, a position that has shrunk by fifteen points since last year.

But the support for stanching immigration largely falls along party lines, with the poll finding “Republicans are the only group still showing at least plurality support for reducing immigration.”

In a recent national poll of registered voters by the New York Times/Sienna, “51 percent said they thought the government was deporting mostly people who ‘should be deported,’ while 42 percent said the government was deporting the wrong people.”

That poll, too, found respondents wrestling with the administration’s aggressive tactics.

“More than half of voters, 53 percent, think the process of deporting people has not been fair; 44 percent said it was mostly fair,” according to The New York Times.

How Colorado leaders are responding to federal actions

Some Coloradans praised the work of elected officials to stand in the way of federal immigration enforcement.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser has used his office’s powers to fight against federal immigration actions, from defending in-state tuition for noncitizen students to suing a sheriff’s deputy for involving ICE in a traffic stop that resulted in the detainment of a college student.

In the spring, state lawmakers passed a bill designed to protect undocumented immigrants from coming to the attention of federal authorities. And over the summer, Colorado’s Democratic members of Congress toured the state’s only immigration facility in Aurora, only to leave with more questions than answers.

Colorado governments are in danger of losing federal funds and the state is being sued by the federal government for so-called sanctuary policies, but Democratic leaders have so far resisted the administration’s pressure campaign, arguing immigration enforcement is not the state’s problem.

That doesn’t mean inter-agency coordination isn’t happening. Despite state laws strictly limiting when officials can cooperate with ICE requests, state agencies were found to have provided federal immigration officials with Coloradans’ personal information in response to subpoenas several times this year. Those actions by the Polis administration have riled fellow Democrats and immigration advocates.

Looking ahead

Even though state laws prohibit local law enforcement from helping federal agents, targeted immigration raids continue to take place across the state, including outside of metro regions. In the last couple of weeks, local news outlets have reported on an incident in Alamosa where ICE detained a family with a baby inside a vehicle at gunpoint, smashing a car window, and a situation in Routt County where a county commissioner was blocked by ICE vehicles.

For Pierce, it’s not just new policies that have made it difficult for him — or other lawyers — to do this job. He’s seen announcements of immigration court judges resigning or being fired, resulting in longer processing times for cases. Clients are also being transferred to detention facilities out of state, making it hard to connect with their legal counsel and putting them at risk of being deported within days.

“So when it comes to hurting people, the system’s gotten a lot faster. When it’s come to helping people, the system’s gotten a lot slower,” he said.

The majority of Pierce’s cases involve Afghan men who fought alongside the U.S. military during the Afghanistan War and are now waiting to get legal residency. Most of them filed petitions in 2022 or 2023 but still don’t have a court date set. With the reimposition of the so-called Muslim ban by the Trump administration this summer, it has been difficult for them to be reunited with their families. Pierce says these policies betray a promise made by the U.S. government for fighting alongside its troops.

The situation is leaving the men with two options: risk likely death to join their families back home or wait in the U.S, in the hope that their families will eventually be allowed to join them.

It’s gotten so bad that Pierce has found himself for the first time ever advising people to seek asylum in Argentina or Chile. He’s even started to offer powers-of-attorney services so that family or friends with U.S. citizenship can take control of bank accounts and other assets if their loved ones are rapidly deported.

Should the city council choose to continue with informational outreach, minimal costs could be absorbed within existing departmental budgets.
After the city council members deliberated, the item passed with a vote of 3 to 2 (Jung and Dunlap voted NO).
Yolanda wants to see Fullerton support immigration and believes it is essential for the city to do so.
The newly established Fullerton Community Foundation aims to do good work and could be a great avenue for this support.","During the City Council meeting, Deputy City Manager Daisy Perez presented on the recent federal immigration enforcement actions impacting residents in Fullerton. Council Member Zahra, supported by Mayor Pro Tem Charles, requested the addition of an agenda item to explore ways the city could assist individuals affected by recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activities. The council was also interested in reviewing actions taken by other jurisdictions, specifically Costa Mesa, to identify potential strategies applicable to Fullerton.

The meeting focused on evaluating how the city could support residents impacted by recent ICE activities and assessing the approaches taken by other cities. The presentation highlighted existing policies, regional contexts, and various options available for the City Council’s consideration.

Fullerton complies with the California Values Act, Senate Bill 54, which restricts local law enforcement’s involvement in federal immigration enforcement. The Fullerton Police Department does not engage in civil immigration enforcement and adheres to policies in accordance with state law. Additionally, the City offers public resources through its website, including Immigration Enforcement and Immigration Information pages, along with a Police Department resource page. These resources feature bilingual materials that connect residents with legal and community service providers.

In response to recent immigration enforcement activities in Southern California, various jurisdictions have been reviewing their policies to find ways to support residents while complying with state and federal laws. Common strategies among those cities included public education, community partnerships, and coordination with nonprofit organizations that provide legal and humanitarian assistance.

The City Council, during its meeting, voted 4-0-1 (with Dunlap absent) to direct staff to prepare and submit an amicus brief in coordination with other local jurisdictions regarding the case of Perdomo, et al. v. Noem, et al., pending in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. This case challenged the legality of “roving patrols” by federal immigration enforcement agencies, claiming that such practices could lead to detentions without reasonable suspicion. The City intended to participate in the amicus brief to support constitutional due process and fair enforcement practices consistent with established law.

On August 29, 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed a temporary restraining order, allowing the federal government to resume immigration enforcement operations at public locations such as bus stops, car washes, and home improvement stores while litigation continued.

Regionally, cities have focused on several key actions:

Public education and outreach,

Partnerships with nonprofits and legal aid organizations,

Funding programs for humanitarian or legal support, and

Policy resolutions reaffirming local values and compliance with state law.

Based on these regional examples, Fullerton considered several options for moving forward. One option was to continue existing outreach and education efforts through the City’s website and the Police Department. Another option involved partnering with nonprofits or legal aid organizations to provide localized support. Furthermore, the City could explore developing funding or policy initiatives based on successful models from neighboring jurisdictions.

City staff sought direction from the council on whether to maintain current practices or pursue new initiatives. Should the city council choose to continue with informational outreach, minimal costs could be absorbed within existing departmental budgets. However, any new programs, such as legal aid partnerships or additional funding assistance, could require the use of city discretionary funds, including local discretionary or general funds. This might involve reallocating funds from the general fund contingency or special event accounts, a step taken by other cities in similar situations. It is important to note that federal and other restricted funds, such as Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) and HOME funds, cannot be utilized for these purposes.

At the public comments for this item 30 people spoke in favor of helping immigrant families who have endured trauma from the ICE raides. One person spoke against helping the immigrant community. And there was one AI phone call that was also against helping.

After the city council members deliberated, the item passed with a vote of 3 to 2 (Jung and Dunlap voted NO). This item will be discussed at a future city council meeting.

Public Comments

Patty Tudor: I’m a planning commissioner, but I am speaking as a resident today. Like many of you, I am deeply concerned about the people affected by the recent actions taken by ICE. I want to help those who are struggling and provide mutual aid in any way I can. However, I have found it challenging to connect with a group that can guide me on the right support to offer. I imagine many of you in this room share that same difficulty.

I believe it would be beneficial for Fullerton to take the lead on organizing efforts like this, as it would make it easier for all of us to provide assistance to the residents in our city who need help. Therefore, I urge you to create a space for those of us who want to help so that we can effectively support our community. Thank you.

Laura Cook: I want to speak from the heart about my experience living in Fullerton. You will likely hear many stories about the trauma caused by ICE raids, and I’ve shared my thoughts on that in a previous meeting as well. However, my experience in Fullerton has been that it’s a town filled with neighbors who care for one another.

During the formula shortage in the pandemic, complete strangers from my Buy Nothing group were texting each other to help find formula for babies and dropping it off on porches. This summer, when the ICE raids created a similar atmosphere of fear and uncertainty for many families, people came together to support one another. Neighbors, friends, and even strangers bought groceries and delivered them to those in need, and they dropped off toys for kids who were stuck at home and bored during the summer.

My experience in Fullerton is that it’s fundamentally a community of neighbors who believe in helping each other. On a personal note, my brother served in the military for 13 years and died in a war zone. As a Gold Star sibling, I know that the America he fought for is one where we help our neighbors and offer asylum to those in need. I believe he would echo these sentiments tonight, and I know that many people in Fullerton would agree.

We want to take care of our neighbors, and it’s important to do that. Financially, I believe we can make strong moral and ethical choices with our budget. If you sat down with most Fullerton residents, I am confident they would say that helping each other is the right thing to do.

Malika Contado: I have lived in Fullerton for 35 years since immigrating with my family to the United States from the Philippines when I was three years old. I am here today because I love Fullerton and am proud to call it my home. However, for many of our immigrant neighbors, including myself, home may not feel safe or secure. Immigrants make up almost 30% of our city’s population—28.7% to be precise. I’m rounding that up to illustrate my point.

This evening, I am asking you to commit to building a Fullerton where everyone belongs. I appreciate the presentation given today and believe we can do more to ensure that immigrants feel safe, supported, and empowered to thrive in the community they already love.

Across Orange County, our neighbors are demonstrating what is possible. For instance, Santa Ana funds universal immigration legal defense so that no resident faces deportation alone. Anaheim has created “Welcoming Anaheim,” joining a national network that measures inclusion and allocates real funds to address immigrant needs. We should follow their lead. Costa Mesa has publicly confirmed that its police do not participate in immigration enforcement, which helps build trust between residents and officers. These are not partisan gestures; they are practical strategies for community safety that strengthen our neighborhoods and families.

My nieces are here; they are second-generation Pacific Drive Dolphins. I want them to feel safe and to experience childhood without fear of what might happen around their school. Fullerton can take similar steps by launching a “Belonging First Fullerton” initiative. As a resident, I can dream alongside you.

We could create a small immigrant legal defense fund, possibly sourced from the $6.3 million discretionary fund in our general budget. This fund could be modeled after Santa Ana’s established microgrants—around $200,000—to help families stay housed during immigration crises, thus lessening the trauma these events cause.

I also propose adopting a welcoming resolution affirming that everyone, regardless of origin or immigration status, should feel welcome in our city and that they belong here. When people feel safe in their neighborhoods, when they feel safe calling 911, sending their kids to school, or opening businesses, our entire city benefits.

Belonging is not just a feeling; it’s a practice that we can build together. I will hold our council members accountable to this vision.

Vanessa Estrella: I am a proud trustee for the Fullerton School District, a mother, a small business owner, and a resident of District 5 in Fullerton. In my role, I see how family well-being and student success are intertwined. When a parent faces detention, deportation, or eviction, that pain doesn’t stay at home; it follows children into the classroom.

Just this past August, a Fullerton family with three young children—two of whom attend our local schools—found themselves at risk of deportation after escaping violence in their home country. They are currently here under asylum, yet their future remains uncertain. Local partners have stepped up to raise legal funds and provide temporary housing to keep the family safe and together.

These stories make it clear that good intentions and volunteer efforts aren’t enough; families need structural support. That’s why I am here, asking this council to set aside funding to support immigrant families through legal aid, family assistance, and fair housing protections. Other cities, such as Santa Ana, Costa Mesa, and Anaheim, have already shown what is possible here in Fullerton. We can do the same by directing resources to trusted community partners who already serve our families.

If the city isn’t ready to build new programs from scratch, it can strengthen existing ones by funding local organizations that are already doing this important work, like Amino Immigration Services, which provides legal defense, deportation support, and family assistance. These institutions exist here in Fullerton, and they deserve our investment.

According to Data USA, nearly 30% of Fullerton residents were born outside of the United States, and almost half of our students come from immigrant households. Immigrant families power our schools, our businesses, and our community life, and their economic contributions are undeniable. The California Immigrant Data Portal reports that immigrant households across California contribute over $51 billion in state and local taxes, $81 billion in federal taxes, and hold more than $354 billion in spending power.

When we invest in the safety and stability of immigrant families, we invest in Fullerton’s economy and in our city’s future. So tonight, I urge you to take compassionate and practical action to ensure that every family, regardless of status, feels safe in our community. A strong city, like a strong school district, is built on belonging, and belonging means knowing your community is there for you.

Jennifer Garcia: I am a resident and pastor at Sojourners Church in Fullerton. I wanted to bring to your attention that either last weekend or this weekend would typically be the time for Saint Mary’s Carnival and Festival, which has been held at Ambridge Park every year for as long as I can remember. However, this year, they decided not to hold the event due to concerns from many of their neighbors about attending.

It’s disheartening to see something that has been a cherished gift to our community being lost because of fear. They made this difficult decision to forgo the festival to protect their most vulnerable community members—those living in heightened fear. This situation underscores the severity of the current crisis.

I serve on our county’s Continuum of Care board, and something interesting happened about a month ago. City managers from the North Service Planning Area (NOCSPA), which includes the 11 cities in North Orange County, attended our Continuum of Care board meeting to request funding. I found myself at the opposite end of the diocese, reviewing their funding requests.

Jason Phillips: I’m a resident and a pastor at Sojourners Church in Fullerton.

However, this year, they decided not to hold the event. This decision was made because many of their neighbors were afraid to attend.

It’s disheartening to see something that has been a gift to our entire community being lost due to fear. They made this difficult decision to forgo the festival for the sake of their most vulnerable community members—those living with the greatest fear. This situation emphasizes how deep the current crisis is.

Darlene Ruiz: I am an eighth grader at Ladera Vista Junior High School of the Arts. Immigration services have devastated many Hispanic families by causing fear, family separation, and barriers to jobs, housing, and healthcare. Children often experience trauma when their parents are detained, and many avoid seeking help due to their legal status.

Fortunately, there are many resources available, such as Races United, We Dream, Catholic Charities, and the National Immigration Law Center. In the Pledge of Allegiance, it says “justice for all,” but where is the justice in this country?

What has helped my family and me the most is solidarity. Solidarity has significantly impacted our community since 2012. We appreciate all the staff members who have been and continue to be a part of this effort. They have not only offered help but have also changed many lives.

So, we come here to ask for your support in creating an immigration aid fund.

Stacey: I also attend Ladera Vista Junior High School. The involvement of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has profoundly affected my family and me, shaping our lives with fear, uncertainty, and disruption. The constant threat of deportation has led to ongoing psychological trauma for us. This situation has limited our ability to fully participate in opportunities at work, school, and within our community.

These pressures have created financial and social instability, undermining our sense of security and belonging on a personal level. The emotional toll has been immeasurable, as the fear of family separation weighs heavily on our daily lives.

From a broader perspective, our experience reflects the systemic impact of immigration enforcement policies that disproportionately burden families. These policies leave lasting consequences on mental health, economic stability, and overall well-being.

Therefore, we ask for your assistance in creating an immigration aid fund here in the city of Fullerton.

Julia Aviles: I’ve lived in Fullerton since I was about four years old, and I’m now 17 and a senior at Fullerton Union High School. Although I haven’t been directly affected, the situation impacts my elders and my community, including my family. I can’t help but feel empathy for them as I watch them live in a constant state of paranoia and suffer financially.

Southern California has a significant immigrant population, which plays a crucial role in economic activity. Immigrant-run businesses create a home-like environment and foster a sense of security. Without these businesses, there are neither consumers nor producers, which disrupts the community. With many of these businesses closing down and ICE enforcement being an ongoing threat, many immigrants are forced to either stay home or risk deportation if they venture out.

I had to stay indoors for a couple of months without the ability to work and earn money, while some of my family members had to sell personal belongings to get by. I know they endured great hardship during this difficult time, both emotionally and financially.

Additionally, most of my family members are immigrants, and I can see how uncomfortable they feel going out, even to places like the corner store. This issue affects me personally as I witness their struggles and anxiety. It would mean a lot to me and my loved ones if you could support the creation of immigration aid funds.

Julia Crosby: I am a freshman at Fullerton Union High School, raised in Fullerton my whole life. My family, like many others, suffers from the impact of ICE enforcement in our community. Events are being canceled, and the fear of ICE is making it hard for people to enjoy time outdoors with their families.

For instance, my grandma can only go outside at night because she feels unsafe during the day. She no longer shops in person and must order everything online, which limits her freedom and joy.

We urge the mayor and the council to support initiatives that help immigrant families feel safe and included in our community. Fullerton is our home, and everyone deserves to live without fear. To thrive, we must ensure that our community is safe and welcoming for all.

Alejandro Delgado: I was born in Pomona but moved to Fullerton, where I have lived my whole life. I’m here because our community is only whole when every neighbor belongs, especially those who are most targeted and vulnerable. Right now, in Fullerton and across Orange County, many families are living in fear. Parents worry that a normal day could end in separation, and kids go to school wondering if their family will still be together when they get home. This fear spreads, affecting our schools, neighborhoods, and the trust that keeps our community strong.

For many of us, home means more than just a place to live; it means safety, dignity, and stability. However, for too many families here, that sense of home feels uncertain. Other cities in Orange County have already taken action. In Santa Ana, a program called Frontera, which means “Hope without Borders,” offers legal defense and direct help for families. Costa Mesa set up a $200,000 legal aid fund to help families stay in their homes, and Anaheim added $250,000 to its immigrant aid fund to assist families with rent and utilities when a loved one is detained. These cities are demonstrating what compassion looks like in action, reminding us that when we invest in people, we build strong communities.

Fullerton has the chance to do the same. Instead of viewing our city’s budget as limited, we can see it as a tool for abundance—a way to express what we value most. Our budget is more than just numbers; it’s a reflection of our priorities. Let’s choose to invest in safety, stability, and dignity for every family. Let’s choose hope over fear and abundance over scarcity. Let’s work to make Fullerton a city where every person truly feels at home. As someone who will be voting in the next election, I hope you will make the right decision for our community.

Kate: I work for Solidity NPO, a nonprofit organization that offers an after-school program. I also serve as the Youth Director at One Life City Church. Recently, we heard from some of the teams that participate in our program. It’s important to note that these young people represent the next voters, contributors, leaders, and activists in our city. They are actively contributing, advocating, and sharing their voices as they live, work, and play in our communities. We urge you to listen to their voices and the voices of others present today, particularly in support of the creation of the Immigration Aid Fund.

In recent months, our community has faced trauma as we witnessed our loved ones living in fear, being homebound, and targeted by those in charge who are supposed to serve the public good. Many of us have sought ways to help and have turned to one another for support through organizations and grassroots relationships that embody belonging, safety, and love.

Today, we believe that you, as the City of Fullerton and as the City Council, have an invaluable role in making our city safe, stable, and accountable to the residents who live here—just as we are accountable to you.

In recent conversations with the youth about what has happened in the past months, I’ve heard stories of heartbreak and limited ways of living. People who came here seeking better lives have faced violent incidents. One student shared that their friend’s church was raided by ICE, and their grandmother was taken. They expressed, “I liked that grandma too.” Another student mentioned that their family used to go out more, taking their kids places like the beach during the summer. However, due to these raids, they have had to remain indoors.

In a world filled with distrust and targeting, we must consider, what are we teaching our kids? Fullerton has an opportunity to address these gaps and show support in tangible ways. Hardworking families have found themselves unemployed and lacking resources, often leaving their young adults or teens to bear responsibilities that they should never have had to shoulder. This is the reality we are facing.

We ask that Fullerton follows the example set by Costa Mesa, Santa Ana, and other cities that have taken action. We strongly urge the council to establish a legal aid fund—a direct aid fund—to support our immigrant brothers, sisters, and neighbors, and to help make Fullerton feel like home.

Bianca: I live in District 3 of Fullerton, and I am a student at Cal State Fullerton as well as a volunteer with the Orange County Rapid Response Network. I am the child of two Asian immigrants. When my parents came to this country, all they wanted was a home, and they found one here in Orange County. A home is a place of belonging—it’s where you rest, where you have the support of loved ones around you. My parents found that home.

However, today, many others are losing theirs. Families are being torn apart, and children are being separated from their parents. When ICE detains a person, they are not just taking someone away; they are disrupting a home and tearing apart the fabric of a family.

I witnessed an incident that illustrates this reality. I saw ICE officers pull their vans into a lot in front of a building. One officer turned to their partner and asked, “Do you think we have enough booster seats?” Just then, a mother came out of the building, holding two young children in her arms, both of whom couldn’t have been older than two. They entered the van in silence, and the officers drove away. This is the harsh reality of what ICE does.

Home is not just a physical structure; it is made up of people and love. Fullerton can be a home, but the individuals who contribute to that sense of community are being ripped away, pushed into a system that has never cared for them.

Council members, you have the power to make a difference. We urge you to support organizations that are doing vital work and need funding. Other cities, like Santa Ana, Anaheim, and Costa Mesa, have already established legal aid funds, providing over $200,000 to support their residents. We can do the same.

In addition, families left behind when a breadwinner is taken by ICE need support. Losing a primary income can leave a family in financial distress. Establishing a direct aid fund could mean the difference between a child having dinner the night their parent is taken and going without. We ask you to consider creating this fund.

Brandy Morales: I’m a lead organizer with the Orange County Congregations Community Organization, also known as OCCCO. We focus on developing grassroots leaders to create systemic change, aiming to build communities where everyone can live with dignity and thrive. More importantly, I am a single Latina mother and a lifelong resident of Fullerton, currently in District 4. Fullerton has always been my home because of the diverse immigrant community in which I grew up.

I’m here today to ask that you allocate funding to support immigrant families who have been impacted by the recent ICE raids that occurred a few months ago. During one of the healing circles we held here in Fullerton, a young girl approached me after a session and asked, “What if one of my parents, or both, get detained? What happens then?” Her question broke my heart and made me realize how unprepared we are as a community.

Our community needs more than just lawsuits or statements of support; they need security, stability, and, most importantly, a sense of unconditional belonging. At that moment, all I could do was hand her a few phone numbers, but I wondered if that was enough. I didn’t think so.

I began to ask myself: What if I were detained? Or if one of my loved ones were detained? Could I afford it? Who would take care of my children? I reflected on this because ICE is targeting anyone who fits their stereotype of what an immigrant looks like, and my loved ones and I fit that description.

Imagine if I could tell that young girl, “Our city sees you. Our city has a plan.” Imagine if she knew that Fullerton was investing in families like ours. Our city budget is a moral document; it should reflect our values and support the people who make this city strong and diverse.

So today, I am asking you to invest in our immigrant community and allocate funds for families impacted by ICE enforcement. Thank you, and I pray that you choose to acknowledge the pain and fear that has affected our immigrant communities.

Kathy Plate: I’m a homeowner in Fullerton, and my wife and I are raising two kids who are attending Rolling Hills and the Fullerton School District. I want to emphasize that our community is only whole when everyone feels welcome, safe, and that they belong, especially at the beginning of the school year.

While many families were preparing for back-to-school season, I became aware that some families in our city were unable to drop their kids off at school due to fear of detention. I know our school district is doing everything it can to serve our students and families, but there are larger issues that our schools alone can’t address. I believe it’s time for this council to step up and do more.

The impact we’ve seen from fears of separation, the effects on employment, and the stories shared tonight are significant—much more than what one part of our community can handle. I hope we can partner with the nonprofits here tonight to come up with solutions. As a parent, I strive to ensure our home is a sanctuary and a place of trust and safety—not just for my kids, but also for their friends, our neighbors, and the larger community.

One way we do this is by teaching our kids to make good choices. They’re still learning, as am I, that it’s important to share—whether it’s toys or snacks—and to invite others to play and not exclude anyone. We remind them of their school motto to be kind, safe, and responsible beyond our home.

Fullerton is our larger home, and everyone in our city deserves to feel like they belong and that they are cared for with dignity and safety. No one should feel that they need to stay confined to their house. The city budget should reflect these values.

Our neighboring cities in Orange County, such as Santa Ana, Anaheim, and Costa Mesa, have already stepped up, and I urge the council to do the same. I propose that we establish a legal aid fund so that every resident has access to due process and legal representation. We should also create a direct aid fund for families who may be struggling with rent, food, and essential needs, as well as protect tenants from unjust evictions.

Home should be a place of belonging for all of our immigrant neighbors. I hope the council can make wise choices, be kind, safe, and responsible, and recognize the importance of funding initiatives that ensure our city is a place where everyone can thrive.

Elliot Chung: I serve as one of the pastors at One Life City Church, and I am proud to be a resident of District 5. As a pastor, husband, and father, I speak on behalf of my congregation and my family to emphasize that Filipinos are part of a community where everyone belongs. When one of us is in fear or in need, the whole community feels it.

We are here out of compassion—as citizens, friends, and neighbors of this beautiful city. We have witnessed the impact that ICE raids have had on our immigrant neighbors: families who are part of our schools, our churches, our small businesses, and our friendships. In my Korean culture, there is a term that embodies this kind of love and kinship, which holds a community together. It’s called “jeom” (점) I have reflected on this word recently, as it signifies the deep connection among people—love expressed through presence, shared meals, and simply being there for one another.

This is a love that doesn’t require words to be genuine. I also see “jeom” (점) in my Christian faith when I hear Jesus say, “Love your neighbor as yourself.” This kind of love is not merely sentimental; it is practical. It nourishes, shelters, and protects. It reminds us that every person, including you, me, and every immigrant family in this city, is made in the image of God. Just as Esau recognized Jacob in their reconciled relationship, we need to see each other, for in seeing one another, we see the face of God.

Many cities have already addressed this current brokenness by allocating funds in their budgets. They have responded with love and compassion. Even my small church has managed to set aside funds to assist our neighbors in Maple and Richmond. By God’s grace, we have been able to support 17 families, distributing over $9,000. I mention this not to boast, but to demonstrate that while our little fund is a start, it is just a drop in the bucket compared to the overwhelming need.

Though we may have limited resources, including a building that has cockroaches and no grass, we chose to create a mutual aid fund because the times demand it. I believe Fullerton can do the same. Therefore, I urge this council to establish some form of legal aid fund, a direct assistance fund, or a rental registry to protect our neighbors, congregants, friends, and family.

Fullerton is our home, and it is where love and “jeom” (점) can be made visible. It is where we can truly embody what it means to love our neighbor as ourselves. I encourage you to lead with that kind of care and love, building a city where no one has to live in fear.

Debbie Langenbacher: Deborah Longenbach: Before I begin, I want to congratulate all the young people who have had the courage to come forward and share their stories. It takes a lot of bravery, and although you may not see it, the smiles on their faces and the pride they feel when they return to their seats is truly heartwarming. Thank you all for that.

My name is Deborah Longenbach, and I have been a resident of Fullerton for 25 years. I am also a member of the Unitarian Universalist congregation, and I am here to represent my fellow congregants. We, Unitarian Universalists, adhere to a set of principles that include the inherent worth and dignity of every person, justice, equity, and compassion in human relations. We are committed to building a diverse and multicultural beloved community that actively addresses issues such as racism and oppression, both within ourselves and within our institutions.

We are currently living in a time when racism and oppression are rampant in our city. ICE raids in Fullerton have primarily impacted the Latino community, leaving families fearful of leaving their homes in case they encounter ICE agents. Children are afraid to attend school, worried that their parents may not be there when they return home. None of us desire this situation—nobody in this room wants it.

Fullerton is our home, and we must work as a city to ensure the safety and well-being of everyone, to the extent that we can. Our small congregation is doing what we can, but we are few in number. We urge the city of Fullerton to take action and do its part.

Recently, Costa Mesa, a city with a smaller population than Fullerton, established a legal aid fund of $200,000 to assist immigrant families in their community. As you may have heard, Anaheim and Santa Ana have similar initiatives. These actions reflect a commitment to justice, equity, and compassion in those communities while addressing concerns related to racism and oppression.

How can Fullerton do the same? How can we ensure that Fullerton truly becomes a home for marginalized communities? How can we set an example for other communities in Orange County as a city that supports all its residents—everyone who calls Fullerton home?

Vixon in Spanish: Buenas noches, miembros del Consejo. Esta noche les hablaré en español porque es crucial dirigirnos a nuestras familias y residentes inmigrantes, especialmente a aquellos que hablan español y se han visto afectados por las redadas de ICE.

Hablar en su idioma es una muestra de respeto y garantiza que nuestras voces se escuchen con claridad y propósito. Me llamo Vixen y estoy aquí como orgullosa miembro de la comunidad de Fullerton, apoyando a las familias afectadas por las redadas de ICE. Me acompaña mi colega, Steven Acevedo, quien también hablará sobre la realidad de nuestra situación.

El 3 de octubre, Steven fue atropellado dos veces por un vehículo de inmigración. En lugar de investigar este uso de la fuerza y proteger los derechos de un miembro de la comunidad, la policía de Anaheim optó por ignorar la situación. En lugar de defender a nuestros residentes, optaron por proteger a una agencia federal con un largo historial de causar daños a las comunidades inmigrantes. Este no es un incidente aislado; forma parte de un patrón preocupante. Nuestra comunidad ha sido vigilada, discriminada y perjudicada no solo por ICE, sino también por la complicidad y el silencio de los sistemas locales que deberían protegernos.

Quiero dejar claro que todos los residentes de nuestra comunidad tienen el derecho legal de observar y registrar las acciones de ICE para garantizar nuestra seguridad y rendición de cuentas durante estas redadas. Este tipo de observación debe ser pacífica y está protegida por la ley.

Les instamos a tomar dos medidas importantes. En primer lugar, solicitamos que el Departamento de Policía de Fullerton aclare clara y públicamente su protocolo con respecto a ICE y cómo se relaciona con el derecho de los residentes a observar y registrar legalmente las acciones. En segundo lugar, solicitamos al Ayuntamiento que cree y apruebe un fondo para apoyar a las familias afectadas por redadas y deportaciones. Cuando se lleva a uno de los padres sin previo aviso, toda la familia, incluidos los niños y los ancianos, sufre.

Por último, quiero recordarles a los miembros del consejo que tienen el poder de actuar en este asunto. Por favor, decidan ayudar a nuestros residentes y proteger a nuestras familias. Gracias.

Vixon in English: Good evening, Council members. I will be speaking in Spanish tonight because it is crucial to address our immigrant families and residents—especially those who speak Spanish and have been affected by ICE raids.

Speaking in your language is a sign of respect, and it ensures that our voices are heard with clarity and purpose. My name is Vixen, and I am here as a proud member of the Fullerton community, standing in support of families impacted by the ICE raids. I am joined by my colleague, Steven Acevedo, who will also speak about the truth of our situation.

On October 3, Steven was struck twice by an immigration enforcement vehicle. Instead of investigating this use of force and protecting the rights of a community member, the Anaheim police chose to look the other way. Rather than defending our residents, they opted to protect a federal agency with a long history of causing harm to immigrant communities. This is not an isolated incident; it is part of a troubling pattern. Our community has been surveilled, profiled, and harmed not only by ICE but also by the complicity and silence of local systems that should be protecting us.

I want to make it clear that every resident in our community has the legal right to observe and record ICE actions to ensure our safety and accountability during these raids. This kind of observation should be peaceful and is protected by law.

We urge you to take two important actions. Firstly, we request that the Fullerton Police Department clearly and publicly clarify its protocol regarding ICE and how it relates to residents’ rights to observe and record actions legally. Secondly, we ask the City Council to create and approve a fund to support families impacted by raids and deportations. When one parent is taken away without prior notice, the entire family—including children and elders—suffers.

Lastly, I want to remind our council members that you have the power to act on this issue. Please choose to help our residents and protect our families. Thank you.

Bethany Anderson: I want to share something important that I personally witnessed. Just two weeks ago, I overheard a conversation between ICE officers in the office, where one officer asked another, “What’s up, killer? You out there disappearing people for us?” This exchange clearly highlights the troubling atmosphere surrounding immigration enforcement.

My name is Bethany Anderson, and I am the Executive Director of Solidarity and Communal Immigration Services, a nonprofit organization that has been serving the Fullerton community for over 20 years. As an expert and practitioner of immigration law, I can tell you that what we are witnessing in our community and across the country reflects the worst aspects of humanity. We see businesses under siege, and innocent individuals tackled to the ground based on their skin color and the language they speak. This includes U.S. citizens, as I personally observed during a raid at a car wash in Anaheim just last Thursday.

Furthermore, our legal immigration system is being dismantled, leading to a growing number of undocumented immigrants daily. This crisis affects many hardworking individuals in our city who are striving to obtain legal status. The vast majority have no criminal records and live in mixed-status families, including immediate family members who are U.S. citizens. We are officially in a crisis situation.

As someone who runs an immigration legal service organization, one of the few dedicated to helping the Fullerton community, I can assure you that the need for financial support for our residents is overwhelming. This support is essential for accessing legal services, covering rent, and providing direct aid. Just yesterday, I spoke with a local woman whose husband was kidnapped off the street last Thursday. As a result, she is now worried about how she will pay rent this month. Her husband has lived here for over 20 years, has no criminal record, and is the father of three U.S. citizen children. She is concerned about how she will feed her children and continue to support her child with special needs.

As a community, we are doing everything we can. We have raised funds for rent and groceries for our neighbors, accompanied individuals to court and check-ins, and provided emotional support for one another. However, our efforts alone are not enough. We need a larger, collective initiative to make a meaningful impact.

As I mentioned earlier, we are witnessing the worst of humanity right now, but this also presents an opportunity for us to show the best of humanity. I invite each of you to join us in our collective effort to care for our city, our home, and our community in a significant way. By creating this fund, as I said during my last visit, we are at a crucial point in our legacy as individuals and as a city. Let us come together and be on the right side of history. Thank you.

Danny: I am part of the OCR network, and we help monitor ICE operations legally, as my partner has mentioned before. I have been at Fullerton College for about four years, pursuing different degrees. I’m here because our community is only whole when every neighbor belongs, especially those who are most targeted and vulnerable. No one should ever have to fear going to school, grocery shopping, or simply walking outside. People are being taken off the streets without any judicial or deportation orders. This affects every family, not just undocumented immigrants. The separations caused by these actions, along with their ripple effects on housing, schools, and the community, should be thoroughly studied.

I want to emphasize that home means more than just shelter; it represents safety, dignity, and stability. Other cities, like Santa Ana, Costa Mesa, and Anaheim, have already taken action. Santa Ana has the Help Without Borders program, which provides both legal defense and direct family assistance. Costa Mesa has established a $200,000 legal aid fund and is exploring a rental registry to keep families housed, which I encourage our council to consider. Anaheim recently added $250,000 to its Immigrant Aid Fund to help families pay rent and utilities when their loved ones are detained.

I urge the council to establish legal aid funds for all residents to ensure they have access to due process and legal representation. We need to create a direct aid fund to support families left behind with rent, food, and essential needs. Additionally, exploring a rental registry could help keep tenants stable and prevent unjust evictions.

Earlier, we recited the Pledge of Allegiance, which includes an amendment stating that no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on a presentment or indictment by a grand jury. No one should be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against themselves, nor should they be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. I want to emphasize the phrase “no person,” as it does not specify “citizen.”

Our budget should not be immoral and should not be merely sentimental; it must be strategic. It should prevent harm, support families, and build trust between residents and their government. We are human beings, and every individual deserves a place of belonging. Home is where we feel safe, where we flourish, and where we practice mutual care. Belonging means more than just accommodation. It consists of cherishing and valuing the contributions that every individual, family, and community brings to our city as a whole.

Steven Acevedo: Imagine being struck by a vehicle not once, but twice, by a federal agent, and having your cries for justice ignored by those sworn to protect you. This is not just an isolated incident; it is a glaring example of the systemic failures that continue to put our community at risk. I stand before you not only as someone who has been wronged, but also as a voice for all of us who have been failed by the very institutions meant to protect us. I am here to advocate for accountability, transparency, and justice.

My name is Steven Acevedo, and I was struck by a federal agent twice. On October 3rd, 2025, an ICE agent hit me with their vehicle. I never expected this to happen to me. I never imagined that someone in a position of authority would use their vehicle as a weapon. But that is exactly what transpired. And what did the police do? They turned a blind eye; they chose to protect the federal agent instead of seeking justice for me, the victim, a community member and an American citizen.

Instead of upholding the law and ensuring accountability, the police disregarded the very principles they are supposed to serve. The police should be here to protect citizens, to serve and defend us. Instead, they sided with ICE — an agency known for instilling fear and division rather than fostering safety and community trust. ICE agents are not here to protect our communities; they are here to terrorize. They enforce policies that not only instill fear but also tear families apart and create anxiety in our neighborhoods.

This is not the kind of protection we need in our city. What we need is accountability and transparency. The actions of the police and federal agents cannot go unchecked. We cannot permit a system in which the abuse of power is ignored, where the rights of American citizens are trampled, and where there is no accountability for actions that harm us all. It is up to us to demand better — to demand a police department that truly serves the community and a system in which federal agents are held accountable for their actions.

We will not stand idly by while our rights are ignored and violated, and while our safety is jeopardized. We must hold our leaders accountable, advocate for transparency, and ensure that justice is served. Together, we can make a difference. Together, we can ensure that those who are meant to protect us are held to the highest standards of accountability. This is our city, and we will stand for justice. Thank you.

Todd Harrison is speaking on behalf of his wife, Yolanda Harrison, who is suffering from laryngitis. She expressed her frustration by writing, “Laryngitis sucks.” Yolanda has been typing tirelessly for the last hour to share her thoughts.

As an immigrant, she wanted to attend the No Kings event, but chose to stay home because she has lost her voice. Her husband is concerned about her safety due to the potential implications for her immigration process. Yolanda expressed pride in everyone who stood up for the No Kings initiative, even though she understands the risks her words might pose.

She reflected on her grandfathers, who both lived through difficult times in 1949. They did not endure their suffering so that future generations would face similar challenges. Yolanda wants to see Fullerton support immigration and believes it is essential for the city to do so.

She would like to see a hard copy of all organizations that can assist immigrants, especially for those updating their status safely and in compliance with regulations. There have been incidents of immigrants being detained during their hearings, which terrifies her. Having printed resources is crucial because they can be distributed like the red cards given out during the first No Kings event. Relying solely on online information is inadequate when there is no Internet access.

Yolanda is not only fearful for her own safety, but also for her husband’s and anyone else who is an immigrant or appears to be one. She worries about what may happen once immigrants are no longer targeted—will they go after other marginalized groups next, like those identified by pink triangles or yellow stars?

She emphasizes the importance of remembering that today’s immigrants could be tomorrow’s voters. There is much more she wants to say.

Todd Harrison: Yes, I’m an American citizen. I was born in a hospital in Manhattan. Doctor Charles and I share something important: we each have two Jewish grandmothers. I had a wonderful mother, and before she passed away, she was a strong influence in my life. Additionally, I share something else with at least three-fifths of the City Council: either I, my parents, or my grandparents were immigrants at some point in our history. We can trace our roots back to various groups, whether it’s the Chinese immigrants who built the railroads through the Rockies or Ahmad and his relatives from Syria, and Doctor Charles with her long line of ancestors.

When I was 11 years old, after returning to New York from living in Europe, I was introduced to an elderly uncle of mine who had numbers tattooed on his forearm. Now, we see that Nazis are resurfacing, trying to divide our country by race and beliefs, and tearing our communities apart. I believe all residents and officials of Fullerton owe it to our shared heritage—not just for those around us today, but for our ancestors—to fight against this division. We must support each other in every possible way because it truly does not matter what makes someone stand out; anyone could become a target next.

Current events have shown us that there is no limit to the atrocities that prejudice can inflict. I even wrote to my wife so she could respond while we were sitting here together. I hate to say this, but I am concerned about your visibility in a public forum with your green card up for review. This is how they win—by silencing us.

I won’t go into the entire history, but we all know the saying: they came for others, and I did not speak up. Anyone who has been to school is probably familiar with that, and it remains true today. Therefore, regardless of the risks, we must all speak up and act in support of one another. Thank you.

Diane Kurtzman: I am a lifelong resident of North Orange County, having grown up over the hill in La Habra and spent the last 21 years in Fullerton. For the past 15 years, I’ve lived in our vibrant downtown, and I love the joyful noise that comes with it, as many of us do. A significant part of my appreciation for this lively public square stems from my German Jewish grandparents, who hid their identities in the United States for fear of being targeted, as their family members had been in Germany. My great-grandmother used to call me “Anka,” the same nickname as Anne Frank.

I was raised to be quiet, to know how to hide, and to be hyper-vigilant. Now, as a parent of a beautiful, fierce preteen son and twin daughters, I find myself not only worried about how to protect my children from the violent, indiscriminate kidnappings being carried out by secret police, which leave them weeping and terrified, but also actively engaging in community support. I take groceries to the families of my children’s classmates who can’t leave their homes, and I walk children to school because their parents can’t get them there safely.

As grassroots organizers and first responders, we cannot do this alone. We need your assistance to access funds that we would like to use to support our neighbors—your constituents. I urge you to allocate at least $200,000, like Costa Mesa did, to established organizations such as Camino and Gription Services to assist with legal aid and create a direct aid fund. We are all contributing our money to help, and we would appreciate having some of our tax dollars returned to support these efforts.

As others have mentioned, there are many places where this funding can be sourced. Additionally, as a side note, anyone who speaks a language other than English knows that Google Translate on the website is not a sufficient option; we can and should do better. Please do not be the ones who look the other way when the Gestapo came for their neighbors.

Next speaker. Good evening. All people in our Fullerton community are beloved and include our neighbors, families, friends, co-workers, colleagues, employers, and employees. The important word here is “all,” which encompasses everyone, including immigrants. Communities should help and take care of everyone, which is why I urge the council to approve measures that the City of Fullerton can take to support those impacted by recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement activities.

People are afraid to leave their homes, go to work, or participate in daily life. Children are scared to go to school, fearing that their parents will disappear. I recently attended an important forum sponsored by Mayor Pro Tem Charles—thank you for that—focused on the mental health impacts of ICE activities in our community. The trauma is ongoing and relentless, and it is extremely damaging.

I ask that you establish a fund in the budget to assist these affected individuals, providing support for food, rental assistance, and legal aid. Partner with nonprofits to help in as many ways as possible, and include in our legislative platform support for state legislation that forbids many of the currently used illegal tactics. Other cities and counties are implementing these measures. Fullerton can demonstrate that we care for and support everyone; everyone belongs with us and to each other. We are all striving for the same things for ourselves and our families.

The trauma being inflicted is severe, and we can help alleviate some of the tragic effects through our actions. We have the power to make a difference in the kind of community we foster, and I urge you to take action tonight. Please help.

That’s my prepared statement. Now, I’d like to add some personal thoughts. Listening to everyone tonight, this whole immigrant raid situation has broken my heart more than anything else happening in our country. It pains me to see these beautiful people, speaking their lovely languages and wearing their traditional costumes, made to feel like they have to hide. This is incredibly upsetting and detracts from our entire community. Anyone who has witnessed these raids knows they are wrong—absolutely wrong and ugly. There seems to be no clear path forward; the rules are changing all the time. I know of a family affected by these circumstances.

Harry Longenbach: I have lived in Fullerton for over 25 years and have worked with people across the city on various issues facing our community. I believe that the issue we are discussing now is the greatest moral crisis our city has faced during my time here. I hope you will address it and do everything you can to confront it.

I would also like to take a moment to thank the city manager’s department and the staff who prepared the report on this issue. I believe they went above and beyond the call of duty in their work. They were tasked with looking at what a few other cities have done, and they produced a comprehensive 99-page report of resolutions and examples from various cities, including Goleta. I think they are very capable staff members who have acted with compassion. If you give them direction to work on specific solutions for us, I believe they will bring you something valuable. Thank you.

Next Speaker: I can’t really add to anything that’s already been said. The perspectives that were shared today were heartbreaking and incredible. All that I ask is please protect our community.

Jodi Aegis Vallejo: I live in Fullerton, specifically District 2, and I am a professor at USC, specializing in immigration policy and immigrant integration. I’d like to share some recent statistics released by the USC Equity Research Institute regarding Orange County. This data highlights how deeply immigrant communities are integrated into the fabric of our area, as you heard from the young people who spoke tonight. Our immigrant community in Orange County, especially in Fullerton, is essential to our social and economic structure.

In Orange County, there are over 210,000 undocumented residents, which constitutes one-fifth of all immigrants living here. As noted, a significant majority of these undocumented individuals have been here for a long time—more than a decade—raising families, paying taxes, and building homes. Their roots are our roots.

Think about how connected you might be to immigrants—whether through family, coworkers, students, members of the police force, or city management. Every one of us is touched by this issue. Currently, 216,000 people in Orange County live with undocumented family members. Among our youngest children, research indicates that 16% have at least one undocumented parent. These are our students, our coworkers, and our future leaders—people growing up in fear.

When ICE conducts raids in our neighborhoods and workplaces, it harms not just immigrants but also undermines public safety. The situation is likely to worsen. It is our responsibility at the local level to take proactive measures. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has received $170 million to become a militarized police force. Their budget surpasses that of any other country’s military, except for the United States and China, and is larger than that of any branch of the U.S. military.

So, we must ask: to what end? It is crucial for us to act local. I do not want my tax dollars funding ICE; I would prefer them to be invested in initiatives that make our city a home. Therefore, I urge you to set aside funds for a legal defense fund. We have people in this city actively supporting our community, often without public recognition. This work is happening right under our noses, and they need our support.

These stories are ongoing, and they will not stop. It is up to us to take action.

Z: I truly believe in the importance of consistency, and I want to clarify that I’m not here to ask for anything from you. Just as I wouldn’t seek your help if I were involved in a bicycle accident, I’m here to make an offer. I work as an educational psychologist and am trained as a high school counselor. If Bethany Anderson is still present, I believe she is the executive director of something important.

I would like to offer my services as a volunteer to this community, and I hope more professionals will step forward to provide support for our neighbors, friends, and loved ones. So, that’s my offer. My name is Z, and if you would like my phone number, I’m seated in the back row. I’m happy to volunteer and contribute to protecting our citizens. Thank you for your time, City Council.

Kurt Johnston: I would like to draw attention to ICE on a national level. We all know that ICE stands for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but I believe it’s important to look at its impact across the country. I was watching a case on a program called Court TV about a man named Abera, who came over the border from Venezuela with three other people. Thanks to government assistance, he received a free flight to New York and a paid hotel stay. Unfortunately, he ended up killing a nursing student named Lakin.

As I explored other cases on Court TV, I discovered numerous instances where people have been killed due to immigration violations on a national scale. For me, it’s crucial to see the broader picture. I’m not entirely sure what ICE represents at the local level, but when I think about its national implications, I appreciate the acronym: National Immigration and Customs Enforcement (NICE). It signifies a commitment to keeping our country safe.

Curtis Gamble: I am an activist for homeless veterans, Cal State Fullerton students, OCTA bus drivers, seniors, and low-income communities. I want to express how challenging this situation is. I served my country as a veteran in the United States Navy and have traveled around the world twice, visiting many different countries.

While in those countries, I was always welcomed, and I made a promise to myself that if anyone ever came to America, they would be welcomed here as well. We Americans pride ourselves on our ability to travel anywhere we please, but if we don’t take care of those at home, we risk being treated the way we are treating others when we are abroad. That thought is frightening to me.

Many of us sailors formed bonds and got married during our four-year terms, which means that many people we speak about are like family to us. It pains me to see anyone treated as if they are unwelcome. This is part of the reason I served my country—to make everyone feel welcome, just as we were welcomed in other nations.

Over the past eight years, we have opened 14 to 15 emergency shelters. I believe that immigrants should be able to use these shelters as needed. After all, they are emergency shelters, and there should not be restrictions on what qualifies as an emergency.

Immigrants should have access to a CTA bus to reach one of these shelters if they feel unsafe. These shelters typically have security personnel, usually around six to eight security guards, to ensure safety, along with the support of others present.

We should utilize our resources wisely, and I recommend that we make these shelters available to anyone in need according to our municipal codes. Thank you very much.

Zoom Callers

Jose Trinidad Castaneda Casa Sanchez Mejia Nava Luhan Flores III: I will be brief and to the point. After researching possible policy opportunities to address the immigration challenges posed by ICE and the federal administration in 2023, and collaborating with the architects of these policies at the Legal Aid Defense Fund, I strongly advocated for my then-city water park to allocate a portion of its planned reserve funds to establish a new legal defense fund. Unfortunately, when I sought support from my colleagues, Council Member Conor Trout vehemently declined to back this initiative during the Biden administration, despite the favorable circumstances at that time.

Now, you have an opportunity here in Fullerton to turn this proposal into reality. It is essential to have some form of economic stabilization fund for our community because undocumented immigrants are part of our families, neighborhoods, and the larger community. They are employees, business owners, and integral to the fabric of our local economy.

Our economy is under threat, and it is being destabilized by a federal government that exhibits cruelty, particularly towards Latinos and immigrants in general. Many people in our community are affected by this, and if we do not act now, we will all face further economic destabilization.

I urge you to appropriate those planned reserve funds—which would not have been designated for other programs, projects, or departments—into a newly created legal aid defense fund. This action will distinguish you from my former colleagues in Buena Park, who failed to take action before the situation worsened. We are now in challenging times, and we must utilize reserve funds that are meant to support us during difficult periods.

This is not an exaggeration; it is a matter of literal survival for many in our community here in Fullerton. Establishing this fund is the most fiscally responsible decision we can make. Thank you.

Kayla: I admit that I haven’t read the entirety of the policy, but as someone who did review a lot of the policy for Santa Ana and looked into Costa Mesa’s as well, I am very pleased to see that Fullerton is trying to adopt similar measures. I’m particularly interested in the utility aspect—specifically, whether the city would need to cover those costs, or if they could simply forgive or suspend payments temporarily, since the city collects a lot of these bills, such as water.

I understand that city funds could definitely be used for essential needs like rent, food, especially now that some of these payments are being suspended, as well as for electricity and internet access. I just wanted to highlight that point and express my full support for the initiative being brought forward. I echo many of the comments that others have made so far regarding this issue.

Additionally, I think we should explore doing more, such as considering the creation of a Sanctuary Advisory Board where we consult with lawyers and nonprofits to discuss measures to protect our communities beyond this fund. I know that we passed a law at the state level regarding ICE agents, and I believe we can build on that.

Artificial Intelligence call was allowed to speak at City Council

The editor of the Fullerton Observer loudly objected from the audience to the AI bot being allowed to continue its rhetoric.

Mayor Fred Jung asked, “Mr. City Attorney, do we have this council any legal right to stop an AI voice? And somebody who publishes an local newspaper should realize and understand that.”

City Attorney Dick Jones responded, “As far as the speaker goes, we can’t verify whether it’s an AI voice or not. In the event the law does provide for remote speakers to come on and speak during the three minute comments.”

Council Comments

Council Member Dr. Ahmad Zahra:

I want to start by sharing something personal. I am an immigrant; I came here in my 20s, and I vividly remember the events of 9/11. For the younger generation, it may now be a historical event, but I lived through it as a young immigrant with just a green card. I remember the fear that our Muslim community experienced, but I also recall how our community came together during that difficult time—Jewish, Christian, Sikh, and others united to support one another.

Today, we are facing similar challenges and fears. I believe we should come together as a community, not judging each other’s backgrounds or status, but as neighbors and taxpayers who contribute to this country. Many of us have families that include American citizens and immigrants. I know from the community members who have spoken that everyone is affected; I am impacted, and my neighbors are impacted too. I proudly represent a district with many immigrants, and I know our mayor represents a similarly diverse community that includes first, second, and third-generation immigrants.

There are moral and practical reasons for our budget to reflect our values. When there is disruption in our community—whether from fear, economic instability, or other factors—we see it affect our businesses, our children’s education, and our local economy. We are losing out on revenue because individuals, who are also taxpayers—whether through property taxes or sales taxes—are unable to participate fully in the economy.

It is only logical that when there is a disruption in our community, we allocate funds to help those in need. From a practical standpoint, I propose that we create a resolution to reaffirm our values and establish a fund for both legal defense and humanitarian assistance, including rent support. We can model this after other cities by creating a flexible fund that collaborates with local nonprofits to assess needs and determine how much money we can allocate toward it.

Additionally, I suggest we open this fund to community donations. For instance, we could add a line on water bills that allows residents to contribute to this fund, providing an additional source of support. We could also seek partnerships with companies, corporations, and foundations that might be willing to help fund these initiatives, ensuring that the burden does not fall entirely on the city budget.

To summarize, this is not only a values statement but also a practical proposal. I would like to make a motion to move forward with the creation of this fund so that our staff can bring these items to the council for approval.

Now, regarding the legal defense fund, do you have an allocated amount in mind? I believe it is crucial for staff to have a clear figure because these expenses can add up. I suggest we start with no less than $100,000 for legal defense, and for the assistance fund, we should also allocate no less than $100,000. In total, that would be $200,000.

Lastly, I would like us to get practical legal advice. Mr. City Attorney, can a public entity establish a fund for donations? I thought we needed to maintain a separation of church and state. Please investigate if we can identify a public purpose to justify this initiative. We need to ensure that we involve the appropriate parties in this effort. We’ve successfully opened a donation fund before, such as for the murals, which received significant community support.

Mayor Pro Tem Dr. Shana Charles:

I just seconded Zahra’s motion, so you know where I stand on this issue—I believe it is something worth examining. I want to clarify that what we are doing tonight is discussing possibilities for action at the next meeting. We are not voting on this tonight, but I do hope that it will ultimately pass, given what we have heard today.

I want to emphasize something that struck me during the public comments. As someone who teaches the Constitution, I truly appreciate the importance of constitutional amendments. Specifically, the First Ten Amendments, known as the Bill of Rights, are fundamental rights that the states insisted on when this country was founded. Among these is the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits illegal search and seizure by the government. It explicitly states that no person should be subjected to such actions.

There are other parts of the Constitution where citizenship is clearly mentioned, indicating that the Founding Fathers were mindful of this matter. In fact, the presidency is the only office that explicitly requires a person to be a natural-born citizen, while Congressional members can be naturalized citizens. This inclusivity extends to other levels of government as well.

I feel fortunate to sit here between two gentlemen who are immigrants to this country. I have immense respect for anyone who has the courage to pick up and start anew in a different land. Many people immigrate out of choice, but lately, it seems that choice is increasingly becoming a privilege.

Most recent immigrants are fleeing from difficult circumstances, places that lack the protections guaranteed by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. Their governments often persecute individuals without any recourse.

In supporting the amicus brief for Perdomo v. ICE, we are addressing the issue of due process violations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. They often act without search warrants, disregarding the rights of all individuals, regardless of whether they are U.S. citizens or undocumented. There have been over 50 reported cases in Fullerton alone, and this is likely just the tip of the iceberg.

The implications extend beyond those who are undocumented. I am very concerned about the lack of legal representation, which is essential for ensuring due process. It’s heartbreaking to think of children—some as young as three years old—being forced to appear in court alone, without a lawyer or adult to advocate for them. Such circumstances are unconscionable and should never happen to any resident.

I agree with the Founding Fathers: no person should be denied these protections. Everyone deserves due process, and providing legal assistance is a crucial part of that. I believe that the City of Fullerton can take action in this regard, and I hope our staff can devise a way to create a $100,000 legal defense fund.

Additionally, we need a basic needs fund, and I’ve heard from many community members who want to donate but don’t know how to contribute. This could serve as a fantastic opportunity for community collaboration. The newly established Fullerton Community Foundation aims to do good work and could be a great avenue for this support. I hope we can all come together to agree on these proposals.

Council Member Jamie Valencia:

“We are voting on the motion proposed by Council Member Zahra, which is not one of the current options.” She has asked the City Clerk to review the motion again.

City Clerk Lucinda Williams:

The motion is to return at the next meeting with a resolution outlining values for consideration. It also includes the establishment of two funds: one for legal assistance and another for basic needs, with each fund set at a minimum of $100,000. Additionally, the motion includes the acceptance of donations.

Valencia:

Is there a way to amend this? I would like to work with all the nonprofits in our community, as that was one of the options presented by staff.

Council Members Charles and Zahra:

They affirmed that work with all the nonprofits was part of the original motion.

Mayor Fred Jung:

Throughout my life, I’ve often been reminded that I am an immigrant, with people telling me even now to “go home.” I understand when desperate communities cry out for help—this is why the Council has decided to defend them from a legal standpoint. However, we are facing a $10 million paper deficit, which is not a practical reality. That is simply the truth. There’s nothing practical about it. I’ve spoken with many of you in private about this matter, and I understand your concerns. I hope you can understand mine as well.

Voting Results:

Council Member Dunlap: No

Council Member Valencia: Yes

Council Member Zahra: Aye

Mayor Pro Tem Charles: Aye

Mayor Jung: No

The agreement marks the first successful deal between Washington and an African government regarding Abrego’s removal, after Uganda, Eswatini, and Ghana declined U.S. requests to host him.

Abrego’s deportation dispute and Africa’s role

Abrego’s case became symbolic of the complexities surrounding Washington’s “third-country” deportation strategy, which seeks to resettle deported migrants in nations with no direct connection to their origin or criminal history.

The policy, critics argue, exposes deportees to human rights risks and undermines international asylum norms.

Liberia, in a statement through its Ministry of Information, said its decision to receive Abrego was made “on a strictly humanitarian and temporary basis” following a formal U.S. request as per Reuters.

The government added that it would ensure the migrant is not transferred “to any country where he may face substantial risk of persecution, torture or other serious harm.”

Maryland-based U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis temporarily halted the deportation, pending a ruling on Abrego’s legal challenge for release from immigration detention. It remains unclear whether the new agreement will alter the court’s position.

Trump’s third-country deportation drive

The Trump administration has increasingly relied on bilateral arrangements with African and Central American nations to offload deportees when their home countries refuse reentry. However, several African governments including Nigeria, Burkina Faso, and Libya have previously resisted or outright rejected third-country deportation proposals, citing sovereignty concerns, security risks, and public opposition.

Analysts say the Liberia deal may signal Washington’s determination to continue pursuing its global deportation network, even amid diplomatic resistance.

Congress took neither of those actions this time, though lawmakers have unsuccessfully tried to get legislation addressing federal workers’ pay through Congress, as recently as this week.
Last week, Trump acted unilaterally, repurposing a reported $8bn in defense department funds meant for research and development to pay the military in the middle of October.

Mirasola connected the pay decision to Trump’s deployment of national guard troops into cities across the country, including Washington DC, Chicago and Portland.","By ordering that US military personnel receive paychecks even though the government is shut down, Donald Trump is seeing to the needs of a politically untouchable constituency that has been caught up in the congressional logjam over federal spending.

But experts who spoke to the Guardian warn that he is doing so in a way that is almost certainly illegal and, if left unchecked, bodes ill for Congress’s constitutional authority to control government spending. Some fear it could set the stage for the president to unilaterally fund other contentious decisions in the future, such as the deployment of the military on US soil.

“I’m with the people who believe that there’s really no good legal justification for moving the money around in this way,” said Phil Wallach, a senior fellow at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute who focuses on the separation of powers in the US government.

“There’s no congressional authorization for troop payment for this new fiscal year. So it’s going pretty far out on a legal limb, and just sort of daring anybody to do anything about it. Because, of course, substantially, nobody thinks it’s very bad to pay the troops.”

The federal government shut down at the start of October after Democrats and Republicans in Congress failed to agree on legislation to extend funding beyond the end of September. About 700,000 federal workers have been furloughed, while hundreds of thousands of others continue to report to work, but are not getting paychecks.

Troops were paid during previous government shutdowns because Congress had either approved defense department spending, or passed bills specifically to guarantee their salaries, said Bobby Kogan, a former White House office of management and budget official who is now with the Center for American Progress, a liberal thinktank.

Congress took neither of those actions this time, though lawmakers have unsuccessfully tried to get legislation addressing federal workers’ pay through Congress, as recently as this week.

Last week, Trump acted unilaterally, repurposing a reported $8bn in defense department funds meant for research and development to pay the military in the middle of October. Kogan called the decision “super duper duper illegal” under federal law.

“If you try to spend money you have on the wrong purpose, you’re in trouble. And if you try to spend money into a purpose that you don’t have money for that purpose, then you’re in trouble as well,” he said.

On Thursday, Trump said an unnamed “friend” had contributed $130m to pay service members during the shutdown, later revealed by the New York Times to be reclusive billionaire and Trump supporter Timothy Mellon. Sean Parnell, the chief spokesperson for the Pentagon, confirmed acceptance of the funds “under its general gift acceptance authority. The donation was made on the condition that it be used to offset the cost of Service members’ salaries and benefits.”

Christopher Mirasola, a law professor at the University of Houston, said that the civil servants who carried out Trump’s order to repurpose funds could theoretically be prosecuted for violating a law called the Antideficiency Act. But such prosecutions have never happened in the past, and he said in an interview he finds it difficult to believe Trump’s justice department, or even another president, would carry them out.

“I’m just not sure if a future administration would have the appetite to bring career government officials who at that point would have suffered years of abuse at the hands of the administration for complying with something even if they knew that it was illegal,” Mirasola said.

Trump foes who tried to sue over it – think Democratic lawmakers or civil society groups – may have trouble proving that they were harmed by paying the troops, a necessary component for bringing a case, Kogan said.

“You’re in tough places here to find standing under this supreme court, at least under the Trump administration,” he said.

The experts viewed Trump’s move to pay troops as his latest attempt to shift the power of the purse away from Congress and into the executive branch, but differed over how significant it was in the long term. Since taking office, he has used a variety of methods to halt government spending on areas his administration opposes, including a controversial pocket rescission of foreign aid funds.

“I think the crisis will start to feel more acute if we start seeing the president moving money around to do things that are very politically controversial,” said Wallach, noting that paying US armed forces is “something that basically everybody agrees on”.

The ball is now in the Republican-controlled Congress’s court to make clear that it is they who make the decisions about spending, Wallach said.

“I certainly don’t think among GOP appropriators, they’re like wanting to see the White House just take things over. I’m really quite certain that they’re distressed by this dynamic and want to get away from it as fast as they can,” he said.

Kogan warned that Trump was launching an offensive against Congress’s appropriations process, by which lawmakers, usually working in a bipartisan fashion, outline how much the government will spend, and on what.

“If the president can just completely ignore anything and everything, can spend money into existence, he can drain accounts and use them on whatever he wants, right?” Kogan said. “Like, what are we even doing there? That makes you an appropriations king.”

Such decisions may paradoxically make finding an agreement to reopen the government harder, by sapping the trust in Congress that any legislative deal Democrats sign on to will be honored by Trump.

“The whole point of the budget deal is to figure out how you’re going to allocate your limited resources. We are going to figure out what we want to prioritize in the government, and if the president has complete and unilateral authority to ignore every part of that deal, how can you ever do appropriations? How can you ever make a funding deal?” Kogan.

Mirasola connected the pay decision to Trump’s deployment of national guard troops into cities across the country, including Washington DC, Chicago and Portland. He views many of the federal laws that govern how the military may be used on US soil as outdated, and the main obstacle Trump faces is his ability to get Congress to pay for the soldiers.

“If my theory that appropriations are the most important limit on these domestic military deployments, if that’s true, then moves like this to edge Congress out of the appropriations process [are] really a strike at one of the most significant amendments on the president’s authority to use the military in the United States,” he said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c884ab773bdc8f41040f7ff0a604bf2d6e95f4f3/250_0_2501_2000/master/2501.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=82cd07b6fd2514c641d7b3a9e8dddbf8",N,,2025-10-26 10:57:29.617247

Kevin Kiley spent an hour of his morning in Washington guiding a group of middle school students from Grass Valley through the empty corridors of the U.S. Capitol.
We are absolutely unified on that.” The shutdown is being felt across California, which has the most federal workers outside the District of Columbia.
Many California lawmakers — including Kiley, one of the few GOP lawmakers to openly criticize him — have been dismayed by the deadlock.
The Republicans’ plan would have paid active-duty members of the military and some federal workers during the shutdown.
“I will not support a shutdown deal that strips healthcare from tens of thousands of my constituents,” she said.","Twenty-two days into the government shutdown, California Rep. Kevin Kiley spent an hour of his morning in Washington guiding a group of middle school students from Grass Valley through the empty corridors of the U.S. Capitol.

Normally, one of his staff members would have led the tour. But the Capitol is closed to all tours during the shutdown, unless the elected member is present. So the schoolchildren from Lyman Gilmore Middle School ended up with Kiley, a Republican from Rocklin, as their personal tour guide.

“I would have visited with these kids anyway,” Kiley said in his office after the event. “But I actually got to go on the whole tour of the Capitol with them as well.”

Kiley’s impromptu tour is an example of how members of California’s congressional delegation are improvising their routines as the shutdown drags on and most of Washington remains at a standstill.

Some are in Washington in case negotiations resume, others are back at home in their districts meeting with federal workers who are furloughed or working without pay, giving interviews or visiting community health centers that rely on tax credits central to the budget negotiations. One member attended the groundbreaking of a flood control project in their district. Others are traveling back and forth.

“I’ve had to fly back to Washington for caucus meetings, while the opposition, the Republicans, don’t even convene and meet,” Rep. Maxine Waters, a longtime Los Angeles Democrat, said in an interview. “We will meet anytime, anyplace, anywhere, with [House Speaker Mike] Johnson, with the president, with the Senate, to do everything that we can to open up the government. We are absolutely unified on that.”

The shutdown is being felt across California, which has the most federal workers outside the District of Columbia. Food assistance benefits for millions of low-income Californians could soon be delayed. And millions of Californians could see their healthcare premiums rise sharply if Affordable Care Act subsidies are allowed to expire.

For the California delegation, the fallout at home has become impossible to ignore. Yet the shutdown is in its fourth week with no end in sight.

In the House, Johnson has refused to call members back into session and prevented them from doing legislative work. Many California lawmakers — including Kiley, one of the few GOP lawmakers to openly criticize him — have been dismayed by the deadlock.

“I have certainly emphasized the point that the House needs to be in session, and that canceling a month’s worth of session is not a good thing for the House or the country,” Kiley said, noting that he had privately met with Johnson.

Kiley, who represented parts of the Sacramento suburbs and Lake Tahoe, is facing political uncertainty as California voters weigh whether to approve Proposition 50 on Nov. 4. The measure would redraw the state’s congressional districts to better favor Democrats, leaving Kiley at risk, even though the Republican says he believes he could still win if his right-leaning district is redrawn.

The Senate has been more active, holding a series of votes on the floor and congressional hearings with Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. The chamber, however, has been unable to reach a deal to reopen the government. On Thursday, the 23rd day of the shutdown, the Senate failed to advance competing measures that would have paid federal employees who have been working without compensation.

The Republicans’ plan would have paid active-duty members of the military and some federal workers during the shutdown. Democrats backed a bill that would have paid all federal workers and barred the Trump administration from laying off any more federal employees.

“California has one of the largest federal workforces in the country, and no federal worker or service member should miss their paychecks because Donald Trump and Republicans refused to come to the table to protect Americans’ health care,” Sen. Alex Padilla said in a statement.

Working conditions get harder

The strain on federal employees — including those who work for California’s 54 delegation members — are starting to become more apparent.

Dozens of them have been working full time without pay. Their jobs include answering phone calls and requests from constituents, setting the schedules for elected officials, writing policy memos and handling messaging for their offices.

At the end of October, House staffers — who are paid on a monthly basis — are expected to miss their first paycheck.

Some have been quietly told to consider borrowing money from the U.S. Senate Federal Credit Union, which is offering a “government shutdown relief loan program” that includes a no-interest loan of up to $5,000 to be repaid in full after 90 days.

The mundane has also been disrupted. Some of the cafeterias and coffee carts that are usually open to staffers are closed. The lines to enter office buildings are long because fewer entrances are open.

The hallways leading to the offices of California’s elected officials are quiet, except for the faint sound of occasional elevator dings. Many of their doors are adorned with signs that show who they blame for the government shutdown.

“Trump and Republicans shut down the government,” reads a sign posted on the door that leads into Rep. Norma Torres’ (D-Pomona) office. “Our office is OPEN — WORKING for the American people.”

Rep. Ted Lieu, a Democrat from Torrance, posted a similar sign outside his office.

Rep. Vince Fong, a Republican who represents the Central Valley, has been traveling between Washington and his district. Two weeks into the shutdown, he met with veterans from the Central Valley Honor Flight and Kern County Honor Flight to make sure that their planned tour of the Capitol was not disrupted by the shutdown. Like Kiley’s tour with the schoolchildren, an elected member needed to be present for the tour to go on.

“His presence ensured the tour could continue as planned,” Fong’s office said.

During the tour, veterans were able to see Johnson as well, his office said.

Shutdown highlights deep divisions

California’s congressional delegation mirrors the broader stalemate in Washington, where entrenched positions have kept both parties at a negotiation impasse.

Democrats are steadfast in their position that they will not agree to a deal unless Republicans extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits expiring at the end of the year, while Republicans are accusing Democrats of failing to reopen the government for political gain.

Kiley is one of the few Republicans who has called on Johnson to negotiate with Democrats on healthcare. Kiley said he thinks there is a “a lot of room to negotiate” because there is concern on both sides of the aisle if the tax credits expire.

“If people see a massive increase in their premiums ... that’s not a good thing,” he said. “Especially in California, where the cost of living is already so high, and you’re suddenly having to pay a lot more for healthcare.”

Rep. Robert Garcia, the chair of the House Democratic Caucus, in a press event Wednesday with five other California Democrats talked about the need to fight for the healthcare credits.

Garcia, of Long Beach, said he recently visited a healthcare center in San Bernardino County that serves seniors with disabilities. He said the cuts would be “devastating” and would prompt the center to close.

“That’s why we are doing everything in our power to negotiate a deal that reopens the federal government and saves healthcare,” he said.

As the shutdown continues, many Democrats are digging their heels on the issue.

At an Oct. 3 event outside of Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, for instance, Rep. Laura Friedman held a news conference with nurses and hospital staff and said she would not vote for a bill to reopen the government unless there is a deal on healthcare.

Last week, the Glendale Democrat said her position hasn’t changed.

Matt Wyatt, 51, who also voted for Mr. Trump, agreed.
Mr. Leeds said he has traveled to the country 25 times and used dollars paid by Iowa farmers to foster strong bonds with Chinese importers.
Iowa’s large beef industry then recoiled after Mr. Trump suggested he would try to lower the cost of beef by importing more from Argentina.
Peter Orazem, an economics professor at Iowa State University, linked that to layoffs of migrant workers.","When President Trump announced a $20 billion bailout for Argentina this month, Larry Ory, 86, a farmer in Earlham, Iowa, could hardly believe it, especially after boatloads of Argentine soybeans began shipping to China, a once-critical customer for Mr. Ory's family.

For Iowans, losing China’s soybean market in the president’s trade war was only one of many economic shocks that have hit the state since the start of Mr. Trump’s second term. The cost of tractors and fertilizers have shot up with his tariffs. Labor has grown scarcer in agribusinesses. Major manufacturers have laid off workers. Even the ubiquitous wind turbines that provide income for some Iowa farmers are in the president’s sights.

“Right now, we’re fighting different economic wars all at once,” said Summer Ory, 37, the wife of Mr. Ory’s grandson, Dan. The couple works in the family’s farm business. “You can sustain it one at a time, but right now it’s death by a thousand paper cuts.”

Since siding with Barack Obama twice, Iowa has become a stronghold for Mr. Trump. Yet perhaps no state has struggled more with his economic policies. During the first quarter of 2025, Iowa’s gross domestic product dropped by 6.1 percent, more than any other state aside from neighboring Nebraska.

Manufacturing, which drives 17 percent of Iowa’s economic output, has been hit with higher production costs in part because of steep tariffs on inputs like aluminum and steel. Meatpacking plants, which help make Iowa the nation’s leading pork producer, rely heavily on foreign-born workers, hundreds of thousands of whom saw their legal status stripped away by the president. Mr. Trump’s war on renewable energy also threatens the wind industry that produces more than half of Iowa’s electricity.

Some of the state’s troubles, like bad weather, high interest rates, an aging and shrinking rural population, and global commodity prices, are beyond the president’s control. But new economic policies have magnified the state’s woes, according to economists, agricultural groups and some business leaders.

“This is as challenging as I’ve seen it,” Kirk Leeds, the chief executive of the Iowa Soybean Association, said. “We’ve got uncertainties beyond compare.”

Next year’s midterm elections could indicate how Iowans feel about those policies. At least two competitive House districts will be up for a vote. The state will also choose a replacement for its retiring governor, Kim Reynolds, and a retiring senator, Joni Ernst. All those posts are held by Republicans.

“People are hurting everywhere in Iowa, and they’re looking for something different,” said Josh Turek, a Democratic state house member running for Ms. Ernst’s seat.

Mr. Trump has argued the tariffs will help protect American jobs and rectify trade imbalances, while enforcing immigration laws will free up work for citizens.

“There is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force,” Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said, adding that the president was “capitalizing on that untapped potential while delivering on our mandate to enforce our immigration laws.”

And many Iowans remain loyal. Doug Keller, 63, who farms about 15 miles southwest of Waterloo, said he was hopeful the president will reach a new trade deal with China that will benefit farmers in the long run. Matt Wyatt, 51, who also voted for Mr. Trump, agreed.

“Money is tighter than it should be,” said Mr. Wyatt, who works with Mr. Keller to grow corn and soybeans on close to 1,500 acres of land. “But we try to stay optimistic around here.”

For now, times are tough. Iowa is the country’s second-largest producer of both corn and soybeans. America exports as much as half its soybeans, and the vast majority of that had gone to China — $12.6 billion worth last year.

But this year, China stopped purchasing soybeans from the United States to retaliate against Mr. Trump’s tariffs. American producers have spent decades working with people in China on how to use soy in animal feed, part of an effort to build up that growing market. Mr. Leeds said he has traveled to the country 25 times and used dollars paid by Iowa farmers to foster strong bonds with Chinese importers.

“I’m not exactly sure how we repair some of these relationships,” Mr. Leeds said.

The president’s bailout of his ally, President Javier Milei of Argentina, has rankled many Iowans, since China moved immediately after it was announced to lock up Argentine soybean exports to fill the gap from Beijing’s boycott of American soy.

“Who are you subsidizing, our competitors or us?” Larry Ory asked.

Iowa’s large beef industry then recoiled after Mr. Trump suggested he would try to lower the cost of beef by importing more from Argentina. Bryan Whaley, the chief executive of the Iowa Cattlemen’s Association, said Mr. Trump’s comments roiled cattle markets, and a volatile market “provides less of an opportunity for our producers — cattlemen and women here in Iowa — to make decisions that are going to help keep them profitable and viable.”

The president said he will take some money raised by his tariffs and “give it to farmers” as a bailout, but that is not necessarily welcome news.

“We would much rather farm with no federal assistance whatsoever,” Mr. Wyatt said. “We want to be able to sell our products for a good value, and normally we can.”

John Gilbert, a farmer in Iowa Falls, said he expected the government payments to favor larger agribusinesses and to drive more consolidation in an industry that has been dominated by big corporations.

“The payments are skewed to the bigger guys,” said Mr. Gilbert, a Democrat whose family has about 800 acres of land for grains and livestock.

As he deals with those higher prices, Aaron Lehman, a fifth-generation farmer in rural Polk County, said he will continue to use his more than 25-year-old, worn combine. A machine with greater power and a more sophisticated GPS system would cost upward of $100,000 used and more than $250,000 new, he said.

Mr. Lehman wondered whether his 26-year-old son could realistically earn a living working full time on the family farm.

“Our farms, and lots of farms, are having to assess if there’s real opportunity for years down the road,” said Mr. Lehman, who serves as president of the Iowa Farmers Union.

The economic pain has spread beyond agriculture to truckers who transport seeds and grains, agronomists who help farmers innovate, and the Main Street restaurants where farmers eat and drink.

“Everywhere you turn, people are asking, ‘How are you going to make it?’” Ms. Ory said.

Dan Ory, 37, her husband, called it “just the perfect storm.”

John Deere, a leading manufacturing employer that makes agricultural equipment, has laid off hundreds of workers from its Iowa factories this year as sales decline and tariffs on steel and aluminum cost the company more than $300 million.

Employment in Iowa’s food manufacturing is down too. Peter Orazem, an economics professor at Iowa State University, linked that to layoffs of migrant workers. JBS Foods, a Brazilian meatpacker, laid off approximately 200 workers from Haiti, Cuba, El Salvador and Honduras at a plant in Ottumwa in June, said Paulina Ocegueda, vice president for the local chapter of LULAC, a Hispanic civil rights organization.

“It’s not costless to replace that number of workers,” Dr. Orazem said. He added that it was “difficult to find domestic workers who take these jobs.”

In Waterloo, some Haitian workers lost jobs at a Tyson pork processing plant, said Yves Fleurima, a community outreach coordinator for World Grace Project, which helps refugees and other new migrants in Waterloo find employment. Workers had received letters from the Department of Homeland Security telling them their legal immigration status would be terminated and they should leave the country, he said.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for Homeland Security, said humanitarian parole programs “undercut American workers” and allowed “poorly vetted” people into the country.

JBS employs more than 5,000 people at four production facilities in Iowa, according to Nikki Richardson, a spokeswoman for the company. Two more plants are under construction and expected to create close to 1,000 additional jobs in Iowa, she added.

“We are focused on hiring team members who are legally authorized to work in the United States and will continue to follow the guidance provided to us by the U.S. government,” she said in an email.

Tyson did not respond to requests for comment.

Iowa’s renewable energy sector is also facing uncertainty, driven by what appears to be the president’s personal animus toward wind power. The Trump administration and Congress have cut funding for major renewable projects, phased out renewable energy tax credits and issued new rules to make it harder for some projects to qualify for those credits.

The impacts might be modest in Iowa, according to Steve Guyer, a senior lawyer at Iowa Environmental Council, because the state has already heavily invested in wind energy. Still, he said the new rules must be navigated, while tariffs raise the cost of new turbines.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/25/arts/nat-iowa-stilo-cine-still/nat-iowa-stilo-cine-still-facebookJumbo.png,N,,2025-10-26 10:57:36.631730

América Diversa, a group that advocates on behalf of LGBTQ immigrants, told the Washington Blade that Andrei Ushakov and Aleksandr Skitsan fled Russia on March 14, 2024, “after the government began labelling LGBTQIA+ organizations as ‘extremist.’” Skitsan “faced direct threats at his workplace, forcing them to flee for their safety.”

The State Department’s 2023 human rights report specifically notes a Russian authorities “used laws prohibiting the promotion of ‘non-traditional sexual relations’ to justify the arbitrary arrest of LGBTQI+ persons.” The 2023 report also cites reports that “state actors committed violence against LGBTQI+ individuals based on their sexual orientation or gender identity, particularly in Chechnya” and “government agents attacked, harassed, and threatened LGBTQI+ activists.”

Advocacy groups in August sharply criticized the State Department after it “erased” LGBTQ and intersex people from its 2024 human rights report. Immigration Equality and other organizations say this omission could jeopardize the cases of LGBTQ who are seeking asylum in the U.S.

The Trump-Vance administration discontinued the CBP One app on Jan. 20, the day it took office.

Ushakov and Skitsan were initially detained at the Imperial Regional Detention Facility in Calexico, Calif., which is in the state’s Imperial Valley.

“Andrei was placed in an overcrowded unit with more than 60 detainees, where poor sanitation, excessive air conditioning, and the lack of adequate medical care have put his health at risk,” said América Diversa.

The group says the couple are now at the San Luis Regional Detention Center in San Luis, Ariz.

“They are now being denied all communication with each other, despite being legally married and sharing the same asylum case,” said América Diversa.

The group notes Ushakov has a “chronic medical condition that requires continuous medication and quarterly monitoring.”

“Despite repeated requests, he faces long delays in treatment and limited access to medical services,” said América Diversa.

América Diversa also noted Skitsan suffers from a “chronic ear infection, which causes ringing and temporary hearing loss, as well as untreated stomach issues.” América Diversa said Skitsan had been scheduled to see a doctor in December, but his “recent transfer to Arizona has jeopardized that case.”

“Their transfer to the San Luis Regional Detention Center has further worsened their situation,” said América Diversa. “At this new facility, they have been prohibited from communicating with each other, an act that violates not only basic humanitarian principles but also their rights as a legally married couple under both U.S. and international law.”

América Diversa Managing Director Yonatan Matheus on Oct. 22 told the Blade he had just spoken with Ushakov.

“He couldn’t talk with his husband, he was only able to talk with me for less than five minutes,” said Matheus. “The calls are recorded and monitored. He is very afraid to speak.”

The couple’s case are among those that have garnered attention since the Trump-Vance administration took office.

The White House earlier this year “forcibly disappeared” Andry Hernández Romero, a gay Venezuelan makeup artist who asked for asylum in the U.S., to El Salvador. He returned to his homeland in July after he spent more than 100 days in El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center, a maximum-security prison known by the Spanish acronym CECOT.

ICE agents in August arrested Alice Correia Barbosa, a transgender Brazilian woman, while she was driving her car in Silver Spring, Md. A senior Department of Homeland Security official who misgendered Correia told the Blade that she “overstayed his visa by almost six years” and DHS plans to deport her.

Brazil has the highest number of reported murders of trans people in the world.

ICE did not respond to the Blade’s request for comment about Ushakov and Skitsan’s case.

On Tuesday, Vladimir Putin took his oath of office becoming the second ever longest serving leader of the modern Russian state since Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, who held power from 1922 until his death in 1953.

Putin’s tenure in office has been marked by his acquisition of concentrated political power in part due to his eradication and imprisonment or the deaths of his political opponents, such as his rumored unproven involvement in the assassination of fierce Putin critic Boris Nemtsov on Feb. 27, 2015, just steps away from the gate to the Kremlin, and more recently in the prosecution and imprisonment of another high profile Putin critic, Alexei Navalny, who died on Feb. 16 at a penal colony north of the Arctic Circle.

Putin ordered military operations in August 2008, which led to the Russo-Georgian War and diplomatic relations were broken. To this day, the two countries have maintained no formal diplomatic relations. Then in February and March 2014, Russian troops at his direction invaded the Crimean Peninsula, part of Ukraine, and annexed it. The resulting hostilities also spread to the far-eastern Ukrainian oblasts, [provinces] which culminated with Russia invading Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, an escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War that started in 2014. The invasion became the largest attack on a European country since the end of World War II in 1945.

As the war drags on Putin’s threats of military escalation against NATO countries and use of battlefield nuclear weapons has created a tense relationship with a majority of the European Union as well as with the United States. Russia has been heavily sanctioned by the West and is turning to other totalitarian regimes like China, Iran, and North Korea for support.

In his inaugural speech Putin made oblique reference to his oft stated desire to recreate a hybrid of the former Soviet Union:

“In these solemn and crucial moments of assuming the office of the president, I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the citizens of Russia across all regions of our country, as well as those living in the historical territories of Russia who have won their right to stand united with our Motherland.”

The Russian president then thanked the forces fighting in the invasion of Ukraine saying:

“I humbly honor our heroes, the participants in the special military operation, and all those who are fighting for our Fatherland. I would like to thank you again for the trust you have placed in me and for your unwavering support. These words are directed to every citizen of Russia.”

On the domestic front Putin has stifled media outlets with draconian laws passed designed to keep the Russian population largely ignorant of the cost both human lives and governmental spending as the warfare in Ukraine drags on and losses to the Russian military continue.

The Associated Press reported neither the U.S., U.K. nor German ambassadors attended. The U.S. Embassy said Amb. Lynne Tracy was out of the country on “prescheduled, personal travel.”

A handful of EU envoys attended even though top EU diplomat Josep Borrell said he told them “the right thing to do is not to attend this inauguration,” because Putin is the subject of an arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, accusing him of personal responsibility for the abductions of children from Ukraine.

In his speech Putin issued a veiled threat to critics of his regime that dissention would not be tolerated:

“We can see that the atmosphere in society has changed, and how much we now value reliability, responsibility, sincerity, integrity, generosity, and courage. I will do everything in my power to ensure that those who have displayed these admirable human and professional traits, and who have proved their loyalty to the fatherland through their deeds, achieve leading positions in state governance, the economy and all other spheres.

We must ensure reliable continuity in the development of our country for decades to come and bring up new generations who will strengthen Russia’s might and develop our state based on interethnic accord, the preservation of the traditions of all ethnic groups living in Russia, a civilizational nation united by the Russian language and our multi-ethnic culture.”

The Russian president has also targeted the country’s LGBTQ community with passage of multiple laws that forbid public mention or acknowledgment of queer Russians. In his speech he emphasized his commitment to maintaining “family values.”

“Our top priority is the preservation of the people. I am confident that the support of centuries-old family values and traditions will continue to unite public and religious associations, political parties, and all levels of government.

Our decisions regarding the development of the country and its regions must be effective and fair and must promote the prosperity of Russian families and improve their quality of life,” he said.

The Wilson Center, a nonpartisan think tank in D.C., noted recently:

“Escalating state discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community in Russia is directly informed by the Putin regime’s struggle to maintain legitimacy and public support, especially as Russia’s war in Ukraine drags on. Russian federal elections are scheduled for 2024, and officials are reportedly planning to project record levels of public support for Putin.”

The war in Ukraine and discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community are both popular policies among the socially conservative interest groups that make up Putin’s strongest base of support, and Russian policymakers draw clear connections between the Kremlin’s narrative that Russia is fighting Western ideology by proxy in Ukraine and the Kremlin’s attack on the LGBTQ+ experience in Russia.

Putin’s inaugural speech today signaled his future intentions on conducting the war in Ukraine and his ongoing persecution of LGBTQ+ Russians.”

Legislation that will effectively ban the existence of transgender Russians was signed on Monday as expected by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The new law, which takes effective immediately, was passed earlier this month by the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian Parliament, and then last week by the Federal Council, which is its upper body.

The law now bans Russians from changing their gender on official government identity documents including internal and external passports, driver’s licenses and birth certificates, although gender marker changes had been legal since 1997.

Medical healthcare providers are now banned from “performing medical interventions designed to change the sex of a person,” including surgery and prescribing hormone therapy.

The law, which human rights organizations have labeled draconian and barbaric, also bans individuals who have undergone gender reassignment from adopting children and annuls marriages in which one of the partners is trans.

LGBTQ activists have warned that the law will lead to a further increase in already high rates of suicide and suicide attempts among trans Russians. Worse, say sympathetic physicians and trans rights advocates, it will foment an underground market for surgeries and medications, which are dangerous as unproven drugs or outright fake drugs may cause irreparable harm.

LGBTQ activists also said that this law will lead to an increase in attempted suicides among trans youth unable to access medical care.

“The way how these people see their future is collapsing,” Yan Dvorkin, the head of Center-T, a group that helps trans and nonbinary people in Russia, said in an interview with The Moscow Times earlier this month.

During debate over the law, Deputy Duma Speaker Pytor Tolstoy, a co-sponsor of the legislation, pointed out that banning the “practice of transgenderism” was in the interest of national security.

The diagnosis of “transsexualism,” he added, refers to gender identity disorders and is the basis for recognizing a citizen as unfit for military service. In addition, “we must not forget that by changing the sex of one of the partners, a homosexual couple gets the right to adopt a child. Unfortunately, there are already such cases in Russia,” he said.

LGBTQ and human rights organization ILGA-Europe issued a statement condemning the actions of the Duma and offered support and solidarity with the Russian trans and queer communities.

“We firmly assert that such legislation flagrantly violates fundamental human rights standards and principles.

ILGA-Europe firmly believe in the inherent dignity and equal rights of all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression. International human rights standards, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, emphasize that everyone has the right to self-determination, privacy and the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. Denying trans and gender diverse individuals access to trans-specific healthcare and legal gender recognition blatantly disregards the international human rights framework,” ILGA-Europe wrote.

A young woman who only identified herself to Russian freelance journalist Sergei Dimitrov by the name Elena, told him in an interview in St. Petersburg earlier this month:

“There is no safety anymore, soon they will openly hunt us like swine, we no right to exist they say,” she said.

The young woman also said that since the latest passage of laws including expansion of the Russia’s “gay propaganda” law to include adults last December, coupled with the crackdown by the Russian Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media, abbreviated as Roskomnadzor, on any websites and on popular phone apps that cater to LGBTQ people, she has now begun efforts in earnest to leave the country.",https://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2025/10/Aleksandr_Skitsan_and_Andrei_Ushakov_insert_courtesy-1000x600.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 10:57:48.857823

Meet Mel and Jasmine and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.

Nonprofits working to combat domestic violence and sexual assault have notched a string of legal wins as they push back against efforts by the Trump administration to put restrictions on work that goes against the administration’s views.

A series of lawsuits has, at least temporarily, blocked the administration from enforcing restrictions on millions of dollars of funding for upcoming grants and forced it to return grants it took away from some nonprofits working with LGBTQ+ victims.

Domestic violence groups and the broader network of gender-based violence nonprofits have been on high alert since the Trump administration issued a series of executive orders — followed by a temporary federal freeze in late January — to end federal funding for programs or organizations out of step with the administration’s ideology. The funding, advocates say, is essential to providing life-saving services to vulnerable victims, who are more likely to be women.

Through agency rules, the administration is actively trying to restrict the use of federal grants to fund what it calls “illegal” diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility activities and “gender ideology extremism.” It is also trying to restrict federal grants from organizations that in any way express support for abortion and that serve immigrants without permanent legal status in the country.

The restrictions go even further: Nonprofits that want to continue to receive federal funding from the Office on Violence Against Women, part of the U.S. Department of Justice, are not allowed to “frame domestic violence or sexual assault as systemic social justice issues rather than criminal offenses.”

Trump, who has been found liable for sexual assault, last month downplayed the seriousness of domestic violence crimes in a speech. “If a man has a little fight with the wife, they say this was a crime,” Trump said.

The lawsuits

In June, 17 state-level coalitions that support victims of domestic and sexual violence, represented by Democracy Forward and the National Women’s Law Center, sued the administration over such restrictions on Violence Against Women Act grants awarded by the Justice Department. The following month, in a separate lawsuit filed by Democracy Forward, many of the same state coalitions sued over similar rules attached to grants from the departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

In early August, Judge William Smith of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island issued a preliminary injunction blocking the administration from enforcing the new restrictions on Justice Department grants as the case progresses.

The judge agreed that the nonprofits face an impossible choice between accepting conditions that will harm the core services they provide or going without essential funding. The judge cited two examples: Complying with the rules would bar the organizations from providing the same quality of services to transgender victims and could also prevent organizations counseling victims from doing anything other than calling law enforcement.

“These examples are simply two of many activities that the coalitions engage in that they reasonably fear will now subject them to loss of grant funding,” Smith wrote. “The Office’s assurances that … the office will be reasonable in its interpretation of the conditions is cold comfort.”

A similar preliminary injunction came down in mid-October in the HHS and HUD case, blocking the rollout of restrictions on those agencies’ grants as the case continues. In her ruling, District Judge Melissa DuBose, also of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, said the administration didn’t provide a “satisfactory explanation” the new slew of restrictions, finding that Trump officials “engaged in a baseless and arbitrary process” that didn’t consider the “harmful impact their decision would have on the coalitions and the vulnerable populations they serve.”

Litigation in both cases will likely stretch into 2026.

Advocates against domestic violence and sexual assault celebrated the two rulings, which are part of a broader effort that also includes challenges to rules trying to strip funding from groups that work with LGBTQ+ and immigrant victims.

“This injunction provides immediate relief to survivors, and it allows us and our programs to continue our life-saving work without the threat of restrictive, harmful policies that would have undermined our ability to support those who need it most,” Mike Waterloo of the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence said of the August ruling.

“This is not a permanent solution, and we still have work to do.”

A coalition of states working with Democracy Forward called the ruling on health and housing grants “a relief and a win that gives us breathing room to continue this vital work.”

LGBTQ+ victims

One of the Trump administration’s first targets was funding that supported groups working with LGBTQ+ people. Lambda Legal, an LGBTQ+ civil rights advocacy group, helmed an early lawsuit on behalf of nine nonprofits that receive federal funding, several working in the intimate partner violence field.

The organizations argue that the Trump administration’s executive orders, including the order calling for the end of federal funding for activities that promote “gender ideology extremism,” amount to “an existential threat to transgender people.” Forcing the organizations to comply violates the groups’ free speech, due process and equal protection rights, they say.

In June, a federal judge in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued a preliminary injunction in the case that favored the nonprofits, saying that their case was likely to succeed in court. The judge’s ruling reinstated canceled grants and voided instructions hindering new applications and instructions for funding, including one from the Office of Violence Against Women stating that “that no LGBTQ+ related content should be submitted.”

The administration appealed the decision to the U.S Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in August. The case continues to move through the courts.

LGBTQ+ Americans, with the exception of gay men, are more likely to have experienced domestic violence, partner abuse or dating violence than cisgender and heterosexual people. Queer women are significantly more likely to have experienced intimate partner violence in their lifetime than straight women, according to an analysis of federal survey data by the Human Rights Campaign. Fifty-four percent of respondents to the 2015 U.S. Trans Survey said they have experienced intimate partner violence, and 47 percent reported being sexually assaulted.

FORGE, one of the plaintiffs, is among the only organizations in the country focused specifically on transgender victims of violence. The 30-year-old organization relies on federal grants for 90 percent of its funding.

Legal services for immigrant victims

A coalition of Democratic attorneys general filed a lawsuit in early October challenging a new rule from the Justice Department that could restrict the use of federal grants to pay for legal services for immigrant victims of domestic and sexual violence.

The upcoming rule says states and the local nonprofits they fund are barred from providing some legal services to survivors who don’t have legal status to be in the country. The lawsuit argues that the Violence Against Women Act — which authorized a part of the funding in question — includes a broad list of allowable legal services that include divorce, parental rights, child support, employment-related lawsuits, housing, civil rights and more.

The Justice Department’s new rule does allow states to pay for restraining and custody orders, legal action dealing with human trafficking and legal services to obtain U and T visas, as required by other laws.

The states argue that it’s unclear how exactly they and the organizations that use the funding will be able to comply with the order: Which immigrants are restricted? What legal services are not allowed?

They also argue that the order would force them to violate the law, including the Violence Against Women Act, which says that services for victims are “not dependent on the victim’s immigration status.”

“With this cruel attempt to dictate which survivors deserve access to legal supports, DOJ is endangering families, silencing survivors, and threatening public safety. I will not stand idly by while the federal government unjustly attacks people seeking protection from violence,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office is taking the lead on the lawsuit. (James, who has led more than a dozen lawsuits against the Trump administration, is a political target of Trump; the president’s Justice Department is pursuing federal mortgage fraud charges against James related to a house she owns in Virginia.)

“We are asking the court to block this illegal rule before it takes effect, immeasurably harming survivors.”

The administration notified states of the new rule in August. It is expected to take effect in November.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Domestic-violence-nonprofit-illustration-for-Oct-26-2025-story.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 08:57:03.039460

They further highlighted that ""the Trump administration has spent the entire year endangering the food security of millions of Americans.
""In order to make the deadline, the Trump administration would have needed to start preparing for partial payments weeks ago, which it has not done.""
After also obtaining the memo, CNN asked Trump if he would direct the USDA to fund SNAP next month.","Elected Democrats and other critics on Saturday continued to call out the Trump administration for refusing to use contingency funding to pay for food stamps during the US government shutdown, imperiling hunger relief for about 42 million low-income people.

In November, Americans who receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits won't get their food aid if Congress doesn't reach an agreement to fund the government, which shut down at the beginning of the month due to a battle over healthcare.

""Congress established an emergency fund to ensure that millions of Americans on SNAP continue to receive nutrition assistance when funding expires in November,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who caucuses with Democrats, said on social media Saturday.

Sanders—the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions—then appealed directly to Republican President Donald Trump: ""Don't let kids go hungry. Use these emergency funds to feed low-income families.""

Throughout the week, left-leaning groups, congressional Democrats, and Democratic governors of states including Maryland, Massachusetts, and New Jersey, have called for using the contingency fund.

Sharon Parrott, a former Office of Management and Budget (OMB) official who is now president of the think tank Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, took aim at US Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins in a Wednesday statement.

""Secretary Rollins' claim that the Trump Administration is unable to deliver November SNAP benefits during a shutdown is unequivocally false,"" Parrott said. ""In fact, the administration is legally required to use contingency reserves—billions of dollars that Congress provided for use when SNAP funding is inadequate that remain available during the shutdown—to fund November benefits for the 1 in 8 Americans who need SNAP to afford their grocery bill.""

""Speaking as a former OMB official, I know from experience that the federal government has the authority and the tools it needs during a shutdown to get these SNAP funds to families,"" she continued. ""It would be unconscionable for the administration to go out of its way to threaten millions of children, seniors, veterans, people with disabilities, parents, and workers with hunger, rather than taking all legal steps available to provide food assistance to people who need it.""

That same day, a trio of experts at the Center for American Progress also argued that the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) ""is legally obligated to use"" the contingency resources. They further highlighted that ""the Trump administration has spent the entire year endangering the food security of millions of Americans. From terminating funding used to purchase food for schools and food banks to passing the largest cuts in SNAP history, the administration has made it clear that its goal is to take food away from hungry families—and that sentiment is extending to the USDA's approach to the shutdown.""

US House Agriculture Committee Ranking Member Angie Craig (D-Minn.) and Subcommittee on Nutrition and Foreign Agriculture Ranking Member Jahana Hayes (D-Conn.), along with nearly every other Democrat in the chamber, sent a letter to Rollins on Friday. They wrote:

USDA's shutdown plan acknowledges that ""congressional intent is evident that SNAP's operations should continue since the program has been provided with multiyear contingency funds."" USDA still has significant funding available in SNAP's contingency reserve—which Congress provides precisely for this reason—that can be used to fund the bulk of November benefits.

We urge USDA to use these funds for November SNAP benefits and issue clear guidance to states on how to navigate benefit issuance. Additionally, while the contingency reserve will not cover November benefits in full, we urge USDA to use its statutory transfer authority or an other legal authority at its disposal to supplement these dollars and fully fund November benefits.

As Politico reported Friday, ""The contingency fund for SNAP currently holds roughly $5 billion, which would not cover the full $9 billion the administration would need to fund November benefits.""

""Even if the administration did partially tap those funds, it would take weeks to dole out the money on a pro rata basis—meaning most low-income Americans would miss their November food benefits anyway,"" the outlet explained. ""In order to make the deadline, the Trump administration would have needed to start preparing for partial payments weeks ago, which it has not done.""

Politico and other outlets obtained a brief memo from the USDA blaming Democrats for the disruption and claiming that ""contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.""

""SNAP contingency funds are only available to supplement regular monthly benefits when amounts have been appropriated for, but are insufficient to cover, benefits,"" the memo states. ""The contingency fund is not available to support [fiscal year] 2026 regular benefits, because the appropriation for regular benefits no longer exists.""

""Instead, the contingency fund is a source of funds for contingencies, such as the Disaster SNAP program, which provides food purchasing benefits for individuals in disaster areas, including natural disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods, that can come on quickly and without notice,"" it continues. ""For example, Hurricane Melissa is currently swirling in the Caribbean and could reach Florida.""

The memo adds that ""this administration will not allow Democrats to jeopardize funding for school meals and infant formula in order to prolong their shutdown.""

After also obtaining the memo, CNN asked Trump if he would direct the USDA to fund SNAP next month. The president—who left for Asia later Friday—claimed, ""Yeah, everybody is going to be in good shape, yep,"" without offering any details.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61922734&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C504%2C0%2C504,N,,2025-10-26 10:57:40.555440

In 1947, when Trump was born, the United States was over 89 percent white; today, that percentage is just over 60 percent.
In addition, The New York Times said he is considering a major change in immigration policy that would favor white immigrants from Europe and South Africa.
In his first 200 days, the nonpartisan Brookings Institution said 91 percent of his appointees were white and 88 percent male.
The only recent administration with similar statistics was Trump's first administration, where his appointments during a similar period were 90 percent white.","For President Donald Trump, white is beautiful.

Since regaining the presidency, he has pursued policies that seek to reverse the country's racial diversification and make it -- and its government -- whiter again, as it was before millions of immigrants entered from South and Central America, Africa and Asia.

In 1947, when Trump was born, the United States was over 89 percent white; today, that percentage is just over 60 percent. Back then, most entering immigrants came from Europe; now, fewer than 20 percent do.

In 2024, Trump's support from white voters -- 57 percent, according to exit polls -- was about the same as backed GOP candidates in the previous six elections. But in office, he has reversed both policies and appointments to favor whites over people of color.

His Justice Department revoked long-standing legal interventions favoring Black plaintiffs in civil rights cases, and his administration has accelerated deportation of illegal immigrants -- and some legal ones -- who are mostly people of color.

Meanwhile, Trump has removed several prominent Black officials named by his own and prior administrations, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and replaced almost all of them with white appointees.

In addition, The New York Times said he is considering a major change in immigration policy that would favor white immigrants from Europe and South Africa.

Last week, the Justice Department joined critics of a key provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act in urging the Supreme Court to reverse its long-standing policy requiring consideration of race in congressional redistricting. The court's conservative majority seemed amenable to the change, which would almost certainly reduce the number of Black representatives in Congress.

Earlier, the department announced it had changed the focus of its civil rights division, dropping challenges to several state actions the Biden administration contended were discriminatory against Blacks and other minorities, dismissing lawsuits challenging the right of states to purge voters right before an election, and challenging the race-based creation of several Texas congressional districts it previously approved.

Voting rights division attorneys were directed to dismiss all active voting discrimination challenges, and a new mission statement stressed the goal of fighting voter fraud, though proven cases have been rare.

Trump, himself, gave an unusually candid exposition of his views on the country's racial makeup during his first term, when he criticized the influx of immigrants from predominantly Black and brown countries and called for more from mostly white European nations.

At a January 2018 meeting to consider a possible compromise on immigration issues, news organizations reported that Trump complained about ""having all these people from s---hole countries come here,"" citing Haiti, El Salvador and Africa as examples. ""We should have more people from Norway,"" he said. Norway is over 90 percent white.

And during his successful 2024 campaign, The New York Times reported similar comments to a group of millionaire donors. ""Why can't we allow people to come in from nice countries,"" he reportedly asked, adding, ""I'm trying to be nice. Nice countries, you know like Denmark, Switzerland? Do we have any people coming in from Denmark? How about Switzerland? How about Norway?"" All are over 90 percent white.

Now, he is preparing to change that.

Soon after taking office, his administration barred most new asylum applicants from Africa and Central America, but Trump started a program granting entry to white South Africans on grounds they were subject to discrimination from the land reform policies of the country's Black majority government.

More recently, The Times reported the administration is considering slashing the asylum program designed to protect refugees from violence and discrimination and instead favoring admission of white South Africans and Europeans who shared its views on immigration.

Trump has also shown his racial priorities in his appointments -- and in those he has fired. After all, the president gained a lot of his initial following by firing people on a weekly television show.

In his first 200 days, the nonpartisan Brookings Institution said 91 percent of his appointees were white and 88 percent male. The only recent administration with similar statistics was Trump's first administration, where his appointments during a similar period were 90 percent white.

By contrast, former President Joe Biden's appointments during his first 200 days were only 53 percent white and 38 percent male.

Trump's only black Cabinet member is Scott Turner, the secretary of housing and urban development.

Soon after taking office, he fired Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., the second Black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the first woman to serve as Chief of Naval Operations and commandant of the Coast Guard. All of the Joint Chiefs are now white men.

Several other prominent Black officers have also left, most recently Gen. Alvin Holsey, commander of the Southern Command.

Trump also fired several top Black civilian officials, including Carla Hayden, the librarian of Congress; Gwynne A. Wilcox, a member of the National Labor Relations Board; Robert Primus, a member of the Surface Transportation Board, which approves rail mergers; and Alvin Brown, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board.

He tried to fire Lisa Cook, the first Black woman on the Federal Reserve Board, but courts blocked him.

As the country has become more diverse racially, so have the federal government's upper ranks. The only two recent exceptions: Trump's first administration, and his second.

The Salvadoran national’s case has become a magnet for opposition to President Trump’s immigration crackdown since he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, in violation of a settlement agreement.

He was returned to the U.S. in June after the U.S. Supreme Court said the administration had to work to bring him back. Since he cannot be re-deported to El Salvador, the U.S. government has been seeking to deport him to various African countries.

A federal judge in Maryland had previously barred his immediate deportation. Abrego Garcia’s lawsuit there claims the Trump administration is illegally using the deportation process to punish him for its embarrassment over his mistaken deportation.

A Friday court filing from the Department of Homeland Security says that “Liberia is a thriving democracy and one of the United States’s closest partners on the African continent.” Its national language is English, its constitution “provides robust protections for human rights,” and Liberia is “committed to the humane treatment of refugees,” the filing asserts. It concludes that Abrego Garcia could be deported as soon as Friday.

The court filing assessment is in contrast to a U.S. State Department report last year that detailed a human rights record in Liberia including extrajudicial killings, torture and serious restrictions on press freedom.

“After failed attempts with Uganda, Eswatini, and Ghana, ICE now seeks to deport our client, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, to Liberia, a country with which he has no connection, thousands of miles from his family and home in Maryland,” a statement from attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg reads. “Costa Rica stands ready to accept him as a refugee, a viable and lawful option. Yet the government has chosen a course calculated to inflict maximum hardship. These actions are punitive, cruel, and unconstitutional.”

Abrego Garcia has an American wife and child and has lived in Maryland for years. He immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager, but in 2019 an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to El Salvador, where he faces a “well-founded fear” of violence from a gang that targeted his family, according to court filings. In a separate action in immigration court, Abrego Garcia has applied for asylum in the United States.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4ee70f9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3500x1838+0+248/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F53%2F8a%2F4779b6e54c25bd9a3694e2fdae25%2F1c78b6e265064da2abafeefcbb21fd09.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 04:56:35.930088

In Chicago this week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents allegedly pointed a gun at a state representative and his staff on the city’s North Side. The next day, raids in the heavily Latino neighborhood of Little Village, in the city, and Cicero, a western suburb, led to arrests of two American citizens — staffers of a city alderman. One local leader called the raids a “brutal escalation” of the Trump administration’s ongoing immigration enforcement.

Nearly two months into ICE’s campaign in Chicago, disruptive, chaotic scenes like this are hardly surprising anymore. In recent weeks, agents have rappelled into an apartment building from a Black Hawk helicopter, fired pepper balls at peaceful protesters, and allegedly zip-tied the hands of children. ICE and the Department of Homeland Security have not commented in some of these instances, or they have said the officers’ actions were justified.

This spectacle of enforcement isn’t merely incidental. Part of the rationale for the administration’s intense posture has always been to terrify people into self-deportation, ProPublica noted in a report this week. The Chicago effort has included cinematic promotional videos of the aggressive, militarized campaign. An AFP fact check found that at least one White House video promoting the Chicago operation included footage from earlier enforcement across the country.

Meanwhile, in communities across Chicago, people are creating their own kind of commotion to slow down ICE. The sounds of whistles have periodically blanketed neighborhoods, as people monitor enforcement activity and alert others that agents are in the area. Those efforts have come alongside rapid response protests and court battles over whether agents have used excessive force on demonstrators.

Beneath all the commotion, though, the work of hardening the immigration system has been methodical. According to ICE, federal officers made more than 1,000 arrests over roughly the first month of the operation, sweeping up both new arrivals and long-time Chicagoans. Calls to Chicago-area legal assistance hotlines by families of people arrested by immigration authorities have “skyrocketed”. Many of those detained have been transferred to facilities in Louisiana and Texas, far from their families and lawyers, and without hope for release while their immigration case is pending.

According to immigration lawyers, these outcomes reflect a deeper reshaping of the machinery of detention and deportation away from discretion and toward a singular focus: getting people out of the country as rapidly as possible, by any means necessary.

Historically, ICE agents at a local field office could consider the individual circumstances of a case — for example, whether an immigrant was a nursing mother or had serious medical conditions — in deciding whether to make them a priority for arrest.

“That discretion has totally evaporated,” said Sarah Cockrum, the supervising attorney at Beyond Legal Aid, a Chicago legal services organization representing people in immigration court. Now, Cockrum said, “there are children with cancer who are in detention — just really awful things.”

In fact, not only were agents previously allowed to consider such factors — under a memo issued at the beginning of the Biden Administration, they were required to consider all facts and circumstances in making arrest decisions. The memo stated that the “overriding question” in deciding whether to make an arrest was whether a noncitizen presented a public safety risk.

The Trump administration reversed that framework entirely just days after the president took office, essentially redefining discretion as the authority to detain and deport more quickly, rather than to weigh the individual facts of a person’s life.

Once ICE makes an arrest, the next place where officials have traditionally had some discretion is in the judicial branch. Days before DHS announced its operation in Chicago, however, the Board of Immigration Appeals ruled that immigration judges lack the authority to grant bond to anyone who entered the U.S. without authorization.

It’s not the only way the administration has sought to limit the power of judges. Since early summer, government lawyers in Chicago’s immigration court, and around the country, have increasingly asked judges to dismiss immigration cases, only for federal officers to arrest the immigrant after their hearing. In many cases, the government sought to deport the immigrant through expedited removal, a rapid process that happens without judicial review and had previously been used largely for people apprehended near the border who had been in the U.S. only a short time. In August, a federal judge paused the administration’s efforts to expand the use of expedited removal.

“One thing we're seeing is a big push to remove people from the immigration court system so that they don't get a chance to fight their case in court,” Cockrum said.

With fewer avenues for ICE officers or immigration judges to allow someone to remain in the U.S. or out of detention, immigrant-rights advocates have turned to the federal courts. Earlier this month, a federal judge ruled that ICE had violated a 2022 court-ordered agreement that limits ICE’s ability to make warrantless arrests in six midwestern states, including Illinois.

As ICE allegedly breaches existing legal protections and the administration looks for ways to write other protections out of existence, communities across the region are feeling the impact. In Niles, next to Chicago, 16-year-old Ofelia Torres, who is battling a rare and aggressive form of cancer, took to social media to plead for her father Reuben Torres Maldonado’s release. She described him as the “main parent who watches my brother while I stayed at the hospital.” Torres Maldonado is also the family’s primary breadwinner, the Chicago Tribune reported. He was arrested last weekend in a home improvement store parking lot.

Cockrum said that in the past, someone like Torres Maldonado — a father to a sick child, who had lived more than half his life in America, with only minor traffic offenses on his record — would have been exactly the type of person likely to be deprioritized for enforcement. If arrested, he likely would have been granted bond while his case proceeded.

Instead, a statement from administration officials dismissed legal efforts to free him as “nothing more than a desperate Hail Mary attempt to keep a criminal illegal alien in our country.” In the statement, officials said that he backed into a government vehicle while attempting to flee.",https://mirrorball.themarshallproject.org/cAayEM0nwi4jWu9g8b7tHG9LOCxs1AXQxoZZwtldNJE/w:1200/aHR0cHM6Ly9kMm0x/OXBtdnRzNWJvYi5j/bG91ZGZyb250Lm5l/dC8wdDdmdGl5MG44/Z2h5aDJubGI3bXJi/Y2prYTR5LzI1MTAy/NF9PSm9uZXNfQ2hp/Y2Fnb0lDRV9HZXR0/eUltYWdlcy5qcGc,N,,2025-10-26 11:17:09.179674

Ashanna Valle, who joined the crowd despite the rain, said she felt compelled to speak out.

“We have to stand up. We have to be here. We have to keep saying this is not right,” Valle said.

The rally came less than a week after federal agents detained 105 undocumented individuals in Wilder, according to community organizers. The raid, witnesses said, created panic and confusion as families were separated and many struggled to locate detained relatives.

Leo Morales, executive director of the ACLU of Idaho, said the event was meant to both show solidarity and share resources for affected families.

“Some family members continue to have challenges finding their loved ones who were detained,” Morales said. “There were machine guns there, with children who were zip-tied. Rubber bullets were used as well, and this was visible to all community members. It was a very traumatic event.”

Morales said counselors are being mobilized to help those coping with the trauma and that the ACLU is coordinating donations of food, clothing and financial support. Contributions are being accepted at the International Rescue Committee (IRC) in Boise and the Community Council of Idaho. Monetary donations can also be made at GiveButter.com/ifaf.

Interfaith groups, including Methodist, Mennonite and Catholic leaders, helped organize the event to provide emotional and spiritual support through prayer.

Reverend Karen Hernandez of the United Methodist Church said faith communities have a moral duty to stand with their immigrant neighbors.

“Our hearts are breaking for the entire immigrant and Latino community that are fearful — and that fear seems justified,” Hernandez said. “It makes it even more urgent for people of faith to stand up and support those neighbors.”

Community leaders are also calling on Gov. Brad Little to offer transparency and leadership in response to the raid.

Activists said the facility, which typically operates only Monday through Friday, called dozens of immigrants on Friday night and Saturday morning, instructing them to report for appointments Saturday.

Inside the building, advocates said, immigrants waited anxiously to learn whether they would be allowed to go home or be detained.

Lisa Knox, a lawyer and the leader of the California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice, said some were forced to make heartbreaking choices.

“At one point, people were told they had to choose between seeing their families, seeing infants and saying goodbye before they were shipped off to detention, and talking to lawyers,” Knox said. ""They're not usually open on the weekends. It's very unusual. Usually, when people have appointments, they go in on a weekday. They're told months in advance when their next appointment would be so for people to get a call on Friday saying come in on Saturday is really unusual.""

Immigration rights activist Luis Magana said he came to the facility to support those summoned inside.

“That’s why activists are here—to see what happens,” Magana said. He noted that weekend check-ins limit immigrants’ access to legal support. “Some people I know are inside—they’re waiting for their appointment, and we expect they come out. We don’t know.""

Knox said that while many got to go back home after their appointments, not everyone did.

“We believe that around 25 people at least were detained today and are going to be sent to detention centers in the Central Valley,” Knox said. ""There was a young person who may be a minor and also a pregnant person.""

ABC10 reached out to ICE for comment and to confirm the reported detentions, but did not receive a response. Despite the tense atmosphere, Stockton police observed the protest from a distance, and it was mostly peaceful.

Activists said that more check-ins were scheduled for Sunday, and they plan to return to voice their concerns. Several lawyers also said they plan to be at the facility on Sunday to offer legal services to those in need.

“We know for now at least, ICE and CBP have called off large-scale raids in the Bay area, and it seems like they've decided to shift some of their capacity here,"" Knox said. ""We’re here to say that wherever they go, we’re going to go also. We’re going to support our community, our families and our loved ones.”

According to informed sources, the U.S. administration is drafting plans to overhaul the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE), including replacing several senior field office directors nationwide.

The proposal stems from growing frustration within the White House and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) over the slow pace of deportations—lagging behind Trump’s stated goal of deporting more than one million people by the end of his first year back in office.

Officials say the plan, which would reassign around six regional directors, has not yet been finalized.

This potential reshuffle highlights the administration’s ongoing struggle to fulfill Trump’s demand for a sweeping immigration crackdown — a policy cornerstone of his political agenda.

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson declined to comment on the restructuring plans, but in a statement said:

“The President’s entire team is fully aligned in executing his immigration agenda — from securing the border to deporting criminal illegal aliens. The results speak for themselves.”

Over 20 field office directors currently oversee deportation operations across the U.S., each responsible for wide regions that may include multiple states or major areas like Northern California.

These regional leaders have faced mounting pressure to ramp up arrests. ICE has already replaced two acting directors and several senior officials amid Trump’s push for faster deportations.

Claire Trickler-McNulty, a former senior ICE official under the Biden administration, said:

“They’re under constant threat; people are being crushed. It’s a culture of fear. There’s been so much turnover that I can’t imagine anyone is able to take on the real challenges.”

The DHS reports that since Trump returned to office, over 400,000 people have been deported, with a target of 600,000 total deportations by the end of his first year.

However, those numbers can be misleading. Individuals turned back at the border or entry points are counted as deportees — even if they never actually entered or lived in the U.S.

Earlier this year, Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff, met with senior ICE leaders in Washington to discuss ways to accelerate deportations. Shortly afterward, he appeared on Fox News, announcing ICE’s goal of 3,000 arrests per day.

Following his comments, daily arrests briefly climbed above 2,000 — but have since declined, with ICE unable to meet Miller’s benchmark. Even so, the agency has continued detaining over 1,000 migrants per day throughout the summer.

The New York Times reported that ICE’s deportation operations are time-intensive. Historically, the agency prided itself on targeted enforcement against specific individuals, not broad sweeps that cause panic in communities and ensnare bystanders.

Now, ICE agents are devoting massive time and resources to surveillance and raids, making it difficult to hit the administration’s high deportation quotas.

Agency data show that more than 60,000 migrants are currently in ICE detention — a sharp increase. ICE has been granted extra funding to expand detention capacity to over 100,000 migrants. Its annual budget was boosted to $28 billion under a domestic policy bill Trump signed earlier this year.

With ICE arrests lagging, U.S. Border Patrol agents have taken a greater role in enforcement — conducting workplace inspections at major retailers and even large-scale raids at residential complexes in cities like Chicago. Meanwhile, ICE continues to focus on narrower, case-by-case operations.",https://www.mizanonline.ir/files/en/news/2025/10/25/14269_290.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 21:01:00.507960

The court filing said that Abrego Garcia could be sent to the West African nation as soon as Oct. 31 to fulfill a standing deportation order against him.

Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March despite a 2019 protection finding and a court order barring his removal to his home country. His case has become a focal point in the clash between Trump’s hardline deportation agenda and Democratic efforts to block removals.

The filing noted that Abrego Garcia’s attorneys cited more than 20 countries he allegedly fears would prosecute or torture him if he were removed there and that Liberia is not on that list.

“Liberia is a thriving democracy and one of the United States’s closest partners on the African continent,” the filing said.

The filing said the country’s national language is English, its constitution “provides robust protections for human rights,” and Liberia is “committed to the humane treatment of refugees.”

DHS said in the filing that it has received diplomatic assurances from Liberia about the humane treatment of people removed there.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia requests asylum in attempt to prevent deportation to Uganda

Attorneys for Abrego Garcia blasted the administration’s latest move as political retribution, arguing the latest deportation plan is part of a pattern of punitive deportation tactics.

“After failed attempts with Uganda, Eswatini, and Ghana, ICE now seeks to deport our client, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, to Liberia, a country with which he has no connection, thousands of miles from his family and home in Maryland,” attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said in a statement, according to The Associated Press.

“Costa Rica stands ready to accept him as a refugee, a viable and lawful option,” the lawyer added. “Yet the government has chosen a course calculated to inflict maximum hardship. These actions are punitive, cruel and unconstitutional.”

Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., a staunch supporter of Abrego Garcia, condemned the latest filing on Friday. Van Hollen flew to El Salvador in April in a publicized visit to meet Abrego Garcia in prison and has led the effort to get him released.

“The Trump Administration has been desperately shopping for faraway countries they can ship Kilmar Abrego Garcia to in order to deny his constitutional due process right to defend himself against the charges they have brought,” Van Hollen said in a statement.

“Clearly, Trump’s cronies want to avoid answering for the claim that they are engaged in a vindictive prosecution against Abrego Garcia, after a federal judge concluded earlier this month that his prosecution ‘may stem from retaliation by the DOJ and DHS due to Abrego’s successful challenge of his unlawful deportation in Maryland.’ Kilmar must be allowed his day in court to fight for his rights,” the senator said.

Abrego Garcia entered the U.S. illegally in 2011 and was issued a deportation order in 2019. Two previous judges found he was likely affiliated with MS-13.

Trump administration officials acknowledged in court that his deportation had been an administrative error, although some top Trump officials said he was correctly removed and contended he’s a member of the notorious MS-13 gang.

One immigration judge in 2019 found that Garcia had not sufficiently refuted evidence of MS-13 affiliation and was thus removable to anywhere other than El Salvador because of a threat from a rival gang.

The latest move to deport him comes as Abrego Garcia remains in immigration detention in Pennsylvania. A federal judge in Maryland previously barred his immediate deportation while reviewing claims that the government is retaliating against him for successfully challenging his wrongful removal earlier this year.

The same judge wrote in an October order that his prosecution “may stem from retaliation by the DOJ and DHS,” while a separate case in Tennessee over human smuggling charges is still pending.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/newspress-collage-qq79mz6zi-1761418049448.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1761403663&w=1200,N,,2025-10-25 21:01:04.836727

It was the latest death to occur in an operation of the Trump administration’s crackdown on people residing unlawfully in the United States.

The man, Josue Castro-Rivera, 24, of Honduras, was found dead by responding Virginia State Police officers on Interstate 264 in Norfolk on Thursday morning, state police said. He had been struck by a pickup truck.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers had stopped Mr. Castro-Rivera’s vehicle as part of a targeted operation, according to a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security. When the officers moved to detain the vehicle’s occupants after determining they were in the country illegally, Mr. Castro-Rivera fled the scene on foot and entered the busy highway.

“One of our ICE officers administered CPR to Castro-Rivera in an attempt to keep him alive,” the D.H.S. spokesperson said. “Unfortunately, Castro-Rivera perished. The officer then informed the three detained aliens that their friend had deceased. He then grieved and prayed with them.”

(Minnesota Reformer) — Hundreds gathered outside the federal Whipple Building at Fort Snelling Friday to protest the presence of Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, who is leading the Trump administration’s efforts to detain and deport millions of immigrants.

Noem held a press conference to tout the administration’s arrests of immigrants who have committed crimes. She spoke behind a table piled with seized firearms and bags of marijuana, meth and fentanyl.

Many protesters feared Noem’s presence signaled the beginning of a large-scale immigration enforcement effort like the one launched in Chicago last month.

But Noem’s appearance focused instead on celebrating arrests made by Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s St. Paul field office.

“I’m here today to ask all of the people in Minnesota, all of the people in the Midwest and throughout our country, to support your law enforcement officers, to support them and help protect them as they go out and do their job,” Noem said.

Dozens of clergy members attended the protest, leading demonstrators through songs like “This Little Light of Mine” and “We Shall Not Be Moved.”

Craig Loya, a bishop at Episcopal Church in Minnesota, preached a message of inclusion.

“As long as I have breath, I will continue to preach and proclaim that diversity makes us stronger and that there is no clearer moral imperative than standing with the immigrant and the outsider, because that is how God has embraced every single one of us,” Loya said.

Protesters demonstrated right up to the Whipple Building’s glass doors, with many holding signs and shouting anti-ICE chants.

“No more Minnesota nice. We won’t want your fascist ICE,” the protesters chanted.

The chants did not reach the windowless room of the Whipple Building where Noem spoke.

When asked whether President Donald Trump would deploy the National Guard or other federal law enforcement to the Twin Cities, Noem said “it’s up to the president.”

But thousands of newly-trained ICE officers are expected to join field offices in the coming weeks, including in St. Paul, paid for by funding approved in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed in July, Noem said.

Under Noem, DHS has bucked precedent by requesting troves of personal data from states and other federal agencies to assist in deportation efforts; arresting people at courthouses; sending immigrants to countries they have no ties to and in some cases known for human rights abuses; and ignoring court orders.

Immigration agents detained a roofing crew in St. Paul on Oct. 3. The officers arrived in unmarked vehicles and refused to show their identification, according to advocates. Some wore masks.

Asked about the incident, Noem said “our agents always follow exactly what the law is and what the regulation and the protocol is for every single operation that they’re out on, so they are always identifying themselves and making sure that people know who they are.”

A handful of Minnesota Democratic lawmakers also attended the protest, including DFL state Rep. Samantha Sencer-Mura, who said she was at the protest to send a message to Noem that she and ICE weren’t welcome in Minnesota.

“We know a lot of what they do — the point is just fear,” Sencer-Mura said. “Always trying to combat that with love and community is a good way to just show up.”",https://media-cdn.socastsrm.com/wordpress/wp-content/blogs.dir/2431/files/2025/10/mg-5354-1536x1024-1-1200x675.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 21:01:09.820951

Jose Castro-Rivera was in a vehicle that was stopped on I-264 eastbound in Virginia around 11 a.m. local time on Thursday, according to Virginia State Police, who were responding to a report of a vehicle-pedestrian crash at the Military Highway interchange.

When they arrived, troopers found an adult male who had been hit by a 2002 Ford pickup truck. The man was identified as Rivera, and was pronounced dead at the scene.

A preliminary investigation by VSP found that he was “fleeing from a pursuit initiated by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement when he exited his vehicle and attempted to cross the interstate.”

Officials from VSP were not involved in the pursuit but are investigating the pedestrian crash, which remains under investigation.

A spokesperson from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said ICE stopped the vehicle in which the Honduran national was traveling as “part of a targeted, intelligence-based immigration enforcement operation.”

“Upon determining that the occupants were in the United States illegally, officers began detaining the occupants of the targeted vehicle. However, one of the vehicle’s occupants, Jose Castro-Rivera, resisted heavily and fled the scene onto a busy highway, creating a significant safety risk to himself and the general public,” the agency said. “Unfortunately, a passing vehicle struck Castro-Rivera.”

Jose Castro Rivera was killed on Thursday morning after running onto a busy highway and being struck and fatally injured while trying to evade ICE agents, local authorities said.

A Department of Homeland Security official told NBC News that ICE agents stopped a vehicle as part of a “targeted, intelligence-based immigration enforcement operation” but did not provide further details about Castro Rivera, or any of the other passengers who were detained but survived the operation. An ICE agent administered CPR to Castro Rivera, but he died at the scene, according to the official.

The fatal incident took place on the busy Interstate 264 eastbound at the Military Highway interchange in Norfolk in south-east Virginia. The Virginia state police said they were not involved in the pursuit and the fatal crash remains under investigation.

This is the third known deadly incident involving immigrants trying to flee immigration raids by masked, armed federal agents that are spreading across the country, as part of the Trump administration’s relentless crackdown on immigrants and unprecedented expansion of ICE.

In August, Roberto Carlos Montoya Valdés, 52, of Guatemala was killed on the freeway after fleeing an ICE raid at a Home Depot in Monrovia, California, about 20 miles (32km) north-east of downtown Los Angeles. The home improvement retailer, which has long been a meeting spot for employers to recruit documented and undocumented day laborers as roofers, painters and construction workers, has been targeted by the Trump administration for ICE operations.

The Guatemalan man’s death came just a month after another deadly ICE raid in southern California.

Mexican farm worker Jaime Alanís García, 56, died after falling 30ft (9 meters) from a greenhouse while fleeing federal agents at the state-licensed Glass House Farms cannabis facility in Camarillo, Ventura county. Alanís García, who had been living and working in the US for about three decades to support his family in Michoacán, Mexico, climbed onto the roof in a desperate effort to get away from the masked ICE agents and national guard soldiers during the July raid, in which more than 300 people were detained. He suffered catastrophic injuries and was taken off life support after two days.

Trump and his anti-immigrant advisers have repeatedly claimed that the unprecedented resources and power being gifted to ICE is about removing “illegal criminals” off American streets.

Yet official government data shows that immigrants with no criminal record are now the largest group in US immigration detention. The number of people with no criminal history arrested by ICE and detained by the Trump administration has surpassed the number of those charged with crimes.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/093220ec316f230fe8c43b1ccba66334f9104f8c/846_0_5417_4335/master/5417.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3de615a66d27428a2a78dfa3e4869f62",N,,2025-10-25 18:16:43.571832

As such, the Government would need to immediately file notice of intent to transfer Petitioner to a long-term facility outside of Massachusetts.
As such, ICE respectfully requests this Court modify its Order to allow the relief requested by Petitioner - a return to an appropriate facility in New Jersey.
And, she continued, ICE should not be rewarded for disregarding ""the court's authority"" and the explicit order O'Toole signed to have her client returned to Massachusetts.
Here, Petitioner's habeas petition remains pending, and she continues to require communication and in-person access with Massachusetts counsel.","Yesterday, two days after a federal judge in Boston ordered ICE to ""immediately"" ship a woman it had stuck in a cell in a Texas prison back to Massachusetts, ICE asked if it could instead ship her to a prison in New Jersey - once it gets a cell cleared for her - acknowledging its ad-hoc prison in a Burlington office park is not designed for long-term imprisonment, what with its lack of medical facilities and a room for inmates to meet with their attorneys.

In a reply, Mirian Abarca Tixe's attorney asked what part of ""immediately"" ICE failed to understand, and asked US District Judge George O'Toole to step in, again, and get the Ecuadorean immigrant closer to her so that they can better prepare for her legal battle to be released altogether as she fights to stay in the US.

As of this afternoon, O'Toole had yet to respond.

In its request, filed around 5 p.m. on Friday, ICE's lawyers - at the US Attorney's office in Boston - noted that when ICE initially grabbed Abarca Tixe at what she thought was a routine check-in at Burlington on Aug. 21, they at first kept here there, then, with her lawyer's consent, shipped her to a prison in New Jersey because ICE doesn't have any facilities for long-term imprisonment of women in Massachusetts.

But that move was contingent on ICE agreeing to notify a Boston judge should she be moved again, only ICE then shipped her to Texas without telling a judge here - raising questions whether ICE was really serious about not interfering with the woman's legal battle, and making it difficult for her to get ""a fair and orderly consideration"" of her habeas-corpus request by shipping her 1,700 miles way, O'Toole wrote in a ruling Wednesday.

In his ruling, O'Toole said ICE not only had to get Abarca Tixe out of Texas, it had ""to immediately return the petitioner to a proper facility located within the District of Massachusetts.""

In its motion, filed around 5 p.m. on Friday, ICE attorneys asked O'Toole to modify his order to allow her to be sent no further north than New Jersey, which it said should be more than acceptable since Abarca Tixe's attorney had previously said that was OK, although her request was for either return to New Jersey ""or another mutually acceptable facility readily accessible to her current Massachusetts counsel.""

As grounds for this request, ICE contends that there is not a proper facility located within Massachusetts for to house Petitioner for more than a temporary period. ...

If Petitioner was transferred back to Massachusetts, Petitioner would be detained temporarily at the ICE field Office in Burlington which does not contain many of the accommodations needed to house and care for individuals for any extended period of detention and does not contain medical facilities or dedicated attorney client meeting space. As such, the Government would need to immediately file notice of intent to transfer Petitioner to a long-term facility outside of Massachusetts. As such, ICE respectfully requests this Court modify its Order to allow the relief requested by Petitioner - a return to an appropriate facility in New Jersey.

But in her reply, filed about an hour later, Abarca Tixe's attorney, Elizabeth Shaw of Boston, argued O'Toole made himself pretty clear in his order and that given the issue of Burlington's suitability as a prison had come up earlier in the case, he made no mistake when he specified Massachusetts.

The Court's October 22 Order was clear and unambiguous. Respondents' claim that Massachusetts lacks an “appropriate facility” simply repeats arguments already made and rejected in earlier filings. This Court has already considered the government's administrative concerns and determined that they do not override the Petitioner's rights or the Court's authority to enforce its orders. Motions for modification cannot serve as a vehicle to reargue matters that have been previously resolved. ...

She cited a 2009 appeals case in Boston that concluded judges ""should not reconsider prior decisions unless there is newly discovered evidence, an intervening change in law, or clear error.""

""None is present here,"" she wrote.

And, she continued, ICE should not be rewarded for disregarding ""the court's authority"" and the explicit order O'Toole signed to have her client returned to Massachusetts.

Now, Respondents once again seek to move Petitioner out of this District - despite a standing Order to the contrary. To grant this motion would not only endorse noncompliance but would erode this Court's ability to ensure meaningful judicial review of habeas proceedings. ...

The government's failure to act swiftly or to seek a stay pending resolution of its motion constitutes a waiver of its right to relief. This delay, coupled with prior noncompliance, further evidences bad faith and weighs heavily against any equitable modification.

And she wrote that O'Toole's order was a recognition that even bringing her back to part of the Northeast rather than to Massachusetts would still harm her legal efforts:

The Court's October 22 Order was expressly designed to protect Petitioner's access to her Massachusetts-based counsel. Relocating her to New Jersey would substantially interfere with that access - precisely the harm the Court sought to prevent.

She added that ""the Supreme Court has long recognized that meaningful access to counsel and to the courts is a fundamental right of detained persons"" and that federal judges in Boston have taken that into account in this year's immigration cases.

Here, Petitioner's habeas petition remains pending, and she continues to require communication and in-person access with Massachusetts counsel. Any transfer outside this District would directly impair those rights, violating both the letter and the spirit of this Court's prior orders.",https://www.universalhub.com/images/alogosmall2.png,N,,2025-10-25 21:01:28.445508

""Our officers are facing a surge in assaults against them as they put their lives on the line to arrest murderers, rapists and gang members.""

The five incidents that occurred on Wednesday included several incidents in which U.S. citizens are accused of threatening violence and taking other actions against immigration enforcement officers. According to DHS, Isabel Mata, a U.S. citizen, allegedly threatened a law enforcement officer after stating she would put a hit out on Border Patrol commander Chief Gregory Bovino. The department said it referred the incident to the FBI.

In another incident, three U.S. citizens, who DHS identified as Jacqueline Lopez, Eliana Bahena and Jonathan Uribe, allegedly tailed Border Patrol vehicles ""to draw attention to them."" DHS said that one driver attempted to ram a vehicle. All three drivers were taken into custody, according to DHS.

The third incident allegedly involved a member of the Latin Kings gang. DHS said that U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) was targeted by a U.S. citizen who was ""displaying an anti-ICE flag."" Alexis Correa, who DHS claimed was the driver and a member of the Latin Kings, allegedly followed agents for several miles before attempting to ram the vehicle. USBP was able to evade Correa, who then allegedly hit another civilian vehicle. DHS said Correa was arrested under 18 U.S. Code 111, which makes it a federal crime to forcibly assault, resist, oppose, impede, intimidate or interfere with certain federal officials.

Also on Wednesday, CBP Office of Field Operations (OFO) officers arrested a U.S. citizen, identified by DHS as Alexander Torres. He is accused of ""recklessly impeding operations and tailing government vehicles."" According to DHS, he ignored multiple commands from officers to stop and ""eventually boxed in government vehicles in an alleyway.""

DHS said that Correa and Torres had criminal records. According to the department, Correa's record includes convictions for unlawful possession of a firearm, destroying evidence and a DUI. Torres' record allegedly includes convictions for unlawful possession of a firearm by a gang member, DHS said.

In the fifth incident, USBP encountered three illegal immigrants from Mexico who DHS said were ""in violation of our nation's immigration laws.""

The illegal immigrants allegedly refused to comply with agents' verbal commands to exit their vehicle. The driver, who DHS identified as Jose Mauricio Rosas-Hernandez, allegedly ""reversed into a government vehicle and scraped another USBP unit."" DHS said that one agent was struck in the knee while chasing the suspects on foot. According to DHS, the three illegal immigrants were taken into Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody.

Democrats say any state funding directed to direct benefits would be supplemental to SNAP but not considered formal benefits.
The refusal to tap the contingency fund to pay benefits, however, is another story.
And SNAP supporters — advocate groups and Democrats, alike — have argued for weeks that any effort by the administration to withhold contingency funds would be illegal.
Those accusations only escalated Friday night after the news of the USDA memo surfaced.","Top House Democrats tore into the Trump administration on Friday night for withholding available food aid for millions of low-income Americans, saying the decision is both callous and illegal.

“It is a disgusting dereliction of duty that the Trump administration would knowingly rip food out of the mouths of 42 million children, seniors and veterans,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said in a statement.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is sitting on more than $5 billion in a contingency fund earmarked by Congress to fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in emergencies. But the department says it won’t use those funds to cover benefits if the government shutdown extends beyond Oct. 31, according to multiple news reports.

In a memo, first reported by Axios, the USDA said the reason is simple: The contingency fund was designed to respond to emergencies, like natural disasters, and the current shutdown doesn’t qualify because it was manufactured by Democrats. To spend the money on SNAP benefits during such an event, the USDA said, would be illegal.

“[T]he contingency fund is a source of funds for contingencies, such as the Disaster SNAP program, which provides food purchasing benefits for individuals in disaster areas, including natural disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods, that can come on quickly and without notice,” the memo reads.

The memo contradicts the shutdown plan posted by USDA earlier in the year, which stated that “Congressional intent is evident that SNAP’s operation should continue since the program has been provided with multi-year contingency funds that can be used for State Administrative Expenses to ensure that the State can also continue operations during a Federal Government shutdown.”

The plan has since been deleted.

The new policy also stipulates that the USDA will not reimburse states that seek to fill the void with their own funding for food aid during the shutdown.

“There is no provision or allowance under current law for States to cover the cost of benefits and be reimbursed,” the memo says.

The reimbursement policy is not controversial. Democrats say any state funding directed to direct benefits would be supplemental to SNAP but not considered formal benefits.

The refusal to tap the contingency fund to pay benefits, however, is another story. And SNAP supporters — advocate groups and Democrats, alike — have argued for weeks that any effort by the administration to withhold contingency funds would be illegal.

Those accusations only escalated Friday night after the news of the USDA memo surfaced.

In a joint statement, Reps. Rosa DeLauro (Conn.), the senior Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, and Angie Craig (Minn.), the ranking member of the Agriculture Committee, said the policy is not only a violation of the law, but a “cruel” attack on poor Americans.

“This is perhaps the most cruel and unlawful offense the Trump administration has perpetrated yet — freezing funding already enacted into law to feed hungry Americans while he shovels tens of billions of dollars out the door to Argentina and into his ballroom,” the pair said in a statement.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/jeffrieshakeem_102425gn07_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-25 17:56:45.467601

NCLA believes the Supreme Court must adopt the view of the V.O.S.
ABOUT NCLA NCLA is a nonpartisan, nonprofit civil rights group founded by prominent legal scholar Philip Hamburger to protect constitutional freedoms from violations by the Administrative State.","Washington, DC, Oct. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The New Civil Liberties Alliance, on behalf of itself and its clients in two pending lawsuits against the emergency tariffs, filed an amici curiae brief today at the U.S. Supreme Court in the consolidated Learning Resources v. Trump and Trump v. V.O.S. Selections tariff cases. NCLA urges the Justices to rule that President Trump’s orders imposing tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) are unlawful, because the text of that law does not authorize any tariffs.

As NCLA has argued since filing Simplified v. Trump—the first lawsuit ever brought against the IEEPA emergency tariff orders—IEEPA never mentions tariffs, so it cannot authorize the President to enact them in declared emergencies. NCLA represents Simplified, Kilo Brava, Bambola, Rokland, FIREDISC, and the Game Manufacturers Association on the amici brief, which are NCLA’s clients in Simplified and the similar FIREDISC v. Trump lawsuit. NCLA’s brief specifically asks the Court to reject the Government’s dangerous and absurd argument that “… regulate … importation or exportation of … property …” means “tariff.”

The President does not possess any inherent executive authority to impose tariffs unilaterally. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in V.O.S. Selections that IEEPA does not authorize the specific tariffs President Trump has levied. A concurrence in that case held that all such tariffs are unlawful, and the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia had reached the same conclusion earlier in Learning Resources. NCLA believes the Supreme Court must adopt the view of the V.O.S. Selections concurrence and the Learning Resources ruling, determining that IEEPA does not give the President power to issue unilateral tariffs on Americans. The Justices should also rule that federal district courts have jurisdiction to hear these cases, since IEEPA is not a tariff statute.

NCLA released the following statements:

“The Supreme Court should rule that the President lacks the authority to order emergency tariffs of any kind—a ruling that will restore Congress’s control over tariffs and discourage future presidential overreach.”

— Andrew Morris, Senior Litigation Counsel, NCLA

“Congress didn’t give the President tariff power under IEEPA. The Supreme Court can preserve the proper place of separation of powers by saying so.”

— John Vecchione, Senior Litigation Counsel, NCLA

“If, as the Government has requested, the Supreme Court decides that the word ‘regulate’ means ‘tariff,’ it would open a Pandora’s Box of mischief. Doing so would unleash bureaucrats throughout the Administrative State to find other laws containing the word ‘regulate’ that would let them tax Americans.”

— Mark Chenoweth, President, NCLA

He was returned to the U.S. in June after the U.S. Supreme Court said the administration had to work to bring him back.
It concludes that Abrego Garcia could be deported as soon as Oct. 31.
These actions are punitive, cruel, and unconstitutional.” Abrego Garcia has an American wife and child and lived in Maryland for years, but he immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager.
In a separate action in immigration court, Abrego Garcia has applied for asylum in the United States.","The U.S. government plans to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Liberia, and could do so as early as Oct. 31, according to a Friday court filing.

The Salvadoran national's case has become a magnet for opposition to President Donald Trump’s immigration policies since he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, in violation of a settlement agreement. He was returned to the U.S. in June after the U.S. Supreme Court said the administration had to work to bring him back. Since he cannot be re-deported to El Salvador, ICE has been seeking to deport him to a series of African countries.

Meanwhile, a federal judge in Maryland has previously barred his immediate deportation. Abrego Garcia's lawsuit there claims the Trump administration is illegally using the deportation process to punish him for the embarrassment of his earlier mistaken deportation.

A Friday court filing from the Department of Homeland Security notes that “Liberia is a thriving democracy and one of the United States’s closest partners on the African continent.” Its national language is English; its constitution “provides robust protections for human rights;” and Liberia is “committed to the humane treatment of refugees,” the filing reads. It concludes that Abrego Garcia could be deported as soon as Oct. 31.

“After failed attempts with Uganda, Eswatini, and Ghana, ICE now seeks to deport our client, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, to Liberia, a country with which he has no connection, thousands of miles from his family and home in Maryland,” a statement from attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg reads. “Costa Rica stands ready to accept him as a refugee, a viable and lawful option. Yet the government has chosen a course calculated to inflict maximum hardship. These actions are punitive, cruel, and unconstitutional.”

Abrego Garcia has an American wife and child and lived in Maryland for years, but he immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to El Salvador, where he faces a “well-founded fear” of violence from a gang that targeted his family, according to court filings. In a separate action in immigration court, Abrego Garcia has applied for asylum in the United States.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/Abrego_Garcia_AP_25249595037449_NAT_0906,N,,2025-10-25 16:01:11.085622
,Agencies,2025-10-25 18:30:19+00:00,The Verge,ICE is building a social media panopticon - The Verge,Emma Roth,,,,,https://www.theverge.com/policy/806425/ice-social-media-surveillance-free-speech-assault,"The “real-time intelligence” platform is capable of ingesting and analyzing vast amounts of publicly available data, like social media posts, according to its website.
But with billions of dollars in funding, ICE has the budget to employ an array of social media monitoring tools that could lead to arrests and deportations across the country.
“With billions of dollars to spend on spyware, it’s extremely alarming to think how far ICE will go in surveilling social media,” Owen says.
The Trump administration’s social media surveillance plans extend beyond ICE, with Citizenship and Immigration Services proposing an initiative that would require people applying for US citizenship or personal residency to provide their social media account handles.
The US government has already started trawling social media for posts that don’t align with the Trump administration’s viewpoints.","As Immigration and Customs Enforcement carries out raids across the country, the agency is working rapidly to expand an online surveillance system that could potentially track millions of users on the web. Federal records uncovered by The Lever reveal that ICE is paying $5.7 million to use an AI-powered social media monitoring platform called Zignal Labs, something Will Owen, the communications director at the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (STOP), calls an “assault” on democracy and free speech.

The “real-time intelligence” platform is capable of ingesting and analyzing vast amounts of publicly available data, like social media posts, according to its website. In a pamphlet shared by The Lever, Zignal Labs says it uses machine learning, computer vision, and optical character recognition to analyze more than 8 billion posts per day in over 100 languages. This allows it to process and sort data into “curated detection feeds” that ICE could use to flag individuals for deportation.

The pamphlet highlights Zignal’s ability to capture geolocated images and videos while providing alerts and information to “operators.” One example states that Zignal Labs used its technology to analyze a Telegram video showing “the precise location of an ongoing operation in Gaza.” The company says its tool identified emblems and patches to “confirm the operators involved,” allowing it to notify operators on the ground. That means ICE could potentially trace someone’s location based on the location attached to a video posted on TikTok, or even a picture on Facebook.

ICE procured the contract with Zignal Labs through Carahsoft, a firm that deploys IT solutions for government agencies. Zignal Labs most recently partnered with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to analyze weather events from public and online media sources. It also inked a contract with the US Secret Service in 2019 and works with the Department of Defense and Department of Transportation, according to The Lever. The Verge reached out to Zignal Labs with a request for more information about its contract with ICE but didn’t immediately hear back.

Surveillance on social media isn’t anything new. In 2016, the American Civil Liberties Union found that police were using a CIA-backed tool called Geofeedia to track protesters of police brutality across Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. But with billions of dollars in funding, ICE has the budget to employ an array of social media monitoring tools that could lead to arrests and deportations across the country.

“With billions of dollars to spend on spyware, it’s extremely alarming to think how far ICE will go in surveilling social media,” Owen says. “ICE is a lawless agency that will use AI-driven social media monitoring not only to terrorize immigrant families, but also to target activists fighting back against their abuses. This is an assault on our democracy and right to free speech, powered by the algorithm and paid for with our tax dollars.”

“The scale of this spying is matched by an equally massive chilling effect on free speech.”

Earlier this month, a report from Wired revealed that ICE plans to hire almost 30 workers to comb through content on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, X, YouTube, and other social platforms to “locate individuals who pose a danger to national security, public safety, and/or otherwise meet ICE’s law enforcement mission.”

A document seen by Wired shows that ICE is requesting information from contractors who could help the agency carry out the initiative, which may even require workers to search for data about a target’s family members, friends, or coworkers to pinpoint their whereabouts for ICE officers. The document notes that ICE would place around 12 contractors in a monitoring facility in Vermont, while 16 staff members would work in California, with some required to be available “at all times.”

David Greene, civil liberties director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, tells The Verge that automated and AI-powered monitoring tools will give the government the ability to “monitor social media for viewpoints it doesn’t like on a scale that was never possible with human review alone.” Greene adds, “The scale of this spying is matched by an equally massive chilling effect on free speech.”

Outside social media, 404 Media reports that ICE has tapped into license plate-scanning security cameras, as well as gained access to a tool that tracks the movement of millions of phones.

The Trump administration’s social media surveillance plans extend beyond ICE, with Citizenship and Immigration Services proposing an initiative that would require people applying for US citizenship or personal residency to provide their social media account handles. In 2019, the State Department began requiring some visa applicants to list their social media handles on sites they’ve used within the past year, but the agency expanded it to include more kinds of nonimmigrant visas in June.

The US government has already started trawling social media for posts that don’t align with the Trump administration’s viewpoints. In March, it began an AI-powered “Catch and Revoke” initiative to track down posts from student visa holders that appear to be in support of Hamas or other designated terror organizations. The State Department also announced earlier this month that it revoked the visas of six people who the US claimed “celebrated” the shooting of right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk. This week, ICE arrested nine street vendors on New York City’s Canal Street shortly after a conservative influencer tagged ICE in a post showing vendors in the area.

But now, with a powerful AI social media monitoring tool in the hands of ICE, the agency won’t need influencers to flag individuals for deportation — and it will only get riskier to speak freely on the internet.

“This is another example of Big Tech CEOs partnering with an increasingly authoritarian federal government as part of Trump’s ongoing attempts to clamp down on free speech,” Sacha Haworth, executive director of the Tech Oversight Project, tells The Verge. “This should terrify and anger every American.”",https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/STK471_Government_Surveillance_CVirginia_B-1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-10-25 16:01:24.368431

It’s the latest move in the agency’s ongoing quest to build out a social media surveillance dragnet.
Last week, a group of labor unions sued over the federal government’s growing use of social media surveillance to target immigrants for their political speech, calling it a “mass, viewpoint-driven surveillance program.” And there are indications that ICE intends to further expand its social media surveillance capabilities.
As Wired reported earlier this month, ICE has plans to develop a round-the-clock social media monitoring team to identify leads for immigration enforcers.
“We’ve been seeing an uptick in ICE surveillance contracts,” said Julie Mao, an attorney with Just Futures Law, a legal advocacy group that closely monitors ICE’s surveillance regime.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement has inked a new $5.7 million contract for AI-driven social media surveillance software, according to federal procurement records reviewed by The Lever. It’s the latest move in the agency’s ongoing quest to build out a social media surveillance dragnet.

The five-year contract with government technology middleman Carahsoft Technology, made public in September, provides Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) licenses for a product called Zignal Labs, a social media monitoring platform used by the Israeli military and the Pentagon.

An informational pamphlet marked confidential but publicly available online advertises that Zignal Labs “leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning” to analyze over 8 billion social media posts per day, providing “curated detection feeds” for its clients. The information, the company says, allows law enforcement to “detect and respond to threats with greater clarity and speed.”

The Department of Homeland Security, ICE’s parent agency, has in the past procured Zignal licenses for the U.S. Secret Service, signing its first contract for the software in 2019. The company also has contracts with the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation.

But the September notice appears to be the first indication that ICE has access to the platform. The licenses will be provided to Homeland Security Investigations, ICE’s intelligence unit, to provide “real-time data analysis for criminal investigations,” per the disclosure.

Zignal joins ICE’s growing arsenal of social media surveillance tools, many of which employ artificial intelligence to generate leads and identify “threats” from vast quantities of online data. These tools pose a particular threat as ICE, under the Trump administration, appears to be increasingly using social media to direct its immigration enforcement strategy.

Several pro-Palestinian activists, including Mahmoud Khalil, were targeted and jailed by immigration authorities after being doxed online by right-wing, pro-Israel blacklist websites like Canary Mission. Just this week, immigration agents raided street vendors in New York City after a right-wing influencer posted a video of the block online, demanding action by authorities.

Last week, a group of labor unions sued over the federal government’s growing use of social media surveillance to target immigrants for their political speech, calling it a “mass, viewpoint-driven surveillance program.”

And there are indications that ICE intends to further expand its social media surveillance capabilities. As Wired reported earlier this month, ICE has plans to develop a round-the-clock social media monitoring team to identify leads for immigration enforcers.

Advocates told The Lever that ICE’s purchase of Zignal Labs licenses, like its other uses of digital surveillance tech, raises civil liberty concerns.

“[The Department of Homeland Security] should not be buying surveillance tools that scrape our social media posts off the internet and then use AI to scrutinize our online speech,” said Patrick Toomey, the deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Security Project. “And agencies certainly shouldn’t be deploying this kind of black box technology in secret without any accountability.”

“Tactical Intelligence” to Israel and the Pentagon

Zignal Labs, founded in Silicon Valley in 2011, initially catered to public relations firms and political campaigns, advertising data analytics and media monitoring to help identify and respond to narrative trends online.

But like the many private companies that now provide digital surveillance tools to the federal government, Zignal Labs soon moved into the defense and intelligence industries, formally announcing the new focus, along with a “public sector advisory board” staffed by industry veterans, in 2021. One Zignal pamphlet from this year advertises the company’s work with the Israeli military, saying its data analytics platform provides “tactical intelligence” to “operators on the ground” in Gaza. The pamphlet also highlights Zignal’s work with the U.S. Marines and the State Department.

Zignal Labs did not return a request for comment about its work with Israeli forces or its new contract with ICE.

The unions’ lawsuit over the Trump administration’s use of social media surveillance details the myriad digital surveillance tools that ICE already has at its disposal, including ShadowDragon, a software that uses publicly available websites to map out an individual’s online activity, and Babel X, which links social media profiles and location information to a target’s Social Security number.

“We’ve been seeing an uptick in ICE surveillance contracts,” said Julie Mao, an attorney with Just Futures Law, a legal advocacy group that closely monitors ICE’s surveillance regime.

This week, ICE signed a $7 million contract with the firm SOS International LLC, for “skip tracing services,” a term that refers to tracking a person’s whereabouts, per federal procurement records reviewed by The Lever. The multimillion-dollar contract comes just three months after SOS International LLC, which also does business as SOSi, announced that the company had hired Andre Watson, an ICE Homeland Security Investigations intelligence chief, to “expand [the company’s] business and deliver capabilities to state and federal law enforcement agencies.”

Many of these services tout that their surveillance capabilities are enhanced by artificial intelligence, including Zignal. In a July post announcing the latter company’s partnership with Carahsoft Technology, Zignal’s CEO boasted that the latest iteration of the software used AI to scour global digital data, “helping defense and intelligence teams detect and respond to threats with greater clarity and speed.” Two months after this announcement, ICE signed its new contract with Carahsoft for Zignal licenses.

ICE’s use of AI to surveil vast swathes of the internet in real time presents serious privacy and free speech concerns, the labor unions argued in their lawsuit against the Trump administration.

“The government’s utilization of AI and automated tools for viewpoint-driven online surveillance gives teeth to its threat to surveil ‘everyone’ online for disfavored expression,” attorneys with the civil liberties group the Electronic Freedom Foundation and Yale Law School’s Media Freedom and Information Access Clinic wrote in the complaint, saying that such tools “exacerbate the chilling impact of that surveillance.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2241666955-1536x1024.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 16:01:15.288348

Kristi Noem on immigration enforcement in Minnesota

What we know:

In the press conference, Noem gave details on recent arrests made by Immigration Control and Enforcement (ICE) in Minnesota.

According to Noem, the individuals were arrested for either homicide, human trafficking or sexual assault.

Noem praised the work of USCIS in the state, who, under operation ""Twin Shield"", has been investigating visa fraud in Minnesota.

At the press conference, Noem condemned ""violent protests, violent attacks, riots and attacks on law enforcement,"" and is encouraging Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey to have a partnership with DHS law enforcement.

Noem said that it is up to the President if the National Guard will be deployed here, but did say there would be an ""increase"" in federal officers coming.

""It's up to the President on if he believes the National Guard should be deployed to any situation to any city across our country,"" Noem said at the press conference. ""But we do have an increase of federal officers that will be coming. As you know, we had a big bill passed through Congress that allocated 10,000 new ICE officers across the country.""

Noem said Minnesota will see ""dozens"" of new agents and federal officers.

Trump Administration and Minnesota

Local perspective:

Earlier this month, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz raised the possibility of the Trump Administration deploying federal troops to Minnesota, like the administration has in Chicago.

""I think it makes — it would be logical for them to come here. We fall into exactly what it looks like they’re trying to target — blue cities in places that he wants to make an impact. You can certainly chill voting in states like Minnesota if you target Minneapolis and St. Paul,"" Walz said at an event with Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker hosted by the Star Tribune.

Walz said his administration has been preparing for the possibility of troop deployments in Minnesota since last year.

Immigration crackdowns nationwide

Dig deeper:

The Trump Administration deployed National Guard members to Illinois earlier this month as the administration ramped up immigration enforcement in Chicago. President Trump has also repeatedly criticized Chicago and asserted that crime in that city is out of control.

Trump was also set to deploy federal agents to San Francisco this week to quell crime, but backed off this plan after talking to the mayor.

Minneapolis and St. Paul's mayors respond to Noem's visit

Local perspective:

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, along with city leaders, recorded a message on the city's stance on immigration, ahead of the press conference with Noem.

The message can be watched in full above, but Frey stated the city is committed to upholding its Separation Ordinance, which ensures that city employees, including police and firefighters, are not allowed to participate in civil immigration enforcement.

""Minneapolis doesn’t flinch when it comes to our values,"" said Frey. ""We stand with our immigrant neighbors — not just in words, but in the laws we’ve passed, the policies we enforce, and the way we show up for each other every day.""

St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter shared the following statement regarding Noem's presence in the Twin Cities:

""We're aware federal employees, including ICE and border patrol agents, are converging in the Twin Cities ahead of Kristi Noem's speech today in Minneapolis. Though we aren't aware of planned enforcement activity, I understand and share concerns about what this could signal.

""Remember you have rights. We encourage everyone to review the following information for what to do if you are stopped by federal law enforcement, how to safely and legally document proceedings in progress, and who to call for legal assistance.

""As a reminder, Saint Paul police officers will always identify themselves. They wear clearly marked SPPD uniforms, display their badges, and, when relevant, produce a warrant. Our officers will help de-escalate situations when possible. And they do not wear face coverings.""

Community leaders gather in protest of Noem's visit

The other side:

The People's Action Coalition Against Trump gathered to protest Noem's visit to the Twin Cities. The group is rallying against having a larger ICE presence and the National Guard being sent to the state.

(WAVY) — Officials have identified the man who died Thursday morning after being struck by a vehicle while fleeing from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Interstate 264 in Norfolk.

According to Virginia State Police, the incident happened just after 11 a.m. on I-264 eastbound near the Military Highway interchange. Troopers said a man exited his vehicle and tried to cross the interstate during a pursuit with ICE officers when he was struck by a 2002 Ford pickup truck and pronounced dead at the scene.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson identified the man as Jose Castro-Rivera of Honduras. The spokesperson called the incident “tragic,” adding it “could have been prevented had Castro-Rivera complied with our officers.” The spokesperson also said ICE officers had determined the people in the vehicle were in the United States illegally, which led to them “detaining the occupants of the targeted vehicle.”

Community leaders close to Castro-Rivera tell 10 On Your Side he was 24-years-old.

In a follow-up statement, ICE said Castro-Rivera “resisted heavily” and that “the death of this illegal alien is a direct result of every politician, activist and reporter who continue to spread propaganda and misinformation about ICE’s mission.”

The agency said the vehicle stop was “part of a targeted, intelligence-based immigration enforcement operation.”

Immigration attorney Andrew Reigel of Virginia Beach criticized that statement, saying it unfairly places blame on the victim.

“They’re making the unfortunate deceased person the bad guy here,” Reigel said. “He was probably fearful for his life, and in that moment thought maybe this was a safer option, … which should tell you quite a bit about the situation.”

Reigel said ICE’s current enforcement practices differ from those under previous administrations.

“Previous administrations had focused on immigrants with criminal records, knowing resources are limited,” he said. “Now, just simply being here, paying taxes and working isn’t enough. … People are being detained and placed in facilities comparable to jails.”

Patricia Bracknell, founder and CEO of the Chamber for Hispanic Progress, said her organization is working directly with Castro-Rivera’s family to provide assistance.

“They have been very involved since this morning,” Bracknell said. “The Honduran consulate in Washington, D.C., has agreed to pay for his body to be sent back to Honduras and help the family through the paperwork process.”

Bracknell said local community members have also launched a fundraising effort to support the family.

She added that while the group is not opposed to immigration enforcement, they are concerned about what they describe as aggressive and unjust tactics.

“We’re seeing normal residents… people who live in our communities and are working, … being picked up and disappearing,” Bracknell said. “There’s no due process. What we are not supportive of are the tactics.”

Bracknell questioned whether racial profiling played a role in recent immigration stops.

“This particular case raises that question,” she said. “They’re driving while Latino… is racial profiling an issue now? I’m a U.S. citizen, but I look Latina.”

Reigel said he’s heard similar reports.

“What we’ve seen earlier this year is that ICE was targeting work trucks, … anything that appeared to be a white work truck with Hispanic passengers,” he said.",https://www.wavy.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/snapshot-2025-10-24T204733.870.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-25 14:56:54.611829

The NYCLU and The Door filed an emergency lawsuit after the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained the Bronx high school junior identified in court papers only as “EJCC.”

After being released to his brother in Maryland, he was later detained again and is now held in Pennsylvania.

In a court filing, federal officials said Liberia has agreed to accept Abrego Garcia and described the country as “a thriving democracy and one of the United States’s closest partners on the African continent.”

The filing added that Liberia’s Constitution, modeled in part on the US Constitution, “provides robust protections for human rights” and that the country is “committed to the humane treatment of refugees.”

Officials said they have received diplomatic assurances regarding Abrego Garcia’s treatment in Liberia and are making arrangements to carry out the removal, which could take place as soon as Oct. 31.",https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2025/10/25/thumbs_b_c_134bfa03230f84bbbc2b7280f1e348dc.jpg?v=083843,N,,2025-10-25 16:57:08.570682

The Salvadoran national’s case has become a magnet for opposition to President Donald Trump’s immigration policies since he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, in violation of a settlement agreement. He was returned to the U.S. in June after the U.S. Supreme Court said the administration had to work to bring him back. Since he cannot be re-deported to El Salvador, ICE has been seeking to deport him to a series of African countries.

Meanwhile, a federal judge in Maryland has previously barred his immediate deportation. Abrego Garcia’s lawsuit there claims the Trump administration is illegally using the deportation process to punish him for the embarrassment of his earlier mistaken deportation.

A Friday court filing from the Department of Homeland Security notes that “Liberia is a thriving democracy and one of the United States’s closest partners on the African continent.” Its national language is English; its constitution “provides robust protections for human rights;” and Liberia is “committed to the humane treatment of refugees,” the filing reads. It concludes that Abrego Garcia could be deported as soon as Oct. 31.

“After failed attempts with Uganda, Eswatini, and Ghana, ICE now seeks to deport our client, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, to Liberia, a country with which he has no connection, thousands of miles from his family and home in Maryland,” a statement from attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg reads. “Costa Rica stands ready to accept him as a refugee, a viable and lawful option. Yet the government has chosen a course calculated to inflict maximum hardship. These actions are punitive, cruel, and unconstitutional.”

Abrego Garcia has an American wife and child and lived in Maryland for years, but he immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to El Salvador, where he faces a “well-founded fear” of violence from a gang that targeted his family, according to court filings. In a separate action in immigration court, Abrego Garcia has applied for asylum in the United States.

Additionally, Abrego Garcia is facing criminal charges in federal court in Tennessee, where he has pleaded not guilty to human smuggling.

Tim Walz will not.

Noem addressed the room behind a table piled with zip-tied firearms and several plastic bags of methamphetamine, said to be seized from operations conducted by the agencies. Alongside her stood two signs: both mugshots of men, which read “Arrested: Mexican Child Sexual Assault,” and another read “Arrested: Salvadorian Human Trafficker.”

Outside of the building, almost a thousand protestors gathered to chant and deliver speeches. After the conference concluded at around 5:30 p.m., most protesters left with a few remaining for follow-on protests.

Drew Harmon, with the group MN50501, said he has a personal grudge against Noem because of how she leads ICE agents and security in the country.

“Kristi Noem is the mouthpiece in the face of that movement right now,” Harmon said. “She is not just perpetuating it. She’s also enabling it by being a ‘yes’ woman for Donald Trump.”

He added that people will be ready if the National Guard, alongside ICE agents, sets foot in Minneapolis.

“They have it out for Minnesota. They have it out for the Twin Cities,” Harmon said.

In her address, Noem thanked local leaders such as Sam Westbay with Homeland Security Investigations in St. Paul and Regional Enforcement Removal Operations director David Easterwood for their work deporting immigrants in Minnesota.

Noem said in her address that Mayor Jacob Frey has allowed more criminals to “get away” with their crimes. She added that violence against police officers has increased by “1000%” due to them being “demonized” by leaders in Washington, D.C.

“If you get the chance today, thank someone who defends our laws,” Noem said.

Noem mentioned Operation Twin Shield, an operation between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which worked specifically with visa fraud, which she said has been “rampant in these cities.”

“The fraud operation that has gone out and investigated those who maybe came into this country under wrong paperwork or overstayed and refused to leave, and they utilized fraud to do so,” Noem said.

Noem added that dozens of agents will be coming to field offices in the region. There are USCIS field offices in both Minneapolis and St. Paul.

“If you’re here illegally, go home,” Noem said in her address.

She added that around 1.6 million have supposedly self-deported or been detained, then deported. If people choose to leave, Noem said the federal government will give them $1000 to buy their plane ticket to return to their home country.

“Those who break the law face the consequences of that and get removed from the country,” Noem said.

Numerous Minneapolis city leaders reaffirmed their stance on the city’s values and separation ordinance, which prohibits all city employees, such as police and firefighters, from participating in ICE activities.

Frey said in a press release that he will continue to support the city’s ongoing commitments to keep neighborhoods safe, ensuring residents are informed about their rights and supporting immigrants within the city.

“Minneapolis doesn’t flinch when it comes to our values,” said Frey in the statement. “We stand with our immigrant neighbors — not just in words, but in the laws we’ve passed, the policies we enforce, and the way we show up for each other every day.”

In a video standing alongside city leaders, Frey explained that under the separation ordinance, people can access city programs and emergency services regardless of immigration status.

“Immigration raids don’t make us safer. It makes people afraid to call for help. It keeps families from reporting crimes, working with trusted law enforcement, and seeking support,” Frey said in the video. “That’s not safety. That’s fear. ”

Council Member Robin Wonsley (Ward 2) said in an email statement that many “still recall the trauma” of Walz’s deployment of the National Guard in 2020 due to riots following the murder of George Floyd.

“Seeing troops in our streets again would reopen deep wounds, but Minneapolis’s working-class communities have always cared for one another in the face of state violence,” Wonsley said in the statement. “Immigrants are our friends, neighbors, and coworkers—and we will organize to protect them and all who are vulnerable.”

Mayor candidate and Sen. Omar Fateh (DFL-Minneapolis) said in an email statement that Noem was here to encourage ICE agents’ operations and that the White House “has its sights set on Minneapolis.” He added that this is because the city stands by people’s rights and democracy.

“If Trump tries to send troops here, and re-traumatizes our residents who lived through 2020, they’re going to have to go through us first,” Fateh said in the statement.",https://mndaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-24-at-6.38.15-PM.png,N,,2025-10-25 16:57:16.618081

Lawsuits challenging the administration’s sweeps in Los Angeles and elsewhere are making their way through the courts.
But after an emergency appeal by the Trump administration, the Supreme Court reversed the judge in Los Angeles.
Before the Vasquez Perdomo decision, the court’s most influential ruling on immigration stops involved an American named Felix Humberto Brignoni-Ponce.
“So it’s not surprising that for years, you’ve heard the Latino community complaining, not unreasonably, that immigration stops are based on race.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.","Again and again in Chicago and elsewhere in recent weeks, masked federal agents have accosted people who appear to be Latino and have confronted them with questions about their immigration status.

Targeting people for immigration enforcement based on race or ethnicity alone was forbidden by the U.S. Supreme Court in a unanimous decision 50 years ago. After all, it’s impossible to determine the immigration statuses of people simply by looking at them. So for decades, agents seeking to question people about their citizenship were supposed to rely on more than just appearance.

But as President Donald Trump has intensified his mass deportation campaign, roving patrols that have targeted predominantly Latino communities have become a key part of the administration’s playbook. And whether the tactics are legal appears to be an open question, one likely to be decided by the Supreme Court.

Lawsuits challenging the administration’s sweeps in Los Angeles and elsewhere are making their way through the courts. The outcomes could redefine the limits on the discretion officers have to stop, question and detain people over their immigration statuses and how much race and ethnicity can play into those decisions.

“We are in nebulous land,” said Mark Fleming, a lawyer at the National Immigrant Justice Center, which is representing plaintiffs in Chicago. “We have never seen this type of enforcement on the streets ever.”

Last month, in an emergency ruling in the Los Angeles suit, the Supreme Court said federal agents there could question people about their immigration statuses based solely on factors such as race or ethnicity or another spoken language or accented English.

The decision isn’t final, as it overturned the temporary prohibition imposed by a federal judge on officers while she hears arguments on the case. But like many of the justices’ emergency decisions since the start of the new administration, the ruling appeared to signal substantial deference to the executive branch under Trump and the possibility that the court would ultimately side with him should it eventually issue an opinion on the case.

It is one of four legal challenges nationwide aiming to curb the warrantless arrests and traffic stops that have become a defining element of the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign.

But even as the lawyers mounting the challenges are hoping to affirm constitutional limits on such immigration stops and apprehensions, experts warn that the lawsuits could end up further emboldening officers to use race or ethnicity in immigration enforcement.

Thomas Coffin was part of the government legal team in the case that led to the 1975 Supreme Court ruling that race could not be the sole factor in immigration stops. Although he and his colleagues lost the case, Coffin, now 80, said the decision and others had established crucial rights to privacy. But whether they govern the federal agents conducting sweeps on America’s streets today is, he said, “the $64,000 question.”

During the mass deportation campaign, Latinos have been stopped while driving gardening and landscaping trucks. They have been questioned and detained at bus stops and street corners where laborers gather to wait for work. They have been rounded up at farms, car washes and construction sites.

José Escobar Molina, 47, who had a temporary form of legal status for immigrants from El Salvador, said he was walking up to his work truck outside his apartment building in Washington, D.C., in August when he was confronted by agents, according to the lawsuit filed in Washington. Without asking for his name, identification or immigration status, the agents handcuffed him and drove him to a holding facility in Virginia, where he was forced to spend the night, he said in a declaration filed in court. When he was released a day later, an ICE agent apologized to him three times for the ordeal, Escobar Molina said.

In Chicago, where ICE tactics have escalated in recent weeks, lawyers say they have identified dozens of arrests that have violated a 2022 consent decree that covered six Midwestern states. The order — stemming from a 2018 class-action lawsuit that immigrant and civil rights groups filed against the first Trump administration on behalf of five immigrants — restricted federal immigration agents from apprehending and holding people without a warrant.

In court filings, government lawyers have asserted that federal agents are trained in the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits “unreasonable searches and seizures,” and that they should not be hobbled in their efforts to target immigrants lacking legal status.

Civil and immigrant rights groups have said the dragnets in different cities have violated the Constitution: Federal agents routinely approach people with brown skin or whom they perceive to be Latinos or immigrants. The agents ask who the people are and where they are from. If people refuse to answer or attempt to leave, they are held or handcuffed and sometimes subdued.

In the Los Angeles case, the lead plaintiff is a man named Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, one of several day laborers arrested at bus stops over the summer. Lawyers for the laborers say that federal agents are stopping Latino workers en masse without having reasonable suspicion or being able to articulate a legal basis for believing that the people being questioned are in the country illegally.

The legal challenges in Chicago and Washington, D.C., say federal officers are detaining and arresting people without meeting an even higher legal standard of having “probable cause” to suspect that a person is in the country illegally.

A fourth class-action case challenging both stops and arrests was filed in Mobile, Alabama, on behalf of Leonardo Garcia Venegas, a Latino construction worker and U.S. citizen born in Florida who was held by immigration officials on two occasions this year.

The judge in the Los Angeles case issued an injunction prohibiting federal agents in that part of California from conducting stops based on perceived race or ethnicity, or other factors, such as spoken Spanish or accented English.

But after an emergency appeal by the Trump administration, the Supreme Court reversed the judge in Los Angeles. In a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said the injunction would “substantially hamper” efforts to enforce immigration laws in the Los Angeles area. He wrote that agents needed to be able to rely on their training and experience in “determining whether reasonable suspicion exists.”

In a dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that the court’s decision eroded freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution. “We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job,” she said.

Before the Vasquez Perdomo decision, the court’s most influential ruling on immigration stops involved an American named Felix Humberto Brignoni-Ponce.

On an evening in March 1973, Border Patrol agents who were staked out on an interstate highway between San Diego and Los Angeles stopped Brignoni-Ponce’s car because its occupants appeared to the agents to be of Mexican descent.

Upon discovering that two passengers did not have legal status, the federal agents arrested everyone and charged Brignoni-Ponce, a Marine Corps veteran and U.S. citizen of Puerto Rican ancestry, with knowingly transporting immigrants lacking legal status. But in a ruling two years later, the Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision throwing out the conviction, finding that officers could rely on “Mexican appearance” as a factor — but not the sole factor — in deciding to stop and question people about their citizenship.

To some critics of racial profiling, the decision seemed like a victory. But the ruling came to be seen by some experts as enabling racial profiling by allowing “Mexican appearance” to be a factor at all.

“Since race can be one factor, in the exercise of discretion, it can become the dominant factor in an immigration stop,” said Kevin R. Johnson, the former dean of the School of Law at the University of California, Davis. “So it’s not surprising that for years, you’ve heard the Latino community complaining, not unreasonably, that immigration stops are based on race.”

In Torres v. Rubio, No. 24-40685 (5th Cir. Oct. 21, 2025) (unpublished), the Fifth Circuit affirmed a bench-trial judgment denying a declaratory judgment of birthright citizenship under 8 U.S.C. § 1503(a). The case arose after the State Department refused to issue a passport to Juan Manuel Torres, concluding he had not demonstrated U.S. birth by a preponderance of the evidence. At the heart of the dispute were conflicting records—a Texas birth certificate signed by a midwife later convicted for fraudulent registrations and multiple Mexican records (civil birth, baptismal, vaccination) listing Matamoros, Mexico as the place of birth—as well as a 1995 sworn statement by Torres’s mother to immigration officials that her son was born in Mexico and that a midwife had been paid to obtain a Texas birth certificate.

On appeal, Torres challenged the district court’s weighing of the evidence, including the evidentiary value of the Texas birth certificate, the credibility of the midwife’s testimony, and the district court’s reliance on his mother’s 1995 confession. The Fifth Circuit, applying clear-error review to the bench-trial findings, rejected each challenge. Most notably, the court clarified that district courts adjudicating § 1503(a) actions conduct a de novo determination of citizenship status and are not bound by the State Department’s passport regulations distinguishing “primary” versus “secondary” evidence. The court also reiterated that there is no per se legal rule that a first-recorded birth record is more credible than a later one, and it emphasized the appellate deference owed to trial-level credibility determinations.

Summary of the Opinion

The Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court’s judgment after a two-day bench trial that Torres failed to prove U.S. birth by a preponderance of the evidence. Three holdings drive the affirmance:

Section 1503(a) actions are independent, de novo judicial proceedings. District courts are not bound by State Department passport regulations (such as 22 C.F.R. § 51.42’s “primary evidence” framework) and may consider any competent evidence relevant to place of birth. Even within the regulatory framework, 22 C.F.R. § 51.45 empowers the Department to require additional evidence beyond a birth certificate.

There is no legal presumption that an earlier-filed birth certificate necessarily outweighs a later-filed record; factfinders may evaluate all the circumstances. The district court did not err in considering the Mexico birth certificate and other records notwithstanding the prior Texas registration.

Credibility determinations—here, crediting the midwife’s testimony and the mother’s 1995 written statement over trial testimony—are entitled to heightened deference on appeal. The district court’s account was plausible in light of the entire record, so there was no clear error.

Factual and Procedural Background

Torres applied for a U.S. passport in 2017, submitting a Texas birth certificate purportedly issued for his birth in San Benito, Texas on March 29, 1994. The Department requested additional evidence; Torres provided a Mexican civil birth certificate and baptismal certificate listing Matamoros, Mexico as his birthplace. The Department denied the passport in 2021.

In a § 1503(a) suit, Torres called his parents and the midwife, Elisa Meade, at a 2024 bench trial. His parents described a spontaneous encounter at a bus station leading to an emergency home birth in San Benito attended by a midwife who then delivered a Texas birth certificate days later. The mother’s 1995 interaction with immigration officials produced a written statement (which she signed) admitting a Matamoros birth and a midwife payment; she later claimed coercion. Meade testified she never delivered a baby alone, did not conduct emergency pick-ups, had a 1996 conviction for false Texas birth registrations, and signed a 1997 affidavit that she filed a false birth certificate for Torres.

The documentary record included the Texas birth certificate (favorable to U.S. birth) and the Mexican birth certificate, baptismal certificate, and vaccination records (all listing Matamoros). The district court found the parents’ narrative “difficult to accept,” concluded Meade’s affidavit stripped the Texas certificate of probative weight, credited the 1995 statement, and held that Torres did not carry his burden of proof. Torres appealed.

Detailed Analysis

Precedents and Authorities Cited

Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564 (1985): Establishes robust deference to trial court credibility determinations and factual findings under the clear-error standard. The Fifth Circuit quoted Anderson’s core rule that appellate courts may not reweigh evidence if the trial court’s account is plausible.

Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(6): Findings of fact from bench trials “must not be set aside unless clearly erroneous,” with due regard for the trial court’s opportunity to assess witness credibility.

Kona Tech. Corp. v. S. Pac. Transp. Co., 225 F.3d 595 (5th Cir. 2000): Bench-trial standard of review—clear error for fact-finding, de novo for legal issues.

Guzman v. Hacienda Records & Recording Studio, Inc., 808 F.3d 1031 (5th Cir. 2015): Emphasizes the “great deference” owed to district court factual findings.

Johnson v. Hosp. Corp. of Am., 95 F.3d 383 (5th Cir. 1996): Clarifies when challenges to weight-of-evidence are reviewed for clear error rather than as legal errors; applied here to treat Torres’s evidentiary-weight arguments as clear-error challenges.

De Vargas v. Brownell, 251 F.2d 869 (5th Cir. 1958): Places the burden on the § 1503(a) plaintiff to prove citizenship by a preponderance of the evidence; also notes the caution with which “interested” witness testimony should be received.

Richards v. Secretary of State, 752 F.2d 1413 (9th Cir. 1985), and Mathin v. Kerry, 782 F.3d 804 (7th Cir. 2015): Persuasive authorities confirming that § 1503(a) actions are independent de novo determinations, not administrative-review proceedings bound by agency regulations.

Martinez v. Secretary of State, 652 F. App’x 758 (11th Cir. 2016) (per curiam): Rejects the notion that a state birth certificate creates a presumption of citizenship in § 1503 litigation; cited here to support considering additional “secondary” evidence even where a birth certificate exists.

Salinas Moya v. Limon, 793 F. App’x 296 (5th Cir. 2019) (per curiam): Holds there is no rule that older evidence is automatically more credible than newer evidence; supports the district court’s decision to weigh a later Mexican birth certificate alongside an earlier Texas record.

Garcia v. Kerry, 557 F. App’x 304 (5th Cir. 2014) (per curiam): Affirms discrediting a mother’s testimony resting on “unlikely coincidences,” paralleling the trial court’s skepticism of the parents’ narrative here.

22 C.F.R. § 51.42 and § 51.45: State Department passport regulations distinguishing “primary” and “secondary” evidence (birth certificates vs. other records) and authorizing the Department to require any additional evidence deemed necessary. The panel explained these regulations do not bind district courts in § 1503(a) cases; even so, § 51.45 undermines any argument that submission of a birth certificate precludes review of other evidence.

Legal Reasoning

The panel organized its analysis around three appellate challenges—each resolved under clear-error review because they attacked the trial court’s weighing of evidence and credibility rather than asserting a legal misinterpretation.

1) The Texas Birth Certificate and the “Primary vs. Secondary” Evidence Argument

Torres argued the district court gave insufficient weight to his Texas birth certificate because, under passport regulations, it is “primary evidence” and should eclipse “secondary” evidence like baptismal or school records. The Fifth Circuit rejected this for two reasons:

De novo adjudication: A § 1503(a) action is an independent judicial determination of nationality status, not an administrative-review proceeding. As such, State Department evidentiary regulations do not constrain the kinds of evidence that a district court may consider. The court relied on Richards (9th Cir.) and Mathin (7th Cir.).

Even within the regulatory framework, § 51.45 expressly allows the Department to demand additional evidence beyond a birth certificate; thus, the idea that “secondary” evidence is off-limits when a birth certificate exists is incorrect. The Eleventh Circuit’s Martinez supports this reading and rejects a presumption of citizenship from a state birth certificate in § 1503 litigation.

The Fifth Circuit also emphasized that there is no legal rule privileging the first-recorded birth certificate over a later-recorded foreign certificate; citing Salinas Moya, the court reiterated that “older” is not automatically “more credible.” The district court thus acted within its discretion to consider and weigh the Mexican records—especially given independent reasons to discount the Texas certificate (the midwife’s 1996 conviction and 1997 affidavit admitting a false registration for Torres).

2) The Midwife’s Testimony and Credibility

Torres challenged the weight accorded to the midwife’s testimony because of her age, a passing reference to occasional forgetfulness, and minor inconsistencies (e.g., costs she associated with registering births). The Fifth Circuit emphasized the heightened deference due to trial-level credibility assessments (Anderson; Rule 52(a)(6)). The claimed inconsistencies did not undermine the trial court’s credibility finding, particularly in light of the midwife’s conviction and her 1997 affidavit acknowledging a false birth certificate for Torres—documentary anchors that significantly eroded the probative value of the Texas record. The panel found no clear error in crediting her testimony and affidavit.

3) The Mother’s 1995 Statement and Claims of Coercion

Torres argued that his mother’s 1995 statement to immigration officials (admitting a Mexican birth and a payment to a midwife) was involuntary and should not have been credited. The Fifth Circuit again deferred to the district court’s factual findings and credibility calls:

The trial court reasonably found the parents’ account “difficult to accept” because it turned on a string of unlikely coincidences and was contradicted by documentary records listing Matamoros as the birthplace.

The court found no persuasive reason why an immigration officer would fabricate the 1995 statement, especially since the mother signed a document containing the admission.

The mother was an “interested” witness in her son’s § 1503(a) case, justifying caution in assessing her trial testimony (De Vargas).

On this record, the district court’s decision to credit the 1995 statement over trial testimony alleging coercion was plausible and therefore insulated from reversal under clear-error review.

Impact and Implications

Although unpublished and thus non-precedential under Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5, Torres v. Rubio carries significant persuasive weight and offers practical guidance for § 1503(a) litigation in the Fifth Circuit and beyond.

De novo means de novo: District courts are not bound by the State Department’s passport evidentiary taxonomy. Litigants cannot rely on 22 C.F.R. § 51.42 to prevent consideration of other records, nor to create a presumption from a state birth certificate. Courts may weigh all probative evidence.

No automatic priority to first-filed birth records: The panel reaffirms that chronology alone does not decide authenticity or credibility. Later-filed foreign records can be persuasive, particularly where corroborated by related records (baptismal, vaccination) and where independent factors undermine the earlier domestic record.

Trial credibility calls are decisive: Because § 1503 cases are fact-intensive and often turn on witness credibility and documentary nuance, the clear-error standard provides a significant buffer on appeal. Parties must build the best possible record at trial; appellate courts will not reweigh evidence if the trial court’s narrative is plausible.

Midwife-registered Texas certificates require corroboration: Where there is evidence of registration irregularities or fraud (e.g., prior convictions, sworn affidavits), courts may substantially discount a Texas birth certificate without erring. Litigants should marshal independent corroboration (e.g., contemporaneous medical, hospital, or third-party records; non-interested witnesses).

Practice Pointers for § 1503(a) Litigants

Do not assume a state birth certificate will end the inquiry. Be prepared to present corroborating evidence consistent with U.S. birth (medical, school, and third-party affidavits; contemporaneous photographs or hospital discharge records; border-crossing logs; tax or benefit records linked to newborn care).

Anticipate and address foreign records. If contrary foreign birth or church records exist, proactively explain or rebut them with context and documentation.

Prepare for credibility challenges. Interested witnesses (parents, close family) face heightened scrutiny. Where possible, include disinterested witnesses and contemporaneous documents.

If alleging coercion of prior statements, develop a robust factual record: details of the setting, witnesses, translation issues, contemporaneous objections, and any documentation to support the coercion claim. Absent such support, trial courts may credit signed statements over later recantations.

Complex Concepts Simplified

8 U.S.C. § 1503(a): A federal statute allowing a person in the U.S. who has been denied a right or privilege as a U.S. national (e.g., a passport) to file a civil suit for a declaratory judgment that he or she is a U.S. national. The district court decides citizenship status anew (de novo).

Preponderance of the Evidence: The plaintiff’s burden in § 1503(a) suits. It means “more likely than not”—a greater than 50% likelihood that the claim (U.S. birth) is true.

De Novo Determination vs. Agency Review: In § 1503, the court does not review the agency’s decision under administrative law standards; it independently determines the fact of citizenship. Agency regulations do not bind the court’s evidentiary analysis.

Clear Error Standard (Appellate Review): On appeal from a bench trial, factual findings stand unless the appellate court is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. Credibility findings get “even greater” deference.

“Primary” vs. “Secondary” Evidence (Passport Regulations): For passport processing, the State Department treats a birth certificate as primary evidence, and other records (church, school, medical) as secondary. In § 1503 litigation, courts are not bound by this scheme and may consider all probative evidence.

Interested Witness: A witness with a personal stake in the case’s outcome (e.g., a parent in a child’s citizenship suit). Courts scrutinize such testimony carefully when it conflicts with other evidence.

Affidavit: A sworn written statement. In this case, the midwife’s 1997 affidavit admitting she filed a false birth certificate for Torres was central to the court’s evaluation of the Texas record.

What the Court Did Not Decide

No categorical rule on the weight of any given document: The court did not adopt a universal hierarchy among birth records; it endorsed case-by-case weighing.

No evidentiary exclusion of “secondary” materials: The court did not limit the admissibility of secondary evidence when a birth certificate exists.

No holding that a mother’s post hoc coercion claim can never succeed: The ruling is record-specific; stronger evidence of coercion might change the outcome in a different case.

Conclusion

Torres v. Rubio underscores three controlling themes in § 1503(a) litigation: the district court’s de novo authority unconstrained by passport regulations; the absence of any formal presumption favoring earlier-recorded birth certificates; and the powerful deference appellate courts accord to trial-level credibility assessments. The decision aligns the Fifth Circuit’s approach with sister-circuit authority (Richards, Mathin, Martinez) and reinforces that § 1503 cases are intensely fact-driven. For litigants, the message is clear: success turns on building a comprehensive, coherent evidentiary record at trial—one that can withstand rigorous credibility scrutiny and that does not rely on a single documentary keystone when countervailing records and sworn admissions exist.

After the shooting and the death of García-Hernández, Gauffeny said she received hateful messages from strangers on social media.
There is no headstone on García-Hernández’s grave yet because she cannot afford it.","A few hours before the Texas sun set, Stephany Gauffeny held her newborn son close to her chest as she started walking in a cemetery. The grave she stopped at had no headstone, but Gauffeny, 32, had written her husband’s name on a red ribbon.

She married Miguel García-Hernández in 2016, nearly 10 years before he was shot at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas in late September.

“I am trying to cope because that’s what I am supposed to do, but what hurts me the most is to hear my kids ask where daddy is,” said Gauffeny, speaking to the Guardian in her first interview since his death.

“My eight-year-old daughter with autism waited for him until the last minute. They would talk over the phone while he was detained, but one day before the funeral, I had to tell her that daddy was in heaven and that he would be watching her and that she wouldn’t see him.”

García-Hernández ended up in ICE custody early on 24 September after a short time in jail for a DUI. That same morning, while he was shackled inside a government van, a gunman opened fire outside the ICE field office in Dallas where he was awaiting intake.

Federal authorities have said the attacker was targeting ICE officials, but only detainees were hurt, including García-Hernández, 31, who was rushed to the hospital in critical condition.

“I was coming back from a doctor’s appointment for my pregnancy and I was so excited to tell him about our son, but I got a call saying that my husband was in the hospital,” said Gauffeny, switching between English and Spanish intermittently.

“I walked into the [hospital] room and I just started crying. His arms were restrained to the bed and he had handcuffs on his feet.”

García-Hernández died on 29 September from his gunshot wounds. His third child with Gauffeny was born three days later. He would have turned 32 on 5 January, the day of their 10th wedding anniversary, Gauffeny said as she stood sorrowfully in front of García-Hernández’s grave.

She believes the rising political violence and anti-immigration agenda in the US played a part in her husband’s violent death.

The couple had been focusing hard on the new home they bought a few months ago in Arlington, on the outskirts of Dallas. There, they lived with their children, as well as two girls from Gauffeny’s previous relationship whom García-Hernández had helped raise.

“He talked about little projects like turning the garage into a room, painting some parts of the house, getting a new fence and doing it all by himself,” said Gauffeny, her voice cracking.

“It hurts to look around now, you know? Who is going to do it?”

García-Hernández was born in San Luis Potosí, a central state in Mexico, and crossed the US border without papers when he was 14. Though the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program has benefited hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants with similar cases since 2012, he arrived just too early to qualify.

García-Hernández lived in the Dallas area for nearly two decades, most recently making a living painting and remodeling homes. Gauffeny said he had applied for a Biden administration initiative, dubbed Keeping Families Together, that was designed to allow the undocumented spouses of US citizens to get legal status. However, a federal judge in Texas blocked the policy just a few months after it started.

Martina Alvarado, a lawyer who tried to help García-Hernández fix his immigration status, said he was awaiting a waiver that, if granted, would effectively erase his illegal entry into the US and allow him to get a green card based on his marriage to an American citizen.

Gauffeny said her husband was planning to open his own painting company as soon as his immigration case was resolved, and he had been saving money for the equipment.

Since Donald Trump took office for a second time, his administration has aggressively expanded immigration raids across the country, granting deportation agents a broad mandate to target those in the country without proper documents, even if they’re not criminals. The crackdown has spurred massive protests and growing concerns over tactics by federal agents.

The contentious climate around immigration under the Trump administration can also be palpable far from the neighborhoods and the streets where federal agents roam. After the shooting and the death of García-Hernández, Gauffeny said she received hateful messages from strangers on social media.

“Some comments said they were happy that it happened because he shouldn’t have been here illegally,” said Gauffeny.

“He and I never hid the fact he entered illegally, you know, but what I keep saying is that he didn’t deserve that and we’re going to fight this.”

Eric Cedillo, a Dallas attorney who has been helping Gauffeny since the shooting, said they are contemplating filing a lawsuit, without specifying details at that time.

García-Hernández’s mother, Maria García, was deported to Mexico earlier this year and was initially unable to see her son when he was hospitalized. But she was allowed into the US after the Mexican government intervened. In a statement, Mexico’s foreign ministry said “an extraordinary humanitarian parole was arranged for García-Hernández’s mother to travel to the US”.

The statement did not provide information on what, if any, economic assistance has or will be given to Gauffeny to cover expenses related to García-Hernández’s funeral.

At the funeral, a Mexican flag was laid next to his grave by the Brown Berets of North Texas, a community defense group that runs an “ICE Watch” in the area. When Stephany visited with newborn Miles Alexander last week, the flag was gone but some roses remained.

Gauffeny said that securing the burial site was possible thanks to money donated to a GoFundMe page created by her sister-in-law. There is no headstone on García-Hernández’s grave yet because she cannot afford it.

“My biggest concern now is to have a place to live in the future. Our mortgage is very expensive and we were already struggling when he was detained. I am scared for my kids,” Gauffeny said.

Before leaving the cemetery in Arlington, Gauffeny recalled that her husband had bought a Bible in Spanish while in the custody of Tarrant county for the DUI. Days after his death, his belongings came in the mail, including the Bible, which he had bookmarked.

She said: “It was on a page in Genesis. He wanted to read the Bible from the start to the end but couldn’t continue because he was killed.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cf1dd902bad9730e38e823fe866fd9a4b0a073c/0_0_2000_1600/master/2000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f444ae5e3d262195b5739d6445f14d4f",N,,2025-10-25 12:21:16.570414

The pushback that you will get from the authorities is that these protests are turning violent, that the protesters are not just protesters.","The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview located outside of Chicago has become a focal point for protesters who want to resist the agency. A viral photo of an ICE agent at the site pepper spraying a pastor in the face has come to exemplify the aggressive and violent tactics federal officers are using to corral the demonstrations.

The Rev. Quincy Worthington was there the night his friend, the Rev. David Black, was shot in the back of the head with a pepper bullet and pepper-sprayed in the face, and has returned every weekend since. He’s seen ICE agents hit protesters with batons, shoot pepper balls and rubber bullets, and deploy flash-bangs into the crowd. Worthington says his faith is what keeps him going back after some of the scariest nights of his life.

Below is a conversation between Worthington and Today, Explained host Noel King. Their conversation has been edited for length and clarity. There’s much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

Where did this start for you?

At the beginning of September, I went to a Faith Over Fear rally and press conference in Daley Plaza [in downtown Chicago] that was about Operation Midway Blitz ramping up and about a faithful response to that. David was there and he spoke, and through conversation of asking him what was going on and what he was doing, he told me about Broadview and the things that were going on there. And he said that it would be really great to have more clergy presence there, because we provide a sense of calm and can help deescalate things sometimes if it needs to be deescalated. I told him I would be happy to join him at those and went that Friday.

That night when the picture was taken, he and I had actually just arrived there together. And I was checking in with people at a supply table, finding out who the medics are, because [the ICE agents had] been releasing chemical munitions on us before. One of the things I’ve been trying to help do is get protesters safely away from the chemical munitions and to get the medical treatment if they need it; helping flush out eyes. While I was connecting there, David went up front as he usually does to pray, to plead to the humanity of the officers. He had finished doing that and was turning around to walk away, and the agent on the roof shot him in the top of the head with a pepper ball.

Were you surprised that this happened?

(Sigh) I think by that time, no. I mean, I guess you’re surprised every time it happens. I wasn’t shocked. ICE has been escalating their response to protesters every time we’ve gone. So I think I was a little taken back in the moment that it was just a random pot shot that they took at him, but it wasn’t entirely surprising that that’s how they responded.

When did things start to escalate between the protesters outside of Broadview and law enforcement? And what did it look like when it did?

“I find it terrifying. It seems like every time I go, that time is the scariest moment of my life.”

When I started going in September, what we would notice is an escalation both throughout the day and then every week that we would go. It first started early in the day, when vehicles would come in and out, that they were trying to keep the road clear and protesters away. At least I assume that’s what they were trying to do. Then it seemed like they would randomly come out and just attack us.

And so the pattern would be: You would see one to three agents appear on the roof. You would see a drone go up in the air, and that’s when you knew something was coming. And then as the gate would open, the men from the roof would shoot down pepper balls onto the protesters and sometimes rubber bullets. The gates would open. Anywhere from 20 to 50 agents, depending on how large the crowd would be, would then rush into the crowd, essentially throwing tear gas at us, shooting us with pepper balls. I saw canisters of pepper spray that they would just douse the crowd in. They would shove people to the ground; they would sometimes grab somebody and detain them.

Do you find this frightening?

I find it terrifying. It seems like every time I go, that time is the scariest moment of my life.

What you’ve just described went down in September. It’s late October. Is this still happening at Broadview?

Right now, there’s a temporary restraining order preventing ICE from using chemical munitions. So we haven’t seen that exactly at Broadview. We’ve seen it at other places in the city where ICE is conducting operations. But since October, Illinois State Police has come in. They have threatened to use chemical munitions, but have never released them that I’ve seen. Instead, they carry batons and use physical force.

The pushback that you will get from the authorities is that these protests are turning violent, that the protesters are not just protesters. They’re in some cases, and I quote, “violent rioters.” What have you seen?

I have not seen anything to lead me to believe that these are violent rioters. I’ve never seen protesters acting any way but peacefully. They might yell things that I think are inappropriate, that I certainly wouldn’t yell at somebody, but that’s totally within their First Amendment rights. So I challenge that narrative. I have not seen anything that would look anything remotely like a riot.

After what you’ve seen over the past couple of weeks — agents of the federal government, in your telling, attacking peaceful protesters — has this changed your feelings about law enforcement?

I think this has changed my feelings about just about everything. I think it’s made me seriously question my understanding of law enforcement and why they’re there, the way the US government operates. And I think on a personal level, it’s caused me to struggle with and think deeper about my own faith and about what it means to be a person of faith — and what it means to be a citizen of this country.

As a minister and a professionally trained theologian, we often tend to think of these things in abstract ideas. There’s this idea of essentially picking up your cross and following Christ, or, are you willing to die for your faith? And those were kind of abstract ideas for me. I think in a very real sense, I’ve been forced to confront the very real possibility that by living out my Christian convictions, that I’m putting myself in serious jeopardy.

For me, the call to follow Christ has to reign supreme in my life. And what I witness in the life and teachings of Jesus is a man who stands up to unfair oppression. He speaks boldly and prophetically about standing up for the least of these. About trying to give voice to those who feel voiceless and standing with people who can’t stand by themselves, and giving hope to the hopeless. More important than that, I think the linchpin, the reasoning behind that is that Jesus firmly believed that every person is a precious child of God, and that we’re all created in the image of God.

The Trump administration alleges he is a violent MS-13 gang member involved in smuggling other undocumented migrants.

His lawyers have filed a suit contesting his deportation, and a federal judge in August blocked an attempt to send Abrego Garcia, who is married to a US citizen and denies all wrongdoing, to Uganda.

In Friday's filing, government attorneys say they have identified the west African country of Liberia as a site for ""removal,"" as it was not on a list of countries that Abrego Garcia's attorneys had rejected out of hand.

""Liberia is a thriving democracy and one of the United States's closest partners on the African continent,"" attorneys said in the filing in a US federal court in Maryland.

The government noted that Liberia is an English-speaking country and is ""committed to the humane treatment of refugees.""

It said it could complete the deportation ""as soon as October 31.""

Abrego Garcia's lawyer Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said ICE is seeking to deport his client ""to Liberia, a country with which he has no connection, thousands of miles from his family and home in Maryland.""

""Costa Rica stands ready to accept him as a refugee, a viable and lawful option. Yet the government has chosen a course calculated to inflict maximum hardship. These actions are punitive, cruel, and unconstitutional,"" Sandoval-Moshenberg said in a statement on his law firm's website.

Abrego Garcia had been living in the United States under protected legal status since 2019, when a judge ruled he should not be deported because he could be harmed in his home country.

He then became one of more than 200 people sent to El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison in March as part of Trump's crackdown on undocumented migrants.

But Justice Department lawyers admitted that the Salvadoran had been wrongly deported due to an ""administrative error.""

Abrego Garcia was returned to US soil months later, only to be detained again in Tennessee on human smuggling charges, a separate case from the Maryland proceedings.

Right-wing supporters praise the Republican president's toughness, but legal scholars and human rights advocates have blasted what they say is a haphazard rush to deport people without even a court hearing, in violation of basic US law.

Residents say law enforcement arrived sometime around 6 a.m.

Video posted to social media and shared with KATU show officers telling residents they were serving a search warrant in the area, and that they were conducting an investigation.

""They [officers] said supposedly because there was a whole bunch of guns and drugs, and that's why they were coming to the apartment,"" Carrington Square resident Priscilla Mazorra said.

In a post on social media, state Rep. Ricki Ruiz, D-Gresham, confirmed Rockwood Preparatory School closed because of the operation.

“Witnesses reported over 10 vehicles arriving and targeting two individuals,” Ruiz said.

According to Mazzora, officers used some sort of explosive device to blow at least two doors off the hinges, then raided at least one of those apartments.

Mazzora told KATU she saw four people detained by federal officers, including three from one household, but that number has not been confirmed.

Ruiz warned Gresham residents that they should expect to see more ICE operations in the coming weeks.

Morning Reads

Trump backs away from sending federal troops to San Francisco after pleas from tech leaders (Alexandra Marquez and David Ingram, NBC News) — President Donald Trump on Thursday said that “he is calling off plans to deploy federal troops to San Francisco after speaking to the city’s mayor and following backlash from the tech industry,” according to NBC News. His decision keeps San Francisco clear, at least for now, of ongoing legal battles over Trump’s authority to federalize and deploy the National Guard to cities that oppose the deployment. “The Trump administration and California’s government are already engaged in a legal battle over the president’s deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles earlier this year to quell protests against immigration enforcement raids in the city and surrounding areas. … Trump has also deployed the National Guard to Portland, Chicago and Washington this year,” and the question of whether the Chicago deployment can proceed is in front of the Supreme Court.

Cities, nonprofits challenge Trump grant freeze at Fourth Circuit (Steve Garrison, Courthouse News Service) — Two months after the Supreme Court held in National Institutes of Health v. American Public Health Association that disputes over the Trump administration’s effort to freeze certain federal grants likely belong in the Court of Federal Claims, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit is weighing whether it was improper for a U.S. district judge in South Carolina to order the administration to fund “more than 30 environmental or agricultural grants awarded to various nonprofits and cities,” according to Courthouse News Service. The government contends, citing the NIH decision, that the case on the environmental and agricultural grants needs to move to the Court of Federal Claims, while the grantees “argued Thursday that the constitutional claims raised in the suit could not be properly decided by the 16-judge court that specializes in handling government contract disputes.”

‘That would be neat’: American businesses eye $1 trillion in tariff refunds—and a long fight ahead—depending on the Supreme Court (Sasha Rogelberg, Fortune)(Paywall) — If the Supreme Court upholds lower court rulings striking down tariffs, the federal government may need to refund up to $1 trillion in tariff revenue to American companies, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. However, finance experts told Fortune that some small businesses may forego the money in order to avoid what could turn out to be a complicated refund process. “The general feeling is, if you have the resources, and you have the capability, the juice is worth the squeeze,” said David Warrick, executive vice president of supply-chain risk management firm Overhaul. “If you are a smaller business or a smaller importer, you’ve already spent time baking in the cost of tariffs and the associated risks to your supply chain, then you’ve got to weigh up that cost-benefit.”

Harvard sees drop in Black, Hispanic student admissions, rise in Asian Americans (Lexi Lonas Cochran, The Hill) — Harvard College’s latest admissions data shows that Black students comprise 11.5% of the school’s class of 2029, down from 14% in the class of 2028, according to The Hill. “For Black students, the slide has been consistent since the 2023 Supreme Court decision that outlawed affirmative action in higher education. Before the decision, Black students made up 18 percent of Harvard’s student population.” Hispanic student admissions are also down (from 16% to 11%), but the share of Asian American students is up by four percentage points. Harvard did not provide admissions data for white students.

Fighting Trump and defending Tesla, lawyer Paul Clement is everywhere now (Mike Scarcella, Sara Merken, and David Thomas, Reuters) — Former U.S. Solicitor General Paul Clement has argued more than 100 cases before the Supreme Court, and he’s showing no signs of slowing down, according to Reuters. He’s set to argue two cases in front of the court in December, and he’s working on several other high-profile disputes. “He’s on the team representing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook in a major fight at the Supreme Court over Trump’s effort to oust her, and defending U.S. judges in Maryland in an unusual lawsuit brought against them by the U.S. Justice Department over immigration. … For [Elon] Musk, Clement is part of a team defending Tesla in federal court in wrongful death litigation, and representing X Corp in a battle with watchdog Media Matters.”

Several cases on the interim docket are fully briefed and awaiting the court’s response, including the Trump administration’s request to be allowed to federalize and deploy the National Guard in Illinois. For more information on the current state of the interim docket, check out Kelsey’s story in the On Site section below.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is scheduled to speak at Springfield Symphony Hall in Springfield, Massachusetts, on Monday night, about her path to the Supreme Court.

A Closer Look: Capital Punishment

The Supreme Court on Thursday denied two requests for a stay of execution from Anthony Boyd, clearing the way for him to be put to death in Alabama hours later. Boyd became the 40th person executed in the United States this year, which has seen a surge of executions after a period of decline, as SCOTUSblog reported last month.

So far this year, the Supreme Court has considered more than 30 emergency stay applications for persons on death row, and it has not granted a single one. For those who are familiar with the court’s typical approach to capital litigation, this trend likely isn’t surprising. Such emergency applications are rarely viewed favorably by the justices.

Most of this year’s denials have come and gone without a noted dissent. Boyd’s case is one exception. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a dissent from the denial, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.

Another exception is the case of Crawford v. Mississippi, which the court addressed last week. Charles Ray Crawford contended that his attorneys “conceded [his] guilt before the jury” after he expressly told them not to, and noted that the Supreme Court later held in a separate case that such an action by attorneys violates the Sixth Amendment. Crawford’s stay request was denied, but, as with Boyd, Sotomayor dissented, joined by Kagan and Jackson.

Death row inmates have fared better when their case makes it to the merits docket, at least in recent years. During the 2024-25 term, the justices ruled in favor of the inmate in three cases – Andrew v. White, Glossip v. Oklahoma, and Gutierrez v. Saenz – by either asking a lower court to reconsider their claims or ordering a new trial. In the term ahead, the court will again weigh in on the administration of the death penalty in Hamm v. Smith, a case about how courts, when presented with multiple IQ scores, should determine whether a capital defendant is so intellectually disabled that he may not be executed.

SCOTUS Quote

“From this day forward, I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of death.”

— Justice Harry Blackmun in Callins v. Collins

The Interim Docket Remains Active

The Supreme Court is done hearing argument for October, but that does not mean it’s done making major rulings. There are several applications awaiting action on the court’s interim docket, including the Trump administration’s request to be allowed to federalize and deploy the National Guard within Illinois and its attempt to change the current rules for sex markers on passports. Check out Kelsey’s story for a brief overview of the pending applications.

From Amy Howe

Court Turns Down Man’s Request to Die By Firing Squad

The Supreme Court on Thursday afternoon turned down a request from an Alabama inmate to block his execution. In an unsigned order, the justices denied Anthony Boyd’s plea to put his execution on hold and to decide whether executing him by nitrogen hypoxia would violate the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented from the court’s decision to allow the execution to go forward. In a nine-page opinion joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, Sotomayor wrote that “Boyd asks for the barest form of mercy: to die by firing squad, which would kill him in seconds, rather than by a torturous suffocation lasting up to four minutes. The Constitution would grant him that grace. My colleagues do not,” as Amy noted in her analysis.

With Adams no longer mayor, Trump will lose the benefit of that arrangement.
It is not too early to create a detailed strategic plan to thwart Trump’s bullying once Mamdani becomes mayor.
The New York City Law Department handles the filing of such lawsuits.
Mamdani is all but certain to face the full spectrum of intimidation from Trump and his allies.","This month is the 63rd anniversary of the Cuban missile crisis. In October 1962, Russian Premier Nikita Khrushchev tried to intimidate the young first-term U.S. President, John F. Kennedy, by moving nuclear warheads and missiles into Cuba. Though the threat of nuclear war loomed, Kennedy rose to the challenge: Khrushchev blinked, and Russia removed the nuclear warheads from Cuba.

We are now witnessing another generational standoff between America’s bully-in-chief, President Donald Trump, and Zohran Mamdani, the likely next mayor of New York City, whom Trump has referred to as “Mamdani the commie.” In 1962, Khrushchev was 23 years older than Kennedy. The difference in age between Trump and Mamdani — 44 years — is about double.

Trump’s vindictiveness will not stop with mere threats.

If Mamdani becomes mayor, Trump has vowed to withhold billions of dollars in federal funds from New York, take over New York “when we have to,” and arrest Mamdani if he defies federal immigration enforcement. This week, the president admitted Mamdani is likely to win, “but here’s the good news: He’s got to go through the White House.” The other object of Trump’s bullying is New York City voters, who effectively are being told that voting for Mamdani risks reprisals against their city.

Trump’s vindictiveness will not stop with mere threats. To understand what is in store for New York, we need look no further than the illegal actions Trump has already perpetrated against colleges, universities, law firms and other cities and states. Trump may, for instance, direct federal agencies to conduct bogus investigations of New York City agencies for their use of federal funds. He may federalize the New York National Guard to patrol the City’s streets under the pretext of fighting crime. He may demand his Justice Department indict Mamdani on flimsy pretexts, such as not cooperating with his immigration policies.

So far, Trump has spared New York from the wrath he has inflicted on other major Democratic Party-controlled cities, including Washington, D.C.; Chicago; and Los Angeles. But that’s because current Mayor Eric Adams agreed to cooperate with the administration’s immigration policies, and in return the Justice Department moved to dismiss Adams’ federal charges for bribery and fraud. With Adams no longer mayor, Trump will lose the benefit of that arrangement.

Mamdani has no illusions about Trump’s vindictiveness. So far, Mamdani has politically pushed back against Trump’s bullying with the united front of New York’s two top state officials — Gov. Kathy Hochul and Attorney General Letitia James (herself a target of the president). He has likely recognized that every target of Trump’s bullying that has stood up to the president has gained rather than lost political clout. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, for example, regained public support after directly confronting federal agents when Trump sent the National Guard into LA.

But more is now needed. It is not too early to create a detailed strategic plan to thwart Trump’s bullying once Mamdani becomes mayor.

Fighting this legal battle will take enormous legal firepower.

A major battleground in this fight will be the federal court in the Southern District of New York. Mamdani’s team should review what legal actions other cities and states have brought against the Trump administration in federal court and begin compiling the types of legal pleadings that are likely to be successful. A committee of advisers should oversee the drafting of ready-to-file court papers to use, as necessary, the day Mamdani becomes Mayor.

Fortunately for that committee, Trump has shown a penchant for not following the U.S. Constitution and statutory law. This has been his underlying weakness in his ongoing retribution campaigns against his perceived enemies. New York City must be prepared to seize on those missteps and follow the examples of Harvard University, Jenner & Block and other institutions that have successfully used Trump’s blatant violations of the law against him in court.

Fighting this legal battle will take enormous legal firepower. The New York City Law Department handles the filing of such lawsuits. However, the Law Department currently has numerous vacancies for lawyers. As soon as Mamdani becomes mayor, he must fill those positions.

Mamdani is all but certain to face the full spectrum of intimidation from Trump and his allies. A well-thought-out strategic plan, similar to the one Kennedy orchestrated in response to Khrushchev, is the best path to defeating the bully.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251023-donald-trump-zohran-mamdani-zz-c8a8d4.jpg",N,,2025-10-25 04:56:32.976456

Noem said federal efforts in Minnesota have resulted in the removal of 4,300 individuals ""off of our streets.""

“I'm just out today supporting not only the administration, Kristi Noem, the secretary of Homeland Security, just overall law and order,” Gee said.","MINNEAPOLIS — Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited Minneapolis Friday afternoon, Oct. 24, touting efforts of federal law enforcement operations in Minnesota since President Donald Trump took office.

The former South Dakota governor also blasted Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and other leaders.

“Under the leadership of (Minneapolis) Mayor (Jacob) Frey, under the leadership of Gov. Walz, more violent crimes are being perpetuated in these communities because of their refusal to defend American citizens,” Noem said.

Noem said federal efforts in Minnesota have resulted in the removal of 4,300 individuals ""off of our streets."" Of those, 3,316 had criminal histories and 98 were part of foreign terrorist organizations, according to Noem.

Noem's appearance on Friday was met with a crowd of more than 300 protesters outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building. The DHS head spoke to the media from behind a table of items she said were seized by ICE, including rifles, cocaine and methamphetamine.

Protesters ahead of the news conference suspected that Noem’s visit would announce the deployment of new federal agents in Minnesota. When asked during the news conference, Noem said that it is “up to the president,” and she wouldn’t say if Minnesota specifically would be seeing an increase in federal officers, but that DHS is expecting an increase of roughly 10,000 new ICE officers across the country.

Noem said that she is looking at local partnerships with sheriffs as well as state agreements and cooperatives, “such as Gov. Walz has not been.”

“If (Walz) would sign agreements with us to have our backs out on operations, that he would help with the safety and security of our federal officers when they're out there protecting people and making sure that we're focused on getting the worst of the worst off our streets as soon as possible, that would be absolutely wonderful,” Noem said. “That would be fundamental, because I don't know how he sleeps at night.”

A spokesperson with Walz's office told Forum News Service on Friday evening that Noem's visit appeared to be ""more about pulling a political stunt than about solving a problem.""

""The governor wishes the Trump administration would stay focused on the real issues facing Americans: skyrocketing health care costs, a crisis for farmers, and the ongoing federal government shutdown,"" the spokesperson said.

The Prairie Correctional facility in Appleton has been eyed as a potential ICE detention facility, The Washington Post reported in August, citing internal ICE documents. Noem said that she couldn't speak to specific contracts but confirmed Friday that DHS is looking at Minnesota.

Noem also touted “Operation Twin Shield” conducted by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, in coordination with ICE and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, from Sept. 19 to 28.

USCIS said the operation was “the first of its kind” and was aimed at fraud detection and deterrence activities in which immigration officers discovered suspected fraud in 275 cases across Minneapolis and St. Paul.

Noem's visit came three weeks after the Justice Department sued Minnesota over its ""sanctuary policies."" Walz has rejected that Minnesota is a sanctuary state, while Twin Cities mayors stand behind their separation ordinances.

It also comes as federal law enforcement cracks down in Chicago, the most recent of U.S. cities to see a surge in federal law enforcement presence. Two million undocumented immigrants have been removed or have self-deported since Jan. 20 of this year, the Department of Homeland Security reported in September.

Outside of the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, a large crowd gathered Friday afternoon.

Amber Mathwig, a veteran with About Face: Veterans Against the War, said she heard about Noem’s visit Friday on social media and that she's worried there will be an announcement that Minnesota “is the next target.”

“My concern out of this is not only that there's going to be a increase in incredibly violent, you know, detainment, kidnappings by ICE, but that a national guard from another state is going to be, you know, asked to go occupy our city, and what can happen from there,” Mathwig said.

Becky Gee, a former South Dakota resident, also heard about Noem’s visit on social media. Standing outside next to a small crowd of Trump flags, she came to show support for her former governor.

“I'm just out today supporting not only the administration, Kristi Noem, the secretary of Homeland Security, just overall law and order,” Gee said. “We have to have immigrants, but we have to have immigrants coming the legal route.”

Minnesota was home to approximately 130,000 undocumented immigrants in 2023, according to a 2025 analysis from Pew Research Center — considerably smaller than estimates for states such as California, Texas and Florida, which stand in the millions.

Minnesota has more undocumented immigrants than all of its bordering states but other Midwest states such as Illinois and Michigan top Minnesota, at 550,000 and 200,000 respectively, according to the Pew estimates.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/0978ff2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1599x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe7%2Fa7%2F3fc7afb8402fbb76aedf8af17ab2%2Fdsc-1371-1.JPG,N,,2025-10-25 02:16:52.587575

Speaking at a late afternoon news conference, she blamed Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey for an increase of violent crime. She also highlighted federal funding that has been recently approved to hire more U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers.

“We have thousands more in the next week or two that will be deployed into field offices as well, and this office will be the beneficiary as well,” she said.

Noem’s appearance drew hundreds of protesters who held a news conference of their own and a rally outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, which houses the Fort Snelling Immigration Court.

It comes on the heels of Operation Twin Shield, a “targeted surge” in enforcement by immigration officials and the FBI in the Twin Cities metro area in September that officials said uncovered 275 cases of suspected immigration fraud.

At the news conference Friday, Noem spoke behind a table piled high with confiscated assault weapons. She was joined by Samuel Westbay, St. Paul special agent in charge from Homeland Security Investigations and HSI Special Agent Tonya Price, among others.

Since January, Noem said federal agents have arrested more than 4,300 people in Minnesota for immigration violations. She highlighted four cases at the news conference of men arrested for crimes including human trafficking, homicide and sexual assault.

Major cities in Minnesota do not comply with ICE’s request to hold detainees, Noem said, allowing “dangerous criminals” to be released.

Last month, the Trump administration filed a lawsuit against the state of Minnesota, city of Minneapolis, city of St. Paul and other state officials over policies that limit cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration officers. The case is still pending.

Both cities are involved in lawsuits to block Trump’s order earlier this year to cut federal funding grants that support city services. Some of the threatened services include housing support, transportation and emergency management.

Frey and St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter released statements in response to Noem’s visit on Friday, reassuring residents that local law enforcement are prohibited from working with federal immigration and immigrants have legal rights.

On Friday Noem said one Minnesota county, that she did not name, has recently signed an 287(g) agreement that allows ICE to delegate authority and train local officers to perform immigration enforcement functions. She is looking to collaborate with smaller towns to partner on federal immigration operations, she said.

Local immigration attorneys said Noem’s data on arrests clashes with the information they have on their immigrant clients who have been detained by ICE in recent months. They also said an increase of federal immigration officers will likely result in more enforcement across Minnesota.

“The message that the administration wants to convey is very different than what the reality is of the average undocumented person,” said Evangeline Dhawan-Maloney, a local immigration attorney.

Watching the press conference via live video feed, some attorneys said it felt similar to a political campaign in the way it perpetuated negative rhetoric towards immigrants.

“We need these immigrants and many of them coming from the border are not the worst of the worst that she is describing,” said Gloria Contreras Edin, a St. Paul immigration attorney.

“I do not agree with the criticism of the Consultative Commission on Human Rights regarding the infrastructure of the Maison de retour,” Minister of the Interior Léon Gloden said at a press conference on Friday morning.

The facility opened in October 2024 and is located in temporary structures in Hall 6 at Luxexpo in Kirchberg.

Both Gloden and Director General of Immigration Jean-Paul Reiter said on Friday that they want the facility to move to a permanent premises but cannot yet say when that will be.

Despite the temporary facilities, Gloden rejected most of the CCDH’s criticism. “One hall will remain, but renovation work will continue,” Gloden said, noting that sanitary facilities are to be renovated.

Voluntary return is an honest policy

“Voluntary return is part of an honest immigration policy,” said Gloden. The voluntary return procedure has already been introduced step by step, and the ministry of the interior will now promote it more strongly.

The principle of voluntary return has not changed, but the procedure for doing so has been adapted. Voluntary return applies to people whose asylum application has been rejected or who are staying in Luxembourg illegally, as well as asylum seekers deemed to be the responsibility of another EU country under the so-called Dublin rules.

The new voluntary return procedure provides for every asylum seeker to be informed about the possibility of voluntary return to their country of origin or a third country before a decision is made on their application. The asylum application and the voluntary return procedure are now carried out by two different immigration officials. Previously, one official handled both procedures. “It is extremely important that there is trust between the asylum seeker and the officials during both procedures,” Gloden said.

If an asylum seeker decides to return voluntarily, they are accommodated in the Maison de retour.

Reintegration programme

Another change to voluntary return is that people who opt for this procedure or whose asylum application has been rejected will be accompanied to their country of return by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the European Reintegration Programme (EURP).

If the asylum application is rejected, the person must leave the structures of the Office national de l'accueil (ONA) within 30 days. If they decide to return voluntarily, they will receive between €3,000 and €6,000, depending on criteria.

“Voluntary return is a form of cooperation,” said Gloden. “We want to offer these people prospects in their countries,” he added. This could be achieved through training and career counselling, among other things. Neither Gloden nor Reiter said what these look like in concrete terms, however.

In 2024, there were 274 voluntary returnees to 54 countries. As of 30 September, there had been 200 returnees to 45 countries in 2025.",https://img.wort.lu/public/luxemburg/9q40kz-pk-vorstellung-der-massnahmen-zur-unterstutzung-der-freiwilligen-ruckkehr-leon-gloden-jean-paul-reiter-36120552.jpeg/alternates/SIXTEEN_NINE_1200/pk-vorstellung-der-massnahmen-zur-unterstutzung-der-freiwilligen-ruckkehr-leon-gloden-jean-paul-reiter-36120552.jpeg,N,,2025-10-25 01:57:05.101046

This comes as 41 aid organizations, including Oxfam and the Norwegian Refugee Council, have published an open letter accusing Israel of “arbitrarily” rejecting aid deliveries into Gaza. The letter says, “Aid denied by Israeli authorities includes tents and tarpaulins, blankets, mattresses, food and nutrition supplies, hygiene kits, sanitation materials, assistive devices, and children’s clothing, all of which should be unrestricted during the ceasefire.” The World Food Programme warned it was falling short of its target of sending 2,000 tons of food into Gaza. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization described Gaza’s starvation crisis as “catastrophic.”

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus: “There is increase in amount after the ceasefire, but what is entering Gaza is significantly below the required target. Significantly below the required target. And that I also can explain the second — can be an answer to the second question: Is there a dent in hunger level? So, if the Gaza that — if the aid that’s entering Gaza is significantly low, it cannot dent the hunger level. And the situation still remains catastrophic, because what’s entering is not enough.”

In Israel, Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with senior Israeli army officials and held a news conference in Kiryat Gat, the site of a new international command center with troops from the U.S., U.K., Jordan and the UAE. Rubio said that the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, cannot have a role in the Gaza Strip; Rubio called it a “subsidiary of Hamas.” Since the U.S.-brokered ceasefire came into effect on October 10, Israel has killed nearly 100 Palestinians and wounded 230 in Gaza.

President Trump responded Thursday to the Israeli Knesset’s vote advancing legislation that would annex the occupied West Bank.

President Donald Trump: “The West Bank is — don’t worry about the West Bank. Israel’s not going to do anything with the West Bank, OK? Don’t worry about it. Is that your question? They’re not going to do anything with the West Bank. Don’t worry about it. Israel’s doing very well. They’re not going to do anything with it.”

This follows a Time magazine interview in which Trump firmly opposed Israeli annexation, saying, “It won’t happen because I gave my word to the Arab countries. Israel would lose all of its support from the United States if that happened.” Separately, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called annexation in the West Bank a “threat to the peace process.”

Meanwhile, Al Jazeera is reporting that a child has died after being wounded by Israeli forces during a raid in Nablus. UNRWA reports more than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed in settler and Israeli army attacks in the occupied West Bank since October 7, 2023. We’ll have more on this story later in the broadcast.

Members of the Israeli opposition are slamming far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich for his “harmful” comments about Saudi Arabia. Smotrich resorted to stereotypes when he said he wouldn’t agree to a normalization deal with Saudi Arabia if it required Israel to recognize a Palestinian state.

Bezalel Smotrich: “If Saudi Arabia says to us 'normalization in exchange for a Palestinian state,' friend, no, thank you. Continue riding camels on the sand in the desert. And Saudi Arabia, we will continue to develop, really, with economy and society and state and all the great and wonderful things that we know how to do.”

Smotrich has since apologized for his comments. This comes as President Trump is set to host Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House next month. It will be the Saudi crown prince’s first visit to the U.S. since the 2018 murder of columnist Jamal Khashoggi.

President Trump says he’s suspended trade talks with Canada over an advertisement produced by the government of Ontario that criticizes tariffs. The ad features excerpts of a 1987 address by then-President Ronald Reagan warning of the dire consequences of high tariffs, like the 35% tariff Trump has imposed on most Canadian goods not covered under a trade agreement.

President Ronald Reagan: “High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars. Then the worst happens. Markets shrink and collapse. Businesses and industries shut down, and millions of people lose their jobs.”

In a social media post, Trump lashed out at the one-minute ad, calling it ”FAKE,” writing, “Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED.”

A group of civil and human rights organizations is calling on Immigration and Customs Enforcement to end the jailing of pregnant people and to immediately investigate reports of severe medical neglect in ICE jails in Louisiana and Georgia. A joint letter signed by the National Immigration Project, the American Civil Liberties Union and others describes the shackling of pregnant people during transport; solitary confinement; the denial of prenatal vitamins; inadequate food; and delayed or substandard medical care. They say one woman experienced a dangerous infection after a miscarriage due to ICE’s medical neglect.

Meanwhile, CNN is reporting that the Department of Homeland Security is funneling $10 billion through the Navy in order to construct a sprawling network of migrant detention centers in Louisiana, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Pennsylvania and Utah. A source tells CNN that facilities could hold as many as 10,000 people each.

The federal government shutdown has entered its 24th day. It’s now the second longest in U.S. history, rivaled only by the 2018-2019 shutdown during Trump’s first term. On Thursday, the Senate rejected competing partisan bills to compensate some federal workers who’ve gone without pay since early October.

This comes as at least 36 states are warning they’re preparing to suspend November payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities warns that would leave about one out of every eight people in the U.S. without food assistance, including some 16 million children, 8 million older adults and 4 million people with disabilities.

The Trump administration finalized plans Thursday to open more than a million-and-a-half acres of Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling. The Interior Department also announced the first oil and gas lease sale with the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska since 2019, and it approved a more than 200-mile industrial road through Alaska’s Izembek National Wildlife Refuge.

Environmentalists condemned the announcements. In a statement, the Alaska Wilderness League wrote, “Opening the entire coastal plain of the Arctic refuge to drilling would destroy one of the most ecologically significant landscapes on earth — the birthing grounds of the porcupine caribou herd, vital habitat for polar bears and migratory birds, and sacred land for the Gwich’in people who have stewarded its resources for millennia.”

President Trump on Thursday pardoned the convicted founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty in 2023 to enabling money laundering while he was CEO of Binance. According to The Wall Street Journal, Binance struck a business deal with World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s crypto startup, which has generated $4.5 billion since Trump returned to office. Binance also reportedly hired lobbyist Charles McDowell, who is a close friend of Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. Republican Senator Thom Tillis blasted the pardon, saying it sends “a bad signal.” When asked about Zhao’s pardon, President Trump said, “I don’t know, he was recommended by a lot of people.”

Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is contributing $22 million, after settling a lawsuit Trump filed against YouTube for banning him from the platform after he incited his followers to attack the Capitol on January 6, 2021.

On Thursday, the Secret Service shut off public access to the Ellipse, a public park adjacent to the White House and one of the only spots to view the demolition. Photos show the entire East Wing has been knocked down.

President Trump says he’s canceled plans to send federal forces into San Francisco. On Thursday, Trump wrote on social media that he’d been talked out his plans for what he called a “surge” after he spoke with his “friends” — the CEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, and the CEO of Salesforce, Marc Benioff. Trump’s sudden reversal came as protesters rallied outside a U.S. Coast Guard base on the San Francisco Bay, where more than 100 federal agents were reportedly preparing to ramp up immigration raids. Police used flash-bang grenades to drive protesters away from an entrance as Customs and Border Patrol vehicles drove through. Separately, city officials joined protests at San Francisco City Hall. This is Laura Valdez, director of Mission Action, which works on behalf of low-income and immigrant communities.

Laura Valdez: “Please remember that this might be the start of mass enforcement in our communities, and we need to prepare adequately. And even if it is not the start, we still need to be prepared. And this community is here to back you up.”

Meanwhile, former House speaker and longtime San Francisco Congressmember Nancy Pelosi is warning federal agents they could face arrest by local police if they break California law while carrying out immigration sweeps. In a statement, Pelosi wrote, “While the President may enjoy absolute immunity courtesy of his rogue Supreme Court, those who operate under his orders do not. Our state and local authorities may arrest federal agents if they break California law — and if they are convicted, the President cannot pardon them.” In response, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche wrote on X, “Stand down or face prosecution.

The landscape of immigration enforcement in the United States has shifted dramatically in recent months. In Colorado, Nicholas Pierce—a lawyer specializing in asylum and deportation defense—finds himself in a relentless race against changing federal policies. Each new directive, from the so-called “Freaky Friday” initiative that offered unaccompanied minors cash to self-deport, to the rollback of protections for groups like Venezuelan refugees, brings fresh uncertainty. Local human services agencies and families alike are left scrambling for answers, often with little guidance from official sources.

Pierce describes a system that has become both swifter and more unforgiving. “It is, in a lot of ways, much worse than what I had anticipated, much faster than I had anticipated,” he reflects, comparing the current crackdown to previous administrations. With hundreds of cases, he’s witnessed firsthand the profound disruption: legal statuses stripped, families forced into hiding, and children left without the right to hearings. The psychological toll is palpable, as some Coloradans are now advised to seek asylum in countries like Argentina or Chile—an option previously unthinkable.

Public opinion in Colorado is deeply divided, as evidenced by a CPR News and Colorado News Collaborative survey. While some residents support strict border controls, a majority express discomfort with the tactics being used—particularly when due process is circumvented and enforcement appears indiscriminate. One Grand Junction resident put it bluntly: “Ambushing families is despicable.” Another, from Durango, argued, “Deport criminals, not workers.” The refrain is clear: the desire for security must not come at the expense of basic human rights.

State leaders have responded with resistance. Attorney General Phil Weiser has fought federal actions in court, while lawmakers have passed bills to shield undocumented immigrants from attention. Despite these efforts, federal agents continue to execute raids, sometimes in ways that spark outrage—such as smashing car windows or detaining families with children at gunpoint. Even as state laws limit cooperation, interagency coordination persists, fueling tension among policymakers and advocates.

Economic Shockwaves: Chicago’s Restaurants and Workers in Peril

In Chicago, the consequences of the federal crackdown ripple through the city’s restaurant industry—a sector heavily reliant on immigrant labor. With increased ICE activity under operations like Midway Blitz and At Large, owners have taken drastic measures to protect staff: closing doors, shifting to takeout only, and locking entrances during business hours. The fear is pervasive, and its impact is immediate. “You can’t plan for this,” admits one restaurateur, who requested anonymity for safety.

Sales have plummeted for businesses like Taquizas Valdez and Cadinho Bakery, with foot traffic drying up as both workers and diners stay home. “You can definitely feel the streets are lonelier,” says Ivan Valdez. Online harassment compounds the anxiety, with some businesses receiving threats for displaying signs opposing ICE. The economic fallout is compounded by the human stories: street vendors have been detained, losing their livelihoods; families are separated, and owners worry about the well-being of their teams.

Yet, amid the fear, there is resilience. Community groups organize whistle events and restaurant crawls to alert neighborhoods about ICE activity and support local businesses. Owners like Omar Cadena and Eric Carlson describe a strengthened sense of solidarity, with neighbors and elected officials offering advice and resources. Fundraisers for immigrant rights groups are becoming more common, and the message is clear: immigrants are the backbone of Chicago’s vibrant food scene and economy. “They’re paying taxes, pumping money into the economy,” Cadena notes, highlighting the paradox of policies that target those who contribute most.

California’s Vigilance: Political Pushback and Community Mobilization

On the West Coast, the Bay Area remains on edge even after President Trump canceled a planned surge of federal enforcement in San Francisco. The announcement came after significant pressure from city leaders, business figures, and public outcry. But the sense of relief is tempered by caution. “San Francisco remains prepared for any scenario,” Mayor Daniel Lurie declared, echoing the region’s longstanding commitment to sanctuary policies.

The mood is tense. Federal agents’ presence on Coast Guard Island in Alameda sparked protests, with law enforcement deploying flash-bang grenades and pepper powder to disperse crowds. Local officials, including Oakland’s Barbara Lee, vow to support residents through legal means. California’s Governor Gavin Newsom continues to monitor developments, emphasizing the state’s unique role as a haven for immigrants and warning against federal overreach.

This tension plays out against a backdrop of broader political battles: Newsom has vetoed legislation citing hostile federal policies, and state leaders are fighting to preserve funding for critical services. The Bay Area’s story is one of vigilance—balancing preparedness with advocacy, and community mobilization with calls for reasoned governance.

National Pulse: Divided Opinions, Shifting Priorities

Polls reveal a country wrestling with its identity and priorities. In Colorado, concerns about illegal immigration vary by region: 90% on the Eastern Plains see it as a major problem, compared to just 46% in Denver. Meanwhile, 20% of Coloradans say the mistreatment of immigrants is an “extremely serious” concern, with higher sensitivity in urban areas. Nationally, a Gallup poll finds that only 30% of Americans now support reducing immigration—a notable decline from the previous year, with most opposition clustered along party lines.

Debate centers not only on numbers but on fairness. A New York Times/Sienna survey reports that 53% of voters believe deportation processes have not been fair, with many questioning the government’s aggressive tactics. The friction is evident: while some see strict enforcement as a necessity to protect resources and order, others warn of the social and economic costs—particularly the erosion of due process and compassion.

These divisions shape the actions of leaders and communities alike. In Colorado, legal battles and policy reforms continue. In Chicago, restaurant owners rally to support their staff and neighbors. In California, officials remain vigilant, ready to resist federal intervention. Across the country, stories of hardship and resilience abound, painting a complex portrait of a nation at a crossroads.

America’s immigration crackdown has exposed deep fractures—between security and compassion, local autonomy and federal power, economic necessity and political ideology. The voices from Colorado, Chicago, and California reveal a country searching for balance: striving to uphold laws while honoring the human stories behind every policy. Ultimately, the test will be whether communities and leaders can forge solutions that respect both the rule of law and the dignity of those who seek a better life within America’s borders.",https://azat.tv/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/America-Immigration.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 08:57:28.930197

Over Labor Day weekend, the government attempted to deport dozens of unaccompanied Guatemalan children who were in ORR custody; kids were loaded onto planes before a judge halted the plan.
In early October, the government said it was offering $2,500 to unaccompanied minors 14 years and older who agree to leave the country.
Under Trump, the number of unaccompanied children crossing the border and entering ORR custody has plummeted.
In September, about 2,000 kids were in ORR custody on average, down from more than 6,000 last October.","The Department of Homeland Security has sent unaccompanied immigrant teenagers $5,000 fines for illegally entering the United States, according to youth advocates and fine notices reviewed by New York Focus and The Intercept.

Roughly 10 teenagers in New York, ages 14 to 17, received the fine in mid-October, said Meena Shah, managing director of the Legal Services Center at The Door, a New York City-based nonprofit that serves young people. At least one teenager in Michigan has received the fine too, according to the teen’s lawyer. New York Focus and The Intercept reviewed copies of the fine notices delivered in both New York and Michigan.

The fine is one of several new financial penalties for immigrants created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed in July. The federal government is issuing the fines under a section of the law titled “Inadmissible alien apprehension fee,” which is set at $5,000 and can be applied to people apprehended between official ports of entry. Homeland Security’s application of the fine hasn’t been previously reported.

Shah and Ana Raquel Devereaux, the attorney representing the teenager in Michigan, both said the kids are living in shelters overseen by the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, or ORR, which takes custody of unaccompanied immigrant children while they wait to be released to an adult sponsor.

Devereaux, who works for the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, pointed out that kids in government custody have no ability to work.

“It’s really about creating fear,” Devereaux said. “There’s no way that a child in this situation would be able to pay this, and the penalties are so severe.”

Minors in Texas and Pennsylvania have received the fines too, according to a staff member at a national nonprofit who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the nonprofit’s leadership fears being targeted by the Trump administration.

The fine is one of several ways the Trump administration has sought in recent weeks to pressure minors who entered the U.S. alone to return to their home countries. Over Labor Day weekend, the government attempted to deport dozens of unaccompanied Guatemalan children who were in ORR custody; kids were loaded onto planes before a judge halted the plan. In early October, the government said it was offering $2,500 to unaccompanied minors 14 years and older who agree to leave the country.

The notices reviewed by New York Focus and The Intercept state that “Payment in full is due now” and list an array of potential consequences for failure to pay, including collection litigation and negative impacts on their immigration cases. Fines that aren’t paid in full will accrue interest, the notices say.

“They’re trying to pressure and coerce these young people into taking voluntary departure,” Shah said. “These are the stressors you’re putting very young kids under.”

Border Patrol teased the apprehension fee in a September 24 Facebook post, which included a megaphone emoji and said anyone 14 years or older could be fined. Money collected from the fines will be credited to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to the text of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Other fees created by the new law include $100 to apply for asylum, plus $100 every year the application is pending; $550 for asylum-seekers to apply for a work permit; and $5,000 for anyone ordered removed in absentia and then arrested by ICE. Lack of clarity over exactly how and when to pay the $100 fees recently sparked panic among asylum-seekers in New York and a flood of misinformation and potential scams, New York Focus recently reported.

In response to questions about the $5,000 fee being applied to minors, the Department of Homeland Security referred New York Focus and The Intercept to a press release about a different fee of $1,000 for immigrants paroled into the U.S. The agency did not respond to follow-up questions.

Supporters of the fine argue that it will incentivize people to cross at legal entry points rather than traverse dangerous desert terrain and take up Customs and Border Protection resources. Andrew Arthur, a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that advocates for restrictions on immigration, said he understood the argument that a teenager won’t be able to pay a $5,000 fine, but said their parents or relatives would then be on the hook.

“This isn’t, you know, ‘We want to punish 14-year-old kids,’” Arthur said. “This is, ‘We want to discourage parents from paying smugglers to bring their kids to the United States.’”

It’s unclear how many immigrants have received the $5,000 fine. Several attorneys who work with unaccompanied minors in New York and other states told New York Focus they’d heard about the fines secondhand but hadn’t seen any cases personally. All of the cases New York Focus and The Intercept were able to verify involved teenagers in ORR custody, but advocates said they had heard of minors outside of federal custody receiving the fines.

Under Trump, the number of unaccompanied children crossing the border and entering ORR custody has plummeted. In September, about 2,000 kids were in ORR custody on average, down from more than 6,000 last October.

Theo Liebmann, a law professor at Hofstra University who runs a legal clinic for immigrant youth, said unaccompanied kids in ORR custody are particularly vulnerable because they often don’t have lawyers, having recently arrived in the U.S.

Liebmann, who doesn’t have any clients who have received the fine, said it appeared to be an effort to “go after the kids who are especially defenseless and won’t be able to understand how to look at this threat, how real this threat is, and what they can do in response.”",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2241884413-e1761341003294.jpg?fit=3000%2C1500&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-10-24 22:56:36.226530

The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco on Friday issued a so-called administrative stay on an Oct. 20 ruling by a sharply divided three-judge panel.

The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco on Friday issued a so-called administrative stay on an Oct. 20 ruling by a sharply divided three-judge panel. The stay means an Oct. 4 decision by a lower court judge to block deployment is back in effect for at least the next several days.

In the meantime, a full complement of appellate judges will consider holding a so-called en banc rehearing to review whether the 2-1 decision was correct on the law. Oregon requested the rehearing, as did the dissenting judge who said it was a dangerous decision.

“This administrative order expresses no views on the merits of this matter and is not a reconsideration of the earlier stay order,” Senior Circuit Judge Sidney R. Thomas said in the order.

The Portland dispute comes as Trump continues to tout his plans to bring state National Guard troops under federal control and send them into Democratic-led cities where he claims violent protesters are impeding the activities of US immigration agents. Similar suits are challenging Trump’s deployments to Los Angeles, Washington, DC, and Chicago.

Oregon argues a rehearing is warranted because the 2-1 ruling was wrong on the law. Friday’s order suggests the appeals court will complete its vote on whether to hold the review by Oct. 28, a day before the start of three-day trial in Portland on the merits of Oregon’s suit challenging the deployment.

The Portland is being being overseen by US District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee whose initial order against the deployment concluded the president was exaggerating the severity of the protests.

The flights began after Venezuela agreed in March to resume repatriation flights, and have continued amid heightened U.S.-Venezuelan tensions in recent weeks.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deported approximately 140 individuals back to Venezuela in its latest removal flight on October 15. Last Wednesday's flight included at least seven individuals with criminal histories, including alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang and sexual predators, according to DHS.

Among those deported include Jefferson Bracho Haddad, an alleged Tren de Aragua gang member that a DHS spokesperson tells CBS News had six criminal arrests, including for larceny and drug possession. The agency spokesperson added that the flight also returned Angelo Dennis-Jesus Ainaga-Jaspe, convicted of multiple weapons offenses, plus Diego Alejandro Mavarez Arocha, convicted of sexual assault.

DHS has repeatedly spotlighted removals of individuals with criminal histories as part of an ongoing effort by the Trump administration to deport undocumented migrants the government determines pose threats to public safety.

""These individuals, including confirmed Tren de Aragua gang members, sexual predators, and violent offenders, should have never been in our country in the first place,"" said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement provided to CBS News, adding that an estimated 2 million undocumented immigrants have left the U.S. since January.

McLaughlin did not specify how many of those individuals were believed to have departed the U.S. voluntarily, versus those who have been deported. The vast majority would have needed to leave without making contact with DHS to reach that total. According to internal government figures previously obtained by CBS News, over the first six months of President Trump's second term, the administration deported nearly 150,000 people and recorded 13,000 who self-deported.

According to senior DHS officials, the deportations to Venezuela have occurred alongside the intensified U.S. campaign against drug trafficking and transnational crime in South America. The Trump administration has carried out at least 10 known strikes on suspected narcotics vessels over the past two months, including two this week off Colombia's Pacific coast. The most recent strike, conducted overnight, targeted a vessel allegedly operated by Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang in the Caribbean Sea.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said it was ""a lethal kinetic strike"" in international waters, marking the first night strike of the campaign. ""Six male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the strike … all six terrorists were killed and no U.S. forces were harmed,"" Hegseth said.

Trump administration officials say the combination of targeted strikes and deportation flights reflect a multi-pronged strategy to disrupt the Tren de Aragua gang and other organized criminal networks, which have been linked to drug trafficking and violent crime throughout the Americas.

The U.S.-Venezuela repatriation deal, which allows the flights to Caracas, has faced scrutiny from human rights organizations, though Trump administration officials point to the diplomatic deal as an important tool in reducing the influence of transnational criminal gangs within the United States.

Senators left Thursday after failing to advance legislation that aimed to pay essential workers, such as military troops or immigration enforcement agents, despite the funding lapse. Workers expect to miss their first full paychecks within the next few days, depending on where they work.

The vote was different from the previous 11 votes that failed to advance a House-passed bill to fund the government through Nov. 21. The last vote on that temporary remedy was Wednesday as advocates warned about running out of food benefits, delayed flights and other lost services during the shutdown.

The shutdown, entering its 24th day, has dragged on for long enough that lawmakers are looking for options for a longer, temporary funding bill to complete negotiations on full-year funding for government agencies.

Trump told reporters he didn’t know if the shutdown would be resolved by the time he returns from a trip to Asia on Oct. 30. His trip will take him to Malaysia, Japan and South Korea.

Capitol Police union says officers are in dire straits amid shutdown

With the government shutdown almost certain to reach a fifth week, lawmakers' inability to compromise is increasingly hurting the people in charge of protecting them.

Gus Papathanasiou, the head of the labor union for the United States Capitol Police, said his colleagues, on their second pay period without a check, are feeling the financial pressure.

""My officers are frustrated right now,"" he said in a statement Friday. ""I have officers who are taking out loans to pay their rent and feed their families. I have officers who are borrowing money from family members to make their car payment, pay for daycare, or pay their student loans.""

House officially out for another week

The House of Representatives is officially scheduled to be out for another week, even as the shutdown is barreling toward record length.

Though he's acknowledged some frustration about the strategy within the GOP caucus, Speaker Mike Johnson has kept the chamber away from voting as part of an effort to pressure Senate Democrats. Without the House in session, it's impossible to pass any bipartisan funding deals.

The House recess, which began Sept. 19, is slated to continue through Sunday, Nov. 2. Lawmakers will receive a 48-hour notice if the speaker changes his mind and decides to bring them back to vote. - Zachary Schermele

Expiring health care subsidies remains the focus of shutdown for Democrats

Health care policy remains the dividing line for Democrats on Day 24 of the federal government shutdown.

Senate Democrats have 12 times blocked a Republican-backed continuing resolution to fund the government at existing spending levels. Democrats argue legislation to reopen the government should also extend expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies and reverse Republicans’ Medicaid cuts passed over the summer.

Republicans have refused to entertained negotiations on health care policy, arguing the health care subsidies should be debated by Congress after the shutdown is over.

Democrats have circled Nov. 1 as a key date in their push. That’s when open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, begins and millions of Americans will start shopping for their 2026 health coverage plans.

If the subsidies are not extended by November, healthcare.gov consumers could experience sticker shock when they start searching for health care plans. Premiums are expected to double for millions of Americans if the subsidies are not renewed, according to the research organization KFF.

Inflation ticked up in September

Inflation ticked up again in September, revealing the persistence of rising prices as the job market shows signs of cooling and consumers head into the holiday season.

Consumer prices increased 3% from a year earlier, slightly up from 2.9% in August, according to the Labor Department’s Consumer Price Index, a measure of goods and services costs across the country.

The economic impact of the ongoing government shutdown has not yet been fully felt, according to Bankrate Financial Analyst Stephen Kates. At the Bureau of Labor Statistics, October data collection has been suspended during the lapse in funding.

“Federal layoffs or the absence of backpay would drag down spending and worsen labor conditions, especially in the local areas most affected,” Kates said in an Oct. 21 note. “The longer the shutdown continues, the larger our blind spot will be on current economic conditions.”

What is the Social Security COLA adjustment for 2026?

While the Labor department's jobs report was delayed due to the ongoing shutdown, today's Consumer Price Index received special attention as it was needed to calculate cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, for Social Security.

The Social Security Administration announced a 2.8% adjustment in 2026, larger than the 2.5% increase beneficiaries have received in 2025.

Airline pilot unions urge passage of Republican bill to end shutdown

Pilots for major airlines are jumping into the fight over the federal government shutdown as three pilot unions called on Congress to end the stalemate by passing the Republican-backed continuing resolution.

The Coalition of Airline Pilots Associations, the NetJets Association of Shared Aircraft Pilots, and the Allied Pilots Association issued separate statements on Thursday urging Congress to pass a ""clean"" continuing resolution to reopen the government.

Their statements came after a fourth union, Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, endorsed the Republican-backed continuing resolution the previous day.

About 13,000 air traffic controllers ‒ considered ""essential"" workers ‒ are working without pay during the shutdown. Transportation Security Administration employees are also forced to work without pay.

""We have seen the stress and tension this year on the National Airspace System due to short-staffed air traffic controllers,"" the Coalition of Airline Pilot Associations said in a statement. ""This shutdown only compounds the pressures they face as they now report to work without a paycheck.""

The Air Line Pilots Association, the largest pilot union with about 80,000 members, in an Oct. 15 statement called on lawmakers to find a solution to reopen the government, but it did not specify which bill Congress should pass.

The White House warned that Americans should expect airport delays and disruptions if the shutdown spills into the Thanksgiving holiday, when travel historically spikes.

""We fear there will be there will be significant flight delays, disruptions and cancellations across the country this holiday season,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at a Thursday briefing with reporters. ""If Democrats continue to shut down the government, they will also be shutting down American air travel."" Read more.

Unsuccessful Senate bill aimed to pay essential workers

Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, proposed legislation that would have paid ""essential"" workers such as air-traffic controllers, members of the military and immigrant enforcement agents, who remain on the job despite a lack of paychecks.

""We're not paying them,"" Johnson said. ""That's absurd.""

The 54-45 vote fell short of the 60 necessary to advance the bill. Three Democrats joined Republicans in supporting the measure: Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff of Georgia and John Fetterman of Pennsylvania.

Trump uncertain if shutdown will be resolved during Asia trip

Trump told reporters he didn’t know if the shutdown would be resolved by the time he returns from a trip to Asia on Oct. 30.

""I don't know,"" he told reporters at the White House.

Trump leaves Friday for a trip to Malaysia, Japan and South Korea. But he said Democrats “have gone totally crazy” and their unpredictability leaves resolution of the dispute uncertain.

“I don’t think they know what they’re doing right now,” Trump said.

Time runs short to resolve full-year funding bills even if shutdown ends

The House approved legislation to keep the government funded through Nov. 21 because lawmakers thought seven weeks would provide enough time to approve full-year spending bills.

But with half that period gone already, without even the temporary funding approved, lawmakers are starting to look for options to both reopen the government and fund it for an entire year.

Another bill might be required just to reopen the government until December or next year. But the House has been out while waiting for the Senate to reopen the government. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, has opposed bringing back the House until the Senate acts.

Rep. Jason Smith, R-Missouri, who heads the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, told Bloomberg TV on Wednesday that some Republicans are talking about extending funding past the next election, until Dec. 1, 2026.

“Every day that passes, we’ve got less time to fund the government,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, told reporters Monday.

A shortage of air-traffic controllers could lead to cancelled flights: DOT

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that a shortage of air-traffic controllers could lead to more delayed and cancelled flights with the holidays approaching.

Duffy told reporters Oct. 23 that controllers will miss their first full paycheck Oct. 28. As they grow concerned about how to pay their mortgage or car loan, or to put food on the table, Duffy worried they would look for second jobs.

“I don’t want my air-traffic controllers taking a second job,” Duffy said of the high-stress job requiring concentration.

Duffy said a lack of controllers would lead to reduced flights.

“Safety is paramount for us,” Duffy said. “You will see us delay traffic. You will see us cancel flights.”

Former budget official: SNAP food benefits could be extended

Sharon Parrott, president of the nonpartisan research institute Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the Trump administration could continue providing food assistance to low-income families through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program despite the shutdown.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has warned full benefits won’t be available Nov. 1 if the shutdown continues. But Parrott, a former Office of Management and Budget official, said the administration could shift billions of dollars in contingency funding to continue benefits for the 42 million people who participate in the program.

Robust monotherapy activity, as well as combination activity with BBOT’s KRAS G12C ON/OFF inhibitor, BBO-8520, and panKRAS inhibitor, BBO-11818, was observed at well-tolerated dose levels in a panel of KRAS -mutant models

The combination of a KRAS inhibitor with a PI3Kα pathway inhibitor may maximize the response rate and reduce the development of adaptive resistance mechanisms due to full inhibition of both MAPK and PI3Kα signaling

BBOT-10203 is currently being evaluated in the Phase 1 BREAKER-101 trial for patients with HER2+ amplified or HR+/HER2- breast cancer, and KRAS mutant colorectal or non-small cell lung cancer with initial Phase 1 clinical data expected in the first half of 2026

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Oct. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BridgeBio Oncology Therapeutics, Inc. (“BBOT”) (Nasdaq: BBOT), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on RAS-pathway malignancies, today announced new preclinical data showing BBO-10203 selectively and specifically blocks the physical interaction between RAS and PI3Kα, resulting in the inhibition of RAS-driven PI3Kα-AKT signaling in tumors without the risk of hyperglycemia. In addition, combination activity with BBOT’s KRAS G12C ON/OFF inhibitor, BBO-8520, and panKRAS inhibitor, BBO-11818, was observed at well tolerated dose levels in a panel of KRAS mutant models . The data were presented at the 2025 AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics.

“Aberrant activation of the PI3Kα pathway is among the most common oncogenic drivers across human cancers and leads to promotion of tumor growth, survival, and resistance to standard therapies,” said Pedro Beltran, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer of BBOT. “Current PI3Kα inhibitors are hindered by dose-limiting toxicities like hyperglycemia, which restrict target coverage, limit the number of eligible patients, and shorten the duration of treatment – leaving a significant unmet medical need. We’ve designed BBO-10203 to break the interaction between RAS and PI3Kα and inhibit RAS-mediated activation of the PI3Kα pathway. These preclinical data demonstrate BBO-10203 can accomplish this in in vivo studies without affecting glucose metabolism and achieve robust anti-tumor activity both as a monotherapy and in combination with our KRAS inhibitors, BBO-8520 and BBO-11818.”

These preclinical findings demonstrate BBO-10203 covalently binds PI3Kα on cysteine 242 in the RAS binding domain, breaking the protein-protein interaction between RAS and PI3Kα. Monotherapy results show achievement of complete cellular target engagement at low nanomolar concentrations and oral bioavailability with robust dose- and time-dependent inhibition of pAKT across diverse human cancer cell lines with KRAS mutations. Importantly, BBO-10203 does not induce hyperglycemia or hyperinsulinemia during an oral glucose tolerance test. In a panel of cell-line derived xenograft (CDX), patient-derived xenograft (PDX), and genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models, treatment with BBO-10203, both as a monotherapy and in combination with BBO-8520, BBOT’s direct inhibitor of KRAS G12C in both the ON and OFF states, and with BBO-11818, the company’s panKRAS inhibitor targeting mutant KRAS in both the ON and OFF states with strong potency against KRAS G12D and KRAS G12V mutants, show robust anti-tumor activity. Importantly, the combination of BBO-10203 + BBO-8520 and BBO-10203 + BBO-11818 induces deep tumor regressions through direct effects on tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis and are well-tolerated.

BBO-10203 is currently being evaluated in the Phase 1 BREAKER-101 trial for patients with HER2+ amplified or HR+/HER2- breast cancer, and KRAS mutant colorectal or non-small cell lung cancer as a monotherapy and in combination with standard of care treatment, and will be evaluated in combination with KRAS inhibitors.

“We are pleased to share these preclinical data on BBO-10203’s potential as a RAS:PI3Kα breaker,” said Eli Wallace, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of BBOT. “By breaking the interaction between RAS and PI3Kα while preserving normal insulin signaling, these results further support our belief that BBO-10203 represents a truly differentiated approach with significant biological and therapeutic potential. We continue to enroll patients in our Phase 1 BREAKER-101 trial and look forward to expanding into combination studies, including with our own KRAS inhibitors.”

A copy of the poster titled “BBO-10203, a first-in-class, orally bioavailable, selective breaker of the RAS:PI3Kα interaction inhibits tumor growth alone and in combination with KRAS inhibitors in KRAS mutant models without inducing hyperglycemia” will be available on the “Publications” page of the BBOT website following the conference.

About BBO-10203

BBO-10203 is a first-in-class small molecule which breaks the protein-protein interaction between RAS and PI3Kα and inhibits RAS-mediated activation of the PI3Kα pathway. It selectively disrupts oncogenic RAS-PI3Kα signaling while sparing insulin-mediated glucose uptake, potentially maintaining efficacy with reduced risk of hyperglycemia or hyperinsulinemia. BBO-10203 is currently being evaluated in the Phase 1 BREAKER-101 trial for patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2+ breast cancer, HR+/HER2- breast cancer, KRAS mutant colorectal cancer, and KRAS mutant non-small cell lung cancer. Initial Phase 1 clinical data are expected in the first half of 2026.

Dover, DE, Oct. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AlphaTON Capital Corp ( Nasdaq: ATON) and its wholly owned oncology-focused subsidiary Tarus Therapeutics, LLC, operating as Cyncado Therapeutics, today announced that a new poster is live at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics in Boston. The work, conducted with investigators from the Italian Group for Mesothelioma (G.I.Me) and collaborators, provides the first evidence that selective adenosine A2B receptor inhibition exerts a direct anti-tumor effect in both epithelial and non-epithelial mesothelioma cells, decreases in pCREB with an associated reduction in PD-L1 expression, and modulates YAP signaling consistent with proteomic shifts, alongside immune-mediated growth inhibition.

These findings reinforce earlier preclinical results with Cyncado’s selective A2B receptor antagonist TT-4 in mesothelioma, where monotherapy activity exceeded anti-PD-1 and the combination with anti-PD-1 further improved tumor control, accompanied by increased immune infiltration and tertiary lymphoid structures. The new mechanistic data help explain the previously observed efficacy profile and support translation into first-in-human evaluation.

In human mesothelioma spheroid systems, hypoxia-linked adenosine signaling increased tumor growth and PD-L1 expression. Selective A2B receptor inhibition reduced cell growth and lowered PD-L1 protein through reduced CREB phosphorylation (pCREB). In murine models, TT-4 blocked NECA-induced pCREB activation and growth stimulation in AB1 and AB22 mesothelioma cells. In vivo, TT-4 demonstrated meaningful monotherapy activity in an immunocompetent mesothelioma model, and combination treatment with anti-PD-1 further increased tumor growth inhibition, with immunohistochemistry showing higher T-cell infiltration.

“Mesothelioma is a hypoxic, adenosine-rich disease, and these data add a clear tumor-intrinsic mechanism to the case for targeting the A2B receptor,” said Rob Kramer, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer at Cyncado Therapeutics. “We are advancing TT-4 toward first-patient dosing in Q1 2026 to translate these signals clinically.”

“AlphaTON focuses on programs where biology and translational markers converge,” said Brittany Kaiser, Chief Executive Officer of AlphaTON Capital. “This first-evidence package strengthens our conviction in TT-4 for mesothelioma and informs how we prioritize resources to reach proof of concept in patients.”

Clinical program status

• TT-10 (A2A receptor antagonist): Phase 1 dose escalation is ongoing in advanced solid tumors.

• TT-4 (A2B receptor antagonist): IND-enabled program preparing for first-patient dosing in Q1 2026.

CLN-978 led to rapid and deep B cell depletion in vitro and in vivo in multiple autoimmune diseases

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Oct. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cullinan Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: CGEM), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company accelerating potential first- or best-in-class, high-impact therapies in autoimmune diseases and cancer, will present new preclinical data for CLN-978, its novel investigational CD19xCD3 bispecific T cell engager. These data will be presented at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Convergence 2025, being held in Chicago, Illinois, October 24-29, in a poster presentation session on October 28, 10:30 a.m.-12:30 p.m. CT (Poster Session C, Poster Number 2293). Cullinan will also have a Booth (#1074) in the Exhibit Hall.

New in vitro preclinical data show CLN-978 robustly and specifically depleted target B cells while activating T cells in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) derived from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Sjögren's disease (SjD), or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). These effects were similar to those observed with PBMCs from healthy donors.

Dose-dependent B cell depletion was observed following subcutaneous administration of CLN-978 in nonhuman primates (NHPs). Doses of CLN-978 considered well tolerated in the NHPs achieved deep and sustained B cell depletion in blood and multiple tissues including bone marrow and lymph nodes, suggesting the potential to achieve meaningful B cell depletion in patients.

In a murine model of SLE, CLN-978 treatment led to a reduction in circulating B cells, levels of anti-dsDNA IgG, and IgG deposition in the kidney, indicating a disease-modifying effect in both peripheral blood and affected disease tissues.

“We continue to generate preclinical data that reinforce the potential of CLN-978 as a highly potent T cell engager designed to deplete B cells deeply across multiple autoimmune diseases,” said Jeffrey Jones, MD, MBA, Chief Medical Officer, Cullinan Therapeutics. “In parallel, we are advancing our global clinical programs in rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren’s disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus, recognizing the significant unmet needs for people living with these diseases. Current therapies are typically limited to addressing disease symptoms whereas CLN-978 has the potential to modify the underlying pathophysiology of the disease itself.”

Cullinan is advancing the global clinical development of CLN-978 through its OUTRACE studies across RA ( NCT06994143 ), SjD ( NCT07041099 ), and SLE ( NCT06613360 ), with active trials now underway across all three indications and in multiple countries.

About CLN-978

CLN-978 is a novel, differentiated and highly potent CD19xCD3 bispecific T cell engager. CLN-978 triggers redirected lysis of CD19-expressing target cells in vitro and in vivo . CLN-978 is engineered to achieve very high affinity binding to CD19 to efficiently target B cells, including those with very low CD19 levels. Small in molecular size (65 kDa), CLN-978 contains two single-chain variable fragments, one binding with very high affinity to the CD19 target and the other binding to CD3 on T cells, and a single-domain antibody binding to human serum albumin to extend serum half-life. CLN-978 was developed by an internal Cullinan team and is a wholly owned asset. CLN-978 has the potential to offer a convenient, off-the-shelf, subcutaneously delivered therapeutic option for patients living with autoimmune diseases and is being studied in Cullinan’s OUTRACE studies for patients with rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren’s disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus. CLN-978 is investigational and has not been approved by any health authority.

KYV-101 resulted in a profound reduction in disease-associated autoantibodies and impact on disease activity in patients with difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA)

KYV-101 continues to demonstrate a well-tolerated profile, consistent with observations from 100 patients treated with KYV-101 to date 1

Emerging IIT data in RA reinforce broad potential for KYV-101 in rheumatology indications

EMERYVILLE, Calif., Oct. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kyverna Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: KYTX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing cell therapies for patients with autoimmune diseases, today announced the presentation of data from the Phase 1 portion of an investigator-initiated Phase 1/2 trial (IIT) evaluating KYV-101 in patients with active and treatment-refractory rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The data will be featured in a poster presentation from Charité, University of Berlin, at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Convergence 2025, taking place in Chicago, Illinois from October 24-29, 2025.

“We are very encouraged by these results, in which KYV-101 continues to provide robust CAR T cell expansion and B-cell depletion with a well-tolerated profile, driving compelling outcomes in patients with difficult-to-treat autoimmune disease,” said Warner Biddle, Chief Executive Officer of Kyverna Therapeutics. “Alongside IIT data recently presented in multiple sclerosis, these promising results in rheumatoid arthritis reinforce Kyverna’s potential to address serious autoimmune diseases beyond our core neuroimmunology CAR T programs, further demonstrating our leadership in this space.”

Charité – University of Berlin Poster Presentation

The COMPARE trial is an open-label, randomized, controlled Phase 1/2 study evaluating KYV-101 against the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab in patients with anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA)-positive, treatment-refractory RA with moderate to high disease activity.

All six patients enrolled in the Phase 1 portion of the study displayed highly refractory disease and had failed a mean of 5.8 prior biologic and targeted synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) before entering the study and receiving a single infusion of 1×10 8 KYV-101 CD19 CAR T cells with follow-up ranging from 28-175 days. The primary endpoint for the Phase 1 study was safety and tolerability with patients additionally evaluated for efficacy and key biomarkers of RA.

Key highlights are outlined below:

Safety: KYV-101 was well-tolerated with no high-grade Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), and no instances of Immune Cell Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS).

Biological Activity: CAR T-cells expanded rapidly, peaking between 14 and 21 days, and B-cell depletion occurred in all patients. Profound reductions in pathogenic ACPA, and in Rheumatoid Factor – Immunoglobulin M (RF-IgM) titers were also observed.

Efficacy: With follow up ranging from 28 to 175 days, four out of six patients met the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (ACR20) response, with two of these patients additionally achieving an ACR50 response (meeting 50% improvement thresholds).

“These are encouraging results in patients with long-standing, treatment-resistant rheumatoid arthritis for whom KYV-101 could offer profound relief from this debilitating disease,"" said David Simon, M.D., Ph.D., Head of the Clinical Trial Unit in the Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology at Charité, University of Berlin and Principal Investigator of the COMPARE trial. “These data highlight the safety and potency of KYV-101, with a rapid decline in key biomarkers and promising clinical response that are especially meaningful since all treated patients had failed multiple prior therapies. We believe these observations warrant further study of KYV-101 in RA as we progress into the Phase 2 portion of the study.”

These results supported the initiation of the randomized Phase 2 portion of the study, which is currently ongoing with patient enrollment completed.

About KYV-101

KYV-101 is a fully human, autologous, CD19 CAR T-cell therapy with CD28 co-stimulation, designed for potency and tolerability, which is under investigation for B-cell-driven autoimmune diseases. With a single administration, KYV-101 has potential to achieve deep B-cell depletion and immune system reset to deliver durable drug-free, disease-free remission in autoimmune diseases.

About Rheumatoid Arthritis

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic and systemic autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the lining of the joints, causing persistent inflammation that leads to pain, swelling, disability and stiffness of multiple joints. Over time, ongoing immune activity can erode cartilage and bone, resulting in progressive joint damage and deformity. RA can also cause inflammation in other organs, including blood vessels, the lungs and heart, contributing to fatigue and overall reduced quality of life. Autoantibodies produced by B cells, most notably rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs), represent a hallmark of RA and play a key role in driving disease. While current therapies, including biologic and targeted synthetic agents, aim to manage symptoms and slow or prevent joint damage, many patients continue to experience persistent disease activity or lose response over time.

About Kyverna Therapeutics

Kyverna Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: KYTX) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on liberating patients through the curative potential of cell therapy. Kyverna's lead CAR T-cell therapy candidate, KYV-101, is advancing through late-stage clinical development with registrational trials for stiff person syndrome and myasthenia gravis, and two ongoing multi-center Phase 1/2 trials for patients with lupus nephritis. The Company is also harnessing other KYSA trials and investigator-initiated trials, including in multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, to inform the next priority indications for the Company to advance into late-stage development.

1 Includes patients treated in KYSA clinical trials, investigator-initiated trials, and “IH” or “Individueller Heilversuch,” also known as “named-patient basis access”. Similar to expanded access or compassionate use in the United States, IH is a regulatory mechanism in Germany that allows for the supply of a treatment that has not received marketing authorization for an individual patient in response to a request by the treating physician on behalf of the named patient. This option can be pursued for the expected benefit of a patient who has exhausted all available treatment options, under the discretion of the treating physician with the patient’s consent. The use of KYV-101 in the IH setting is not a substitute for, nor intended to replace, Kyverna’s clinical trials. The goal is not to assess the effectiveness of a potential therapy, but rather to provide an individual patient with a possible efficacious approach when all other treatment options have failed, as determined by the patient’s physician.

Data published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology showed rapid and sustained relief of nighttime gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms in patients treated with VOQUEZNA, including clinically meaningful increases in heartburn-free nights observed after the first dose and maintained through 24 weeks of treatment

Analysis of exploratory endpoints showed durable improvements in measures of nocturnal symptom severity and sleep-related impacts throughout the full treatment period

FLORHAM PARK, N.J., Oct. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: PHAT), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel treatments for gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, today announced that results of additional analyses from its pivotal Phase 3 pHalcon-NERD-301 trial evaluating VOQUEZNA® (vonoprazan) tablets in patients with Non-Erosive Reflux Disease (NERD) have been published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology . The article, titled “Vonoprazan Improves Nocturnal Gastroesophageal Reflux Symptoms in Non-Erosive Reflux Disease” , underscores the significant burden of nighttime GERD symptoms and the potential role of VOQUEZNA in addressing this aspect of the disease.

Nighttime GERD symptoms are highly prevalent, affecting up to an estimated 80% of patients with GERD, and can be associated with impaired sleep, reduced work productivity, and increased risk of esophageal and respiratory complications. Despite lifestyle interventions and the widespread use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs), many patients experience inadequate relief of nocturnal symptoms, which remain underrepresented in clinical research.

“Nocturnal symptoms can be among the most disruptive and difficult-to-manage aspects of GERD,” said Philip Katz, MD, MACG, Professor of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine and study author who serves as a consultant for Phathom Pharmaceuticals. “This large, randomized trial provides important support for VOQUEZNA’s potential role in improving sleep and daily functioning for patients with Non-Erosive Reflux Disease.”

In the Phase 3 pHalcon-NERD-301 trial, 772 patients were randomized to VOQUEZNA 10 mg, 20 mg, or placebo for an initial 4-week period. Patients on VOQUEZNA continued blinded active treatment for a 20-week extension, while those on placebo were re-randomized to VOQUEZNA 10 mg or 20 mg for the extension phase.

Key findings include:

Percentage of Heartburn-Free Nights: At week 4, patients receiving VOQUEZNA 10 mg and 20 mg achieved mean percentages of heartburn-free nights of 59.9% and 56.4%, respectively, compared to 43.3% for placebo (nominal p<0.0001, exploratory analysis not adjusted for multiple comparisons). Median percentages of heartburn-free nights during the 4-week placebo-controlled treatment period were 70.4% for VOQUEZNA 10 mg, 71.0% for VOQUEZNA 20 mg, and 45.5% for placebo.

Onset of Effect: Separation from placebo was observed after the first dose, with 45.3% of VOQUEZNA 10 mg and 52.4% of VOQUEZNA 20 mg patients experiencing a heartburn-free night after the first dose vs. 32.1% on placebo.

Patient-Reported Outcomes: As measured by the validated Nocturnal Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Symptom Severity and Impact Questionnaire (N-GSSIQ), treatment with VOQUEZNA was associated with improvements from baseline versus placebo in total N-GSSIQ score, and in the subscales of nocturnal symptom severity and concern about nocturnal GERD, but not on morning impact. Improvements with VOQUEZNA were sustained through the 20-week extension treatment period.

Durability: VOQUEZNA demonstrated sustained nocturnal symptom relief throughout the full treatment period, consistent with the 24-hour heartburn relief observed in the full pHalcon-NERD-301 trial. Median heartburn-free nights remained above 70% across all treatment groups through the 20-week active extension.

Generally Well Tolerated: VOQUEZNA was generally well tolerated in both phases of the trial. The most common adverse events (≤3%) in the 4-week period were nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, and urinary tract infection; in the 20-week extension, most common adverse events (≤5%) included upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, influenza, urinary tract infection, nasopharyngitis, nausea, and gastroenteritis.

“The publication of these data in The American Journal of Gastroenterology adds to the growing body of clinical evidence evaluating VOQUEZNA as a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker with the potential to address the unmet needs for patients with GERD, including those with bothersome nighttime symptoms who often have been inadequately managed by existing therapies,” said Eckhard Leifke, MD, Chief Medical Officer at Phathom. “The results provide additional insights into a challenging and under-recognized aspect of GERD and further contribute to the clinical understanding of this first-in-class medicine.”

About Non-Erosive Reflux Disease

Non-Erosive GERD is the largest subcategory of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and is characterized by reflux-related symptoms in the absence of esophageal mucosal erosions. There are an estimated 38 million U.S. adults living with Non-Erosive GERD, of these approximately 15 million are treated with a prescription medicine annually. Symptoms can impact overall quality of life and may include episodic heartburn, especially at night, regurgitation, problems swallowing, and chest pain.

About VOQUEZNA®

VOQUEZNA® (vonoprazan) tablets contain vonoprazan, an oral small molecule potassium-competitive acid blocker (PCAB). PCABs are a novel class of medicines that block acid secretion in the stomach. VOQUEZNA is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with Erosive Esophagitis, also known as Erosive GERD, the relief of heartburn associated with Erosive GERD, the relief of heartburn associated with Non-Erosive GERD, and for the treatment of H. pylori infection in combination with either amoxicillin or amoxicillin and clarithromycin. Phathom in-licensed the U.S. rights to vonoprazan from Takeda, which markets the product in Japan and numerous other countries in Asia and Latin America.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

VOQUEZNA ® (vonoprazan) is a potassium-competitive acid blocker (PCAB) indicated in adults:

for the healing of all grades of Erosive Esophagitis (Erosive Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease or Erosive GERD) and relief of heartburn associated with Erosive GERD.

to maintain healing of all grades of Erosive GERD and relief of heartburn associated with Erosive GERD.

for the relief of heartburn associated with Non-Erosive GERD.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

CONTRAINDICATIONS

VOQUEZNA is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to vonoprazan or any component of VOQUEZNA, or in patients receiving rilpivirine-containing products.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Presence of Gastric Malignancy: In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with VOQUEZNA does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing in patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with VOQUEZNA. In older patients, also consider endoscopy.

Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis: Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) has been reported with VOQUEZNA. If suspected, discontinue VOQUEZNA and evaluate patients with suspected acute TIN.

Clostridioides difficile -Associated Diarrhea: Published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD), especially in hospitalized patients. VOQUEZNA may also increase the risk of CDAD. Consider CDAD in patients with diarrhea that does not improve. Use the shortest duration of VOQUEZNA appropriate to the condition being treated.

Bone Fracture: Several published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine, especially in patients receiving high dose (multiple daily doses) and long-term therapy (a year or longer). Bone fracture, including osteoporosis-related fracture, has also been reported with vonoprazan. Use the shortest duration of VOQUEZNA appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to the established treatment guidelines.

Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCAR): Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported with VOQUEZNA. Discontinue VOQUEZNA at the first signs or symptoms of SCAR or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation.

Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin) Deficiency: Long-term use of acid-suppressing drugs can lead to malabsorption of Vitamin B12 caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Vitamin B12 deficiency has been reported postmarketing with vonoprazan. If clinical symptoms consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency are observed in patients treated with VOQUEZNA, consider further workup.

Hypomagnesemia and Mineral Metabolism: Hypomagnesemia has been reported postmarketing with vonoprazan. Hypomagnesemia may lead to hypocalcemia and/or hypokalemia and may exacerbate underlying hypocalcemia in at-risk patients.

Consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of VOQUEZNA and periodically in patients expected to be on prolonged treatment, in patients taking drugs that may have increased toxicity in the presence of hypomagnesemia or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia. Treatment of hypomagnesemia may require magnesium replacement and discontinuation of VOQUEZNA.

Consider monitoring magnesium and calcium levels prior to initiation of VOQUEZNA and periodically while on treatment in patients with a preexisting risk of hypocalcemia. Supplement with magnesium and/or calcium, as necessary. If hypocalcemia is refractory to treatment, consider discontinuing VOQUEZNA.

Interactions with Diagnostic Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors: Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Temporarily discontinue VOQUEZNA treatment at least 4 weeks before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high.

Fundic Gland Polyps: Use of VOQUEZNA is associated with a risk of fundic gland polyps that increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year. Fundic gland polyps have been reported with vonoprazan in clinical trials and during postmarketing use with PPIs. Most patients who developed fundic gland polyps were asymptomatic and fundic gland polyps were identified incidentally on endoscopy. Use the shortest duration of VOQUEZNA appropriate to the condition being treated.

ADVERSE REACTIONS:

Healing of Erosive GERD : The most common adverse reactions (≥2% of patients in the VOQUEZNA arm) include gastritis (3%), diarrhea (2%), abdominal distention (2%), abdominal pain (2%), and nausea (2%).

Maintenance of Healed Erosive GERD : The most common adverse reactions (≥3% of patients in the VOQUEZNA arm) include gastritis (6%), abdominal pain (4%), dyspepsia (4%), hypertension (3%), and urinary tract infection (3%).

Relief of Heartburn Associated with Non-Erosive GERD: The most common adverse reactions (≥2% of patients in the VOQUEZNA arm) include abdominal pain (2%), constipation (2%), diarrhea (2%), nausea (2%), and urinary tract infection (2%).

DRUG INTERACTIONS

VOQUEZNA has the potential for clinically important drug interactions, including interactions with drugs dependent on gastric pH for absorption, drugs that are substrates for certain CYP enzymes, and some diagnostic tests. Avoid concomitant use of VOQUEZNA with atazanavir or nelfinavir. See full Prescribing Information for more details about important drug interactions. Consult the labeling of concomitantly used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with vonoprazan.

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

Lactation: Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment. Because of the potential risk of adverse liver effects shown in animal studies with vonoprazan, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with VOQUEZNA.

Renal Impairment: For the healing of Erosive GERD, dosage reduction is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min).

Hepatic Impairment: For the healing of Erosive GERD, dosage reduction is recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B and C).

You are encouraged to report suspected adverse reactions by contacting Phathom Pharmaceuticals at 1-888-775-PHAT (7428) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.

Reports of federal immigration agents making arrests and tear-gassing neighbors on the North Side led some elected officials to leave the hearing at the Cook County Building to check out the latest development in operations Midway Blitz and At Large in person.

Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Illinois, said that at least four people living in her district were “disappeared” as Friday’s hearing unfolded. While the arrests continued away from Friday’s “shadow hearing,” Ramirez told Block Club that the visit offered a valuable perspective for her colleagues who haven’t yet seen federal agents descend on their communities as they have in Chicago.

“Nothing beats watching, seeing, walking through these streets — whether it’s in Little Village or Albany Park or Humboldt Park — to actually feel and see and take that back to the work that we have to do,” Ramirez said.

Among those who left to deal with raids that were happening at the same time were Cook County Board Commissioner Jessica Vásquez, Ald. Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez (33rd) and State Rep. Lilian Jiménez, Ramirez said during the hearing.

Friday’s gathering was the fourth in a series of “shadow hearings” — or unofficial public hearings — by a group of members of Congress touring the country to discuss the tactics deployed by immigration agents and the trauma left behind. Previous hearings were held in Washington, D.C., and this was the first one held in Chicago, said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Washington.

“My people are being hunted down, in Chicago, by ICE and CBP and other agencies,” said Juliet De Jesus Alejandre, the Logan Square Neighborhood Association’s executive director, during the hearing.

For more than a month, Chicagoans have tried to keep up with ICE sightings across the city, sharing information with each other, including through rapid response groups. Across the city neighbors — including City Council members — are using bright orange whistles to warn others when federal immigration officials are nearby.

“Everyday community members, also known as rapid responders, are now the last line of defense against unbridled, violent kidnappings of both our beloved immigrant families and neighbors and, also, U.S.-born Black and Brown Chicagoans,” De Jesus Alejandre said.

Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García, D-Illinois, directed his ire at Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino — the public face of the ongoing operations in Chicago — saying that Bovino and other federal agents have been operating without warrants and are violating residents’ Constitutional rights.

“We saw a little man [Bovino] lead an attack on a hard-working, studious, industrious community as he sprayed tear gas on people in our community. We reject these practices,” García said.

Over the past month, federal agents in and around Chicago have shot at least two people, killing one; repeatedly tear-gassed protesters and first responders; shot rubber bullets at protesters; detained U.S. citizens, including children; handcuffed a Chicago alderperson in a hospital; smoke-bombed and tear-gassed people in Logan Square, Albany Park and East Side; fired a chemical weapon at a TV reporter and detained a journalist.

Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Michigan, also presented recruitment ads from the Department of Homeland Security that she said were examples of how members of the Trump administration, like Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, are pushing an “extremist” anti-immigrant ideology via federal agents’ actions.

“I want my colleges to remember this, because when we get the gavel back, we’ve got to know they’re already there. We’ve got to address white supremacy within our agencies that are attacking our immigrant neighbors,” Tlaib said.

Arrests without due process or access to legal counsel shows that people are being “disappeared and kidnapped” by the Trump administration, Tlaib said.

“I can’t believe I can’t find my residents. Literally for days,” Tlaib said.

Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Illinois, suggested that immigration officials were violating the law at ICE’s Broadview processing facility, citing feedback from constituents who’ve had loved ones detained there. He read an email from one person who wrote, “My dad was sent to Mexico, but he told me he signed his voluntary leave because the conditions were so inhumane inside the Broadview facility.”

The conditions included up to 60 people kept inside one cell, which has forced them to sleep standing up, Krishnamoorthi said.

Mayor Brandon Johnson was among a group of local and state officials who also participated in Friday’s hearing. He implored state leaders to declare a state of emergency to allow virtual learning for students whose families are affected by federal agents’ actions.

The ""shadow hearing"" included some powerful testimony from community members impacted by the raids. It was part fact-finding mission and part a show of solidarity among democrats who have from the beginning decried the way ICE and Border Patrol agents have carried out their immigration enforcement mission.

For weeks now, communities across the Chicagoland area have been responding to ICE agents targeting their neighborhoods, like Little Village, with large crowds trying to disrupt those efforts.

Protesters have frequently surrounded ICE vehicles and used cell phones to document what's happening, sometimes prompting agents to deploy tear gas to disperse crowds. That has happened despite a judge issuing a temporary restraining order limiting the use of chemical agents.

""They will say, our presence is impeding right, our yelling is documenting, right, and our documentation, they don't want to be documented, because everything that they're doing is illegal, it's unconstitutional is violent and it's dangerous,"" said Juliet de Jesus Alejandre, Executive Director of Palenque LSNA.

House democrats from across the country, including most from the Chicago region, held an unofficial immigration hearing to get testimony from impacted community members, including one 19-year-old woman named Genesis, whose mother has been detained.

""I get home from one of mom's shifts and I still need to find a way to put food on the table for my little sister and me,"" Genesis said. ""I have to seek more affordable meals because I don't have enough money to pay the bills that are already piling up.""

""They've conducted raids near churches and clinics and places that should be sacred,"" Rep. Jesús ""Chuy"" García said. ""That's why we're conducting oversight and demanding accountability, and an end to the lawless federal invasion of Chicago.""

The Trump administration has said agents are going after violent criminals who are in illegally, but communities members said frequently not turned out to be the case. 08 1:02

""With two operations on the ground, the effects are chilling. ICE and CBP are operating without a hint of accountability or transparency for their actions,"" said Ani Huamani with the Brighton Park Neighborhood Council.

Mayor Brandon Johnson later joined the members of Congress in a show of unity, thanking the congressional delegation for raising awareness of what's happening in Chicago.

""I'm grateful that you all are here to shed light today on Trump's unlawful and increasingly aggressive actions taken against our city and cities across America. What we heard today in the hearing was alarming stories of protesters being attacked, children being traumatized and communities living in fear,"" Johnson said. ""Our standing here today, standing here proudly, unapologetically sends a very clear message to Donald Trump. Chicago will not be silent, we will not bend, we will not cower and we will certainly not break.""

Among those testifying was a pastor, David Black with First Presbyterian Church Chicago, who was hit in the head with pepper balls while praying outside the ICE detention facility in Broadview.

""Temporary restraining order issued by Judge Sarah Ellis should be improving the conditions of those exercising their First Amendment right in Chicago Bovino and his henchmen are showing mocking contempt for the rule of law,"" Pastor Black said.

""May my colleagues take this conviction back, as we remind those in leadership in Congress that it is our moral responsibility to defend our communities,"" Rep. Delia Ramirez said. ""The greatest threat to public safety in Chicago is ICE AND CBP. I think it's important we lift up just how out of control and unaccountable DHS is.""

The committee members have already been in Chicago two days, talking to community groups gathering information and feedback. Before they return to Washington, they plan to meet with business groups and educators as well.

""We will take these field hearings across the country, and we will use every part of our power and our platform to fight back and ensure that we return this country to a country of democracy and justice for all,"" Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal said.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security provided more information Friday about recent violent run-ins with federal agents over the past few days.

DHS issued the following statement:

""While conducting immigration enforcement operations in Cicero and Glendale Heights, agitators stalked law enforcement, rammed vehicles, fled scenes, injured agents, and caused multiple accidents across town-putting law enforcement and the public in danger. Despite the violence, CBP arrested 3 illegal aliens who were breaking our nation's immigration laws. Six citizens were arrested for impeding and threatening to kill agents.

""Our officers are facing a surge in assaults against them as they put their lives on the line to arrest murderers, rapists, and gang members. Secretary Noem's message to the rioters is clear: you will not stop us or slow us down. CBP and our federal law enforcement partners will continue to enforce the law.

Criminal defense lawyers are required to advise non-citizens of the effects of guilty pleas on their immigration status, but the Third Circuit would go no further.
But in 2014, a whistleblower who had worked for the Patels filed a False Claims Act lawsuit in New Jersey federal court.
They pointed to a 2010 decision – Padilla v. Kentucky – which held criminal lawyers had to caution immigrants on what a guilty plea could do to their status.
Criminal lawyers had to advise only of “direct” consequences.","Criminal defense lawyers don’t have to take into account what a guilty plea could cost their clients in a civil lawsuit, a federal appeals court has ruled.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit this month rejected a lawsuit by Nita and Kirtish Patel, who tried to extend protections to immigrants in danger of deportation to civil litigation. Criminal defense lawyers are required to advise non-citizens of the effects of guilty pleas on their immigration status, but the Third Circuit would go no further.

The Patels forged medical documents to bill the United States for services and face millions of dollars of liability under the False Claims Act – a law that allows whistleblowers and state and federal government to sue when governments are over-billed.

“(I)f we were to hold that the Sixth Amendment requires defense counsel to advise a client about potential civil liability under the False Claims Act, we would be recognizing a new rule of constitutional law,” the Third Circuit wrote.

The Patels offered mobile diagnostic test services at Biosound Medical Services and Heart Solution, and Kirtish falsely told Medicare that a licensed neurologist would perform neurological diagnostic testing.

Kirtish wrote diagnostic reports, and Nita forged the signature of a physician. They earned at least $4.3 million, with about $1.7 million of it coming from Medicare.

But in 2014, a whistleblower who had worked for the Patels filed a False Claims Act lawsuit in New Jersey federal court. This alerted prosecutors who soon arrested them.

They each pleaded guilty to a count of healthcare fraud with the agreement there would be no more criminal charges. Nita got 78 months in prison and Kirtish got 100 months, along with restitution of $4.8 million.

The federal government has the option to intervene in FCA cases filed by whistleblowers, and it did. It used the guilty pleas as evidence of the Patels’ liability.

Awards in FCA cases are tripled as a punishment. A judge ordered $5 million in damages, plus another $2,750,000 in civil penalties.

Nita and Kirtish moved to vacate their criminal sentences because their lawyers had never informed them of their potential civil liability when pleading guilty. They pointed to a 2010 decision – Padilla v. Kentucky – which held criminal lawyers had to caution immigrants on what a guilty plea could do to their status.

Criminal lawyers had to advise only of “direct” consequences. The Supreme Court in Padilla didn’t classify deportation as a “collateral” consequence because removal from the country is a “particularly severe penalty… intimately related to the criminal process.”

Other circuits have held the Padilla ruling is directed only at deportation.

“We read Padilla the same way,” the Third Circuit said. “It did not disturb the lower courts’ rules about whether the Sixth Amendment requires attorneys to inform their clients of a conviction’s collateral consequences.

“Instead, it announced that those courts’ rules are inapplicable to one specific consequences: deportation.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/6b/c6b4eaeb-ba17-46f1-a276-006e390eaf73/68fa9b8fa5fea.image.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 23:56:39.632413

(KGUN) — As the possibility of the former prison in Marana becoming an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center continues to be on the minds of some residents, a community forum, moderated by Pima County Supervisor Jennifer Allen, was held Thursday evening.

Management and Training Cooperation previously owned the prison from the mid-90s until 2013. Fast forward to this year, MTC owns the facility once again after purchasing it from the state for $15 million.

In May, a spokesperson with MTC told KGUN 9 that the facility would be used for detention purposes. In October, an MTC spokesperson told KGUN 9 they are still exploring opportunities with several public agencies and don’t have additional information to share.

As its exact future use remains a question, hundreds of people attended Thursday’s community forum. Everyone in attendance appeared to be opposed to a potential ICE detention center in the town.

Veteran Stevie Rendino said she can’t believe what is going on in the country.

“I fought for freedom or so they told me, and now here I am having to protest a secret police,” she said.

She and Marana resident, Bennett Burke, shared similar feelings when they found out about the possible use of the facility near Sanders and Silverbell.

“Absolute disgust,” Rendino said.

“Outrage, I’m outraged at all of this,” Burke said.

While hundreds were in opposition at Thursday’s event, KGUN 9 recently spoke to Republican State Senator John Kavanagh, who is in support of it being used as an ICE detention facility.

“While they’re being processed, we don’t want to overcrowd them in office jail cells or local jails – let’s have a nice facility and they can get their due process, or they can wait for their flight out there,” he said.

Early this year, Sen. Kavanagh proposed Senate Bill 1294, which would have allowed the state to lease the facility to ICE for $1 a year. The bill failed in the House.

In a letter addressed to Pelosi, Newsom, state Attorney General Rob Bonta and San Francisco D.A. Brooke Jenkins, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche accused the officials of encouraging efforts to detain federal agents, specifically those working with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), if they violate state law during operations.

| REGISTER NOW: Protecting major events from drone threats

Blanche’s letter came in response to recent remarks by Pelosi, who suggested that local law enforcement in California could arrest ICE agents if they break state laws. In a joint statement with Rep. Kevin Mullin (D-Calif.), Pelosi cited California’s legal protections and said that while the president may have immunity from prosecution, “those who operate under his orders do not.”

“California law prevents federal agents from taking certain actions,” the statement read. “Our state and local authorities may arrest federal agents if they break California law — and if they are convicted, the president cannot pardon them.”

In response, Blanche called such statements “illegal and futile,” warning that any attempts to arrest federal law enforcement officers in the performance of their duties would be met with legal consequences.

“Stand down or face prosecution,” Blanche wrote on X. “No one threatens our agents. No one will stop us from Making America Safe Again.”

He also directed the officials to preserve all written and electronic communications related to any such plans.

But an amended complaint filed in May took a broader look at the “sensitive taxpayer data DOGE seeks to share,” including moves made by DHS “to support unspecified criminal investigations in connection with immigration enforcement.”

On Sept. 5, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ordered the defense attorneys to notify the court within 24 hours of any additional requests DHS or Immigration and Customs Enforcement makes to the IRS, or new plans to share tax data with those agencies.

Since the September data request came from CBP and not ICE, the defense wrote in its filing that it does not think it “falls within the ambit of the Court’s order” but decided to share the information with the court anyway, “out of an abundance of caution.”

The defense also noted that CBP did not request any individual tax return information. The agency also has “no authority” to “redisclose” information to ICE that it obtained via the tariff-related section of the Internal Revenue Code, the attorneys said.

None of the plaintiffs responded to a FedScoop request for comment on the new court filing, nor did Democracy Forward, which represents the groups, by the time of publication.

The IRS’s data-sharing agreement with ICE has sparked outrage from immigrant rights and privacy groups, as well as separate litigation. When news of the pact broke in March, the IRS’s then-acting commissioner resigned from the agency in protest.",https://fedscoop.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/10/GettyImages-2215825907.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 19:17:22.168563

According to that article, the Departments of Defense and Justice were assisting ICE in an investigation into an alleged ""concealed logistics network"" that used nonprofits and people without legal status in the U.S. for ""dark money, globalist data tracking operations, and in some cases, organ harvesting.""

ICE had reportedly discovered that network during its raids, leading the local government — Los Angeles County — to attempt to block further federal access through a state of emergency declaration, according to Gazetteller.com.

Los Angeles County Supervisors Lindsey P. Horvath and Janice Hahn, who co-introduced the state of emergency declaration, dismissed the article via email as ""absurd.""

In October 2025, a claim (archived) circulated online that Los Angeles County declared a state of emergency after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids exposed ""tunnels, safe houses, and foreign-backed trafficking hubs"" in the area.

Los Angeles County includes dozens of cities in southern California, the most populous of which is Los Angeles. County supervisors voted to declare a state of emergency on October 14, 2025, after ICE ramped up enforcement actions in June (archived).

Popular X and Facebook (archived) posts sharing the claim began with an all-caps headline, reading, ""L.A. DECLARES STATE OF EMERGENCY AFTER TRUMP'S ICE RAIDS EXPOSE TUNNELS, SAFEHOUSES, AND FOREIGN-BACKED TRAFFICKING HUBS HIDDEN INSIDE SANCTUARY PROGRAMS""

The claim also circulated on Instagram (archived) and Threads (archived). Snopes readers wrote in asking if the claim was true.

Los Angeles County's state of emergency declaration did not mention ICE discoveries or the reported investigation. According to the declaration, the state of emergency was necessary because ICE raids had ""created a climate of fear"" that kept people affected by enforcement actions at home, leading to ""long-term harm to workers, families, and businesses.""

The claim appeared to come from an article (archived) on Gazetteller.com that featured the same all-caps headline seen in online claims. Gazetteller.com is an independent news website that takes article submissions from readers. That article appeared to be the sole source of the claim, as searches on Google, Yahoo, Bing and DuckDuckGo did not produce similar reports from other news outlets (archived, archived, archived, archived).

The article's central claim was that the real reason why Los Angeles County declared a state of emergency was to attempt to keep federal agents out after the discovery of the alleged ""concealed logistics network."" Snopes could not independently verify this claim. Therefore, we leave this story unrated.

Los Angeles County Supervisors Lindsey P. Horvath and Janice Hahn, who co-introduced the state of emergency declaration, told Snopes via email: ""This is absurd.

LA County declaration a response to 'climate of fear'

Though Gazetteller.com claimed it was ICE's alleged discoveries that prompted the state of emergency declaration, Los Angeles County's declaration said it was the effects of the raids on the local population that drove the county to act.

Los Angeles County wrote in its state of emergency declaration:

Enforcement actions and tactics have created a climate of fear, leading to widespread disruption in daily life and adverse impacts to our regional economy due to decreased attendance at workplaces, the temporary or permanent closure of businesses and restaurants, and increased strain on our local institutions such as schools, hospitals, and places of worship

Horvath, who co-proposed the declaration, said it would allow the county to ""protect and stabilize"" communities affected by ICE actions.

In practice, the declaration allowed officials to seek financial assistance and mutual aid outside the county to support people affected by ICE's enforcement action. That could mean assisting them financially or with free legal aid. The declaration allowed the county to expedite hiring, contracting and procurement to achieve this.

The declaration did not mention any of the alleged ICE discoveries that Gazetteller.com reported. The website's article referenced ""internal reports"" that said Los Angeles County was using the declaration to block federal oversight. Snopes could not independently find or verify these reports.

DHS and ICE websites mum about alleged discoveries

At the time of this writing, neither the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) nor ICE had publicly confirmed any details from Gazetteller.com's article.

ICE ramped up activity in the city of Los Angeles starting June 6, according to Mayor Karen Bass. ICE said on June 7 that agents arrested 118 people without legal status in the U.S. in Los Angeles that week. That number was up to 5,000 arrests by late August.

Searches on the DHS and ICE websites and social media for news about tunnels in Los Angeles produced no results. DHS, ICE and other government departments do not publish information about all their work online and might withhold discoveries connected to ongoing investigations.

In sum, Snopes could not independently verify the central claim in Gazeteller.com's article. We await replies from several departments and agencies to queries about the details in the article, which two Los Angeles County supervisors dismissed as ""absurd.""

Los Angeles County's state of emergency declaration remained in place at the time of this writing and could only be lifted by the Board of Supervisors. ICE and DHS enforcement actions also continued in Los Angeles and across the country despite the ongoing U.S. government shutdown.

We’re taking a closer look at what’s going on inside the facility, as detainees and advocates say it’s reaching the point of overcrowding.
This year, under this [Trump] administration, we’ve seen it grow pretty quickly, grow to what we believe to be at or near capacity, he said.
VanDerhoef says the increased volume of detainees has impacted access to quality legal counsel and created other issues for detainees.
Nationally, the Trump administration touted the bond policy against immigrants who entered the country illegally.","The number of detainees at Tacoma’s Northwest ICE Processing Center has risen since the Trump administration took over.

We’re taking a closer look at what’s going on inside the facility, as detainees and advocates say it’s reaching the point of overcrowding.

For the past 12 years, private Seattle immigration attorney Larkin VanDerhoef has worked with clients at the detention center under numerous administrations (Presidents Barack Obama, Donald Trump 1.0, Joe Biden, and now Trump 2.0).

Since January, VanDerhoef says, the population has gone up while the facility at times has been understaffed.

“In the time that I have been working with people down there, we’ve seen the population ebb and flow depending on administrations and priorities. And probably the lowest was during COVID in 2020, 2021. This year, under this [Trump] administration, we’ve seen it grow pretty quickly, grow to what we believe to be at or near capacity, he said.

We reached out to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement about the reports of overcrowding at the Tacoma detention center.

In a statement, an ICE spokesperson told Cascade PBS, “There is no overcrowding at NWIPC ... ICE has worked diligently to obtain greater necessary detention space while avoiding overcrowding.”

However, according to data analysis by the University of Washington Center for Human Rights, the facility has been nearly at capacity for most of this year, and even went above capacity, briefly, over the summer. The facility has a maximum capacity of 1,575.

VanDerhoef says the increased volume of detainees has impacted access to quality legal counsel and created other issues for detainees.

“We understand the contract that the GEO Group, who runs the facility, has with the Department of Homeland Security, as they are to provide by the contract 10 spaces or rooms for legal visits. They’ve never provided that, in the time that I have been working with people down there,” he said. “In fact, it was seven rooms, [and] more recently, two of them have been taken away. They’re using ... two entirely, now, for court hearings being done by video by judges across the country. So we’ve seen a dramatic increase in the population, and in fact a decrease in actual physical access to be able to visit our clients.”

ICE did not respond to our follow-up questions about allegations that attorneys have been having a hard time adequately preparing their cases with clients; the reduction in contact visit rooms; and the high volume of daily hearings. GEO Group did respond, but its spokesperson, Christopher V. Ferreira, referred us to an initial email statement:

“The support services GEO provides include around-the-clock access to medical care, in-person and virtual legal and family visitation.”

VanDerhoef also says under the Trump administration, a vital legal lifeline was cut — the Legal Orientation Program, run by the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project.

“With the ending of the Legal Orientation Program, it at least provided individuals with the legal assessment to know what their options are; and with issues of limiting access, it’s pretty clear that the goal is to have more cases conclude in the immigration court without lawyers because it certainly is easier and quicker to deport somebody who doesn’t know their legal rights,” Larkin explained.

In late September, a federal judge ruled that a Tacoma immigration court’s practice of denying bond to detained noncitizens was unlawful. Nationally, the Trump administration touted the bond policy against immigrants who entered the country illegally.

The Northwest Immigrant Rights Project filed the class action lawsuit last spring against the Tacoma immigration courts.

VanDerhoef says that despite the ruling, the courts have not complied in automatically granting bond, or at least presenting the opportunity to request it.

“What we’re seeing, this is pretty unprecedented. But in recent weeks, we’re seeing the immigration judges not following that order, and we’re still waiting to see. They may be waiting for further guidance, but it’s pretty clear they are bound by that order. And they’re still not granting bonds for people that this federal judge has decided should be eligible for them,” Larkin said.",https://www.cascadepbs.org/content/images/size/w1200/2025/10/The_Newsfeed_10.24.png,N,,2025-10-24 18:56:48.462106

It is unclear if the Supreme Court will still be closed to the public come Nov. 5.
The basis of the consolidated case The Supreme Court said in September it would hear the case, after a series of lower court rulings that invalidated the tariffs but allowed them to remain in place for the nation’s top court to have the final word.
The federal government has argued that if the Supreme Court ultimately sided with lower courts and blocked Trump’s tariffs, it may deliver a financial blow to the U.S. Treasury.","WASHINGTON — Less than two weeks away from oral arguments before the Supreme Court about the legality of sweeping tariffs that President Donald Trump placed on most countries, the nation’s top court is setting more of the ground rules for the proceedings, as the president is accusing a U.S. ally of trying to “illegally influence” the outcome.

Trump contended that Ontario, the most populous province in Canada, was seeking to tip the scales of the case in favor of the small business and state plaintiffs seeking to upend the levies by placing TV ads using excerpts from a 1987 speech by former President Ronald Reagan.

Trump posted on his Truth Social site Friday morning that Canada was “trying to illegally influence the United States Supreme Court in one of the most important rulings in the history of our Country.”

In the radio address, Reagan said of tariffs that “such trade barriers hurt every American worker and consumer.’’ Ontario premier Doug Ford said later Friday that the ad would be taken down.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to allow an extended 80-minute period of oral arguments on Nov. 5 – with 40 minutes for the U.S. solicitor general and 20 minutes each for lawyers representing the American companies and states that are suing.

In its decision, the court also denied additional oral arguments by separate plaintiffs who argue that tariffs have unlawfully burdened commerce and travel essential of indigenous communities living along the border between the U.S. and Canada.

Trump suggested earlier this month that he plans to attend the Supreme Court proceedings, which could be the first time a sitting president does so. The Supreme Court Historical Society said Friday that there is no record to their knowledge that it has ever happened before.

It is unclear if the Supreme Court will still be closed to the public come Nov. 5. The highest court announced last week it has shut its doors to the public ""until further notice"" due to the ongoing government shutdown.

The basis of the consolidated case

The Supreme Court said in September it would hear the case, after a series of lower court rulings that invalidated the tariffs but allowed them to remain in place for the nation’s top court to have the final word. Opening arguments next month were originally scheduled for the typical one hour.

Trump announced in April that he was imposing what he called “Liberation Day” tariffs, including a 10% import duty across the board and additional levies that vary by country. Seperately, the president placed duties on Canada, Mexico and China, saying that the threat of illegal immigration and drugs from the countries constituted a ""national emergency"" under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act.

The Trump administration contends the president has the ability to impose tariffs under the IEEPA by declaring that the U.S. is facing a national emergency.

The past few days have seen a flurry of amicus briefs, including one filed Friday by economics, politics and law of international trade professors that contends the president must instead abide by a different law on trade: Section 122.

That law –– a part of the Trade Act of 1974 — allows the president to place “temporary import surcharges” to address “fundamental international payments problems” but restricts the placement to 150 days and 15% — on top of duties already in place.

Solicitor General Dean John Sauer referenced Section 122 in a filing to the nation’s top court but contended that it should be viewed as “complementary” to the statute Trump has used as the basis for his tariffs.

“Section 122 and IEEPA each provides an independent source of authority,” Saur wrote in his brief. “The President’s choice to exercise his authority under one does not compel him to comply with the terms of the other.”

Who are the parties involved?

Separate cases involving small businesses and states — V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. Trump and Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump — have been working their way through the courts in recent months, and will be considered in tandem by the nation’s highest court.

V.O.S. Selections — a New York-based wine business — is joined in its litigation by Genova Pipe, a plastic pipe manufacturer; MicroKits, which makes electronic toys and musical devices; FishUSA, a fishing equipment company; and Terry Precision Cycling, a women’s cycling brand.

The states of Oregon, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York and Vermont have also signed onto their lawsuit.

In the other case originating in Washington, D.C., two Chicago area educational companies — Learning Resources and hand2mind — argued that their businesses made it through the COVID-19 pandemic but that the tariffs “are now posing the greatest challenge of their existence.”

The CEO of Learning Resource estimated in April that the company’s tariff bill would rise from $2.3 million in 2024 to $100.2 million this year.

Revenue of Trump’s tariffs to date

Tariffs have already raised about $200 billion for the country’s coffers so far this year, the Congressional Budget Office reported.

The federal government has argued that if the Supreme Court ultimately sided with lower courts and blocked Trump’s tariffs, it may deliver a financial blow to the U.S. Treasury.

“If the United States were forced to pay back the trillions of dollars committed to us, America could go from strength to failure the moment such an incorrect decision took effect,” Sauer said in a letter to a federal appeals court earlier this year.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/supreme_court_AP_25135471977857_NAT_1020,N,,2025-10-24 19:17:27.931503

In a statement, the US Treasury accused Petro of failing to rein in Colombia’s cocaine industry and of shielding criminal groups from accountability.

The Treasury cited Petro’s “Total Peace” plan, an initiative designed to bring an end to Colombia’s six-decade-long internal conflict through negotiations with armed rebels and criminal organisations.

“Since President Gustavo Petro came to power, cocaine production in Colombia has exploded to the highest rate in decades, flooding the United States and poisoning Americans,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement.

“President Petro has allowed drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity.”

Petro, a prolific social media user, quickly shot back that the Treasury’s decision was the culmination of longstanding Republican threats, including from US Senator Bernie Moreno, a critic of his presidency.

“Bernie Moreno’s threat has indeed been fulfilled,” Petro wrote on the social media platform X. “My wife, my children, and I have been placed on the OFAC [Office of Foreign Assets Control] list.”

He argued that his country had been “fighting drug trafficking effectively for decades” and suggested he would contest the sanctions in the US court system.

“Not one step back and never on my knees,” Petro wrote, pledging not to back down from the fight.

Friday’s designation puts Petro in a relatively small group of top international leaders to be sanctioned by the US.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has faced individual sanctions for human rights abuses in his country, and Russian President Vladimir Putin was also hit with sanctions following his country’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

The sanctions against Petro, however, come as the left-wing leader and former rebel reaches the twilight of his presidency. Term-limited, he is slated to step down in 2026.

Petro is considered the first left-wing president in modern Colombian history.

It also marks the latest action the Trump administration has taken against one of its most prominent critics in Latin America.

A history of confrontation

The feud between Petro and Trump began shortly after the US president returned to the White House for a second term on January 20.

Trump moved swiftly to fulfil a campaign promise: the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants from the US.

Images of shackled immigrants being herded onto US military aeroplanes soon filled the international media. Petro was among those who expressed outrage on social media.

In the wee hours of January 26, he threatened not to accept two deportation flights that were in midair from the US. “The US cannot treat Colombian migrants as criminals,” he wrote on social media.

Trump responded by threatening the country with 30 percent tariffs, and Petro backed down.

But the two have continued to butt heads over issues ranging from immigration to human rights to how Colombia should tamp down on its illicit cocaine production.

The South American country remains the world’s largest source of coca, a leaf that can be processed into cocaine. Last year, the United Nations reported that Colombia had marked its 10th consecutive year of increasing cocaine production, with a 53 percent increase over 2022, when Petro took office.

Trump, however, has increasingly leaned into the fight against drug trafficking as he flexes his might abroad, particularly in Latin America.

He has, for example, wielded the threat of elevated tariffs on US imports to pressure other countries, including neighbours like Canada and Mexico, to combat drug smuggling.

Clashes over military strikes

Since September 2, Trump has followed his threats with military action, carrying out a series of missile strikes on nautical vessels in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean.

The targets, Trump has said, were drug traffickers. But Petro has argued that the strikes amount to extrajudicial killings.

He has used his social media platform to highlight cases like that of fisherman Alejandro Carranza, who reportedly died in one of the strikes. At least 34 people have been killed in the bombings, some of them Colombian.

“These are not war casualties,” Petro wrote in one social media post on Friday, shortly before the sanctions were announced. “They are murders.”

Petro took that message to the stage at the United Nations in New York in September, blasting the Trump administration for its actions.

“The violent war on drugs was a failure, and I replaced it with an effective anti-trafficking policy,” Petro told the international body.

“Was it really necessary to shoot missiles on unarmed poor young people in the Caribbean? The anti-drug policy is meant to stop cocaine that is coming to the United States. The anti-drug policy is to dominate the peoples of the south as a whole.”

Petro was seen afterwards on the streets of New York City protesting with pro-Palestinian demonstrators in opposition to Israel’s war on Gaza.

Within hours, the Trump administration, which has compared such protests to “terrorism”, yanked Petro’s visa “due to his reckless and incendiary actions”.

That same month, the administration also decertified Colombia as a partner in the US’s continuing “war on drugs”.

Ending Colombia’s aid

Relations between Trump and Petro have only grown more tense since.

Just this week, Trump announced on his platform Truth Social that he would be ending all aid to Colombia, the largest recipient of US funds in South America.

He also warned the US could take a more active role in the region if Petro does not do more to stem the cocaine trade.

“Petro, a low rated and very unpopular leader, with a fresh mouth toward America, better close up these killing fields immediately, or the United States will close them up for him, and it won’t be done nicely,” Trump wrote.

It was a threat Trump would repeat days later, on October 22, in a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.

“He’d better watch it, or we’ll take very serious action against him and his country,” Trump said of Petro. “What he has led his country into is a death trap.”

Petro, in response, threatened to sue Trump for slander. The US leader has called Petro a “drug dealer”, “thug”, and “bad guy”, among other things.

The spat between the two presidents has left their countries’ diplomatic relations frayed, with Colombia recently recalling its ambassador from Washington, DC.

But traditionally, Colombia had been one of the US’s top allies in the region and a key partner in its efforts to stem the drug trade.

Friday’s sanctions freeze all property Petro, his family and Interior Minister Benedetti may have in the US and bar US-based entities from doing business with them.

Benedetti, for his part, framed the sanctions as a form of retribution for standing up for Petro.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-23T175415Z_1797378855_RC2THHA5XRRL_RTRMADP_3_COLOMBIA-POLITICS-1761334187.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-10-24 18:01:54.805599

The Trump administration notified a federal judge in Maryland on Friday that it intended to deport Abrego Garcia to the West African country, which it said had agreed to accept him.

The Trump administration notified a federal judge in Maryland on Friday that it intended to deport Abrego Garcia to the West African country, which it said had agreed to accept him.

“Federal Defendants have received diplomatic assurances regarding the treatment of third country individuals removed to Liberia from the United States and are making the final necessary arrangements for Petitioner’s removal,” Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate wrote in the court filing. “Defendants expect to provide the requisite formal notice of the new designation of Liberia to Petitioner later today.”

Abrego Garcia has no ties to Liberia, according to one of his attorneys.

He was mistakenly deported to his native El Salvador in March, capturing national attention. The Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June to face human-smuggling charges — to which he pleaded not guilty — and has sought to deport him to multiple countries without success.

He reunited with his family for a weekend in Maryland before ICE took him into custody on Aug. 25, and he has been detained ever since while fighting his deportation.

During an Oct. 10 hearing in federal court challenging the lawfulness of his ICE detention, Abrego Garcia’s legal team said he was ready to leave the country for Costa Rica. He previously rejected a plea deal to go to the country under the condition that he plead guilty to the human-smuggling charges.

Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Abrego Garcia’s attorneys, said the government’s choice to send his client to Liberia instead of Costa Rica was designed to inflict maximum hardship. The attorney also expressed concern about the possibility of Liberian officials deporting Abrego Garcia to El Salvador.

“Having struck out with Uganda, Eswatini and Ghana, ICE now seeks to deport our client Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Liberia — a country with which he has no connection, thousands of miles from his family and home in Maryland,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, who is presiding over the suit challenging his detention, repeatedly clashed with attorneys representing the federal government — first, over their initial refusal to bring Abrego Garcia back from El Salvador and, most recently, over their failure to produce information about ICE’s plan to deport him.

The announcement of the second deportation comes two weeks after a hearing during which an ICE removals operations official testified that the three African countries to which the Trump administration had threatened to send Abrego Garcia — Uganda, Eswatini and Ghana — had declined to receive him.

Liberia’s foreign minister, Sara Beysolow Nyanti, met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Oct. 16, according to a press release from the country’s ministry of foreign affairs. At the meeting, the countries agreed to strengthen Liberia’s ability to manage migration issues.

United States and has been relied on by courts across the country.
Again in 1946, the Court in Knauer v. United States affirmed its commitment to ensuring that naturalized citizens are able to fully exercise their First Amendment rights.
Two years later, in Chaunt v. United States, the Supreme Court imposed a fourth requirement: materiality.
If a naturalized citizen drove 60 miles per hour in a 55 mph zone, Roberts pointed out, but later answered “no” to that question, his citizenship could be revoked.
Such a result could lead to nearly any naturalized citizen being stripped of the right to citizenship for a failure to disclose even the most minor offense.","Denaturalization Laws and Supreme Court Rulings

The Constitution grants Congress the power to establish a “uniform rule of naturalization” — to set the terms and conditions under which a foreign-born national may become a citizen. The authority to revoke citizenship, however, is limited. In 1967’s Afroyim v. Rusk, the Supreme Court affirmed the principle announced 70 years earlier in United States v. Wong Kim Ark that the Constitution does not give Congress the authority to forcibly deprive a naturalized American of citizenship: The 14th Amendment protects “every citizen of this Nation against a congressional forcible destruction of his citizenship, whatever his creed, color, or race.”

The only situation in which citizenship can be revoked without the citizen’s consent is if it is unlawfully procured. This rule was cited by the Court in the 1981 case Fedorenko v. United States and has been relied on by courts across the country.

The law provides two paths for the government to revoke unlawfully procured citizenship: civil and criminal proceedings.

The civil statutes authorizing revocation have a long and complex history, but the current law, 8 USC 1451(a), provides that a naturalized person’s citizenship can be taken away if it was “illegally procured” or “procured by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation.”

To show that these conditions are met, the government must establish that the person did not meet the three requirements for citizenship when they applied. The first two are objective: five years of lawful permanent residence in the United States with physical presence for at least half that time and continuous residence since the application was filed.

The third requirement is “good moral character,” which is not defined in immigration law. The statute does, however, provide a list of behaviors or activities that preclude a finding of good moral character — including certain criminal offenses, participation in persecution or Nazi genocide, and false testimony for the purpose of obtaining an immigration benefit. The law also says that even if someone is not within the listed categories, an adjudicator is not precluded from finding a lack of good moral character “for other reasons.”

This gives adjudicators considerable leeway when considering whether people qualify for citizenship in the first instance. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services recently announced policies that further expand that discretion. The government can also seek to revoke citizenship by claiming the citizen misrepresented or withheld information about some activity that showed a lack of good moral character.

While the civil revocation provision in section 1451(a) looks at a person’s actions prior to naturalization, another provision of the civil code, section 1451(c), allows the government to pursue denaturalization for actions taken up to five years after naturalization on the theory that behavior within that period shows a lack of allegiance to the United States at the time of naturalization. Under section 1451(c), joining or being affiliated with certain organizations or advocating certain views in the period following naturalization is prima facie evidence that citizenship was obtained by “concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation.” The types of affiliations that can trigger this rule are broad, extending to organizations that advocate destruction of property.

This may appear to leave room for the government to target naturalized citizens based on First Amendment–protected activity, such as joining a protest arranged by an organization that could be regarded as advocating for the destruction of property. The Trump administration has arrested, detained, and deported pro-Palestinian protesters who have attended demonstrations where property was damaged. Denaturalizations could become an extension of that effort.

Alternatively, the government may commence a criminal prosecution under 18 USC 1425, which requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that an individual “knowingly procur[ed] or attempt[ed] to procure, contrary to law, the naturalization or evidence of naturalization or of citizenship.” Such cases must be brought within 10 years of the offense. Conviction requires the government to establish that the citizen lied about facts that either would have led the immigration official to deny naturalization or would have led to discovery of other facts warranting a denial.

However, the courts have imposed significant constraints on these citizenship-stripping laws, particularly in cases where the government seems to be targeting citizens’ association or speech.

Limits on Stripping U.S. Citizenship

In 1824, the Supreme Court held that a naturalized citizen is “a member of the society, possessing all the rights of a native citizen, and standing, in the view of the Constitution, on the footing of a native.” Since the 1940s, it has issued a series of decisions recognizing the importance of citizenship rights. Among other things, the Court has rejected congressional attempts to treat naturalized Americans differently than the native born and rebuffed attempts to denaturalize Americans based on their country of origin, beliefs, or statements, no matter how unpopular or even odious. Unless a citizen consents to give up their citizenship, the government must prove that they illegally acquired that citizenship in the first place and meet an elevated burden of proof.

Fundamental Protections

The Supreme Court jurisprudence constraining the government’s attempts to strip citizenship from Americans developed around the time of World War II and in its aftermath. The legal disputes often involved the most unsympathetic people — alleged Nazis and communists — and arose at a time when the United States was at war with Germany and in the throes of the Second Red Scare and McCarthyism. Rather than cave to the political climate, the Court articulated several key principles and rules limiting the government’s authority to denaturalize citizens that remain in effect today.

In the 1943 case Schneiderman v. United States, the Court emphasized that citizenship is a “precious right” and it would “be difficult to exaggerate its value and importance.” Taking it away is “more serious than a taking of one’s property, or the imposition of a fine or other penalty.” This recognition permeates its subsequent decisions and forms the basis for the stringent standards it set.

The Schneiderman Court also showed its skepticism of denaturalization attempts that have a nexus to First Amendment–protected speech and activities. The justices rejected the Roosevelt administration’s attempt to revoke the citizenship of a Nazi sympathizer, holding that his country of origin, beliefs, or statements — even if hated by a majority of the country — were irrelevant to the determination of whether to take away his citizenship. Rather, rights to “liberty in thought and action [belong] to all those upon whom the right of American citizenship has been conferred by statute, as well as to the native born.” Concurring, Justice Wiley Rutledge said that a citizen living under a threat of denaturalization could never be truly free. “If he belonged to ‘off-color’ organizations, or held too radical or, perhaps, too reactionary views . . . he could not open his mouth without his words being held against him. . . Such a citizen would not be admitted to liberty. His best course would be silence or hypocrisy. This is not citizenship,” he wrote.

Again in 1946, the Court in Knauer v. United States affirmed its commitment to ensuring that naturalized citizens are able to fully exercise their First Amendment rights. Although the Court concluded that Knauer had fraudulently procured his citizenship, it warned that naturalized citizens must have “the right to speak freely, to criticize officials and administrators, and to promote changes in our laws;” to do otherwise would “make denaturalizations the ready instrument for political persecutions.”

The Court has also consistently turned back congressional attempts to impose conditions on naturalized citizens. In Schneider v. Rusk, the justices struck down a law that allowed the government to revoke the citizenship of naturalized Americans who lived in their native country. No such rule applied to native-born Americans. This discrepancy, the Court held, relied on “the impermissible assumption that naturalized citizens as a class are less reliable, and bear less allegiance to this country than do the native born.” The Afroyim Court invalidated a law that would have stripped a naturalized citizen of his citizenship for moving to Israel and voting in its elections. Congress does not have “any general power, express or implied, to take away an American citizen’s citizenship without his assent,” it ruled.

Heightened Scrutiny

In addition to establishing fundamental rules recognizing citizenship as a right of the highest order, insisting on equal rights for naturalized and native-born citizens, and protecting naturalized citizens’ First Amendment rights, the Court established stringent rules for reviewing citizenship stripping cases.

Clear, unequivocal, and convincing proof

The Court has repeatedly held that, given the vital interest at stake, citizenship cannot be taken away in a civil proceeding unless the government provides clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that revocation is warranted. This standard is “substantially identical with that required in criminal cases — proof beyond a reasonable doubt.”

In-depth scrutiny of record

In applying the clear, unequivocal, and convincing standard, the Court reviews the record with heightened scrutiny. In the 1944 case Baumgartner v. United States, for example, the Court did not defer to the lower court’s finding that a German-born citizen had not truly and fully renounced his allegiance to Germany and did not intend to support the Constitution and laws of the United States. Instead, it conducted a detailed review of the timing and content of Baumgartner’s statements and diary entries about the virtues of Hitler and the German government and concluded that the evidence was insufficient to “penalize a naturalized citizen for the expression of silly or even sinister-sounding views which native-born citizens utter with impunity.”

Similarly in Schneiderman, the Court conducted a thorough canvass of Schneiderman’s Communist writings to conclude that his membership in the Communist Party did not mean that he supported overthrowing the American government by force and thus was not attached to the Constitution.

Proof of willfulness and materiality

As the United States entered the Cold War and Sen. Joe McCarthy (R-WI) led the House Un-American Activities Committee to root out suspected Communists, the Supreme Court again stepped in to limit citizenship-stripping efforts. In Nowak v. United States in 1958, the Court required the government to show that a citizen’s alleged opposition to the principles of the Constitution was willful; mere support for the Communist Party, which held those views was not enough.

Two years later, in Chaunt v. United States, the Supreme Court imposed a fourth requirement: materiality. The government had filed a civil case arguing that Chaunt’s citizenship should be revoked because he falsely denied membership in the Communist Party, lacked the requisite attachment to the Constitution, and had concealed and misrepresented his record of arrests. The Court held that the government had to show that any information Chaunt concealed would have warranted denial of citizenship or might have been useful in an investigation leading to the discovery of other facts justifying denial of citizenship. The “tenuous” connection between Chant’s prior arrests and his connection to the Communist party did not meet that standard.

By the time the Court issued Afroyim in 1967 holding that unlawful procurement was the only circumstance in which a naturalized American could be deprived of citizenship then, the Court had established strict legal requirements for citizenship stripping.

In 1988, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the majority in Kungys v. United States and summarized the four-part test for civil denaturalization when citizenship was unlawfully procured: the naturalized citizen must have misrepresented or concealed some fact, the misrepresented or concealed fact must have been willful, the fact must have been material, and the naturalized citizen must have procured citizenship as a result of the misrepresentation or concealment.

The only issues in dispute in the case were materiality and procurement. The majority opinion defined the materiality test as whether the misrepresentation or concealment had a natural tendency to produce the conclusion — by evidence that is clear, unequivocal, and convincing — that the applicant was qualified for citizenship. As for the requirement of procurement as a result of misrepresentation or concealment, the majority held that a material misrepresentation created a presumption that the naturalized citizen had been unqualified, but that she could rebut that presumption with a showing by a preponderance of the evidence that she actually had met the statutory requirement for naturalization.

Criminal Denaturalization

The Court has held firm to these principles in criminal denaturalization cases as well. In 2017, in Maslenjak v. United States, the Court considered criminal denaturalization pursuant to 18 USC 1425 which — similarly to the civil denaturalization provision — provides that an American’s citizenship can be revoked if the individual knowingly procured, contrary to law, the naturalization of any person.

A unanimous Court rejected the government’s argument that any false statement in the naturalization process was sufficient to establish that the citizen “knowingly procured” their citizenship unlawfully. Rather, the unlawful act — in this case, making a false statement — must have a causal connection to the acquisition of citizenship, meaning be material.

During oral argument, Chief Justice John Roberts showed the absurdity of ruling otherwise. The naturalization application asks whether the applicant ever committed a crime or offense for which he was not arrested. If a naturalized citizen drove 60 miles per hour in a 55 mph zone, Roberts pointed out, but later answered “no” to that question, his citizenship could be revoked. Such a result could lead to nearly any naturalized citizen being stripped of the right to citizenship for a failure to disclose even the most minor offense.

In sum, even during periods of heightened suspicion of foreign nationals, the Court has imposed strict limits on government efforts to strip citizenship, including a high burden of proof, de novo examination of the record, and materiality and willfulness requirements.",https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/styles/1050x525/public/2025-10/denaturalizationarticle.jpg?itok=c8Fu1iCN,N,,2025-10-24 17:18:04.804228

The students were arrested Thursday after they were “beat up” and “assaulted” by officers at the scene, according to protesters and Chicago officials. One student was released at the scene, and another student was released hours later, they said.

“This is not even about immigration,” alderman Sigcho-Lopez said during a press conference outside Benito Juarez High School Thursday. “This is about crushing dissent.”

The streets of the Little Village neighborhood filled up with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol agents for a second day in a row Thursday, with protesters seeking to block officers from targeting residents and businesses without a warrant.

“These kids were en route to school. They saw the horrific scenes when you see masked individuals coming for your neighbors,” Sigcho-Lopez said. “They were unfortunately detained. One had blood on his face.”

Liz Winfield, a teacher at Benito Juarez and a member of the Chicago Teachers Union, said she noticed one of her students was missing while taking attendance.

“I marked a junior student absent, not because that student was sick or his bus was late. It was because ICE snatched him up on his way to school,” she said.

“I am so angry and frustrated that these students have to add this worry to their school day,” she added. “They should be worrying about college acceptance or if they’re going to get a date for the school dance. It is outrageous and unacceptable.”

Federal agents detained at least seven people in Little Village, and suburban Cicero, on Wednesday. Two staff members of alderman Michael Rodriguez were arrested and released the next morning, according to his office.

Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino, who is leading the push in Chicago, was captured on video Thursday appearing to toss tear gas canisters at the crowds in Little Village, which lawyers argue violates a court order against indiscriminate use of riot weapons during protests.

Lawyers for a group of protesters, reporters and faith leaders who attended demonstrations warned a federal judge that Bovino “was simply ignoring your order.”

They called on Judge Sara Ellis “to conduct an inquiry into this incident and order relief that the court deems proper,” given the “flagrancy of the apparent violation.”

In a statement to The Independent, Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin accused “rioters” in a crowd of 75 to 100 people of shooting fireworks at agents during an enforcement operation Thursday.

A Border Patrol van carrying detainees was “attacked” by a mob that “grew more hostile and violent, advancing toward agents and began throwing rocks and other objects at agents, including one that struck Chief Greg Bovino in the head,” according to McLaughlin.

She said agents repeated “multiple warnings” to leave before firing tear gas at demonstrators.

“The use of chemical munitions was conducted in full accordance with CBP policy and was necessary to ensure the safety of both law enforcement and the public,” McLaughlin said.

Sigcho-Lopez called the officers’ actions “illegal.”

“They detained them over what? There’s no charges,” he said. “We want to understand why they were detained to begin with.”

Thursday’s volatile scenes and arrests took place as members of Chicago’s school board called on the city’s public school system to hold virtual classes to avoid the same scenario. Chicago Public Schools said it cannot order those changes without a state of emergency declaration from Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker.

Federal agents — which have historically been prohibited from enforcement actions in sensitive areas like schools — are intensifying raids and arrests in the Chicago area, which has emerged as a flashpoint for protest against the president’s mass deportation agenda.

A lawsuit accuses federal agents there of “indiscriminately” tossing flash grenades and tear gas and firing guns loaded with chemical irritants and rubber bullets against demonstrators.

Protesters and reporters have faced “serious injuries” and “some are being randomly singled out for arrest” and detained inside an ICE facility, where they “are detained incommunicado for hours,” according to the complaint.

Trump has deployed hundreds of National Guard members to the state, which a federal judge has temporarily blocked, as a multi-state legal challenge against the administration’s federalized troops plays out.

“I’m mad as hell,” Illinois state Sen. Celina Villanueva said Thursday. “What I saw today is a continuation of fascism that Donald Trump and his cronies are trying to instill throughout our entire country.”","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/10/24/14/15/Federal-Enforcement-Chicago-9cdy7b4m.jpeg?trim=1,0,1,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-10-24 17:17:46.905295

The Texas Supreme Court recently finalized amendments to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 201, implementing the Uniform Interstate Depositions and Discovery Act (“UIDDA”).[1] The amendments took effect August 31, 2025, marking a shift in how parties conduct interstate discovery involving Texas witnesses.

By adopting the UIDDA, Texas has joined the overwhelming majority of states in streamlining interstate discovery. Massachusetts, Missouri, and New Hampshire remain the only states that have yet to adopt some version of the UIDDA, leaving them as outliers in an otherwise uniform national system.

What Changed

For decades, attorneys seeking evidence in Texas for an out-of-state proceeding were first required to obtain a “mandate, writ, or commission” from the court where the lawsuit was pending. This process was cumbersome because it involved unnecessary delays and expenses.

Now, under Rule 201.3, a party simply submits an out-of-state subpoena to a court clerk in the Texas county where discovery is sought. The clerk must then promptly issue an equivalent Texas subpoena incorporating the same terms—with no judicial stamp of approval required.

The new rule applies to subpoenas requiring witnesses to:

Attend and give testimony at depositions (oral examination or written questions); or

Produce documents or tangible things.

Importantly, this request does not constitute an appearance in Texas courts, which means out-of-state attorneys can obtain subpoenas without needing to be licensed in Texas, seek pro hac vice admission, or hire local counsel to issue and serve the subpoena.

Once issued, the Texas subpoena must be served according to Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 176 and 205. From there, Texas law controls. Any discovery disputes, whether concerning protective orders or enforcement, get resolved in Texas courts.

One Key Limitation: Property Inspections

Texas’s version of the UIDDA, however, includes a notable exception that prevents clerks from issuing subpoenas for premises inspections. Litigants will still need a court order for subpoenas seeking inspection of property. Rule 201.3 covers testimony and documents, while carving out and preserving Texas’s traditional requirement for judicial oversight of property inspections.

Why This Matters

The new rule simplifies interstate discovery by eliminating jurisdictional hurdles, reducing costs, and accelerating the discovery process. By directing clerks to act “promptly” and without the need for judicial intervention, the UIDDA framework removes delays that previously plagued litigation across state lines. This change benefits both out-of-state parties seeking discovery in Texas and Texas litigants conducting discovery in other UIDDA states that require reciprocity.

Companies with employees, documents, or operations in Texas can expect to see an increase in out-of-state discovery requests, as the process is now more efficient for parties in litigation elsewhere to obtain testimony and documents from Texas witnesses. Businesses should review their document retention policies and ensure employees understand their potential obligations when served with out-of-state subpoenas.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.7163_543.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 22:17:40.431476

The Salvadoran national's case has become a magnet for opposition to President Donald Trump’s immigration policies since he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, in violation of a settlement agreement. He was returned to the U.S. in June after the U.S. Supreme Court said the administration had to work to bring him back. Since he cannot be re-deported to El Salvador, ICE has been seeking to deport him to a series of African countries.

Meanwhile, a federal judge in Maryland has previously barred his immediate deportation. Abrego Garcia's lawsuit there claims the Trump administration is illegally using the deportation process to punish him for the embarrassment of his earlier mistaken deportation.

A Friday court filing from the Department of Homeland Security notes that “Liberia is a thriving democracy and one of the United States’s closest partners on the African continent.” Its national language is English; its constitution “provides robust protections for human rights;” and Liberia is “committed to the humane treatment of refugees,” the filing reads. It concludes that Abrego Garcia could be deported as soon as Oct. 31.

“After failed attempts with Uganda, Eswatini, and Ghana, ICE now seeks to deport our client, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, to Liberia, a country with which he has no connection, thousands of miles from his family and home in Maryland,” a statement from attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg reads. “Costa Rica stands ready to accept him as a refugee, a viable and lawful option. Yet the government has chosen a course calculated to inflict maximum hardship. These actions are punitive, cruel, and unconstitutional.”

Abrego Garcia has an American wife and child and lived in Maryland for years, but he immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager.

The letter cites several federal statutes that criminalize assaulting, impeding or conspiring against federal officers, and notes the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution dictates state officials cannot prosecute federal agents for actions taken in the course of their duties.

Blanche directed California leaders to ""preserve all written and electronic communications and records related to any attempts or efforts to impede or obstruct federal law enforcement officials,"" forewarning that the Department of Justice will investigate and prosecute any official who violates federal statutes.

President Trump announced a day earlier that he had called off the deployment in San Francisco after being persuaded by local tech leaders. But elected officials elsewhere in the Bay Area, who lacked similar assurances, had wondered whether federal agents would still conduct raids in their cities this weekend.

On Friday, the two federal officials said that the operation had been canceled throughout the Bay Area and that U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents were not expected to conduct the enforcement action that had been planned. Department of Homeland Security officials also called off plans to bring staff members from Los Angeles to the Bay Area to help with the operation, one of the federal officials said.

Mayor Barbara Lee of Oakland confirmed later on Friday that federal agents had canceled their operation in Oakland and the rest of the Bay Area. She said that she was told that by Yesenia Sanchez, the Alameda County sheriff, who was in communication with federal officials.

Other Bay Area leaders expressed cautious relief.

“While I am glad that President Trump called off the surge in federal immigration enforcement in our region, we must remain vigilant,” Jesse Arreguín, a Democratic state senator who represents East Bay communities, said in a statement. “Our immigrant neighbors, which are the backbone of our economy, are living in fear.”

Earlier this week, C.B.P. agents began heading to the Bay Area for an enforcement push that was expected to start this weekend.

The agents began staging at the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda, a military installation near Oakland, drawing more than 200 hundred protesters who opposed the immigration raids. At least two Border Patrol vehicles were seen entering the base on Thursday morning.

Mr. Trump said on Thursday that he had been convinced by tech executives with Bay Area ties that Mayor Daniel Lurie of San Francisco had made progress this year on reducing crime in his city.

But leaders and activists in Oakland, which borders Alameda, said at the time that they hadn’t been given any indication of whether the Trump administration would cancel enforcement plans there. In August, Mr. Trump named Oakland as one of several cities that he was eyeing for federal enforcement and National Guard troops because he said it had high crime rates.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/24/multimedia/24NAT-BAY-AREA-RAID-thlq/24NAT-BAY-AREA-RAID-thlq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 16:57:04.538546

Although the statute doesn’t explicitly grant authority to impose tariffs, President Trump announced a set of sweeping tariffs in April 2025, triggering a global stock market crash. Trump argued that IEEPA implicitly authorized his actions—a claim no prior president had ever made in the statute’s nearly fifty-year history.

Learning Resources, Inc., an educational toy manufacturer, successfully challenged Trump’s tariffs in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Although the Trump administration appealed to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, Learning Resources asked the Supreme Court to hear the case before the appellate court could rule. Separately, a group of small businesses led by V.O.S. Selections and a coalition of twelve states successfully challenged the tariffs in the United States Court of International Trade. On appeal, the Federal Circuit upheld that decision, holding that IEEPA does not authorize the sweeping tariffs that Trump imposed. The Supreme Court consolidated the two cases and agreed to expedited review.

In October 2025, the Constitutional Accountability Center filed an amicus brief supporting the challengers to the tariffs. Our brief responds to a historical argument made in support of the tariffs. According to this argument, IEEPA incorporates a traditional presidential authority to impose tariffs during wartime that traces back to the nineteenth century and was first codified in the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 (TWEA). As our brief shows, this narrative is unsound.

When the TWEA was enacted, there was no consensus about the existence of an inherent presidential authority to impose tariffs during wartime. During the nineteenth century, every imposition of presidential duties or fees in wartime generated significant constitutional controversy. Rather than demonstrating any consensus, these historical episodes reveal fierce contestation over the President’s inherent wartime authority to impose tariffs. When the Supreme Court addressed challenges to these tariffs, the Court ultimately relied on Congress’s express approval of them—leaving the separation-of-powers dispute unresolved.

We further show that, regardless of the original TWEA’s meaning, Congress later severed the Act from its war powers foundation, and IEEPA further separated peacetime emergency powers from implied wartime powers in 1977. Even assuming that law-of-war principles recognized a wartime tariff authority in 1917, and that those principles were codified in the original TWEA, that doesn’t mean that the TWEA continued to confer this authority even after it was subsequently amended. On the contrary, amendments to the TWEA in 1933 dissolved any link with wartime powers and implied tariff authority.

Moreover, when passing IEEPA in 1977, Congress recognized that decades of amendments to the Act had created a dangerously broad grant of authority. Congress’s solution was to split the statute in two: the TWEA would apply only during declared wars, while the newly enacted IEEPA would cover peacetime national emergencies with more limited grants of power to the President. Far from expanding presidential authority, Congress deliberately constrained it. Because IEEPA applies to peacetime emergencies—not wars—any claimed wartime tariff authority has no place in the statute.

The decisions of the lower courts should be affirmed—President Trump doesn’t have authority under IEEPA to single-handedly set global tariffs.",https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Web-Previews_facebook.png,N,,2025-10-24 15:16:57.601331

Federal agents have conducted raids in several Chicago neighborhoods, including Little Village, South Shore, and Brighton Park.

Large-scale immigration raids have continued in Chicago, even as the legality of deploying the National Guard awaits a decision from the Supreme Court.

On Oct. 22, federal immigration officers descended on Little Village, a South Side neighborhood at the heart of Chicago’s Mexican community. Alderperson Mike Rodriguez told USA TODAY at least eight people were arrested, four of whom were U.S. citizens.

It was the latest in President Donald Trump’s Operation Midway Blitz, his Chicago-area immigration enforcement crackdown. Trump launched the blitz on Sept. 8, saying it was needed to catch ""the worst of the worst"" criminal immigrants. Many local critics say instead innocent people are being left terrorized. As of Oct. 8, the Department of Homeland Security said it had arrested more than 1,500 people. But USA TODAY has been unable to confirm that number or track down exactly where all of the incidents are occurring. At an Oct. 20 federal court hearing, a top Homeland Security official said around 75 people had been arrested in connection with protesting immigration enforcement.

A look at some of the high-profile events, like clashes with local elected officials, a raid on a South Side apartment building and ongoing protests at an ICE facility in the suburbs, show the immigration efforts have come to neighborhoods all over the city. Here is what to know:

Little Village, heart of Chicago’s Mexican community, raided

Federal immigration enforcement agents raided the city’s longtime historic Mexican neighborhood on Oct. 22 and Oct. 23, removing several people, causing car accidents and brandishing weapons, according to residents, local leaders and advocates.

Agents in the morning descended on the commercial corridor of Little Village, a South Side neighborhood and heart of Chicago’s Mexican community. Photos and video from the scene show masked U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents sprinting after people and local business owners locking their doors ahead of agents.

""A reign of terror was brought upon our neighborhood,"" Ald. Mike Rodriguez told USA TODAY. ""They took at least eight people, of those eight, four were U.S. citizens, and two were members of my staff.""

Among the agents on the scene was Customs and Border Protection Commander at-Large Chief Gregory Bovino. The longtime Homeland Security official spearheaded the immigration enforcement crackdown in Los Angeles and is seen as directing the agents' aggressive tactics in Chicago.

Federal agents rappel from helicopters in South Shore apartment raid

Federal agents rappelled from Black Hawk helicopters. Dozens of others, their faces hidden behind masks, arrived in moving trucks. In total, 300 officers stormed a South Side apartment building that Department of Homeland Security officials say harbored criminals.

Hundreds of agents swarmed apartments in the multi-story building, detaining several American citizens, including children, for hours and netting 37 total arrests. The outcome of those arrests remains unclear.

The Chicago Sun-Times and NewsNation were among the first to report on the raid in the city’s South Shore neighborhood. The historically Black area gained a sizable Venezuelan population after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott bused tens of thousands of migrants from the border to the Democratic-led city in 2023. Many moved to the neighborhood after first being placed in city-run shelters in the area.

Videos of the raid shared online by the Department of Homeland Security show Border Patrol agents with guns drawn approaching the building in the middle of the night. Agents led shirtless men outside. The raid saw dozens arrested and the building left in shambles, according to photos shared with USA TODAY. Two ""confirmed Tren de Aragua members"" were captured, according to a Department of Homeland Security statement.

Customs and Border Protection Commander at-Large Chief Bovino was also on hand for the raid.

Broadview facility in the suburbs center of many protest clashes

The ICE facility in Broadview lies on an industrial strip surrounded by residential streets. The small village of some 8,000 people outside of Chicago is home to the region’s main immigration enforcement facility, and it has become a hotbed of clashes between federal agents and anti-immigration enforcement protesters.

DHS officials said they had arrested more than 30 people in connection with the protests as of the beginning of October, including three who had loaded guns. Agency officials did not immediately respond to requests for further information on the people arrested.

Charges against many of the protesters have been downgraded or dropped, including against two of the protesters who were found to be carrying guns. Charges against Ray Collins and Jocelyne Robledo were dropped after a grand jury declined to bring an indictment, a rarity in the federal court system.

Homeland Security officials did not provide the name of the third person they said had been arrested with a gun.

Federal agents have used chemical agents, including pepper spray and tear gas, in plain sight to disperse Chicago protesters blocking immigration enforcement vehicles. On Sept. 26, agents also fired chemical agents at protesters and journalists standing in a road leading up to the immigration enforcement facility located at 1930 Beach Street in Broadview.

Agents' use of chemical weapons on protesters, clergy and journalists resulted in a lawsuit where a federal judge on Oct. 9 ordered federal agents to limit their use of the munitions. U.S. District Judge Sara L. Ellis called agents' use of the munitions ""unprovoked"" and likely ""constituted excessive force"".

Department of Justice lawyer Eric Hamilton said in an Oct. 9 hearing that agents had used $100,000 worth of chemical weapons outside the suburban facility.

Man killed by federal immigration officers in Northwest Suburbs

Federal immigration agents fatally shot Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez in the city’s Northwest suburbs who they say was resisting arrest and dragged an agent with his car, officials said on Sep. 12. Reuters reported the incident happened in Franklin Park.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said he ignored commands from federal agents and drove his car into an officer attempting to arrest him. The agent suffered multiple injuries and is in stable condition, according to an agency statement. In body-worn camera footage from the scene, the agent describes his injuries as ""nothing major.""

DHS said in a statement that the situation arose from an ""enforcement operation targeting a criminal illegal alien"" and that agents had ""conducted a vehicle stop to arrest"" the man.

Former federal judge and prosecutor Ruben Castillo said that the shooting would be among the first incidents a new commission from the office of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker would investigate. ""There are serious questions about that shooting and that killing,"" said Castillo, who is leading the commission.

Border Patrol agent shoots woman on South Side

A Border Patrol agent in Chicago shot a woman after she and at least one other person allegedly rammed cars into vehicles carrying federal authorities, as protests over immigration enforcement intensify and the Trump administration vows to deploy federal troops to the Democratic stronghold.

Chicago residents Marimar Martinez and Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz were arrested on charges of assaulting, impeding and interfering with the work of federal agents with a deadly weapon, according to a criminal complaint filed in the Northern District of Illinois.

Martinez’s attorneys say federal agents attacked their client: “We don't think this is a complicated case,” said attorney Christopher Parente in an Oct. 15 hearing. “It's a car accident where one of the drivers gets out and shoots the other driver.”

The incident occurred in Brighton Park.

Chicago news producer handcuffed, arrested, not charged

Federal Border Patrol agents on Friday, Oct. 10, detained a Chicago news producer during an immigration enforcement operation in the neighborhood known as Lincoln Square.

Video of the incident shows masked agents holding Debbie Brockman, of WGN-TV, face down in the middle of the street as they handcuff her. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which includes Border Patrol, has accused her of throwing an object at a Border Patrol car. WGN reported that she hasn’t been charged with a crime.

A man recording the incident asked for her name. Brockman, whose LinkedIn lists her as a producer, identified herself and said she works for WGN, a Chicago-based news station. “Let them know,” she said.

Agents then placed her in the back of an unmarked gray Chrysler minivan with tinted windows as onlookers yelled at them.

Illinois state representative stopped by Border Patrol agents

Illinois Representative Hoan Huynh was pulled over by federal immigration officials on Oct. 21 in the northwest neighborhood of Albany Park, video shows. The narrator says he was following immigration officials and being followed by agents.

""I never thought I would have a gun pulled on me by ICE agents, but that’s exactly what happened to me yesterday,"" the state representative said in a post on Facebook.

Huynh said that he had been canvassing his district to inform people of their rights should they encounter immigration agents.

""I am a refugee who came to the United States with my family after fleeing an authoritarian regime in Vietnam,"" Huynh said. ""I know what it means to live in fear of the government, and I will not stand by while families here in Chicago face that same fear from ICE.""

Woman pulled out of car in West Loop school pickup line in viral video

A viral video posted Oct. 8 shows several federal immigration officers pulling a woman out of small blue SUV. Fox 32 reported it happened in the West Loop at a school pickup line in sight of other parents and children, though she was not there to pick up their children. The outlet also reported another woman was arrested, though she can’t be seen in the video. The woman being arrested said she had been followed there.

Raids in East Side and Albany Park neighborhoods have become focal point in lawsuit over agents’ use of chemical weapons

On Oct. 14, federal agents pursued a suspect in their vehicles through a neighborhood on the far Southeast Side of Chicago that resulted in a car accident. Neighborhood residents gathered to protest immigration enforcement and agents deployed chemical to disperse the crowd, Homeland Security officials said in a hearing on Oct. 20.

Ellis, the federal judge presiding over the case regarding immigration agents' use of chemical weapons, called top Homeland Security officials Kyle Harvick, deputy incident commander for Customs and Border Protection, and Shawn Byers, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement deputy field director, into court to testify regarding agents' use of chemical weapons in the incident.

Harvick defended his agents' conduct in the East Side neighborhood: ""We needed to contain that scene,"" he testified, ""and then more and more people started to come and then some of those people started to throw objects.""

A Chicago Sun-Times photo taken at the scene showing an agent pointing a weapon into the face of an unarmed teen has become the face of the kind of intimidation many Chicagoans say they are experiencing at the hands of federal agents.

Ellis has said repeatedly that she has serious concerns about whether federal officials are following her orders that they have to warn protesters ahead of using chemical weapons on them.

The judge also questioned their use of chemical weapons in a similar incident in the Albany Park neighborhood.

At an Oct. 17 news conference, Tom Carol, the pastor of a church in front of the scene of the incident in the North Side neighborhood, called the use of chemical weapons on the residential street ""outrageous.""

""ICE agents decided to come to this neighborhood and cause trouble for our community, they tried to snatch one of our neighbors on this very block right as church was letting out,"" the longtime Christ Lutheran Church pastor said. ""It was outrageous in our community to see tear gas used to disperse a non-violent crowd, we’ll continue to stand up for our neighbors.""

The Friday court filing said the West African nation has agreed to take him and argued that the country fit Abrego Garcia’s criteria.

“Although Petitioner has identified more than twenty countries that he purports to fear would persecute or torture him if he were removed there, Liberia is not on that list,” the Department of Justice (DOJ) wrote.

The Trump administration has explored a series of countries as possible deportation destinations after wrongly sending Abrego Garcia to his native El Salvador. An immigration judge in 2019 blocked him from being sent there due to gang threats against his family.

After several months being held in Salvadoran prisons, the Trump administration secured Abrego Garcia’s return, only to hit him with human smuggling charges in connection with a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee in which he was spotted with numerous men without luggage in the van.

Abrego Garcia has denied wrongdoing and has also sought to dismiss the case, arguing he is being selectively and vindictively prosecuted by the Trump administration given the interest in his story.

A Tennessee-based federal judge backed an initial request for discovery, passing a key hurdle to allow the claim to move forward.

As the case proceeds, the Justice Department has argued immigration authorities still have the right to carry out his deportation, a matter that has also been tied up in federal court in Maryland.

In various filings, the Justice Department has proposed deporting him to Uganda, Ghana and Eswatini, while Abrego Garcia has floated Costa Rica as an option.

Attorneys for Abrego Garcia have previously accused the DOJ of having “spun the globe” to pick locations to “troll” their client.

“Having struck out with Uganda, Eswatini and Ghana, ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] now seeks to deport our client Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Liberia – a country with which he has no connection, thousands of miles from his family and home in Maryland,” attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said in a statement.

“Costa Rica has agreed to accept him as a refugee, and remains a viable and lawful option. Instead, the government has chosen yet another path that feels designed to inflict maximum hardship. Their actions are punitive, cruel and unconstitutional.”

In the Friday filing, the DOJ argued Liberia should be an amenable choice for Abrego Garcia.

“Liberia is a thriving democracy and one of the United States’s closest partners on the African continent,” they wrote.

“Its national language is English, the same as the country in which Petitioner has resided for the last several years; and it modeled its constitution, which has been in place since 1986 and which provides robust protections for human rights, in large part on the U.S. Constitution. Liberia also is committed to the humane treatment of refugees.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/abregogarcia_092825ap.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-24 16:57:08.773939

“I think he’s just trying to mess with us, with our Bay Area,” said Jose Ramirez, 59.
“The federal administration, of course, has escalated its rhetoric and its enforcement posture in the Bay Area,” she said.
By Thursday evening as the sun set over the San Francisco Bay, hundreds of protesters walked from Fruitvale, along Oakland’s industrial corridors towards the entrance of the Coast Guard base.
“But I’m so proud to be in the Bay Area where people do get activated.” Sam Levin contributed reporting","It was a whirlwind, disorienting 24 hours in the San Francisco Bay Area for local leaders and organizers, who were expecting a major immigration enforcement operation in the region on Thursday.

But by mid-morning, Donald Trump announced he was calling off a federal “surge” – and telling residents to “stay tuned” for what would come next.

In the uneasy lull, many residents carried on, preparing for the worst.

Volunteers organized patrols in areas where day immigrant workers tended to congregate, and launched initiatives to help the children of undocumented workers get to and from school. Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in San Francisco and across the bay in Oakland.

“I think he’s just trying to mess with us, with our Bay Area,” said Jose Ramirez, 59. He was one of a few hundred people gathered in Fruitvale – a predominantly Latino community in east Oakland, across the bay from San Francisco. “But we’re still out here to support.”

Oakland’s mayor, Barbara Lee, said at a press conference that she was aware of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents being stationed at the local US Coast Guard base. “The federal administration, of course, has escalated its rhetoric and its enforcement posture in the Bay Area,” she said. “But let me be clear, [in] our city, as I said, we are fully prepared.”

By Thursday night, it remained unclear whether agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and CBP were still planning to ramp up enforcement in cities such as Oakland that border San Francisco.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to the Guardian’s queries, and instead linked to Trump’s Truth Social post explaining that he had called off federal agents following a call with tech leaders including the Salesforce CEO, Marc Benioff. “Friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge,” Trump wrote.

Local officials and advocates condemned Silicon Valley billionaires, including Benioff, who had previously suggested that Trump should send the national guard troops to the city.

“I condemn every tech billionaire who supported this,” said Jackie Fielder, the San Francisco city supervisor representing parts of the city’s Mission neighborhood, home to a large Chicano and the Latino community. Standing at the steps of city hall – and directly facing the massive Salesforce tower looming over the city’s skyline – Fielder said: “We are here because Benioff of Salesforce put forth this idea.”

Meanwhile, in Fielder’s district, volunteers from various community groups were geared up to respond to ramped up raids.

For weeks already, the local non-profit Homies Organizing the Mission to Empower Youth (Homey) had been deploying street patrols, to observe and report ICE activity in the area. Patrollers have yet to intervene in any arrests, said José Luis Pavón, an organizer with the group. “But the patrols are also to build community, to make sure that people know their rights, to also reassure a lot of the people who are scared, to involve small business owners, to involve neighbors, to really strengthen the community,” he said.

Following months of threats from the Trump administration to ramp up law enforcement and immigration raids in the city, the neighborhood is now prepared to respond, Pavón said. “I feel like people are starting to lose their fear. People are getting a lot more practical.”

Bay Resistance, a social justice non-profit, said it would continue to send volunteers to Home Depot stores and other areas where day laborers tend to congregate and work, to monitor for immigration agents and help inform workers about their legal rights. The Latino Task Force said it would drive students of undocumented parents to schools across the city.

“We’re ready,” said Lisa Knox, co-executive director of California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice, a non-profit that supports people in immigration detention. “We always say ‘power, not panic.’ We’re focused on getting the message out to the community that they are not alone, people have rights if they encounter ICE or federal agents, and there are rapid response networks that can provide support if they are arrested. Yes, this is frightening, but communities can organize to defend themselves.”

Groups were coordinating across the region to ensure they could mobilize wherever ICE shows up, and advocates had learned lessons from efforts in Los Angeles and Chicago, Knox said. The president’s announcement that he was calling off the troops did not alter preparations, she added: “We’re not taking Trump at his word. He’s equivocated before. We’re sticking with our plans.”

In Fruitvale, which has one of the highest concentrations of immigrants and non--citizens in Oakland, street vendors said they had seen much less foot traffic than usual. The farmers market, held in the plaza outside the transit station, was quieter than usual.

“We cannot let this happen – where people are afraid to get out of the house, where people are afraid to be seen,” said Rosemary, an 18-year-old community college student who joined the protest. She and her loved ones – almost all of whom are immigrants – created a group chat to check in with one another each hour, she said, to make sure they’re safe.

Jaime, an English language development teacher who works with elementary and middle school students in the neighborhood, said she joined up to show solidarity with her students and their families – most of whom are immigrants. Earlier that day, teachers hosted a brown bag lunch for students who were worried about a major federal deployment in the region. A group of about 20 students strategized how to create fundraisers for the families most affected by immigration raids, and reviewed information about immigrants’ legal rights to share with friends and families.

“Unfortunately … a lot of what is happening won’t feel new to our students,” said Nick, a fellow teacher. “It’s not the first time that their families have felt threatened by the presence of ICE or other immigration officials. It’s not the first time they’ve heard of members of our school community being threatened with deportation or being deported.” The Guardian is not using the teachers’ last names at their request, to protect their students.

By Thursday evening as the sun set over the San Francisco Bay, hundreds of protesters walked from Fruitvale, along Oakland’s industrial corridors towards the entrance of the Coast Guard base.

Gabriela DelaRiva, a retired nurse who lived in Alameda – the city where the base is located – began to tear up. Her grandmother, she said, had come to the US from Zacatecas, Mexico, as a child, and worked at canneries in California’s agricultural Central valley. And DelaRiva grew up to be an activist – she had marched for labor rights, and against various US military interventions and wars.

“To see progress, and then to see these things going backwards, it’s very distressing, very painful,” she said. “But I’m so proud to be in the Bay Area where people do get activated.”

What we know:

The enforcement activities are part of Operation Midway Blitz, which launched across the city in early September and remains underway.

Now, officials with the Department of Homeland Security are sharing what unfolded Wednesday, Oct. 22, during the arrests of at least nine people. They say federal agents were targeted in what they are calling ""one of its most violent days"" since beginning the operation.

Near 24th Street and Ogden Avenue, immigration officials say a Latin Kings gang member followed agents in his car and tried to ram them head-on, but instead, struck a bystander's car.

The same day, according to the DHS, officials were at a laundromat when a woman claimed she was putting out a hit on Chief Border Patrol Agent Gregory Bovino.

In other instances, they say people boxed in federal vehicles, fled on foot, and refused to obey commands.

DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin released the following statement:

""While conducting immigration enforcement operations in Cicero and Glendale Heights, agitators stalked law enforcement, rammed vehicles, fled scenes, injured agents, and caused multiple accidents across town—putting law enforcement and the public in danger. Despite the violence, CBP arrested 3 illegal aliens who were breaking our nation’s immigration laws. Six citizens were arrested for impeding and threatening to kill agents.

""Our officers are facing a surge in assaults against them as they put their lives on the line to arrest murderers, rapists, and gang members. Secretary Noem’s message to the rioters is clear: you will not stop us or slow us down. CBP and our federal law enforcement partners will continue to enforce the law. And if you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""

We play an important role — a crucial role — in the surrender of our own rights,” Carter quoted.
And we don’t exactly have the most shining health outcomes,” she said, noting this is a “really destabilizing time” to teach public health and health policy.","By SHANNON O. WELLS

Since the January inauguration of President Donald J. Trump, Pitt School of Law Professor William M. Carter Jr. said he’s “watched with horror” as the Trump administration has “purposely disregarded the rule of law,” and acted not only unconstitutionally, but also what he calls “anti-constitutional.”

“They are waging an attack on our underlying constitutional structure. These things are not just a byproduct of otherwise neutral policies. It is the rule of law itself that I believe is under attack,” said Carter, who specializes in constitutional law and civil rights, at a recent Barco Law Building forum. “One particular aspect of that that I’ve watched with equal horror is the assault on constitutional freedom of expression and the assault on issues of constitutional equal protection and equality.”

Carter’s sense of horror, however, is not accompanied by surprise.

“I think anyone who claims surprise at this point is disingenuous in that regard,” he clarified. “The Trump campaign was very clear as to how it intended to go. Having chosen that government, I don’t think we can pretend to be surprised when they do what they said they were going to do.

What Carter has been “surprised, saddened and appalled” by is “how so many of our leading institutions, universities, law firms, nonprofit organizations such as hospital systems and medical centers and others have utterly and quickly capitulated to the administration’s impacts on their rights.”

Carter shared such insights during a panel discussion held Oct. 14 in the Barco Law Building’s Alcoa Room. Around 50 people attended the event, which was called “President Trump’s Executive Policies’ Impact on Freedom of Expression, Health, and Immigration.”

Joining Carter on the panel were Miranda Yaver, assistant professor in Pitt’s Department of Health Policy; Shoba Sivaprasad Whadia, Penn State professor and director of the Center for Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at Dickinson Law School.

Tamara Dubowitz, chair and professor of epidemiology in Pitt’s School of Public Health, served as forum discussant, and Sheila Vélez Martínez, professor of asylum refugee and immigration law at Pitt’s School of Law, was panel moderator.

The panelists based their discussion on the more than 300 executive orders, memoranda and proclamations issued within the first nine months of Trump’s second term. Bypassing the legislative process to such an extent, they argued, creates a strong potential to degrade freedom of speech, immigrant rights and access to health care, among other constitutionally and legally protected rights and privileges.

Martinez started the event with a video clip of right-wing media host Tucker Carlson interviewing Russ Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget. Vought talked about the president’s need to move “executively as fast and as aggressively as possible with a radical constitutional perspective, to be able to dismantle that bureaucracy in their power centers.”

Martinez said the video “gives you an idea, and … sets the tone of what we have been seeing and why we’re focusing on executive action. Because, as of Oct. 13, (Trump) has signed 209 executive orders, 54 memoranda and 99 proclamations in the second presidential term.”

The group of experts assembled were there, she explained, to provide illumination as to what executive orders are, their legality and what have the orders meant in the areas of immigration, health, and freedom of expression.

Emphasizing the need to stand one’s ground, William Carter paraphrased from Timothy Snyder’s 2017 book, “On Tyranny”: “A cardinal rule when dealing with an authoritarian regime is ‘Do not surrender in advance.’ Most of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. The government’s reach is long, and its powers are vast, but it cannot, through sheer force, oppress an entire citizenry. We play an important role — a crucial role — in the surrender of our own rights,” Carter quoted.

“My perspective,” he continued, “is that we should not engage in anticipatory surrender. Rather, we should stand on our rights by asserting them in the public debate, as well as through the legal system, challenging the illegality of the administration’s actions in force, as to the First Amendment in particular.”

Despite the quantity of rapidly issued executive orders, constitutional and legal checks and balances remain intact, Carter noted. Lawmaking power still lies with Congress, which has the power to “promulgate bills,” which, if signed by a president become law.

“Thus Trump’s various executive orders, proclamations, dear colleague letters — I don’t know what they’re doing, paper airplanes — they are communicating, are only valid to the following extent: First, they have to be within the scope of powers that are granted to the president by the Constitution or federal law,” he said. “The president has no power beyond that granted to him by the Constitution itself or by federal statute.”

Substance vs. symbolism

An 18-year veteran of Penn State, Shoba Sivaprasad Whadia, runs an immigration rights clinic at the university and, as she said, “writes and thinks often” about choice — or “discretion” — in law.

“In the immigration space, those choices can be macro, the choices we might make as an agency; the instrument, like an executive order; the choice to issue an executive order that can impact a broad swath of people or institutions; as well as choices that are mindful,” she said. “Those are the individual decisions that officers or agents might make, like whether to arrest someone or whether to use roving patrols to ‘stop’ an individual on their way to work, or whether to take somebody into custody.

“All of these choices, even, are discretionary choices that have long been a centerpiece of the immigration system,” she noted.

As an immigration attorney who worked with the Immigration and Naturalization Service and practiced during the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Whadia said while what’s going on now is, in many ways “unprecedented, history also is repeating itself.”

“We can start from the 19th century and bring us to the national origins era, to 9/11, to the first Trump administration, to where we are now,” she said. “History is a good reason for why none of us should be surprised.”

A number of recent executive orders focused on immigration, like the recent White House order to pursue prosecutions against those who burn flags as a form of protest, Whadia acknowledged, “were symbolic.”

“So the real operationalization happened through policy or paper, not regulation, not a congressional act, and not even the executive order itself,” she said.

Several federal agencies already carry out immigration-related laws and directives. “Congress has delegated those responsibilities to agencies like the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State.”

At the same time, the Immigration and Nationality Act, passed by Congress in 1952, remains intact.

“It is the primary framework for immigration law today,” Whadia explained. “It has been compared second in complication to the U.S. tax code. So if anyone is trying to explain immigration law or policy to you in a soundbite, this is where making sure you have clear, accessible and accurate information is paramount.”

A recent White House proclamation called for a $100,000 fee for H1-B visas that allow American companies to hire non-immigrant international workers to work in the U.S.

“If you’re in rural Pennsylvania, we’re facing a huge physician shortage, much of which is being filled and fulfilled by H1-B physicians,” Whadia said. “If we drain Central Pennsylvania hospitals from H1-B positions, the people who lose are American patients.”

Upending global health safeguards

Miranda Yaver comes to the executive order topic from both the political science and public health perspectives.

“I feel really fortunate to be able to wear these two hats, (but wonder) if I’ve been cursed by a witch or something. In the first Trump administration, I was teaching law and public policy and constitutional law … and sort of thinking, now quaintly, ‘How can I possibly teach constitutional law amidst institutional arson?’” she said, drawing laughter from the crowd.

Deciding to pivot to health policy and public health when the COVID pandemic hit, she soon found herself once again teaching in targeted realms during another Trump administration.

“In my former life, I was also a stand-up comedian, so along with a team of researchers at the University of Michigan — all of us masochists in various ways — we are analyzing the Trump administration’s actions,” she said, including the number of executive orders and the role of the “not so beautiful bill,” she said of the Trump-named “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” of tax and spending policies recently passed by Congress.

What she considers considerably harmful results include pulling the U.S out from the World Health Organization (WHO), terminating staff in the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), reducing access to health care, defunding vaccine research and threatening to defund the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

“We can have the best insurance in the world, but if we don’t have doctors, we’re not going to get the care. And we don’t exactly have the most shining health outcomes,” she said, noting this is a “really destabilizing time” to teach public health and health policy.

Withdrawing from the WHO is going to be “deeply, deeply harmful to global public health on issues ranging from the health effects of childhood poverty to infectious disease prevention and surveillance.

“And for context, just because we need some more dismal news out of a lot of public health people,” she quipped, “I would say that the next pandemic is a question of if, not when, so underfunding infectious disease surveillance not a great thing.”

Aggressive offense

Following the panel presentation, Jacob Simon, a Pitt School of Law alumnus, asked about ways of “combatting” executive orders, such as seeking injunctive relief in, say, the case of a medical patient’s doctor being deported, or more in the form of “grassroots” efforts to pressure institutions to resist.

Responding, Carter called it a “both/and, not an either/or” scenario.

“Political scientists who study the development of the law (at conferences) essentially say, ‘We lawyers are all wrong about how the law works. Most often, the law follows public opinion. It does not lead it,’” he said. “Most often, especially at the Supreme Court level, they are following rather than leading. There are exceptions. But the data tend to prove that. So public opinion is kind of the foundational work.”

Carter also advocated for going “on offense more often and as aggressively as possible” regarding your legal rights, rather than waiting for something to happen and then suing in response.

“For example … right now, today, I would contend that every university professor has standing to sue based on the chilling effects that the Trump administration’s attack on freedom of speech has had,” Carter explained. “Everyone who works in the university has standing, and I would argue, so do students.

“Maybe I’m wrong … The only way to find out is to bring those cases,” he added. “And I would suggest bringing them aggressively and proactively.”

Last month, the DHS released a statement clarifying that “ICE does not raid or target schools”.","A group of Democratic senators have demanded that the Department of Education stop immigration enforcement activities from taking place close to schools, following several violent crackdowns near school grounds in Chicago.

Although the raids are conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which is under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the senators are making an appeal directly to the education secretary, Linda McMahon.

They said aggressive actions were affecting the safety of students.

“Federal agents continue to use unwarranted, excessive levels of force around Chicago, demonstrating an alarming lack of care or regard for the health and wellbeing of children, particularly by conducting unfocused, inflammatory operations within close proximity of school grounds,” the senators wrote, according to NBC News.

“We demand you pressure your colleague, secretary of homeland security Kristi Noem, to reinstate restrictions on federal immigration enforcement operations in and around places of education.”

The letter was signed by Tammy Duckworth, a senator from Illinois; Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen of Nevada; Kirsten Gillibrand of New York; Cory Booker and Andy Kim of New Jersey; Ed Markey of Massachusetts; and Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland.

At the start of the year, Donald Trump rescinded a policy that prevented ICE from carrying out enforcement in sensitive areas, including schools, hospitals and churches.

“Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America’s schools and churches to avoid arrest,” the DHS said in a statement at the time, adding that removing the policy “returns [enforcement] to a case-by-case basis”.

While violent ICE arrests have taken place across the country in recent months, Chicago has become a focal point in Trump’s targeted immigration crackdown. School officials on Thursday said that officers arrested and briefly detained a 16-year-old student from a nearby school who was a US citizen, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

“We have received reports of federal law enforcement activity in a nearby neighborhood, and I am very sorry to share that a member of our school was impacted,” said Juan Carlos Ocon, the principal of Benito Juarez community academy, in an email to families, noting that enforcement did not take place on school ground. “I know this situation has created many fears and concerns in our community, and I want to emphasize that we are taking this situation extremely seriously.”

Earlier in the month, parents expressed concern about ICE deploying teargas as part of enforcement activity close to a school. Students at one school were rushed inside during recess after teargas was deployed nearby.

In their letter to McMahon, the senators said ICE should follow “common sense” policing guidelines when carrying out enforcement.

“If society can agree that alcohol, tobacco and drugs should be kept at least 1,000 feet away from our school, surely we can agree that tear gas – a chemical weapon which causes burning, pain, skin inflammation and respiratory distress – and other violent DHS tools and tactics also belong on that list,” the letter said.

The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Education did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Last month, the DHS released a statement clarifying that “ICE does not raid or target schools”.

“The media is sadly attempting to create a climate of fear and smear law enforcement,” Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary, said in a statement at the time. “ICE is not conducting enforcement operations at, or ‘raiding’ schools. ICE is not going to schools to make arrests of children.

SAN FRANCISCO – Thousands of residents, workers, and faith leaders filled downtown San Francisco Thursday, rallying under the banner “Free the Bay” despite President Donald Trump’s announcement earlier in the day that he was canceling plans for a federal deployment in the city.

The demonstrations began hours after a noon press conference on the steps of City Hall, where a coalition of faith, labor, and community organizations released a joint statement signed by 150 groups demanding Trump keep federal troops out of the entire Bay Area. Organizers said the protests would go on regardless of the president’s reversal, citing deep distrust of his administration’s track record on immigration and civil rights.

Supervisor Shamann Walton said, “We have to be careful because we do not trust this administration. Hard to say you’re not coming, after you say you’re coming, then say you’re not coming, doesn’t mean we want to make sure our community is prepared to address the concerns and the issues that come when we have federal troops raiding our streets. We are going to remain vigilant.”

San Francisco District 11 Supervisor Cheyenne Chen, a Chinese American immigrant, drew parallels between current events and past acts of discrimination. “We have a long history of fighting for our rights and our freedom from organizing legal challenges to defend the Chinese Exclusion Act to Wong Kim’s fight for the birthright of citizenship,” Chen said. “Today our community is under attack as history is repeating itself, and we must stand in solidarity with our immigrant brothers and sisters.”

Chen added, “Federal agents, you do not belong in front of our schools, our businesses, our churches, and our hospitals. Community organizations, we are standing strong together with resources. We have each other’s back.”

Sophia Eva, serving as emcee, said that while Mayor Daniel Lurie had spoken with Trump earlier in the day and the president had said he would not deploy federal agents, the community’s needs remained urgent. “While Trump may be temporarily saying he’s not deploying federal agents to our city, in reality our communities really need assistance and they need this assistance to feel safe,” she said. “We also need housing. We need healthcare. We need jobs, and we need more federal resources and to restore federal cuts to essential programs such as Medi-Cal, SNAP, and schools—that should be the priority.”

Kim Tavaglione, Executive Director of the San Francisco Labor Council, said that labor leaders were committed to protecting all Bay Area workers, regardless of whether federal troops arrived. “They supposedly are calling off the troops from San Francisco, but, as everyone knows, our workers live in the nine Bay Area counties and beyond,” she said. “Labor is vowing to protect every worker in every county in the Bay Area. An injury to one is an injury to all.”

She added that if the administration “really wants to help the Bay Area, it’s time for them to double down, give us money for our schools, our public transportation, our public sector, our city workers, our county workers. We’re in desperate need of infrastructure. Instead of building a goddamn palace in Washington, D.C., help us build our roads, help us build our infrastructure.”

Alejo, Executive Director of Workers United, said the threats of federal action were “a show to make sure that we’re getting their message to stay silent, stay afraid.” He continued, “As a community, we reject those ideas. We reject that message because we know that the answer to our own safety is when we organize with each other because only we have each other’s back. To those who ICE is targeting, you’re not alone. You have rights. Reach out to your rapid response network, organize at home, organize in your workplace.”

By late afternoon, an estimated 5,000 people gathered at Embarcadero Plaza, carrying banners and chanting in defiance of what they described as the militarization of immigrant communities. Francisco Herrera, Co-Director of Nuevo Sol, said, “Bay Area leaders remain united against ICE and against any federal deployment anywhere in the Bay—whether it comes from the National Guard or the Department of Homeland Security. We won’t desist when our region—our neighborhoods, our schools, our parks, our houses of worship—are under threat of being turned into a militarized training ground.”

District 9 Supervisor Jackie Fielder told the crowd, “When they send troops into our neighborhoods, they’re not protecting us; they’re punishing us for standing up for justice. Our schools are underfunded, our hospitals are understaffed, and yet Trump wants to spend millions on ICE raids? That’s not leadership, that’s sabotage.”

Fielder later joined District 1 Supervisor Connie Chan and Supervisors Walton, Chen, and Mahmood in announcing legislation to appropriate city funds from San Francisco’s general reserves toward immigrant legal services and the San Francisco Rapid Response Network, which have been underfunded amid renewed federal threats.

Fielder said she has been pushing for these funds since taking office and voted against Mayor Lurie’s budget because it lacked additional resources for immigrant legal defense. The Rapid Response Network verifies immigration enforcement activity in San Francisco and connects immigrants arrested by ICE with legal assistance and support services.

“In a moment when Trump is pledging mass deportations, our San Francisco Rapid Response Line and immigration defense attorneys are operating under extremely limited capacity compared to the massive and unprecedented deportation machine they are now facing,” Fielder said.

She emphasized the critical role of immigration attorneys in protecting due process and keeping families together, saying, “Many of the lawyers are immigrants’ last hope, and they are incredibly overwhelmed, overworked, and burning out rapidly. It’s not sustainable. It is time that the city put its money where its values are.”

As the rally continued into the evening, participants filled the streets with chants, music, and banners proclaiming solidarity with immigrant families. Kim Tavaglione told the crowd, “Every raid, every arrest, every threat is a violation of our humanity. But we know our rights, and we’re teaching our neighbors how to protect them. This is not just about the Bay Area; it’s a national emergency. We will not let them turn our communities into battlegrounds.”

Lara Kiswani, Executive Director of the Arab Resource and Organizing Center, said, “We declare our collective humanity and the way we do it is the way we’re showing up today, linking arm and arm. Immigrants are not alone in being the first line of defense. The first line of defense is all of us, shoulder to shoulder, street by street.”

Reverend Deborah Lee, Co-Executive Director of the Interfaith Movement for Human Integrity, urged attendees to stay active and vocal. “This is no time for silence. It’s no time for complacency. It’s a time for us to speak. It’s a time for us to be active,” she said. “Our faith traditions tell us that the government should be for the good of the people and public finances should not be used to invade and repress communities and put them into fear and hiding.”

As the rally concluded, chants of “Free the Bay!” echoed through downtown San Francisco. Leaders promised continued mobilizations and vigilance as Trump’s immigration crackdown looms over the region.

“In that conversation, the president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie said.
It’ll be great again.” Trump had suggested that the role of the National Guard in San Francisco would be to address crime rates.
“I want to make sure that San Franciscans understand that the National Guard would not have any legal authority to make arrests or investigate crime,” San Francisco Dist.
Newsom, the former mayor of San Francisco, said Wednesday that the City by the Bay is experiencing its lowest homicide rate in 60 years.","President Trump said Thursday he had called off a planned deployment of immigration agents in San Francisco after prominent tech executives and Mayor Daniel Lurie asked him to do so.

“The Federal Government was preparing to ‘surge’ San Francisco, California, on Saturday, but friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge in that the Mayor, Daniel Lurie, was making substantial progress,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. Among the people Trump said he spoke to were Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.

Lurie released a statement saying he had talked to Trump on Wednesday night and told him that the presence of militarized immigration enforcement would hinder ongoing efforts to decrease crime and fentantyl use and boost economic activity.

“In that conversation, the president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie said.

On Truth Social, Trump said he believed the surge would be a “faster, stronger and safer” way to remove criminals from the city but that Lurie asked “very nicely” if he could be given a chance to “turn it around.”

News of the planned deployment of federal agents prompted fierce backlash from some California officials Wednesday.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom released a statement on X confirming and criticizing the agents’ upcoming arrival. He called deployment a “page right out of the dictator’s handbook” intended to create the conditions of unrest necessary to then send in the National Guard.

“He sends out masked men, he sends out Border Patrol, he sends out ICE, he creates anxiety and fear in the community so that he can lay claim to solving that by sending in the [National] Guard,” Newsom said. “This is no different than the arsonist putting out the fire.”

About 100 federal agents, including members of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, were en route to the U.S. Coast Guard’s Alameda base, according to reporting from the San Francisco Chronicle. On Thursday morning, before Trump announced the cancellation of the surge, protesters gathered outside the base, where they attempted to prevent federal agents from entering, the Chronicle reported.

On Wednesday, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security confirmed that agents would be performing immigration enforcement in San Francisco.

“DHS is targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens — including murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, and terrorists — in cities such as Portland, Chicago, Memphis and San Francisco,” the spokesperson said.

Lurie, who has thus far avoided directly criticizing Trump during the mayor’s first 10 months in office, issued a statement Wednesday outlining his strong opposition to a deployment of immigration agents or the National Guard in San Francisco.

“Uncoordinated federal action undermines our work,” he said. “Having the military posted in front of our schools, restaurants and office buildings will hinder our progress and let chaos get in the way of our recovery.”

Newsom told reporters at a Wednesday event that the state would file a lawsuit within a “nanosecond of any efforts to send the military to one of America’s great cities, San Francisco.”

He urged Californians to remain peaceful in the face of the arrival of federal agents.

“President Trump and [White House Deputy Chief of Staff] Stephen Miller’s authoritarian playbook is coming for another of our cities, and violence and vandalism are exactly what they’re looking for to invoke chaos,” said Newsom on X.

Trump had suggested for weeks that San Francisco was next on his list for National Guard deployment, after the administration sent troops to Los Angeles and Chicago and was battling in court to send them to Portland, Ore.

On Sunday, Trump told Fox News, “We’re going to San Francisco and we’ll make it great. It’ll be great again.”

Trump had suggested that the role of the National Guard in San Francisco would be to address crime rates. However, the National Guard is generally not allowed to perform domestic law enforcement duties when federalized by the president.

“I want to make sure that San Franciscans understand that the National Guard would not have any legal authority to make arrests or investigate crime,” San Francisco Dist. Atty. Brooke Jenkins told NBC Bay Area on Tuesday. She said the Guard is not legally equipped to “to curb the fentanyl crisis or retail theft or the issues that are most pressing here.”

Lurie acknowledged Wednesday that the city had more work to do to combat fentanyl use but said that the National Guard “cannot arrest drug dealers or shut down open-air drug markets.” He also touted progress the city had made in reducing violent crime to 70-year lows and the number of tent encampments to record lows.

Last month, Trump said that cities with Democratic political leadership such as San Francisco, Chicago and Los Angeles “are very unsafe places and we are going to straighten them out.”

Trump said he told Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that “we should use some of these dangerous cities as training for our military, our National Guard.”

In a Monday statement, the White House defended the deployment of troops in U.S. cities, pointing to drops in crime after troops were deployed in Memphis and Washington, D.C.

“The President’s actions in DC have been tremendously successful, with even Democrat Mayor Muriel Bowser highlighting the significant reduction in crime as a result of the operation,” Abigail Jackson, White House spokesperson, said in the statement. “San Francisco Democrats should look at the tremendous results in DC and Memphis and listen to fellow Democrat Mayor Bowser and welcome the President in to clean up their city.”

The president has direct command of the National Guard in Washington, D.C., as it is a federal territory. However, the president is generally not allowed to federalize troops to support local law enforcement without a governor’s consent.

In the case of Los Angeles and Chicago, the Guard was mobilized to defend federal property and personnel during immigration protests. In Memphis, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee has approved the deployment of the Guard to assist law enforcement with a crackdown on crime. Memphis has the highest violent-crime rate of any city in America, according to FBI data.

Newsom, the former mayor of San Francisco, said Wednesday that the City by the Bay is experiencing its lowest homicide rate in 60 years.

“It’s one of the safest large cities in this country that’s experiencing an economic rebirth and growth,” Newsom said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a6341c1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8111x4258+0+574/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6e%2F82%2F7289a1ec43d79a4449a9a736c1a5%2Fgettyimages-2239294536.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 18:17:32.665418

""There is absolutely no reason for Americans’ SNAP benefits to be suspended considering the funding for November is authorized and readily available.
For far too many veterans, seniors, and children, SNAP benefits are the difference between having food or not.
""We urge USDA to use these funds for November SNAP benefits and issue clear guidance to states on how to navigate benefit issuance.
Choosing not to ensure SNAP benefits reach those in need this November would be a gross dereliction of your responsibilities to the American people.","Today, Congresswoman Veronica Escobar (TX-16) joined 213 of her Democratic colleagues in calling on the Trump Administration to immediately release the nearly $5 billion in SNAP contingency funding that would allow November benefits to go out without interruption.

SNAP benefits were made available to eligible individuals in October, but due to the Agriculture Secretary’s unwillingness to use her statutory transfer authority along with the roughly $5 billion SNAP contingency fund to deliver benefits in November, 42 million American seniors, veterans and families with children risk not being able to keep food on their table.

""Over 152,000 people in El Paso, including children, seniors, veterans, and working parents, rely on SNAP to put food on the table. Despite $5 billion available in SNAP’s reserve or 'contingency fund,' the Trump Administration has directed states to withhold November benefits that millions of low-income families need,” said Congresswoman Escobar. ""There is absolutely no reason for Americans’ SNAP benefits to be suspended considering the funding for November is authorized and readily available. I join my colleagues in calling for the administration to urgently release SNAP contingency funding and to finally come to the table to negotiate ending the shutdown for the good of the American people.""

The text of the letter can be found in its entirety below:

“Dear Madam Secretary,

""Right now, millions of Americans are struggling to afford food due to the Administration’s ill-conceived trade war. Just this year, we’ve seen household staples like eggs, coffee, and ground beef hit record high prices. Now more than ever, millions of families across the country depend upon the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to make ends meet. For far too many veterans, seniors, and children, SNAP benefits are the difference between having food or not. Now, due to the government shutdown, they are facing crippling levels of uncertainty about whether they will be able to afford food next month.

""A potential lapse in benefits would be felt by Americans of all ages and affect every corner and congressional district in the country. As the largest food assistance program in the United States, SNAP serves 42 million people. That includes 16 million children, 8 million seniors, 4 million people with disabilities, and 1.2 million veterans.

""That is why we were deeply concerned to see your comments suggesting that SNAP will run out of funding in two weeks and that no SNAP benefits will be issued in November. USDA’s shutdown plan acknowledges that “Congressional intent is evident that SNAP’s operations should continue since the program has been provided with multi-year contingency funds...” USDA still has significant funding available in SNAP’s contingency reserve – which Congress provides precisely for this reason – that can be used to fund the bulk of November benefits.

""We urge USDA to use these funds for November SNAP benefits and issue clear guidance to states on how to navigate benefit issuance. Additionally, while the contingency reserve will not cover November benefits in full, we urge USDA to use its statutory transfer authority or any other legal authority at its disposal to supplement these dollars and fully fund November benefits.

""There are clear steps the administration can and must take immediately to ensure that millions of families across the country can put food on their table in November. Choosing not to ensure SNAP benefits reach those in need this November would be a gross dereliction of your responsibilities to the American people. We appreciate your consideration of these requests.”

Rashida Tlaib more than a week to find a Michigan mother who had been detained by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents.

Speaking at a “shadow hearing” in Chicago Friday on the impacts of President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, the Democratic lawmaker said 12 days passed before she could find where the mother of three children was detained.

“They had her sleeping in a cot, like on the floor. And I didn’t know where she was!” she said. “I just couldn’t find her – and I’m a former immigration lawyer!”

Tlaib said she and her fellow Democrats have had similar experiences and it has led them to question the administration’s tactics and actions.

“Enough! When we say disappeared and kidnapped, we’re meaning disappeared and kidnapped,” she said. “We can’t find them.”

An attorney for the Trump administration told a federal judge in Portland, Oregon, Friday that they don’t intend to use all of the National Guard troops who have been called up for a potential deployment to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“As of yesterday, our determination remained that 200 (troops) is the right number and the appropriate number,” Department of Justice attorney Jacob Moshe Roth said in a court hearing over whether Judge Karin Immergut must drop her restraining order preventing President Trump from deploying National Guard troops in Oregon.

After first having their effort to federalize 200 Oregon National Guard troops in Portland blocked by Immergut, the administration then moved in 200 guardsmen from California and up to 400 from Texas to prepare for a deployment. The judge expressed concern that a total of 800 guardsmen was a substantial escalation.

Roth said they never intended to use more than 200 troops on the ground.

“They were not supposed to be supplemental; they were supposed to be instead of (the Oregon troops who were initially blocked),” he said.

The DOJ attorney reiterated what the administration said in a Thursday filing, that the administration might be satisfied for now if the judge allows only the 200 Oregon guardsmen to be deployed while continuing to sideline the troops from California and Oregon.

An independent journalist alleges the Department of Homeland Security used video footage he recorded in Illinois without permission and mislabeled it as an example of clashes in Portland, Oregon.

Ford Fischer said a clip of his footage was used in a 3-minute video posted on X on Sunday in which Micah Bock, a DHS deputy assistant secretary, talks about federal law enforcement officers saying they are “defending our cities under siege.”

“Footage of mine is used to say ‘In Portland, Oregon, Antifa terrorists have surged against our federal facilities,’” Fischer said in a post on X. “While labelled as Portland, this footage was shot by me in Broadview, Illinois.”

Fischer, who has been documenting anti-ICE protests in multiple cities, said he did not give DHS permission to use or license his video. When asked about Fischer’s allegations, a DHS spokesperson did not directly address them in a statement to CNN.

“Violence and rioting against law enforcement is unacceptable regardless of where it occurs,” the spokesperson said. In both Portland Oregon and Chicago Illinois violent Antifa terrorists have assaulted and brutally attacked our officers and agents. We will not stop until every single one of these anarchists are brought to justice.”

Fischer told CNN he was surprised to find his footage in the publication, noting that in recent months he observed federal agents using high-end camera gear to make their own, highly stylized videos.

“When I replayed it (…) I realized that indeed, a version of my Broadview, Illinois footage with the watermark cropped out was labelled ‘Portland, Oregon,’” Fischer told CNN.

CNN has geolocated the video clip and confirmed it was taken outside the ICE facility in Broadview on September 19, 2025.

A federal judge will hear arguments Friday in a lawsuit filed by Washington, DC, officials over the Trump administration’s decision to send National Guard troops to the district this August.

In the suit filed last month, DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb accuses the president and his administration of violating the Constitution and federal law by sending thousands of troops to the district without consent from local leaders.

“Deploying the National Guard to engage in law enforcement is not only unnecessary and unwanted, but it is also dangerous and harmful to the District and its residents,” Schwalb said in a statement last month. “It’s DC today but could be any other city tomorrow.”

More than 2,000 National Guard members were assigned to the DC mission and ordered to carry weapons as part of President Donald Trump’s anti-crime agenda in the nation’s capital, which also included a surge of federal officers from other agencies. Many of the National Guard troops were deployed from Republican-led states.

The White House has maintained the president has the authority to deploy the Guard to protect federal property and assist law enforcement.

Friday’s hearing comes as judges across the country are weighing similar lawsuits over the administration’s deployment of the Guard in Oregon and Illinois.

A federal judge will hear arguments today on whether she should drop the restraining order that currently prevents a National Guard deployment in Portland, Oregon – or keep it in place. But the Trump administration is suggesting she has more than two choices.

Judge Karin Immergut blocked President Trump’s deployment of about 600 National Guard troops from Oregon, California and Texas to help protect a Portland ICE facility that has been the site of protests since mid-summer.

The Department of Justice said a recent ruling by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals should force Immergut to end her temporary restraining order that prevents any federalized Guard deployment within the state of Oregon. The state argued the appeals court decision did not directly address that order, and the judge should wait until the Ninth Circuit decides whether to rehear the case with more judges.

In a court filing earlier this week, the Trump administration suggested another alternative, saying even if Immergut decides against overturning her full order, she could instead allow deployment only of 200 Oregon National Guard troops, keeping the ones from Texas and California on the sidelines.

“Even if this Court distinguishes the federalized Guardsmen from Oregon from those coming from California and Texas, there is no question that the (order blocking deployments) must be dissolved or stayed insofar as it prohibits deployment of federalized Oregon Guardsmen,” the court filing said.

Immergut – a Trump appointee – has not said when she will make a decision on the government’s request. Her restraining order is scheduled to expire on November 2.

The Trump administration is giving its first details on how many federal law enforcement agents have been deployed for security at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland, and Oregon officials claim the information shows the administration’s previous statements were exaggerated.

In a response to the state’s ongoing lawsuit trying to stop the deployment of the National Guard in Portland, the Department of Homeland Security said Thursday the processing facility that has been the target of protests for months has had extra security staffing from three different DHS agencies since June. The highest confirmed number is around 150 officers in late September.

Shortly after that filing, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield sent a letter to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals arguing the new document shows “a material factual error” made in court about the need for federal officers in Portland.

The Department of Justice originally said 115 members of the Federal Protective Service had to be deployed to keep the peace at the ICE building, a callout they argued was unsustainable without support from the National Guard. But Rayfield notes the new document shows fewer FPS agents being deployed, with a maximum of 31 ever on active duty at a time in Portland.

Rayfield says the appeals court should reverse its own decision earlier this week that could open the door to National Guard deployments in Portland soon.

“This Court must act swiftly to prevent defendants from attempting to benefit from their own material mistake to deploy military forces to peaceful civilian streets, contravening the rule of law and our nation’s history and traditions,” Rayfield wrote.

The Trump administration has not yet responded to Rayfield’s letter.

As legal cases move forward over National Guard deployments to Democratic-led cities from Los Angeles to Washington, DC, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche is warning California and Illinois officials not to interfere with federal immigration enforcement activities, saying it violates federal law.

Here are the latest developments:

California

President Donald Trump called off plans to “surge” federal law enforcement and immigration resources to San Francisco, citing conversations with “friends” in the area and the city’s mayor.

San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie’s patience on a call with Trump is part of the reason plans were dropped, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said.

Lurie on the call emphasized the progress his city has made in recent years in addressing crime and fueling economic growth. “Having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,” the mayor said.

At a protest against the anticipated deployment to the Bay Area, people blocked Customs and Border Protection vehicles outside a Coast Guard base. Two protesters were arrested, and law enforcement officers fired shots at a U-Haul truck backing toward them.

A panel of three judges with the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals continues to weigh whether to limit Trump’s ability to continue deploying National Guard troops to the Los Angeles area.

Illinois

In Chicago, Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino is accused of throwing at least one tear gas canister at protesters, possibly in violation of a federal judge’s temporary restraining order restricting federal agents from using aggressive crowd control tactics at anti-ICE protests in the city.

Gov. JB Pritzker announced the creation of the Illinois Accountability Commission to establish a public record of federal enforcement abuses.

Federal agents have been deployed in Chicago since early September during what the administration has titled “Operation Midway Blitz.”

The mother of a 20-year-old Illinois woman who became “the face” of the operation after she was killed in a drunken driving hit-and-run collision with a man in the country illegally said her daughter wouldn’t have wanted to be associated with the immigration enforcement push.

Oregon

A federal judge will hold a hearing today to consider whether to dissolve or suspend the temporary restraining order she issued this month barring the White House from deploying the National Guard into Portland.

US District Judge Karin Immergut will preside over the virtual hearing, scheduled for 10 a.m. local time.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/114666-chicagoansconfrontice-horizontal-1-00-00-15-03-still001.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-24 14:04:31.075570

Activists are planning to rally outside the federal Whipple Building near Fort Snelling Friday afternoon, according to social media posts. The Whipple Building is the site of Minnesota’s Immigration Court and an ICE office.

They are planning their own press conference at noon, and aim to protest at the site during Noem’s remarks, scheduled to begin at 4:30 p.m.

Minnesota has yet to see mass deployment of ICE agents, but increased immigration enforcement presence has been documented. In early October, ICE arrested a crew of roofers from El Salvador and Honduras working in St. Paul’s North End, drawing community protests.

On Sept. 30, immigration officials announced they had conducted 900 site visits and in-person interviews in the Twin Cities in an effort to clamp down on alleged immigration fraud carried out through marriage and student visas. The effort, dubbed Operation Twin Shield, claimed to have uncovered 275 cases of suspected fraud.

A June federal law enforcement raid on a Mexican restaurant in south Minneapolis drew hundreds of protestors and sparked chaotic scenes on Lake Street. The raid included dozens of federal agents, including ICE personnel, in paramilitary garb, but was not tied to deportation efforts.

Her visit comes three weeks after the U.S. Department of Justice sued the Twin Cities and state, alleging that they interfere with federal immigration enforcement because of their “sanctuary city” policies.

Local officials, including Gov. Tim Walz and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, pushed back against that lawsuit and said they aren’t violating any laws.

Attorney General Keith Ellison also issued a statement saying, “My team and I regularly partner with law enforcement to prosecute dangerous individuals who pose a threat to their communities, and Minnesota is not stopping the federal government from doing the same. This baseless lawsuit is just more political retaliation against Minnesota and we will respond in court. In the meantime, Minnesota will continue to use our law enforcement resources to actually improve public safety.”

ICE says it has averaged more than 400 arrests per day nationwide since President Donald Trump signed executive orders in January directing the agency to prioritize immigration enforcement and deportations.

“Coast Guard personnel issued multiple verbal commands to stop the vehicle, the driver failed to comply and proceeded to put the vehicle in reverse,” the Coast Guard statement reads.
“When the vehicle’s actions posed a direct threat to the safety of Coast Guard and security personnel, law enforcement officers discharged several rounds of live fire.” No Coast Guard personnel were injured during the incident, according to the the agency.

The incident followed a days-long demonstration near the base, which is expected to be used by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CPB).

The Coast Guard posted a statement to social media early Friday with details about the incident, which occurred around 10 p.m. PDT Thursday. The agency said security personnel “standing watch” in the area observed a vehicle behaving “erratically” before it attempted to “back into” the base.

Video of the incident, which aired on CBS News, shows a truck reversing toward a line of personnel stationed near the base. Once officers began firing shots toward the truck, it drove away.

“Coast Guard personnel issued multiple verbal commands to stop the vehicle, the driver failed to comply and proceeded to put the vehicle in reverse,” the Coast Guard statement reads. “When the vehicle’s actions posed a direct threat to the safety of Coast Guard and security personnel, law enforcement officers discharged several rounds of live fire.”

No Coast Guard personnel were injured during the incident, according to the the agency.

CBS also reported that people witnessed the truck strike two bystanders, but it is unclear whether that led to any injuries.

The statement also said the FBI would take lead on investigating the incident and that the Coast Guard would coordinate with law enforcement agencies.

The Alameda base drew more than 100 protesters earlier Thursday in anticipation of the site’s use by CBP agents during a planned immigration enforcement crackdown in San Francisco. The base is roughly 15 miles away from the city.

CBP officers began arriving to the area early Thursday morning, while some demonstrators attempted to block vehicles from entering the gates. Officials used smoke grenades and flash-bang devices to disperse protesters.

Government officials have expressed fear in recent weeks for the safety of law enforcement officers in the current political climate — primarily amid the rise in tensions over President Trump’s robust deportation agenda.

DHS says gang member tried to ram agents with car, defends apparent tear gas use on protesters

Meanwhile, ABC7 is getting more information from the DHS about recent violent run-ins with federal agents over the past few days.

DHS says Wednesday was one of their most violent days on the job.

At 26th and Ogden in Cicero, DHS claims, a Latin Kings gang member tried to ram agents with his vehicle.

Six people were arrested that day for impeding operations, and three undocumented immigrants were placed into custody.

And there were more tense moments Thursday at the Little Village Discount Mall during an anti-ICE rally.

Attorneys accused federal agents of violating a court order, which does not allow them to use riot control weapons unless facing an imminent threat and requires them to issue warnings first before deploying tear gas.

A federal complaint is now taking aim at the man who led the charge. An image of Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino appears to show him throw tear gas ""without justification,"" according to the complaint.

""Federal agents started acting aggressive, pushing protesters away... Again, it was all peaceful protesters,"" said protester Kristian Armendariz.

However, DHS says the group of about 75-100 people began firing commercial artillery shell fireworks at agents and throwing rocks, adding that Bovino was hit in the head.

According to DHS, agents repeated multiple warnings to the crowd to back up, informing them that chemical agents would be deployed. The department stood by their agents' actions, saying, ""Agents properly used their training. The use of chemical munitions was conducted in full accordance with CBP policy and was necessary to ensure the safety of both law enforcement and the public.""

Bovino was set to appear in court on Nov. 5, but now, a federal judge has ordered more than double the time to question Bovino after these incidents.

Because Abrego Garcia has deportation protections from his home country of El Salvador, the Trump administration must find a third country that is willing to accept him and a country where Abrego Garcia believes he will not face harm or persecution.
The Trump administration so far has floated sending Abrego Garcia to one of three nations in Africa — Ghana, Eswatini and Uganda.
In March, Abrego Garcia was wrongly deported to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador, where he detailed his experience of psychological and physical torture.","WASHINGTON — The Trump administration Friday identified the West African nation of Liberia as the location for the removal of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, noting his deportation could come as soon as Oct. 31.

In a Friday court filing in the District of Maryland, the Department of Justice argued that Liberia is a close partner with the United States and that the federal government has received assurances from Liberia that Abrego Garcia will not be harmed if he is deported there. They added that Abrego Garcia, who has a wife and family in Maryland, has not expressed fear of being removed to Liberia.

“Although Petitioner has identified more than twenty countries that he purports to fear would persecute or torture him if he were removed there, Liberia is not on that list,” according to the filing.

Abrego Garcia’s attorneys in his Maryland case could not be immediately reached for comment.

The new filing comes shortly after attorneys for Abrego Garcia in a separate case in Tennessee this week requested to subpoena Trump DOJ official Todd Blanche in connection with Abrego Garcia’s claim that his criminal case by the Trump administration is vindictive. That hearing is set to start Nov. 4.

Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to those charges, which accuse him of the human trafficking of immigrants in an incident stemming from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee.

Detention challenged

Abrego Garcia, whose wrongful deportation cast a spotlight on the president’s aggressive immigration crackdown, is challenging his detention on the grounds that the Trump administration is using his imprisonment as punishment rather than for the purpose of removal.

Abrego Garcia has stated he is willing to be deported to Costa Rica, which has agreed to accept the longtime Maryland man as a refugee.

Because Abrego Garcia has deportation protections from his home country of El Salvador, the Trump administration must find a third country that is willing to accept him and a country where Abrego Garcia believes he will not face harm or persecution.

The Trump administration so far has floated sending Abrego Garcia to one of three nations in Africa — Ghana, Eswatini and Uganda.

Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis found little evidence the Trump administration has made any effort to remove Abrego Garcia either to the southern African nation of Eswatini or Costa Rica.

At that hearing, Abrego Garcia’s attorneys told Xinis they have not received an answer from the federal government as to why officials won’t remove Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica.

Detained in Pennsylvania

Xinis is currently mulling whether or not to order the release of Abrego Garcia, who is detained at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Pennsylvania.

Any indefinite stay would likely be unconstitutional, per a 2001 Supreme Court ruling that does not allow for immigrants to be detained longer than six months if the federal government is making no efforts to remove them.

County officials this week advanced plans to create “ICE-free zones” throughout the region.
San Jose officials are considering a similar proposal to prevent ICE from using city-owned properties.
“The Border Patrol and ICE have no business patrolling the streets and communities of East San Jose,” Ortiz said.
“Don’t give this administration a single reason to turn their sights to the South Bay,” he said.","South Bay civic leaders said they remain ready to support the region’s immigrant community after news broke Thursday morning that President Donald Trump is backing off plans to surge federal law enforcement personnel in the Bay Area.

“They’ve made the right decision. Our region is on the rise,” Mayor Matt Mahan said during the news conference at the Amigos de Guadalupe Center for Justice and Empowerment in East San Jose.

The event had initially been called in response to Wednesday news reports that the Trump administration planned to deploy more than 100 federal law enforcement personnel to a Coast Guard base in Alameda. The planned deployment, which was said to include immigration enforcement officers, was seen as an attempt to make good on Trump’s promise to crack down on crime in San Francisco.

But by Thursday morning, the deployment had apparently been called off.

“I hope desperately for the good of all of our residents, including our most vulnerable neighbors, that this decision holds,” Mahan said.

Despite the sighs of relief, however, speakers at the East San Jose event — a group that also included elected officials for San Jose and Santa Clara County, as well as a number of nonprofit leaders — voiced skepticism that the apparent enforcement reprieve would stick.

“The administration has shown us that they change their minds from one hour to the next,” Rebeca Armendariz, a member of the Rapid Response Network, a coalition of community-run organizations that protect immigrants and their families from deportation raids in Santa Clara County, told San José Spotlight. “We want our community to continue to prepare themselves.”

To do so, Armendariz urged residents to report on the activity of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to her network.

Other speakers offered messages of solidarity to the South Bay’s immigrant community, encouraging them to be mindful of their rights during interactions with federal immigration officials.

“To our immigrant brothers and sisters, you are not alone,” Maritza Maldonado, executive director of Amigos de Guadalupe, said. “We see you. We love you. We will fight alongside you.”

ICE has conducted large-scale operations in cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco since President Donald Trump took office earlier this year. Santa Clara County has not seen this level of crackdown so far. But fears of immigration raids have kept San Jose students from attending class and slowed foot traffic at Latino-owned businesses. Some undocumented residents have chosen to self-deport.

With the threat of stepped up immigration raids looming, South Bay governments have been stiffening protections for undocumented residents in recent months.

County officials this week advanced plans to create “ICE-free zones” throughout the region. In such zones, local officials would raise physical barriers and lock gates to prevent federal immigration agents from unlawfully using county properties for surveillance and arrests. San Jose officials are considering a similar proposal to prevent ICE from using city-owned properties.

The county and city have also announced efforts to step up legal aid, family shelter, food, child care, health services and communication for undocumented residents.

District 5 Councilmember Peter Ortiz, who represents East San Jose and has been a chief backer of these efforts, was among those who spoke during the event.

“The Border Patrol and ICE have no business patrolling the streets and communities of East San Jose,” Ortiz said. “We will not accept fear as a form of government. We will not accept intimidation disguised as security.” During his remarks, Mahan also reaffirmed the city’s commitment to its sanctuary city laws, which prohibit most forms of cooperation between San Jose police officers and immigration officials.

In addition, he also urged people who are considering protesting the administration’s actions to do so peacefully.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has promoted the program, which the federal government has called a “force multiplier” for immigration enforcement.
He described the 287(g) task force model as a way to serve warrants “expeditiously — and not wait for ICE” to come in person.
Big money in immigration enforcement Bolstering the immigration crackdown is a growing flow of money, incentivizing and rewarding local police departments to do federal work.
Civil rights concerns But as money and manpower flow into immigration enforcement, critics warn of high potential human costs.","As the federal government intensifies its immigration crackdown, the Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office has emerged as one of the Suncoast’s most active partners with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

In recent months, Sheriff Kurt Hoffman’s deputies have patrolled the Everglades immigration jail known as “Alligator Alcatraz” and shuttled immigrants between detention facilities in Florida, earning more than $280,000 in state funding for the work. Meanwhile, the number of ICE detainers — which keep people up to 48 hours past their release date for possible detention and deportation — have quadrupled this past year inside the already crowded county jail.

Sarasota County’s ICE activity stands in sharp contrast to neighboring agencies. The Manatee County Sheriff’s Office has not sent deputies to Alligator Alcatraz or transported immigrants for ICE, according to a spokesperson. And while North Port sought state reimbursements, its request was only a third the size of Sarasota’s.

The county’s growing role comes as Florida positions itself as a testing ground for aggressive, state-backed immigration enforcement — with cash incentives for local agencies and expanded powers under a federal program called 287(g).

The initiative, named for a section of federal immigration law, authorizes local police and sheriff’s deputies to perform duties typically reserved for ICE agents, including holding people inside jails in coordination with the federal agency.

Florida has ramped up its use of the 287(g) task force model, which goes further, allowing officers to make immigration arrests in the field.

U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has promoted the program, which the federal government has called a “force multiplier” for immigration enforcement. During a press conference in Bradenton on Monday, Noem told reporters it was “fantastic to see” how Florida has jumped on board.

But immigrant rights groups have warned that it diverts local staff time from normal policing and risks racial profiling and eroding community trust – problems that surfaced in the years before the government abandoned this same enforcement model more than a decade ago.

“The task force model really changes the culture of law enforcement agencies and the officers who are deputized and pushed to do this kind of work,” said Roberto Lopez, a senior staffer with the group Texas Civil Rights Project, who has closely followed Florida’s immigration policies. “That kind of approach is harmful to policing writ large.”

Hoffman told Suncoast Searchlight during a Sept. 9 interview that the program allows his deputies to act quickly on immigration warrants. He described the 287(g) task force model as a way to serve warrants “expeditiously — and not wait for ICE” to come in person.

The office has since cut off communication with news outlets on the topic of immigration after adopting a policy routing all 287(g)-related media requests through ICE — a move transparency experts say reflects ICE’s broader retreat from public accountability.

“Law enforcement has the power to detain you, to throw you in a cell, to take your kids, to take your money, even take your life,” said David Cuillier, director of the University of Florida’s Joseph L.

As U.S. immigration enforcement shifts from the border to the interior of the country, few states have supported President Donald Trump’s efforts as enthusiastically as Florida.

Each of its 67 sheriff’s departments and more than 150 police departments have signed 287(g) task force agreements with ICE — a controversial practice that no other state has adopted so broadly.

In Sarasota County, Hoffman said that 20 of his deputies would be “cross-sworn as task force members” and able to coordinate with ICE to search for undocumented immigrants in the field — citing traffic stops as a typical gateway to immigration arrests.

“If you get stopped for driving on a suspended license or speeding or something, and we find out that you’re foreign born, [under] the task force model, the deputy out there can then contact ICE,” Hoffman said. “Then that deputy, under the task force model, will charge them, bring them into the jail, and in the jail could process the warrant.”

The sheriff’s office also is a regional transportation hub: Deputies transport people accused of immigration violations from the Hardee, Manatee and Sarasota County jails to ICE custody in the Tampa area. And in August, the office sent a contingent of deputies to patrol Alligator Alcatraz, the immigration detention center in the Everglades.

Since training deputies on the task force model this fall, Hoffman’s agency has reported 16 “encounters” with people suspected of lacking proper authorization to be in the country, according to a statewide database hosted by Gov. Ron DeSantis’s State Board of Immigration Enforcement. None of those resulted in immigration-related arrests.

Most of the office’s immigration enforcement still occurs inside the county jail, where officers may hold people flagged by ICE for up to 48 hours beyond their scheduled release. ICE issued 173 detainers to the jail between Jan. 20 and late July — four times as many as during the same period last year.

Big money in immigration enforcement

Bolstering the immigration crackdown is a growing flow of money, incentivizing and rewarding local police departments to do federal work.

Florida’s State Board of Immigration Enforcement has set aside a $250 million grant to reimburse agencies for their work with ICE, and released more than $14 million so far. ICE, too, is set to pour millions into Florida law enforcement, announcing Sept. 26 it had awarded Florida more than $38 million for that work.

Those agreements have begun to pay off.

Law enforcement agencies in 47 cities and counties received a first batch of reimbursements last month for time spent on ICE training, detention beds, vans and employee bonuses between February and June.

Some sought reimbursements for technologies and gear as wide-ranging as bullet proof vests, body cameras, finger print scanners, printers, monitors, laptops, virtual private networks (VPNs), handcuffs, leg irons, weapon lock boxes and automated license plate readers.

On the Suncoast, the Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office requested the lion’s share of reimbursements; neither DeSoto nor Manatee County sheriff’s offices requested funds. Only one other local law enforcement agency — in the City of North Port — requested and received reimbursement, bringing in a total of $95,000.

In its application to the state, Hoffman’s agency requested: $62,400 to “sublet” beds for people held on ICE detainers; more than $10,000 for gas mileage and meals while transporting immigrants for ICE; more than $130,000 in employee bonuses; and almost $74,000 to purchase a transport vehicle.

The reimbursements were approved just after the sheriff secured an 11% budget expansion — the second-largest of any Sarasota County department — adding more than $20 million in new funding and helping drive a $2.5 billion county budget that has grown more than 70% in three years. The office now operates on roughly $220 million a year, most of it for personnel costs, technology upgrades and jail operations.

Hoffman also is managing an overcrowded jail and facing cost projections in the hundreds of millions to expand the facility. Against that backdrop, the state and federal reimbursements for immigration enforcement — just $283,390 — represent a slim fraction of the agency’s overall budget.

But for individual employees, the financial incentives are significant: Officers can receive $1,000 in one-off bonus payments for ICE training, plus additional pay for special assignments.

The Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office, for example, sought more than $7,500 in state reimbursements per officer for deputies to work security at Alligator Alcatraz in August. According to budget documents obtained through a public records request, the office requested an initial total of $52,454.50 for a 10-day “mission” from the state’s Division of Emergency Management, which built the detention center.

Civil rights concerns

But as money and manpower flow into immigration enforcement, critics warn of high potential human costs.

An internal Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office policy on the 287(g) program prohibits discrimination, as well as “profiling, stereotyping and biased enforcement practices.” But civil rights advocates say the task force model nonetheless opens the door to abuses — eroding trust between deputies and immigrant communities.

Amid concerns about a lack of oversight for local law enforcement, the federal government previously dropped the 287(g) task force model in 2012. Maricopa County, Arizona, offered a worst-case scenario: There, the Department of Justice found deputies had systematically discriminated against Latino residents of the county. The county settled a lawsuit over the program and has spent more than $300 million on the court case and reforms required under the settlement, ProPublica has reported.

Florida’s widespread adoption of the program and its large-scale sweeps like O

peration Tidal Wave — a 6-day push in April by federal and state agencies to arrest undocumented immigrants — has struck a nerve with advocates across the country.

“I’ve been watching and looking at Florida, especially with Operation Tidal Wave, and seeing how [it] bodes for Texas’s future,” said Lopez, of Texas Civil Rights Project. “We aren’t seeing, yet, that kind of task force model compliance that you’re seeing in Florida.”

Under Trump’s second administration, ICE has brought back the model in full force, signing up hundreds of agencies across the country. Now, the federal agency has eroded its training requirements, too.

Under previous iterations of the program, officers were required to participate in weeks of in-person training; they are now required to complete 40 hours online.

Even law enforcement officials have expressed concern about the program.

Sarasota County Commissioner Tom Knight told Suncoast Searchlight that he harbored doubts about the model while serving as sheriff from 2009 until 2021. He allowed for some immigration arrests in the county jail but worried that taking immigration enforcement into the streets would instill fear in community members and jeopardize his relationships with constituents.

“My message was that my job as sheriff is not to be a border patrol agent or an ICE agent out in the field,” said Knight. “It was always an issue for me with the community: what does the hospitality industry think? What do the farmers think? I would talk to a lot of them – even if the people they were hiring were legal, they still had family members who were not here legally… It’s a touchy situation.”",https://suncoastsearchlight.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Sarasota-Sheriff-Deputy-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 18:01:59.381736

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said today that the U.S. struck a boat allegedly carrying drugs in the Caribbean Sea, marking at least the third time this week that the U.S. has attacked a vessel it says was involved in drug trafficking.

“The vessel was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,” Hegseth wrote in a post on X. “Six male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the strike, which was conducted in international waters—and was the first strike at night. All six terrorists were killed and no U.S. forces were harmed in this strike.”

Hegseth said that this vessel belonged to the Tren de Aragua gang, which the Trump administration has named a designated terrorist organization, and was hit in the Caribbean.

Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., and at least a half a dozen other senators are calling on the U.S. Education Department to pressure immigration authorities to refrain from carrying out enforcement within 1,000 feet of any school property, citing recent classroom disruptions in the Chicago area.

Today, they sent the letter, first provided to NBC News, to Education Secretary Linda McMahon, demanding that she step in and ask the Department of Homeland Security to curb its operations around schools.

“Federal agents continue to use unwarranted, excessive levels of force around Chicago, demonstrating an alarming lack of care or regard for the health and wellbeing of children, particularly by conducting unfocused, inflammatory operations within close proximity of school grounds,” the senators wrote in the letter. “We demand you pressure your colleague, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, to reinstate restrictions on Federal immigration enforcement operations in and around places of education.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said today that the U.S. and numerous other countries are committed to the demilitarization of Gaza, stressing that Israel had met its commitment to withdraw its forces from areas of the Palestinian territory.

Speaking from the Civilian Military Coordination Center in Israel, Rubio said ""miles of tunnels"" set up by Hamas posed a challenge to the demilitarization efforts.

""We’re dealing with miles and miles of kilometers of tunnel networks,"" he said. ""We’re dealing with two decades of terrorist infrastructure. All that has to be confronted, and we’ll do that together with Israel.""

He emphasized the multinational commitment to disarmament.

Responding to the Knesset's vote to advance a bill to annex the occupied West Bank, Rubio said, ""It was used to embarrass Netanyahu."" He added that he doesn't think annexation will actually happen and said it would jeopardize the ceasefire agreement between Hamas and Israel.

""It’s a threat to the peace process, and everybody knows it,"" he said. ""But I’m not getting to the middle of Israeli politics. We’re focused on peace and security.""

Statement

Verdict

The Ontario ad is an edited, heavily condensed version of a Ronald Reagan speech, but the sentiment is unchanged and is an accurate reflection of the former president's views on protectionism.

Analysis

Trump said late last night that he was canceling trade talks with Canada after the province of Ontario ran an ad attacking his trade war and the negative effects it anticipates from higher trade tariffs.

The ad used an edited speech by Ronald Reagan in 1987 in which he said, among other things: ""High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries, and the triggering of fierce trade wars.""

Trump dismissed the ad as “FAKE,” implying it misrepresented or distorted the former president’s words.

The Ontario ad changes the order of Reagan’s words, quotes only part of some sentences and removes some of the very specific original context on how he had — very reluctantly and contrary to his economic philosophy — just imposed tariffs on Japan in a dispute over semiconductors.

But the sentiment expressed in the ad is unchanged: Reagan's speech was anti-protectionist and he did say, referring to his own tariffs, that “over the long run such trade barriers hurt every American worker and consumer.”

Trump has doubled down on his criticism this morning, posting on Truth Social that Canada ""fraudulently took a big buy ad saying that Ronald Reagan did not like Tariffs, when actually he LOVED TARIFFS FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND ITS NATIONAL SECURITY.""

The Reagan Foundation said it was considering its legal options regarding the ad, which it said misrepresents the remarks and used the speech without permission. But that legality issue aside, it’s not clear in what way Reagan’s words were misrepresented.

Ambassador Steve Fagin, a seasoned career U.S. diplomat, is expected to be tapped as the State Department's liaison to the Civilian Military Coordination Center monitoring the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas and coordinating the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza, two sources familiar with the matter told NBC News.

Fagin is currently serving as U.S. ambassador to Yemen and has almost two decades of field experience in the foreign service.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to visit the coordination center in southern Israel later this week.

“We’ll be assigning some career, experienced State Department personnel to sort of be there to help coordinate all these efforts,” Rubio told reporters shortly before his departure for Israel on Wednesday. “It’s important particularly over the next couple of weeks, that we keep the cease fire together.”

Fagin will face an uphill battle increasing humanitarian assistance to meet the needs of a starving population in Gaza.

After two years of war, a United Nations hunger monitor warned in August that Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip were confronting manmade faminelike conditions.

The flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza increased 46% in the first week of the fragile U.S. brokered ceasefire, according to the U.N.

Fagin is also likely to face some skepticism from aid groups after the U.S. backed the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which required Palestinians to travel to four aid distribution hubs rather than bringing the aid directly to civilians.

“Humanitarian assistance must enter the Gaza Strip at scale to meet the enormous needs of the population wherever they are,” Farhan Haq, the deputy spokesperson for the U.N. secretary general, said yesterday.

New York Attorney General Letitia James, a longtime political foe of Trump who previously sued him for making misleading statements to banks, is scheduled to be arraigned today in federal court on bank fraud charges.

A grand jury in Virginia indicted James, a Democrat, this month, weeks after Trump posted a message on Truth Social pressing Attorney General Pam Bondi to take action against her and two other political adversaries.

James is charged with one count of bank fraud and one count of making false statements to a financial institution. The indictment alleges she falsely claimed that a home in Norfolk, Virginia, was her second residence, allowing her to obtain favorable loan terms, and that she rented the property to a family of three.

For the 12th time, Senate Democrats blocked the Republican Party’s government funding legislation this week without a single senator switching his or her vote.

Just three Democratic caucus members voted for the bill: John Fetterman, D-Pa.; Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev.; and Angus King, I-Maine. That means Republicans are still five votes short of the 60-vote threshold to ensure passage of the bill, just as they have been since before the government shut down 23 days ago.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told NBC News he’s taken aback by some of the Democratic posturing and rhetoric.

“I’m surprised at how open they’ve been about it,” Thune said in an interview Thursday. “That statement yesterday by that House member that they know the American people are going to suffer but this is their leverage? This isn’t about leverage. This isn’t a political game. It’s about people’s lives.”

President Donald Trump’s scorched-earth immigration policy has led to a historic drop in attempted crossings on foot. At the same time, repression and detentions of immigrants within the country have surged.

For Mr. Trump, closing the border seems to be a promise fulfilled. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reported in mid-September that the number of people caught trying to cross illegally had dropped 96% in 2025 compared with 2024, to 6,319 cases—an average of 204 per day. According to the DHS, 2 million people have already left the U.S. during the first 250 days of the Trump administration, of whom 400,000 were deported; the rest departed voluntarily.

The United Nations confirmed similar figures, noting a 97% drop in border-crossing attempts between January and August, compared with 260,000 in the same period of 2024, based on monitoring of key migration routes. Interviews conducted by the UN Human Rights Office with 182 migrants who decided to return home found that 49% said crossing had become “impossible,” while 46% cited fear of Trump’s crackdown.

With the border quieter, turmoil has moved north, into the country’s interior. The government’s aggressive approach has produced striking images: students detained on the streets by masked agents, immigrants and even U.S. citizens violently confronted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, and families left desperate as loved ones are taken before immigration courts.

The case of Kilmar Armando Ábrego García—deported illegally to El Salvador despite a court order forbidding it—has become emblematic. Rights groups have taken the government to court, denouncing human rights violations and unsanitary detention conditions. Recently, the Supreme Court authorized police to detain individuals with “Hispanic appearance” before checking their immigration status—a ruling that has deepened the sense of insecurity, even among American citizens.

“I came to this country seeking safety and justice. Instead, I was arrested after a hearing and taken to a place designed to break you. The lights never go out, the cold is unbearable. They denied even the most basic human right,” said one immigrant involved in a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), speaking anonymously and referring to being denied bathroom access.

Valor visited both sides of the border between San Diego (California) and Yuma (Arizona), including the famous dune fields that have served as backdrops for films such as Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope (1977). The area reflects a land divided even in name: known as Algodones on the Mexican side and officially as the Imperial Sand Dunes in the U.S. The same applies to El Centinela, a mountain straddling the border—Americans call the 780-meter peak Mount Signal.

Traveling through the region, one quickly notices the shared physiognomy and the strong influence of Mexican cuisine. English and Spanish flow interchangeably, mirroring the fluid cultural identity of a border whose complexity goes far beyond static walls.

Sales executive Kirstin Backes, 36, was training for a dune rally when the reporter visited. Born in California, she works with high-performance cars and feels a deep connection to the dunes, which her family has visited since her childhood. “The dunes show how arbitrary the border can be,” she said, pointing to areas where the sand nearly swallows the wall. “The wall was built by humans, but nature seems to mock it.”

Ms. Backes fears coming across dying migrants in the dunes and says the presence of heavily armed guards makes her uneasy. While reluctant to publicly criticize the government, she believes Trump’s policies are hurting both the economy and society.

“I hope people out there understand that most Americans don’t support these policies—or at least not the way they’re being enforced,” she said. “Trump is using immigrants as political weapons to feed fear.”

Along the 250-kilometer stretch between the Pacific Ocean and Yuma, the border remains sealed and tightly guarded, with Border Patrol trucks stationed roughly every 25 kilometers. Approaching within 91 meters of the nine-meter-high steel wall is prohibited, as is flying drones nearby. Funds from the “Big Beautiful Bill”—so far Mr. Trump’s only legislative victory—will finance further expansion of walls, roads, sensors, and surveillance.

The border agents, cordial but visibly bored, took the opportunity to chat with the reporter. In September, the desert heat was still punishing, with temperatures reaching a perceived 45 degrees Celsius. Federal Route 8 cuts across the region, but crossing on foot is nearly impossible. The nearest city, Yuma, lies 31 kilometers away.

Except for areas managed by the National Park Service—accessible only between November and March—the region is desolate. In the desert, a few emergency phones for migrants, installed by the California government, punctuate the emptiness. Near one stands a small memorial to Rebecca Castellanos, who died in 2022.

Agents, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that crossings have decreased. In Arizona, some attempts still occur in less-patrolled areas. Their main concern now, they said, are vehicles trying to cut through the desert to pick up migrants who manage to evade natural barriers. The entire region is monitored by solar-powered cameras from Anduril, a U.S. defense technology company specializing in artificial intelligence.

In Yuma—a city known for its large population of American retirees who cross into Mexico to buy cheaper medicine and health services—the heat makes life even harsher. A $309 million contract was signed to reinforce 43 kilometers of the nine-meter-high wall. Apart from a few heroin addicts frozen in distorted poses beneath canopies, the city consists mainly of cars shuttling between air-conditioned malls and drive-thru restaurants.

East of Yuma, natural barriers grow stronger: the Colorado River, the Sonoran Desert, and farther east, the Rio Grande. Between Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, the border is more porous—in stretches where rivers do not define the boundary, pedestrian barriers are still under construction, unlike the nearly completed section in California.

Crossing from Calexico (U.S.) to Mexicali (Mexico), Valor saw little visible police or military presence beyond a single checkpoint with sniffer dogs on the road to Tijuana. A dirt road just a few kilometers before it offered an easy detour. The border crossing itself was surprisingly fast, with no passport checks—only cameras photographing vehicles and passengers.

The world’s busiest border city, Tijuana—now home to 1.8 million residents—emerged during the colonial era and grew after the border’s demarcation in 1848. Once a hub for brothels and casinos, it evolved in the 20th century into North America’s largest medical device manufacturing center. It is also widely seen as the point where Latin America ends.

At the western edge, the playa offers the most striking face of the border: the wall extends 50 meters into the sea. The spot has become a tourist attraction, with murals condemning U.S. immigration policies and honoring those who died or disappeared during crossings. Even a fragment of the Berlin Wall stands nearby, beside vendors selling ice cream and micheladas—a traditional Mexican drink of beer mixed with chili and lime.

Nearby, car washer Álvaro Lopez, 52, recalls the days before the wall existed. “It used to be just a fence. We interacted a lot—we’d go play on the other side. But in the 1990s, they started putting up the wall,” said Mr. Lopez, who has worked there for 40 years and has a daughter living in the U.S.

Writer and professor Pepe Rojo, 57, crosses the border weekly to teach at the University of California, San Diego. Having lived on the border for 19 years, his artistic performances—which blend science fiction, mock newspapers from the future, and robots played by local activists—critique the harsh realities of maquiladora factories and the endless waits faced by migrants in daily border lines. “Things started getting worse after 9/11,” he said.

At the playa, families picnic, avoid the polluted water, and listen to mariachis playing for spare change. Many gaze through the narrow slits of the wall toward San Diego. For Mr. Rojo, this routine captures how border residents cope with their reality. “It’s something they face every day—a very concrete part of their lives. There’s no hatred, just resignation,” he said.

“Rather than supporting and working with federal law enforcement professionals, California politicians, including U.S. Representative Nancy Pelosi and San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins, have instead called for state and local law enforcement officials to ‘arrest’ federal agents and officers for enforcing federal laws enacted by the U.S. Congress, including federal immigration laws,” Blanche wrote in his missive.

“The Department of Justice views any arrests of federal agents and officers in the performance of their official duties as both illegal and futile,” he added. “Numerous federal laws prohibit interfering with and impeding immigration or other law-enforcement operations.”

Blanche said the DOJ would “investigate and prosecute any state or local official” who flouts federal statutes or directs or conspires with others to violate them.

The deputy AG further ordered the California officials to “preserve all written and electronic communications and records related to any attempts or efforts to impede or obstruct federal law enforcement officials.”

“We urge you and other California officials to publicly abandon this apparent criminal conspiracy, to stop threatening law enforcement, and to prioritize the safety of your citizens,” Blanche continued. “In the meantime, federal agents and officers will continue to enforce federal law and will not be deterred by the threat of arrest by California authorities who have abdicated their duty to protect their constituents.”

Amid reports of ICE raids planned for the Bay Area, Pelosi and Rep. Kevin Mullin (D-Calif.) issued a joint statement claiming that California law “prevents federal agents from taking certain actions.”

“While the President may enjoy absolute immunity courtesy of his rogue Supreme Court, those who operate under his orders do not,” the lawmakers wrote. “ Our state and local authorities may arrest federal agents if they break California law — and if they are convicted, the President cannot pardon them.”

This submission focuses on the health impacts of air pollution caused by fossil fuels, drawing on HRW’s recent research and advocacy on environmental issues. In particular, it draws out findings and lessons from our work on fossil fuel production (e.g. refining) and use (e.g. coal-fired power plants) across a variety of locations in countries: the United States, Türkiye, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

The findings summarized in this brief illustrate a consistent human rights impact: fossil fuel production, combustion and processing are a major source of deadly air pollution that seriously harms health—causing respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases and premature deaths, particularly among children, older people and people with pre‑existing health conditions.

Our research further shows that regulatory agencies frequently fail to monitor or enforce air quality standards, to the detriment of public health and in some cases, in violation of the right to health information. The people living in and around oil, gas, and coal extraction sites, refineries, power plants, and pipelines often have extremely limited means to protect their health from the devastating impacts of toxic air pollution.

After briefly summarizing our research findings, HRW respectfully offers recommendations for tackling these challenges and strengthening air quality protections in line with human rights obligations.

Weak or unenforced regulations

HRW research has identified that governments often fail to adopt and implement comprehensive pollutant limits consistent with the World Health Organization’s (WHO) 2021 Air Quality Guidelines. This includes standards for fine particulate matter (PM2.5), responsible for the most deaths worldwide from any air pollutant, according to the Health Effects Institute (HEI) and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME).

In Bosnia and Herzegovina (2022), HRW documented that enforcement of air quality standards is poor. HRW found that although air quality standards were generally in line with EU standards (although less robust than WHO guidelines), local officials tasked with various aspects of air quality management said they weren’t enforced. Likewise, between 2018 and 2022 the state breached Energy Community Treaty standards on emissions (for PM2.5, NOx, and SO2) from prescribed coal-fired power plants. In 2020 the plants were emitting almost 10 times as much SO2 as permitted by the treaty. The country had one of the world’s highest mortality rates from air pollution, according to WHO data.

A 2023 HRW investigation into the toxic air pollution caused by expanding fossil fuel operations in the UAE found that PM2.5 concentrations have been consistently above WHO-recommended levels. HRW also analyzed the annual PM10 concentrations from 2018 to 2022 throughout the country, finding that the average of all the stations in 2022 was more than eight times the yearly WHO recommendation. Based on WHO estimates of the death rate attributable to outdoor air pollution, 1,872 people died from air pollution-related illnesses in the UAE in 2019. While the government recognizes the problem of air pollution, its current air-quality standards are much weaker than what the WHO recommends. For instance, the UAE lacks regulatory limits on PM 2.5 (daily and annual), PM10 (annual), NO2 (annual).

In Türkiye (2024), HRW found that air quality standards are less strict than those recommended by WHO and do not include a limit for PM2.5, leaving a major regulatory gap. By early 2024 Türkiye had become Europe’s largest coal-fired electricity producer , accounting for 73 percent of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and certain coal projects that are planned (and seeking approvals and financing) but not yet built. Based on the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, more than 35,000 people died from air pollution-related illnesses in 2019 in Türkiye.

Flawed environmental impact assessments

Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) are a critical tool to determine a proposed activity or project’s possible impact on air quality and the health of fenceline communities. Inadequate EIAs allow polluting activities to be approved despite known risks to human health.

Successive Turkish governments have built and expanded two of the country’s biggest coal power plants, plants A and B, in Afşin-Elbistan. HRW found that air pollution levels near plant A – and the later-built plant B two kilometers away – are dangerously high and that residents are experiencing health conditions that academic studies have attributed to air pollution from the plants. Despite this, Turkish authorities were presented with an EIA that gave the go-ahead for the expansion of plant A, which is projected to lead to an estimated 1,900 premature deaths over its 30-year economic lifespan. HRW found the EIA failed to meet national and international standards.

Specifically, HRW found that the EIA: (i) lacked an adequate assessment of baseline air quality which fails to integrate the existing air pollution problem of the region, (ii) ignored the impact of air pollution on human health; (iii) failed to adequately evaluate the worst-case scenario as technological deficiencies of the Afşin Elbistan A Plant were not taken into account; (iv) lacked a cumulative impact assessment based on the planned projects and relevant existing industrial installations; and (v) failed to respect consultation and participation rights. In 2025, authorities approved the Afşin-Elbistan plant’s expansion.

Disproportionate health impacts on marginalized populations

HRW research on the health impacts of the fossil fuel industry has identified that, in many cases, polluting facilities are located within or near marginalized communities, compounding existing inequalities and exposing residents to greater health risks. A defining feature of the fossil fuel industry is its tendency to produce sacrifice zones - places where residents suffer devastating physical and mental health consequences that violate their human rights as a result of living in pollution hotspots and heavily contaminated areas.

In the UAE (2023), HRW found that migrant workers—comprising 88% of the population—face severe health impacts from toxic air pollution. Migrant workers, including low-wage workers engaged in outdoor work, described a myriad of health problems that they believe could be related to the toxic air they are breathing: respiratory ailments, skin problems, eye problems, dizziness, cardiovascular diseases, and allergies. In the UAE, people with certain health conditions such as asthma, pregnant women and other people, children, older people, people with disabilities, migrant workers especially those working outdoors, people living in poverty and other socially and economically marginalized populations are more likely to be exposed to or adversely impacted by harmful air pollution.

In the US state of Louisiana (2024), HRW found that residents of the predominantly Black and low-income region known as “Cancer Alley” suffer elevated rates of cancer, reproductive, and respiratory illnesses linked to emissions from fossil fuel and petrochemical operations. Many of the residents of Cancer Alley Human Rights Watch interviewed experienced maternal, reproductive, and newborn health harms. Virtually all could name immediate family members, friends or neighbors who had experienced such harms, including low-birth weight, preterm birth, miscarriage, stillbirths, high risk pregnancy and birth, and infertility. Yet expansion is underway with at least 19 new fossil fuel and petrochemical plants planned at Cancer Alley, including within many of the same predominantly Black and poor communities.

Poor air quality monitoring

Air monitoring is essential for assessing air quality and preventing harmful pollution. When monitoring is lacking or is incomplete, people’s health is put at considerable risk. HRW has identified significant gaps in pollutant monitoring at or nearby fossil fuel and petrochemical facilities.

In Bosnia and Herzegovina (2022), HRW showed that air pollution monitoring stations are often not working or unavailable. Local government officials, particularly outside of Sarajevo, reported having insufficient budgets and a shortage of adequately trained personnel to maintain monitoring stations and report data. The country’s 17 air pollution monitoring stations sometimes are out of service, particularly in Republika Srpska, and many do not adequately monitor PM2.5.

In the UAE (2023), HRW found major inconsistencies and data gaps in official air quality monitoring networks. Although some data from monitoring stations across the country is shared, key pollutants such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5) are sometimes missing from public datasets. The available data is also dispersed across multiple platforms and applications that display inconsistent totals for the number of monitoring stations. Moreover, while existing air quality websites provide measurements from ground level monitoring stations, some do not measure all relevant pollutants, and the standards displayed are less stringent than WHO recommendations.

In Louisiana, USA (2024), HRW found that petrochemical companies underestimated benzene emissions from their operations by up to 28 times. Since 2018, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has required oil refineries to install fenceline monitors to measure benzene levels at their perimeters, where emissions can reach nearby communities. However, out of thousands of petrochemical plants nationwide, only 13 have been required to install similar monitors under federal action. Of these, only four have provided enough data for analysis, revealing two plants, including one located in Cancer Alley, with benzene concentrations exceeding EPA regulatory limits.

In Türkiye (2024), HRW found that the number of monitoring stations remains insufficient. While the Turkish government’s air quality monitoring website provides measurements from ground level monitoring stations across the country, the historic data is at times incomplete and pollution hotspots like Afşin-Elbistan are not closely monitored. According to 2016-2019 data analysis, conditions in at least 21 of 81 provinces could not be adequately assessed because data was available for fewer than 75 percent of days. These shortcomings prevent the Turkish government from reliably monitoring the impact of coal-fired power plants on air quality.

Limited availability of air quality information

Access to information about environmental and health risks and impacts associated with a proposed activity or project is a key component of the right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment. HRW has documented numerous cases in which governments have failed to identify or disclose the air pollution risks posed by the fossil fuel and petrochemical industries, thereby threatening the human rights of nearby communities.

In Bosnia and Herzegovina (2022), HRW reported that while major polluters are legally required to submit air quality data to the government, this information is not made public. Warnings to avoid outdoor activities or to limit vehicular transport on days with poor air quality were largely limited to the capital, Sarajevo. In the absence of adequate government monitoring and communication, a series of citizen-run sensors fill the gap - young people said they regularly use apps or websites that report on air quality, some of them operated by civil society. Others receive air quality updates from television and radio, while others, particularly older people, say they assess air quality based on the smell or the appearance of the air, neither of which is appropriate to determine the extent of air pollution or assess health risks.

In the UAE (2023), HRW documented a dearth of public information about the impacts of air pollution, its sources, and how at-risk populations can protect themselves. The UAE government acknowledged that “[t]here is currently no system to warn the public about inevitable high-level pollution episodes (for example, dust storms) and to provide guidance on how to reduce personal exposure to pollution,” yet it has done little to address these gaps. Migrant workers told HRW that they had no information about the risks of air pollution, its sources, who is most impacted, and how they can protect themselves. Existing air quality websites did not provide practical advice on protection measures and lacked detailed information for at-risk groups. They only exist in Arabic and English and are not accessible to migrant workers who may not speak either of these languages; information is not available in accessible formats.

In Louisiana (2024), HRW found that residents’ complaints to the state’s Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) went unanswered. When residents have questions or concerns about industrial operations, they are instructed to contact the LDEQ. However, instead of serving as a trusted source of information, the agency has become a source of profound frustration for many. The lack of information and action has led many residents to stop contacting the agency altogether.

In Türkiye (2024), HRW noted that emissions from large combustion plants, including coal plants, are not publicly available. Even when courts have ordered the government to provide emissions data of coal plants publicly, the authorities have not revealed the data. Residents in Çoğulhan, Berçenek, and Altunelma, said they have not received any information about the extent of environmental problems in the region, possible health effects, or how to participate in decisions around the coal plant that would enable them to address or prevent health risks and seek remediation for health harms. The Environment Ministry provides some health advice via a website, such as suggesting that members of sensitive groups limit outdoor activities when air pollution levels are high, but it does not provide detailed practical advice for at-risk groups.

Recommendations

As a guiding principle, States should implement moratoria on new or expanded fossil fuel operations and begin phase-out of existing operations. In addition, we recommend the following:

Regulation and enforcement

Order an immediate pause of all fossil fuel and petrochemical operations that pose an imminent and substantial endangerment to human health and the environment until they operate in accordance with relevant legal protections.

Develop and enforce stringent regulations to limit air pollution related to fossil fuel and petrochemical operations, including through legally binding pollutant limits on particulate matter (PM 2.5 ​ and PM 10), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2​), and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions in line with the WHO’s 2021 Air Quality Guidelines. Regulations should also seek a phase-out of venting and flaring of methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas and air pollutant.

Mandate science-based buffer zones separating fossil fuel and petrochemical operations from residential, educational, and recreational areas. As a guiding principle, communities should not be relocated to allow for industry expansion or continued operation. On the contrary, states should prioritize decommissioning and or relocating life-threatening facilities away from where people live, work, learn and play.

Environmental impact assessments

Deny permits for fossil fuel and petrochemical operations that would result in a disproportionate burden of harm in already overburdened communities.

Require EIAs to include air quality and health impact assessments for all fossil fuel and petrochemical projects, including short and long-term health risks from exposure to PM 2.5, PM10, NOX, SO2, CH4 and other pollutants.

Require comprehensive baseline and cumulative air quality assessments, considering existing and planned industrial installations.

Ensure affected individuals and communities can meaningfully participate in the EIA process.

In Trump v. Illinois, the Supreme Court will soon decide whether to issue a stay of a district court’s injunction of the deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago. The government’s brief argues there is “no reason to believe that courts can, or should, second guess the President’s conclusion” that military force is needed to suppress an emergency. “[T]his case,” the brief argues, falls in the heartland of unreviewable presidential “discretion.” Even if judicial review is permissible, the government says, a court must be “highly deferential” to the President’s decision.

The Government’s position cannot withstand even rudimentary analysis. This is because the president’s authority is dramatically weaker when deploying troops domestically than it is when fighting enemies overseas.

Power Over the Military is not Exclusive to the President

The government’s interpretation suggests that a president may deploy military forces anywhere in the United States for any reason, and that courts would have no authority to determine its legality. This assertion runs counter to U.S. history, the structure of powers related to the military in the U.S. Constitution, and the theory of checks and balances.

The Framers and the generation that fought the American Revolution were well aware of the dangers of domestic use of the military. Among the grievances enumerated in the Declaration of Independence, abuse of the military was persistent theme: “He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our Legislature,” and “He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.” The Third Amendment to the Constitution reflects these concerns in its prohibition on quartering soldiers in civilian homes during times of peace without legislation.

For this and other reasons, the Framers wisely disaggregated the military power horizontally across the three branches of the federal government, as well as vertically between the states and the federal government. They gave Congress the unique power to declare war and appropriate funds for military exploits, along with a series of other war-related powers. They gave the executive branch the authority to command troops in battle. They gave the judiciary the ability to arbitrate disputes among the branches and to protect individual rights. They left to the various states the power to call forth a militia to protect the people within their particular jurisdictions.

In addition to the structural constitutional dissipation of control over the military, statutes like the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act forbid the use of the military for domestic law enforcement. Congress similarly banned the use of troops at polls around the same time. Even the Insurrection Act, which champions of presidential power cite as an ace-up-the-president’s sleeve, says that the president’s power to use the militia or armed forces is, among other purposes, to protect against the deprivation “of a right, privilege, immunity or protection named in the Constitution and secured by law” when the state is unable to protect such rights of the people (emphasis added).

In other words, the power of the president to use the military in times of emergency is arguably tethered to the need to protect the constitutional rights of the people. This is consistent with the president’s articulated duty under Article II of the Constitution to “take care that the laws are faithfully executed.”

No Cause for Deference

The claim of extreme judicial deference to the president rests on a false equivalence of foreign and domestic use of the military. There is plenty of case law that supports broad deference for presidential determinations regarding foreign troop deployments. Of course, federal judges have been reluctant in our more recent history to second guess the decision to use the military to defend the United States against foreign enemies, or to micromanage tactical decisions during the course of a war. But when the president seeks to deploy the U.S. armed forces into American streets, the constitutional rights of Americans are potentially under threat, and courts are therefore duty-bound to exercise the utmost vigilance.

It is no accident that President Donald Trump is sending military forces into places in which there are some displays of opposition to his policies, based on an unsubstantiated and politically-motivated claim that these pose a threat to the country. It is no coincidence that in the midst of these deployments, he summoned every U.S. General from around the world to Washington to inform them that they need to focus on “the enemy within,” and urged them to use American cities as training grounds for the use of military force.

History tells us that deploying the military against one’s own people is the sine qua non of an authoritarian state, and represents the corruption of the military to solidify power. Be it Jews or other religious minorities, immigrants, infidels, suspected criminals, or alleged traitors, the “strong” leader convinces the population that these “others” are the true threat to national security and that therefore a military response is needed. Extreme deference to the president’s domestic use of the military abdicates the fundamental duty of courts to closely examine threats to fundamental constitutional rights of free speech and assembly that are the bedrock of a democracy.

The United States military swears an oath of allegiance to the Constitution. The oath of office of military officers, unlike that of enlisted servicemembers, contains no explicit commitment to follow presidential orders. Following military orders is obligatory, but only insofar as such orders are lawful. The same was true in Nazi Germany until August 2, 1934, when, following the death of President Paul von Hindenburg, the oath to follow the Weimar Constitution was replaced with an oath of allegiance to Adolf Hitler. Following that date, the German military was under the control of the Führer, sealing the death of German democracy until well after the end of the Second World War. More recently, two weeks ago in Madagascar, the civilian government was toppled by a military coup, the latest in a series of African countries to lose civilian control of the government—including military takeovers in Mali, Niger, Chad, Sudan, and Burkina Faso, not to mention those in other regions, including Myanmar.

If the Supreme Court decides to grant certiorari in the Illinois case or in a similar case involving use of the National Guard, such as the Oregon or California cases, the question of deference to presidential authority as Commander-in-Chief will be front and center. The government will once again argue that there is no basis for federal courts to second-guess presidential decisions regarding the deployment of U.S. troops, and that under Article II such second-guessing would be a violation of the separation of powers. Yet this appeal to presidential deference would ignore the basic distribution of military powers in both constitutional and statutory form that has existed for the entirety of U.S. history.

No case holds that the courts are powerless to prevent an illegal deployment of troops within the United States. How could it? Such a holding would render separation of powers meaningless and destroy the judiciary’s role as a bulwark against tyranny. The Court must remember its statement from 1972 in Laird v. Tatum:

“[T]here is nothing in our Nation’s history or in this Court’s decided cases… that can properly be seen as giving any indication that actual or threatened injury by reason of unlawful activities of the military would go unnoticed or unremedied.”

Military rule and military coups have been fanciful, far-off threats in the United States, but President Trump has now made this threat real in his war against “the enemy within.” The Supreme Court must not shirk its obligation to ensure that presidents cannot conscript the military in an effort to undermine democracy.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2239825286.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 13:16:57.569850

In a recent case addressing sovereign immunity for Native American tribes, Washington Supreme Court Justice Sal Mungia issued an unusual concurrence: He agreed with the state high court’s legal ruling that, under U.S. Supreme Court precedent, the Stillaguamish tribe is immune from a lawsuit over land ownership. “But I dissent,” he wrote in Flying T Ranch v. Stillaguamish, “from the racism embedded in the federal case law that applies to this dispute.”

Mungia’s concurrence lays out the racist stereotypes rooted in the landmark U.S. Supreme Court rulings cited by the Washington high court. In these 19th-century cases, justices described Native Americans as “low in the grade of organized society” and with a “savage nature.” These cases, Mungia argued, were based on racist premises.

Mungia’s concurrence was striking not only for pointing out the prejudices baked into long-standing precedents, but also for how it engaged with his role as a state court judge in our federal system. Mungia acknowledged that the Washington Supreme Court is bound to follow U.S. Supreme Court precedents. However, “we are not bound to stay silent as to the underlying racism and prejudices that are woven into the very fabric of those opinions,” he argued. He called on his colleagues to “clearly, loudly, and unequivocally state that was ‘wrong.’”

While the cases Mungia condemns are more than a century old, state judges have also sharply critiqued some contemporary U.S. Supreme Court decisions as resting on their own illegitimate bases. Last month, for example, Justice Todd Eddins of the Hawaii Supreme Court pointed to recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings, including on its shadow docket, as reflecting a “throw-judges-under-the-bus disdain for district courts, the fact-finders of the federal judiciary.” Looking at the high court’s Establishment Clause jurisprudence, Eddins argued in his Hilo Bay Marina v. Hawaii concurrence that the justices had “repackaged and whitewashed facts to achieve a desired outcome” and imposed policy preferences by “unprincipled fiat.”

When it comes to critiquing the U.S. Supreme Court, state supreme court justices enjoy a unique institutional posture: Like all judges, they can speak to the reality of having to apply problematic precedents, but they also sit outside the federal judicial hierarchy that often leads lower court judges to bite their tongues. Notably, while federal judges have increasingly spoken up to criticize the Court’s use of the shadow docket in litigation involving the Trump administration — which is highly unusual in itself — they’ve largely done so anonymously.

State supreme court justices are also in a special position because they sit atop state judiciaries as the ultimate word in interpreting state laws. This means that within their own sphere, they can model an alternative to the Court in how they interpret, apply, and grapple with their states’ constitutions, laws, and precedents. Eddins, for example, observed that when it comes to interpreting his state’s constitution, he treats recent Supreme Court jurisprudence as “white noise.” And as Mungia notes, the Washington Supreme Court has previously repudiated some of its own prior decisions that “disregarded the rights of Native Americans and their treaty rights.”

Historically, controversial Supreme Court decisions weren’t the end of the conversation about the meaning of the U.S. Constitution and other federal laws. Cases like Lochner v. New York, which invalidated labor protections as inconsistent with the right to freedom of contract, were just the beginning of dialogue — and sometimes conflict, between the Supreme Court and Congress, the states, and other institutional actors. Today’s state court opinions may signal a new generation of contestation.

This comes as 41 aid organizations, including Oxfam and the Norwegian Refugee Council, have published an open letter accusing Israel of “arbitrarily” rejecting aid deliveries into Gaza. The letter says, “Aid denied by Israeli authorities includes tents and tarpaulins, blankets, mattresses, food and nutrition supplies, hygiene kits, sanitation materials, assistive devices, and children’s clothing, all of which should be unrestricted during the ceasefire.” The World Food Programme warned it was falling short of its target of sending 2,000 tons of food into Gaza. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization described Gaza’s starvation crisis as “catastrophic.”

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus: “There is increase in amount after the ceasefire, but what is entering Gaza is significantly below the required target. Significantly below the required target. And that I also can explain the second — can be an answer to the second question: Is there a dent in hunger level? So, if the Gaza that — if the aid that’s entering Gaza is significantly low, it cannot dent the hunger level. And the situation still remains catastrophic, because what’s entering is not enough.”

In Israel, Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with senior Israeli army officials and held a news conference in Kiryat Gat, the site of a new international command center with troops from the U.S., U.K., Jordan and the UAE. Rubio said that the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, cannot have a role in the Gaza Strip; Rubio called it a “subsidiary of Hamas.” Since the U.S.-brokered ceasefire came into effect on October 10, Israel has killed nearly 100 Palestinians and wounded 230 in Gaza.

President Trump responded Thursday to the Israeli Knesset’s vote advancing legislation that would annex the occupied West Bank.

President Donald Trump: “The West Bank is — don’t worry about the West Bank. Israel’s not going to do anything with the West Bank, OK? Don’t worry about it. Is that your question? They’re not going to do anything with the West Bank. Don’t worry about it. Israel’s doing very well. They’re not going to do anything with it.”

This follows a Time magazine interview in which Trump firmly opposed Israeli annexation, saying, “It won’t happen because I gave my word to the Arab countries. Israel would lose all of its support from the United States if that happened.” Separately, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called annexation in the West Bank a “threat to the peace process.”

Meanwhile, Al Jazeera is reporting that a child has died after being wounded by Israeli forces during a raid in Nablus. UNRWA reports more than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed in settler and Israeli army attacks in the occupied West Bank since October 7, 2023. We’ll have more on this story later in the broadcast.

Members of the Israeli opposition are slamming far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich for his “harmful” comments about Saudi Arabia. Smotrich resorted to stereotypes when he said he wouldn’t agree to a normalization deal with Saudi Arabia if it required Israel to recognize a Palestinian state.

Bezalel Smotrich: “If Saudi Arabia says to us 'normalization in exchange for a Palestinian state,' friend, no, thank you. Continue riding camels on the sand in the desert. And Saudi Arabia, we will continue to develop, really, with economy and society and state and all the great and wonderful things that we know how to do.”

Smotrich has since apologized for his comments. This comes as President Trump is set to host Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House next month. It will be the Saudi crown prince’s first visit to the U.S. since the 2018 murder of columnist Jamal Khashoggi.

President Trump asserted Thursday that he had the authority to continue to launch airstrikes against alleged drug boats in international waters without a congressional declaration of war. Since September, the Pentagon says it’s struck nine alleged drug boats, killing 37 people.

President Donald Trump: “Well, I don’t think we’re going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war. I think we’re just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. OK? We’re going to kill them. You know? They’re going to be, like, dead. OK.”

Trump also denied reports by The Wall Street Journal that the U.S. is sending B-1 bombers near Venezuela. Meanwhile, Venezuela’s Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López announced he’s deploying armed forces along the country’s coastline.

Vladimir Padrino López: “No attempt to destabilize the Venezuelan nation will pass through here. They may send however many CIA-affiliated units in covert operations from any flank of the nation, and any attempt will fail, as they have failed so far.”

President Trump says he’s suspended trade talks with Canada over an advertisement produced by the government of Ontario that criticizes tariffs. The ad features excerpts of a 1987 address by then-President Ronald Reagan warning of the dire consequences of high tariffs, like the 35% tariff Trump has imposed on most Canadian goods not covered under a trade agreement.

President Ronald Reagan: “High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars. Then the worst happens. Markets shrink and collapse. Businesses and industries shut down, and millions of people lose their jobs.”

In a social media post, Trump lashed out at the one-minute ad, calling it ”FAKE,” writing, “Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED.”

The federal government shutdown has entered its 24th day. It’s now the second longest in U.S. history, rivaled only by the 2018-2019 shutdown during Trump’s first term. On Thursday, the Senate rejected competing partisan bills to compensate some federal workers who’ve gone without pay since early October.

This comes as at least 36 states are warning they’re preparing to suspend November payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities warns that would leave about one out of every eight people in the U.S. without food assistance, including some 16 million children, 8 million older adults and 4 million people with disabilities.

The Trump administration finalized plans Thursday to open more than a million-and-a-half acres of Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling. The Interior Department also announced the first oil and gas lease sale with the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska since 2019, and it approved a more than 200-mile industrial road through Alaska’s Izembek National Wildlife Refuge.

Environmentalists condemned the announcements. In a statement, the Alaska Wilderness League wrote, “Opening the entire coastal plain of the Arctic refuge to drilling would destroy one of the most ecologically significant landscapes on earth — the birthing grounds of the porcupine caribou herd, vital habitat for polar bears and migratory birds, and sacred land for the Gwich’in people who have stewarded its resources for millennia.”

President Trump on Thursday pardoned the convicted founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty in 2023 to enabling money laundering while he was CEO of Binance. According to The Wall Street Journal, Binance struck a business deal with World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s crypto startup, which has generated $4.5 billion since Trump returned to office. Binance also reportedly hired lobbyist Charles McDowell, who is a close friend of Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. Republican Senator Thom Tillis blasted the pardon, saying it sends “a bad signal.” When asked about Zhao’s pardon, President Trump said, “I don’t know, he was recommended by a lot of people.”

The Trump administration has released a list of wealthy donors and corporations funding President Trump’s $300 million construction of a 90,000-square-foot ballroom at the White House. Among the donors are Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Palantir, Lockheed Martin and more. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is contributing $22 million, after settling a lawsuit Trump filed against YouTube for banning him from the platform after he incited his followers to attack the Capitol on January 6, 2021.

On Thursday, the Secret Service shut off public access to the Ellipse, a public park adjacent to the White House and one of the only spots to view the demolition. Photos show the entire East Wing has been knocked down.

President Trump says he’s canceled plans to send federal forces into San Francisco. On Thursday, Trump wrote on social media that he’d been talked out his plans for what he called a “surge” after he spoke with his “friends” — the CEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, and the CEO of Salesforce, Marc Benioff. Trump’s sudden reversal came as protesters rallied outside a U.S. Coast Guard base on the San Francisco Bay, where more than 100 federal agents were reportedly preparing to ramp up immigration raids. Police used flash-bang grenades to drive protesters away from an entrance as Customs and Border Patrol vehicles drove through. Separately, city officials joined protests at San Francisco City Hall. This is Laura Valdez, director of Mission Action, which works on behalf of low-income and immigrant communities.

Laura Valdez: “Please remember that this might be the start of mass enforcement in our communities, and we need to prepare adequately. And even if it is not the start, we still need to be prepared. And this community is here to back you up.”

Meanwhile, former House speaker and longtime San Francisco Congressmember Nancy Pelosi is warning federal agents they could face arrest by local police if they break California law while carrying out immigration sweeps. In a statement, Pelosi wrote, “While the President may enjoy absolute immunity courtesy of his rogue Supreme Court, those who operate under his orders do not. Our state and local authorities may arrest federal agents if they break California law — and if they are convicted, the President cannot pardon them.” In response, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche wrote on X, “Stand down or face prosecution.

The wait is over. The Texas Supreme Court recently finalized amendments to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 201, implementing the Uniform Interstate Depositions and Discovery Act (“UIDDA”).[1] The amendments took effect August 31, 2025, marking a shift in how parties conduct interstate discovery involving Texas witnesses.

By adopting the UIDDA, Texas has joined the overwhelming majority of states in streamlining interstate discovery. Massachusetts, Missouri, and New Hampshire remain the only states that have yet to adopt some version of the UIDDA, leaving them as outliers in an otherwise uniform national system.

What Changed

For decades, attorneys seeking evidence in Texas for an out-of-state proceeding were first required to obtain a “mandate, writ, or commission” from the court where the lawsuit was pending. This process was cumbersome because it involved unnecessary delays and expenses.

Now, under Rule 201.3, a party simply submits an out-of-state subpoena to a court clerk in the Texas county where discovery is sought. The clerk must then promptly issue an equivalent Texas subpoena incorporating the same terms—with no judicial stamp of approval required.

The new rule applies to subpoenas requiring witnesses to:

Attend and give testimony at depositions (oral examination or written questions); or

Produce documents or tangible things.

Importantly, this request does not constitute an appearance in Texas courts, which means out-of-state attorneys can obtain subpoenas without needing to be licensed in Texas, seek pro hac vice admission, or hire local counsel to issue and serve the subpoena.

Once issued, the Texas subpoena must be served according to Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 176 and 205. From there, Texas law controls. Any discovery disputes, whether concerning protective orders or enforcement, get resolved in Texas courts.

One Key Limitation: Property Inspections

Texas’s version of the UIDDA, however, includes a notable exception that prevents clerks from issuing subpoenas for premises inspections. Litigants will still need a court order for subpoenas seeking inspection of property. Rule 201.3 covers testimony and documents, while carving out and preserving Texas’s traditional requirement for judicial oversight of property inspections.

Why This Matters

The new rule simplifies interstate discovery by eliminating jurisdictional hurdles, reducing costs, and accelerating the discovery process. By directing clerks to act “promptly” and without the need for judicial intervention, the UIDDA framework removes delays that previously plagued litigation across state lines. This change benefits both out-of-state parties seeking discovery in Texas and Texas litigants conducting discovery in other UIDDA states that require reciprocity.

Companies with employees, documents, or operations in Texas can expect to see an increase in out-of-state discovery requests, as the process is now more efficient for parties in litigation elsewhere to obtain testimony and documents from Texas witnesses. Businesses should review their document retention policies and ensure employees understand their potential obligations when served with out-of-state subpoenas.

[1] On June 11, 2023, the Texas Legislature passed H.B. 3929, directing the Texas Supreme Court to consider adopting the UIDDA before September 1, 2025. Tex. HB 3929, 88th Leg., R.S. (2023).

Angelou recalls someone exclaiming, “‘This ain’t no United Nations.","The 80th anniversary session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York began in September 2025 under the theme, “Better together: 80 years and more for peace, development and human rights.” This theme likely does not resonate in South America and the Caribbean as the United States extrajudicially kills civilians from the region on fishing boats in international waters, in violation of the use of force rules of the U.N. Charter. The U.N. has urged restraint while the United States claims the laws of war apply and summarily executes people without trial for unsubstantiated allegations of drug trafficking. “Better together” likely also comes across as empty rhetoric in Sudan, which currently faces the largest humanitarian crisis since recordkeeping began, where the U.N. has been engaged in longstanding conflict resolution efforts.

Additionally, the anniversary theme most certainly falls flat in Haiti, given the U.N.’s shameful history there. In 2010, peacekeepers charged with protecting Haitians were responsible for a deadly cholera epidemic which resulted in 800,000 cases and killed an estimated 10,000 Haitians. Despite Haiti having no history of cholera outbreaks, the U.N. took years to admit its role and did not provide effective remedy. Peacekeepers in Haiti also committed widespread rape, sexual abuse, and sexual exploitation of women and children without redress. One survivor surmised, “As far as the U.N. goes, they came here to protect us, but all they’ve brought is destruction.”

In too many instances, the U.N. has largely functioned to preserve unjust global power dynamics. At the time of its founding in 1945, racial apartheid remained a brutal reality and approximately 750 million people were subject to colonial domination and rule. The U.N. continues to institutionalize this hierarchy; as South African President Cyril Ramaphosa recently commented: “Five permanent members effectively make decisions on behalf of more than 85% of the world’s population living in countries of the Global South.”

Recalling the 1960 coup in the Republic of the Congo (now Democratic Republic of Congo), and a subsequent protest at the U.N. offers a window to see the U.N.’s malignant neglect more clearly.

Coup in the Congo

Amidst the wave of decolonization in Africa following World War II, the Belgian government planned to formally grant independence to Congo, while neo-colonially governing key areas. Belgium desired to maintain control of Congo’s vast mineral riches. Today, for example, Congo holds half the world’s reserve of cobalt, used in batteries for cell phones, cars, computers, and other electronics. During the handover ceremony in June 1960, newly elected Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba forcefully asserted independence, declaring, “We who suffered in our bodies and hearts from colonialist oppression, we say to you out loud: from now on, all that is over.” But following almost a century of colonization, the road ahead was not easy.

On July 5, 1960, Congolese rank-and-file soldiers mutinied in response to Belgian military officials proclaiming, “Before independence = after independence.” The soldiers were disgruntled by lack of leadership changes and wanted higher wages. Sensing an opportunity, Belgium immediately reasserted power. With Belgian support, the mineral-rich province of Katanga seceded, with Moïse Tshombe as nominal leader. Both feared the central government’s encroachment on lucrative mining profits, which provided 60 percent of the country’s income.

To respond to the secession, Lumumba traveled to the United States to request assistance from it and the U.N. While in New York, Lumumba met with the activist and writer Rosa Guy, founding member of the Harlem Writers Guild. The United States rebuffed Lumumba, and while the U.N. assembled a large peacekeeping force, Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld refused to allow U.N. forces to intervene in Katanga. Making matters worse, when he later visited the country, Hammarskjöld declined to meet with Lumumba, heading instead to see Tshombe and seemingly granting him legitimacy. Guy lobbied informally to member States of the U.N. that they should continue to recognize Lumumba as Congo’s legitimately elected prime minister.

Simultaneously, Lumumba faced prospects of a secession from the mineral-heavy province of South Kassai. Consequently, he approved army chief Joseph Desiré Mobutu’s plan to lead an attack on the province. Congolese troops subsequently rampaged, resulting in massive killings and alienating many from Lumumba’s government.

With few options left, Lumumba turned to the Soviet Union for military aid. The Soviets agreed, incensing the United States, given their Cold War rivalry. In August 1960, the U.S. government authorized a clandestine scheme to “replace the Lumumba Government by constitutional means.” The U.S. ambassador advised President Joseph Kasavubu to buy votes in parliament prior to a no-confidence vote against Lumumba. Though Kasavubu did not follow the advice and lost the vote, on Sept. 5, 1960, he nevertheless announced Lumumba’s dismissal on the radio.

Over cables, Hammarskjöld indicated that the U.N. had no issues with Lumumba’s illegal removal from power. U.N. officials in Congo even attempted to stop Lumumba from challenging his purported dismissal, though he eventually did so on the radio.

By Sept. 14, 1960, the CIA’s principal agent and Lumumba’s erstwhile confidante Mobutu, spearheaded a military coup. Conor Cruise O’Brien, a U.N. official in charge of operations in Congo, remarked that the U.N. displayed a concern for legalism “when it was a question of rescuing Lumumba which was quite absent from their very uninhibited phase of activity when it was a question of bringing about Lumumba’s political destruction.”

On Jan. 17, 1961, the day of Lumumba’s assassination, Mobutu delivered Lumumba to Tshombe, Belgian officials, and mercenaries who beat him bloody. Stuart Reid, a history and foreign policy writer, gruesomely details how Katanga’s Belgian police commissioner and the police commissioner’s brother used sulfuric acid, turning Lumumba “into a mass of mucus.” When the acid finished, only Lumumba’s bones and teeth remained. Reid recounts how the Belgians twisted teeth out of Lumumba’s skull with pliers. They then set the remaining parts of Lumumba aflame. The CIA has since acknowledged its involvement in Lumumba’s demise and claims that the U.N. and Belgium played “equally important roles.”

A Demonstration at the U.N.

Lumumba’s execution was met with grief and despair within Congo and beyond. Across the Atlantic, as part of the Black freedom movement, activists and writers Maya Angelou and Rosa Guy, along with jazz great Abbey Lincoln had previously created the Cultural Association for Women of African Heritage (CAWAH), an organization of artists dedicated to supporting the movement. Following Lumumba’s murder, Congolese diplomats informed Guy, who shared the devastating news with Angelou. Angelou wrote of her profound experience in her autobiography, “The Heart of a Woman”: “I knew no words which would match the emptiness of the moment. . . the loss of one hero was a setback of such proportion it could dishearten us and weaken the struggle.”

Guy’s connections with Congolese diplomats tipped them off that Adlai Stevenson, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., was about to announce Lumumba’s murder at the U.N. Following a CAWAH meeting in Harlem, Guy and Angelou stumbled upon Malcom X delivering a speech, which inspired them greatly. Angelou wrote that Guy told her they had “‘to let the Congolese and all the other Africans know that we are with them.’” They convinced some members of CAWAH and the Harlem Writers Guild to join the demonstration. One of Guy’s relatives discouraged her from organizing the protest, declaring, “The United Nations is all the poor countries of this world have…Don’t do anything that might endanger its existence.”

Nevertheless, they persisted. At a bookstore and frequent gathering place in Harlem, Angelou, Guy, and Lincoln informed those in attendance of Lumumba’s execution and the audience responded with disbelief and wailing. Lincoln implicated the Belgians and the Americans. She shared news about their planned demonstration, which included women clipping black mourning veils to their hair, and men wearing black armbands. Lincoln declared, “‘We’re going to stand up and remain standing until they put us out.’” Many in the crowd shouted agreement, “‘See you at the U.N.!’”

They scheduled the demonstration for Feb. 15, 1961. Members of several Black nationalist groups participated. However, Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam were not involved due to the Nation’s policy of non-engagement, which prevented members from participating in politics and protests. Malcolm X was increasingly frustrated with the Nation being seen as talking tough, but never doing anything.

Angelou writes of her disbelief at the large crowd in front of the Manhattan headquarters of the U.N., with placards proclaiming “‘Freedom Now.’” Many activists were unable to enter the U.N., but sympathetic States provided access to about 75 Black demonstrators.

Inside, the U.N. Security Council was meeting to discuss Lumumba’s murder, and Hammarskjöld was busy protecting his tenure from the Soviet Union’s calls for his resignation. In a searing 1,500-word statement, the Soviets labeled him an accomplice to murder and an imperialist. U.S. Ambassador Stevenson flew to Hammarskjöld’s defense, “Shall the United Nations survive? Shall the attempt to bring about peace by the concerted power of international understanding be discarded?”

During Stevenson’s speech, Angelou writes, a piercing “scream shattered his words.” Other voices joined the bloody shriek:

“Murderers.”

“Lumumba. Lumumba.”

“Killers.”

Angelou did not anticipate a riot at the U.N. She expected “to stand, veiled and mournful.” Yet, she heard her own voice joining the chorus shouting, “Assassins.”

Suddenly, the U.N. was in chaos. Angelou recounts diplomats vanishing as guards quickly escorted activists outside. Demonstrators outside were energized. Angelou recalls someone exclaiming, “‘This ain’t no United Nations. This is just united white folks. Let’s go back in.’” With police preventing re-entry, protestors headed for the Belgian Consulate instead, singing, “‘And before I’ll be a slave, I’ll be buried in my grave.’”

In the aftermath, since Guy and Angelou were originally stirred to action by Malcolm X’s oration, they sought out his belated guidance about what they should do. As one of the most radical leaders in the country, they figured he had to support their action. Instead, Malcolm X told them they were wrong, that “‘going to the United Nations’” would “‘not win freedom for anyone.’” He subsequently issued a statement asserting his and the Nation of Islam’s non-involvement, but pointedly observed that the demonstration at the U.N. was symbolic of Black rage in the United States.

Other commentary quickly followed. The New York Times described the activists as “invading” the Security Council chamber and absurdly declared it “the most violent demonstration inside United Nations headquarters in the world organization’s history.” Ralph Bunche, who became the first Black Nobel Peace laureate in 1950, and was serving as undersecretary of the U.N. at the time of the protest, apologized before the General Assembly, telling delegates that the activists were “misled,” and unrepresentative of the “thinking and conduct” of Black Americans. Some in the Black elite were aligned with Bunche’s distancing remarks. Others, like James Hicks, editor of the New York Amsterdam News, challenged Bunche’s apology for Black grief. This sentiment was echoed in several letters to the editor from Black Americans. Hicks described Lumumba’s assassination as the “international lynching of a black man on the altar of white supremacy” that “was staged before the world under the auspices of the United Nations.”

Conclusion

Notably, the country inspiring the 1960s riot never recovered from the complicity of international actors. Mobutu brutally ruled Congo for 32 years. He enriched himself, acquiring sums estimated at $4 to $5 billion, while the 100 million inhabitants of Congo lived in extreme poverty. Protracted extractivist warfare followed Mobutu’s demise, resulting in the deadliest conflict in the 21st century. Since the 1990s, more than six million people have died, seven million people are internally displaced, while 25 million face starvation in Congo. Hundreds of thousands of women and girls have also been subject to rampant sexual violence. Warring parties as well as U.N. peacekeeping forces are implicated in these wanton abuses. In 2022, more than 60 years after Belgium brutally murdered Lumumba, it finally returned for burial a gold tooth that one of his assailants took as a macabre souvenir.

In Sept. 2025, U.N. General Assembly President Annalena Baerbock, a former German foreign minister, mused, “Our world is in pain…But imagine how much more pain there would be without the United Nations.” The story of the Congo is the story of the U.N. The Congo could not possibly experience more pain than it has amid a constant U.N. presence for the past 65 years, including three different peacekeeping missions, with the last being the most expensive in history. In 2022, profound frustration with the U.N.’s failure to protect civilians led some Congolese to protest calling for the organization’s departure. Perceptions persist that the U.N. does not defend the Congolese and is aligned with foreign actors, reminiscent of earlier concerns expressed in the aftermath of Congo’s independence. If the U.N. is the “life insurance for every country,” as Baerbock asserted, then it’s past time for a radical change in policy.

The historian Brenda Gayle Plummer described the 1960s U.N. protest as a “massive …international outcry against imperialism,” the likes of which had not occurred in the United States since protests against the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in the 1930s. Although relegated to the annals of history, the 1960s demonstration at the U.N. is a powerful reminder of the importance of connecting international freedom struggles with those at home in the United States. Following Malcolm X’s break from the Nation of Islam in 1964, he revised his position on political activism. In a speech in New York on Feb. 16, 1965, he observed that “‘human rights’ is part of the charter of the United Nations.” For Malcolm X, framing issues as human rights violations meant, “you can take your troubles to the World Court. You can take them before the world. And anybody anywhere on this earth can become your ally.” Internationalization could “make the world see that our problem was no longer a Negro problem or an American problem but a human problem. A problem for humanity. And a problem which should be attacked by all elements of humanity.”

We saw echoes of the legacy of the 1960s demonstration last month, as thousands protested outside U.N. headquarters in opposition to Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the General Assembly inside, hundreds of diplomats in the chamber walked out before his speech.

Mr. Trump has sent federal agents and troops to other cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles, Memphis, Portland, Ore., and Washington, D.C., saying the deployments will curb crime and illegal immigration.","Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on Thursday threatened to prosecute California officials who support arresting federal immigration agents, sharpening the standoff between the Trump administration and local leaders.

Mr. Blanche conveyed the warning in a letter a day after several officials in San Francisco, including Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker, and Brooke Jenkins, the city’s district attorney, said that they might seek to arrest federal agents who break California law during immigration raids.

The suggestion, Ms. Jenkins said, came from seeing agents confronting people in Los Angeles and Chicago. While she did not envision police officers handcuffing federal agents on city streets, she said she would use video footage to identify agents using excessive force and ask a judge for arrest warrants.

Their idea would be to prosecute immigration agents who overstep their authority, for example by using excessive force, state officials said. But the ability of states to arrest federal officers is without much legal precedent.

He also said that the Constitution’s supremacy clause prevents federal officers from being held on a state criminal charge if the alleged crime occurred while the officer was performing federal duties.

“The Department of Justice will investigate and prosecute any state or local official who violates these federal statutes,” he wrote, “or directs or conspires with others to violate them.”

He concluded that “federal agents and officers will continue to enforce federal law and will not be deterred by the threat of arrest by California authorities.”

The Trump administration had said on Wednesday that it was sending U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents to Alameda, Calif., to prepare for an operation in the San Francisco Bay Area. President Trump on Thursday called off the crackdown in the city, though it was unclear what that meant for the rest of the Bay Area.

Mr. Trump has sent federal agents and troops to other cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles, Memphis, Portland, Ore., and Washington, D.C., saying the deployments will curb crime and illegal immigration. Critics have said that he is using them to punish Democratic-led cities and spread fear in immigrant communities.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/24/multimedia/24xp-feds-mhgb/24xp-feds-mhgb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 11:59:11.508725

Recipients must not “leak or otherwise publicize the existence of” any federal immigration enforcement operations.
By September, US District Court Judge William Smith ruled that the conditions FEMA imposed on funding were “arbitrary and capricious.” He further stated that DHS failed to provide genuine, fact-based justifications for implementing broad immigration conditions across all grants.
The Trump administration’s persistent effort to add immigration strings to FEMA funding feels like a “poison pill” move, especially since Trump has openly discussed shifting responsibility for disaster aid to the states.
One simple step would be to streamline the Stafford Act to remove vagueness that allows presidents to decline disaster aid on a whim.","The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) continues to attach conditions to federal disaster assistance grants that require recipients to comply with federal immigration law, hampering the ability of states and localities to prepare for disasters.

In January, Trump issued Executive Order 14159 calling for DHS to “undertake any lawful actions to ensure that so-called ‘sanctuary’ jurisdictions, which seek to interfere with the lawful exercise of Federal law enforcement operations, do not receive access to Federal funds.” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem issued a memorandum in February, directing sub-agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to scrutinize all federal financial assistance awards. The purpose was to identify funds allocated to sanctuary jurisdictions and to report on compliance within 30 days. By March, FEMA had added language to its grants requiring state and local recipients to confirm they’d help enforce federal immigration law or risk losing all federal funds administered by DHS.

The language contains six specific criteria.

1. Grant recipients must share information with DHS on the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of individuals.

2. Recipients cannot encourage or induce noncitizens to enter the country illegally.

3. Recipients must “honor requests for cooperation, such as participation in joint operations, sharing of information, or requests for short-term detention” of immigrants.

4. Recipients must provide federal immigration agents “access to detainees” in correctional facilities.

5. Recipients must not “leak or otherwise publicize the existence of” any federal immigration enforcement operations.

6. Both grant recipients and subgrant recipients, including aid organizations, are required to follow the criteria.

Finally, recipients are required to certify that none of the programs operated using federal funding can benefit illegal immigrants.

In May, 20 states and the District of Columbia, which have collectively received more than $23 billion in disaster aid since 2017, filed a lawsuit alleging DHS had no authority to withhold congressionally appropriated funds. The plaintiffs also claimed the action violated the Administrative Procedure Act, which dictates federal agencies’ regulatory processes. By September, US District Court Judge William Smith ruled that the conditions FEMA imposed on funding were “arbitrary and capricious.” He further stated that DHS failed to provide genuine, fact-based justifications for implementing broad immigration conditions across all grants. Judge Smith also pointed out that DHS didn’t follow internal advice, overlooked how states would be affected, ignored public safety, and failed to consider alternative approaches, such as pausing targeted grants.

Despite Smith’s injunction, states are arguing that the language has not been removed from the grants. DHS is claiming that the language remains as a trigger clause in the event of the injunction being “stayed, vacated, or extinguished.” Meanwhile, the general hurdles the Trump administration has placed on aid are having real-life consequences for communities across the US facing disaster. These actions, which include the elimination of programs designed to fund mitigation projects, are leaving states and localities less prepared for when disaster inevitably strikes.

The Trump administration’s persistent effort to add immigration strings to FEMA funding feels like a “poison pill” move, especially since Trump has openly discussed shifting responsibility for disaster aid to the states. It’s as if they’re actively discouraging states from accepting the funds. The problem with this approach is that it disregards the separation of powers; funds allocated by democratically elected representatives should be distributed to their constituents without additional, arbitrary, and politically motivated conditions. DHS’s efforts undermine national disaster preparedness and response efforts, leaving vulnerable populations at greater risk. For now, only the judiciary branch is standing up for the American people. It’s about time Congress started doing that as well. One simple step would be to streamline the Stafford Act to remove vagueness that allows presidents to decline disaster aid on a whim. Congress also must assert its authority over government spending by censuring the president, challenging the executive branch’s overreach.",https://www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_7961-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-10-24 13:01:55.179738

Gauffeny said the authorities notified her that García-Hernández had been in an accident, but little information was given about the shooting.
She found out through media reports that García-Hernández was sitting in the van outside the facility when gunfire erupted.
“You know, I haven’t gotten any calls from the authorities besides the one I got the day of the shooting,” said Gauffeny.
“He was a father, a husband and a friend, and he was in the process of fixing his [immigration] status,” Gauffeny said.","The widow of one of the people killed when a gunman opened fire on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Texas last month has spoken out to question whether the political violence rising under the Trump administration played a role in her husband’s death.

Stephany Gauffeny lost her husband, Miguel García-Hernández, when he became the second of two men to die in the attack outside a detention center in Dallas, after succumbing to his gunshot wounds.

“There’s so much hate going on with immigrants and ICE now, so it has crossed my mind if this would have happened under a different administration. It has certainly played a part in his death,” said the 32-year-old mother in an interview with the Guardian, her first since her husband’s death.

She added: “Sometimes it feels better to be asleep than to be awake, because when I sleep I forget about everything and when I wake up this reality hits me.”

Three days after García-Hernández’s death, Gauffeny gave birth to their third child, a son, Miles Alexander, the name chosen by the father he will never meet. A week after the birth the family buried García-Hernández, 31, in Arlington, where they had recently bought a house, on the outskirts of Dallas.

The authorities described the shooting as a lone, “targeted attack” on ICE and said the gunman, Joshua Jahn – who shot himself dead after spraying the exterior of the facility with bullets – wrote “ANTI-ICE” on one bullet casing.

But in the violent chaos, no law enforcement officers were injured and instead a government van was hit that was holding shackled immigrants on their way to detention. Three detainees from Latin America were shot, including García-Hernández.

The other two victims were 37-year-old Norlan Guzman-Fuentes of El Salvador, who died on the day of the shooting, and 33-year-old José Andres Bordones-Molina of Venezuela, who was later released from the hospital.

Gauffeny said the authorities notified her that García-Hernández had been in an accident, but little information was given about the shooting. García-Hernández, who was undocumented, had been hospitalized in critical condition.

She found out through media reports that García-Hernández was sitting in the van outside the facility when gunfire erupted.

“You know, I haven’t gotten any calls from the authorities besides the one I got the day of the shooting,” said Gauffeny. As she sat for the interview at her lawyer’s office in Dallas last week, she watched over her newborn sleeping in his stroller by her side.

“How many people were in the van? How many times did he actually get shot? Was he conscious at all? They never gave me any details,” she said.

García-Hernández was born in San Luis Potosí, a state in central Mexico. He came to the United States as an undocumented 14-year-old in 2008, and built a life in Texas. But on 8 August this year, García-Hernández had been arrested for driving under the influence and taken to the Tarrant county corrections center in Fort Worth. On that same date, ICE placed a detainer against his release, which allowed immigration officials to pick him up once he served a short time in jail.

“He was a father, a husband and a friend, and he was in the process of fixing his [immigration] status,” Gauffeny said. She is currently weighing filing a lawsuit against the authorities.

Because García-Hernández was married to a US citizen and he was the primary source of income for his household, he was able to apply for a waiver that, if granted, would have effectively erased the transgression of his illegal entry into the US and allowed him to get a green card.

“He wanted to have his own painting company; he made business cards and said he was going to buy the equipment. He was so excited and had a lot going for him,” Gauffeny said.

On the day of the shooting, Donald Trump, in the context of the anti-ICE message on one bullet casing, posted on Truth Social: “This is despicable! The Brave Men and Women of ICE are just trying to do their jobs, and remove the ‘WORST of the WORST’ Criminals out of our Country, but they are facing an unprecedented increase in threats, violence, and attacks by Deranged Radical Leftists.”

ICE issued a statement six days after the shooting about García-Hernández’s death, saying: “Our thoughts are with his family and this tragedy underscores the terrible cost of dangerous rhetoric and violence against the men and women of ICE who are simply carrying out their sworn law enforcement mission.”

Gauffeny said that while the family experienced an outpouring of support from many, including via a fundraiser, she has also been targeted with hate messages from strangers.

“I received comments on social media from people saying that they are not sorry,” she said, adding: “Does the fact that he entered illegally mean that he deserves to be killed the way he was killed?”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0989fe25ceaeb0cd09a7bb868d47cfbe4b4d1f11/8_0_2501_2000/master/2501.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bf4c26c8ab8ea597c575edfe6ab2e3f2",N,,2025-10-24 09:02:34.716725

An outright win is next to impossible. The Netherlands has always had a coalition government formed by a minimum of two parties due to its proportional representation electoral system, under which seats in parliament are awarded to parties in proportion to the number of votes they win.

The PVV, headed by Geert Wilders, also won the most votes in the last election in November 2023. It then partnered with three other far-right parties – the Farmer-Citizen Movement (BBB), New Social Contract (NSC), and the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) – to form a coalition government.

But in June, PVV made a dramatic exit from the coalition government over a disagreement on immigration policy. PVV had wanted to introduce a stricter asylum policy that included closing borders to new asylum seekers and deporting dual nationals convicted of crimes, but the other parties demanded further discussions.

In a dramatic move, Wilders took to X to announce that the failure by other parties to agree to PVV’s plans meant it would leave the coalition.

Coalition partners slammed this decision and accused Wilders of being driven by self-interest. VVD leader Dilan Yesilgoz said at the time that Wilders “chooses his own ego and his own interests. I am astonished. He throws away the chance for a right-wing policy”.

Following the pull-out, Prime Minister Dick Schoof – an independent – announced that he would resign and a snap election would be held this month.

Then, in August, the NSC’s Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp also resigned after he failed to secure support for new sanctions against Israel over its war in Gaza and the humanitarian situation in Gaza City. In solidarity with Veldkamp, other NSC party members left the coalition, leaving only two parties remaining.

Now, with an election imminent, opinion polls suggest the PVV will secure the most seats in the 150-seat parliament. While a winner needs 76 seats to form a government, no single party ever makes it to that figure, which has led to a history of coalitions.

According to a poll by the Dutch news outlet, EenVandaag, on October 14, the PVV is projected to secure 31 seats. The centre-left Green-Labour alliance (GroenLinks-PvdA) is polling at 25 seats, and the centre-right Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) is polling at 23.

PVV’s former coalition partner, the centre-right VVD, could take 14 seats and the BBB, four. So far, the NSC is not projected to secure any seats at all.

Immigration fears

At the end of September, EenVandaag polled 27,191 people and found that the main sticking point between voters – and, hence, between the leaders, PVV and GroenLinks-PvdA – is immigration. Half of all voters said it was the key issue on which they would be voting this year. Housing was the second-most important issue at 46 percent, and “Dutch identity” came third at 37 percent.

While the PVV is firmly anti-immigration and wants to impose a much stricter border policy and asylum laws, GroenLinks-PvdA would prefer to allow a net migration figure of 40,000 and 60,000 migrants per year.

Tempers are running high over this issue. Last month at The Hague, a right-wing activist known as “Els Rechts” organised an anti-migration protest that attracted 1,500 attendees. According to reports, protesters threw stones and bottles at the police, set a police car alight and smashed windows of the left-wing Democrats 66 (D66) party offices.

While left-wingers argue that the immigration issue has been wildly hyped up by the far right, they are losing control of the narrative.

Esme Smithson Swain, a member of MiGreat, a Dutch non-governmental campaign group that calls for freedom of movement and equal treatment for migrants in the Netherlands, told Al Jazeera that the far right in the Netherlands and in the United Kingdom, more widely, had “constructed a narrative that there is a migration crisis”.

“They’ve managed to construct this idea of a crisis, and that distracts our attention away from populism, away from arms trades, away from social services and the welfare state being sold off.”

Whatever its merits, the right-wing message that immigration is at the root of many social ills seems to be taking hold. The far-left, pro-immigration BIJ1 party, which rejects this message, is not projected to win any seats at all in this election.

Immigration “is a key term especially for right-wing political parties to win the election”, Noura Oul Fakir, a candidate for the BIJ1 party, told Al Jazeera. “We don’t focus on it because we look at everything that’s been going on from a systemic point of view, that every form of oppression is interlinked … This fight for equality and justice, it’s about more than just immigration, but it’s also interlinked with other issues that we see nowadays.”

People ‘more emboldened to express racist views’

By January 1, 2024, the Netherlands was hosting 2.9 million migrants (16.2 percent of the population), compared to the average across European Union member states of 9.9 percent (44.7 million people in total).

Similarly, Germany hosts 16.9 million migrants (20.2 percent of the population); France, 9.3 million (13.6 percent of the population); Spain, 8.8 million (18.2 percent of the population); and Italy, 6.7 million (11.3 percent of the population), according to figures from the EU.

Mark van Ostaijen, an associate professor in public administration and sociology at Erasmus University Rotterdam, explained that immigration has become a mainstream talking point in “housing, care, educational and cultural policy domains”.

For instance, the Netherlands is currently short of 434,000 homes, including for 353,000 asylum seekers and 81,000 Dutch first-time buyers, according to figures commissioned by the Ministry of Housing and Spatial Planning (VRO).

Immigration has, therefore, been blamed for what is seen as a housing crisis.

According to Statistics Netherlands (CBS), 316,000 migrants arrived in the country in 2024, 19,000 fewer than in 2023. But CBS also found that population growth is still mainly down to net migration, with the largest number of migrants coming from Ukraine and Syria.

“I think this is indeed something that will continue the electoral legitimacy of far-right parties, or right-wing parties, even more, given the fact that the Netherlands was already quite leaning towards the conservative angle,” van Ostaijen told Al Jazeera.

“This will be a topic that will haunt our politics and our democratic decision-making and discourse for quite a while,” he said.

Anecdotal evidence bears this out. Fakir has noticed a change in the experiences of immigrant residents she and her colleagues have spoken to in the country following the growth of the PVV.

“In their personal life [they have seen] a noticeable shift where people feel more free or emboldened to express racist views, both online and in real life. Others are telling them those classic things of ‘go back to your own country, or you’re not Dutch’,” she said.

For Nassreddin Taibi, a recent graduate who works as a political analyst and plans to vote for GroenLinks-PvdA, the anti-immigration protests at the Hague “further cemented polarisation among Dutch voters” and have caused centrist parties to fall into line with the right-wing narrative.

“These protests have influenced the discourse in the sense that centrist parties now say that cutting immigration is necessary to win back trust of voters in politics,” he said.

Nearly half of voters still undecided

While the far-right PVV is projected to win the most seats in this election, it will still face an uphill journey to form a government, as other parties such as the centre-right People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) have ruled out joining a coalition government.

Furthermore, the PVV’s leader, Wilders, has not escaped controversy with his Islamophobic comments and anti-migration stance despite the rise in anti-immigration sentiment across the country as a whole.

Notable incidents over the years include Wilders’ likening of Islam to Nazism in 2007 and his reference to the Muslim holy book, the Quran, as “fascist” in a letter to a Dutch news outlet. His letter and comments led to Wilders being prosecuted for inciting hatred and discrimination, which he denied. In 2011, he was acquitted by a judge who ruled that his comments had fallen within the scope of free speech.

More recently, in August this year, Wilders posted an image on X that depicted a smiling, blonde and blue-eyed woman, representing the PVV; and a wrinkled, angry-looking elderly woman wearing a headscarf, representing the PvdA. It was accompanied by the words: “The choice is yours on 29/10.”

Fake news and misinformation have also driven the rise in far-right narratives, analysts say.

The Facebook page ‘Wij doen GEEN aangifte tegen Geert Wilders’ (We are NOT filing charges against Geert Wilders), which claims to be a PVV supporters’ page boasting 129,000 followers, said it does not intend to be “discriminatory, hateful, or incite violence”, but has nevertheless posted AI-generated images of this nature.

In one such image, which received 1,700 likes, a white family is seemingly being harassed by men of colour.

In another, a white woman is seen in a supermarket paying for groceries while surrounded by Muslim women wearing hijabs and niqabs, with the caption: “No mass immigration, no Islamisation, no backwardness of the Dutch.” The post received 885 likes.

While the outgoing home affairs minister, Judith Uitermark, has said the government is examining new ways to combat fake news, she added that the Netherlands is somewhat protected from the rise of extremism by its proportional representation system, under which no one party ever wins a majority.

Still, the Dutch Data Protection Authority has warned voters not to use AI chatbots to help them decide who to vote for.

And a large number are still deciding. EenVandaag found that some 48 percent of voters are still undecided about which candidate they will choose. If the GroenLinks-PvdA can disengage from right-wing talking points and, instead, focus on its own policies more, it may perform better than expected, analysts say.

This will be no easy task, however.

“We find ourselves doing this also as a civil society organisation, as campaigners, trying to fight off the narrative and fight off the kind of populist ideals of the far right faster than we can push for our own agenda as well. And I think a lot of the time that leaves left-wing parties in the Netherlands seeming a bit hollow,” Swain said.

Still, she says that she is holding out hope for this election, despite what feels like a “vast and growing far-right bulk of the population”.

Leaders say it's not about interfering but rather about alerting and informing the community.

Flyers will be passed around to businesses around the state, community leaders saying Thursday the hotline is not just a number, it’s a lifeline to protecting immigrant families.

Passionate statements from local leaders on Thursday in Portland as they announced the launch of a hotline meant to protect immigrants and their families who may be fearful of seeing ICE on Maine streets.

""Our families, our friends, our neighbors are afraid to go to school, to work, to worship, to the hospital, to the store,"" Rev. Dr. Jodi Cohen Hayashida, a minister in Auburn, said.

Members of the Maine Immigrants’ Rights Coalition and People’s Coalition for Safety and Justice say the ICE Watch Hotline will help people from having to rely on internet posts or word of mouth.

""So we know that this tactic is effective in deterring law enforcement activity,"" Presente! Maine Executive Director Crystal Cron said.

Cron is one of the hotline organizers. She says once the number is called, you will be connected to a volunteer operator, where you can either get supportive advice or report that agents are in your area.

They'll also take a step further: sending people to the location to interact with the agents and answer questions from anyone involved.

Betsy Smith is a spokesperson for the National Police Association, which supports American law enforcement. She believes this hotline only hurts the community.

""A hotline to protect criminals is absolutely obscene,"" Smith said. ""It prevents law enforcement from arresting criminal illegal aliens... It's dangerous, it's unconstitutional, and it's un-American.""

That hotline went live Thursday.

The number is 207-544-9989.

Volunteers will be there to take calls in the morning and evening.

Leaders say they're still building out a list of operators.

“The Maine ICE Watch Hotline is a lifeline for families, a bridge for neighbors and a promise that no one in our community will face fear alone,” said Portland At-Large City Councilor Pious Ali, speaking at a press event at City Hall Thursday.

The goal of the project, which is organized by the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition and People’s Coalition for Safety and Justice, is to provide accurate, real-time information about U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Patrol activity and connect Maine families to resources and support services.

“This isn’t about panic — it’s about protection,” Crystal Cron, executive director of Presente! Maine said. “It’s about staying informed, connected and ready to act together. When ICE shows up, we show up too — not with fear but with solidarity. This hotline is a step towards the community we all deserve, one rooted in trust, care and collective defense.”

The hotline has already trained over 150 volunteers, both as operators to receive calls as well as verifiers to confirm or refute reported sightings of immigrant enforcement activity, Cron said. While there are already volunteers across the state, Cron said they are seeking more in rural areas.

Federal actions targeting Democratic-led cities and states have been on the rise. The press conference was held two days after 50 federal agents descended on New York City’s Canal Street, reportedly arresting nine men.

Last month, a Portland resident was detained by ICE agents after dropping off their child at the Gerald E. Talbot Community School. Nationally, schools, like workplaces, have become frequent targets and there is research tying the raids to increased student absences.

Wes Pelletier said at the press event that, as councilor for Portland District 2, he represents some of the city’s more diverse neighborhoods and has “seen firsthand how fear has taken hold of our communities. Truancy is on the rise… our parks and playgrounds and our streets are more quiet.”

Pelletier, who is among the volunteers that have taken the verifier training, said over the past few months there’s been quiet organizing but there’s been a growing need for a “unified network to share information that doesn’t cause undo panic, is integrated in the communities it serves, and that balances safety with accessibility.”

After the hotline receives a call of a potential sighting, the report is passed to a regional verifier response group. If they confirm that immigration agents are present, an alert will go out through texts and social media. Verifiers are also trained to observe enforcement actions and gather more information. Afterwards, the hotline will help track the detainee through the immigration system while connecting impacted people with legal representation, financial and other support.

Similar grassroots efforts have been launched elsewhere to protect immigrant communities and push back against federal enforcement actions.

Ahead of the Trump administration’s deployment of immigration authorities last month to Chicago, community groups similarly launched a hotline to help keep tabs on agent activity. Since then, volunteers have organized a vast rapid response network that includes blowing whistles to alert neighbors if ICE or Border Patrol agents are spotted nearby and documenting encounters with federal agents on their phones.

Cron said they’ve connected with and learned from groups in other states, including Siembra NC, in North Carolina, and LUCE Immigrant Justice Network in Massachusetts.

The role of local law enforcement

While the speakers focused on federal immigration activity, enforcement in Maine has routinely been initiated by local law enforcement.

Since March, the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, Maine’s only statewide immigration legal services organization, has tracked 22 minor traffic stops and similar incidents where more than 50 Maine residents and workers were handed over to immigration officials by state and local law enforcement based on suspected immigration status alone. This is not a complete picture of such incidents, but rather the organization’s best estimate based on verifiable reports.

“What is known shows a concerning and broad pattern of Maine law enforcement agencies across the state stepping outside of their roles and voluntarily diverting Maine’s resources to assist the federal administration with indiscriminate immigration enforcement, threatening the rights and safety of some of Maine’s most vulnerable residents,” ILAP shared in a statement.

While ICE arrests in Maine double, governor delays deciding on limits for local police cooperation

The state Legislature has considered prohibiting or restricting state and local law enforcement agencies from carrying out the work of federal immigration authorities, though both remain in limbo heading into the next session in January. One of those bills passed the Legislature and rests with Gov. Janet Mills.

“When our governor refuses to sign a bill that will prevent local and state law enforcement from being used to enforce harsh federal immigration laws, it sends the wrong message,” said Ali. “It tells the federal agencies that they can come into our neighborhoods and act without restraint.”

Cron said the hotline guidance is the same regardless of whether it is a federal or local officer and people should call in if they see any suspicious law enforcement activity.

An estimated 70% of ICE arrests nationwide over the past decade have been handoffs from state or local authorities.

As of Tuesday night, no police departments in Maine have formal agreements with federal immigration authorities, after Wells Police Department terminated its agreement under the 287(g) program.

This means departments in Maine have local discretion regarding when to involve federal officials.

Another layer is where immigration detainees are housed. The public has for months been calling for the board to end Cumberland County Jail’s contract with the U.S. Marshal Service to house federal detainees, which includes immigration detainees, arguing that cooperation with federal immigration authorities makes the county complicit with their increasingly aggressive tactics.

Earlier this week, the board postponed its decision, with some members raising concern that ending the contract would only take people farther away from their families and legal counsel.

Legal experts say that already occurs, as it’s common practice for federal authorities to transfer immigration detainees from facility to facility.

As Maine Morning Star reported in April, the majority of immigration detainees in Cumberland County Jail are not residents of nor were they arrested in Maine. Most were transferred to the facility from out of state, and they are often quickly transferred out, too.

The hotline is currently available from 6-9 a.m. and 5-9 p.m. Monday through Friday. The coalition is encouraging interested parties to volunteer or share information about the hotline on social media or by displaying one of their posters.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4699-scaled-e1761245956885-2048x1327.jpeg,N,,2025-10-24 10:00:46.735526

How Colorado leaders are responding to federal actions Some Coloradans praised the work of elected officials to stand in the way of federal immigration enforcement.","Over the last several months, Nicholas Pierce’s work as an asylum, refugee and deportation defense lawyer on the Front Range has meant playing catch-up. The immigration policies and orders that seem to come on a near-daily basis from the federal government have been hard to keep up with.

In a recent interview, Pierce tried to make sense of the latest effort by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which activists said was called ""Freaky Friday,"" offering unaccompanied immigrant children cash to self deport, and potentially depriving them of the right to hearings. A local human services agency had reached out to him earlier in the day asking how it would impact the young immigrants in their care.

He couldn’t answer. Instead he had to turn to others, including a contact at ICE, to figure it out.

“It is, in a lot of ways, much worse than what I had anticipated, much faster than I had anticipated,” Pierce said about the impact the president’s immigration crackdown has had on Colorado. “I was an immigration lawyer during the first Trump administration, and there was just a lot more checks and balances in the system.”

With about 400 cases on his plate through his Denver-based firm Amistad Law, Pierce said he’s seen firsthand how families and communities are being torn apart. He said many have had their legal statuses stripped away, through things like ending Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans – many of whom sought refuge in Colorado. Others, he said, have chosen to go into hiding for fear of being detained when appearing for their asylum interviews.

Pierce, who is a former U.S. Army Reserve service member and whose work receives state funding through the Colorado Refugee Support Program, is one of hundreds of Coloradans polled by CPR News and other outlets in the Colorado News Collaborative who have expressed either complete opposition to or frustration with some of the ways Trump has carried out his campaign promise to close the southern border and reduce the number of undocumented immigrants living in the country.

A small number we heard from say they support the president’s actions, calling them necessary to free up government resources for things like housing and Medicaid for citizens or protect the country from socialism.

Since the beginning of the year, the Trump administration has increased immigration raids across U.S. cities, including in Colorado, escalated tactics like sending the National Guard to back up ICE in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., and reversed Biden-era policies, including allowing arrests at schools and churches.

What Coloradans are saying about immigration

In the survey circulated by Colorado newsrooms, including CPR News, a majority of the nearly 400 respondents said that, even if they supported some of the president’s stated goals, they opposed some of the immigration enforcement tactics currently being used by federal agents.

Specifically, Coloradans take issue with federal agents violating due process and not focusing on deporting the “worst of the worst” criminals.

“I have no problem with deporting those convicted of felonies, but ambushing families is despicable,” said a woman in Grand Junction.

“I am in favor of the overall goal, but I do take issue with some of the practices,” said a man from Broomfield. “Treat people as human beings, even if they are criminals.”

A man in Durango summarized it like a report card. He gave efforts to close the border an A+, deporting criminals a C-, visa restrictions a D-, the use of Immigration and Customs Enforcement an F and described the use of the National guard as illegal. He said Trump also failed in the area of “Politicalization.”

“Deport criminals not workers,” said a woman in Durango. ICE tactics like “unmarked cars, civilian clothes, refusal to identify themselves should be eliminated.”

“It's a waste of time to deport people contributing to the economy,” said a man in Colorado Springs. “I'm more concerned with the affordability of housing and health care.”

“The response has been too extreme and brutal,” said a woman in Colorado Springs. “It targets too many law-abiding, legal, U.S. residents,: denying due process to detainees.”

Evergreen resident Norman Sherbert said he believed the president was carrying out what he promised to do when elected and correct the previous administration’s actions.

“I’m not here to tell the government how to do their job,” Sherbert elaborated via email. “All I know is that 11 or 12 million illegal immigrants coming into our country, seeing pictures of the masses of people standing at our borders, and hearing of children without guardianship being used to gain entrance into the U.S. is not good policy. And, in the long run over the next generations, will have a deteriorating effect on our society and way of life.”

Sherbert sees the administration’s extreme measures as a necessary way to right the situation with the limited time and resources it has.

At a flea market in Colorado Springs on a recent weekend, JoAnn Antaya said she believed Trump wanted to help people during his first administration but doesn’t agree with the tactics being used today.

A German-born American who remembered how difficult it was to adjust to a new culture as a child, Antaya believes society has lost its compassion.

“We do not care about our fellow man,” Antaya, 63, said. “So it's easy to put a wall between here and Mexico because you know what? They have nothing to do with you. Heaven forbid if you should hand them a crust of bread. No, I'm not happy with my country.

“It's like they're not compromising. They're not coming to a happy medium. They're just combative. And that's all it is: Argument, argument, argument.”

What the polls say about immigration concerns

Opinion polling suggests how Coloradans feel about immigration has a lot to do with where they live.

A poll from the Colorado Health Foundation released earlier this year looked at top issues facing Coloradans. It surveyed over 2,300 people across the state.

It found that “illegal immigration” was a major concern for about half of the residents surveyed, though the extent of the concern depended on where respondents lived, lower in urban areas (39 percent), versus suburban (58 percent) and rural (65 percent).

Ninety percent of respondents on the Eastern Plains believe illegal immigration is a problem in Colorado compared to 46 percent in Denver metro.

On the flip side, 20 percent of all respondents said the mistreatment of immigrants was an ""extremely serious” concern compared to 42 percent of respondents saying it was “not too serious.”

Broken down by region, that concern fluctuated, with 44 percent of urban respondents saying mistreatment is extremely or very serious compared to 30 percent of suburban respondents and 23 percent of rural respondents.

“The regional, the urbanity and the partisanship seemed to really be driving how folks react to those problems and react differently to the two different framings that we tested,” said Lucia Del Puppo, senior vice president with the research firm that conducted the Pulse Poll.

CHF spokesperson Katie Peshek says Pulse Poll findings are shared with policymakers to help them understand the real issues residents are facing and prioritize those concerns.

“With a third of poll respondents pointing to government and politics as the state’s leading challenge, it’s clear that on issues like immigration, the cost of living and housing, Coloradans are ready for real action and solutions,” Peshek said.

Meanwhile, a national Gallup poll released this summer found that only 30 percent of Americans say immigration should be reduced, a position that has shrunk by fifteen points since last year.

But the support for staunching immigration largely falls along party lines, with the poll finding “Republicans are the only group still showing at least plurality support for reducing immigration.”

In a recent national poll of registered voters by the New York Times/Sienna, “51 percent said they thought the government was deporting mostly people who ‘should be deported,’ while 42 percent said the government was deporting the wrong people.”

That poll, too, found respondents wrestling with the administration’s aggressive tactics.

“More than half of voters, 53 percent, think the process of deporting people has not been fair; 44 percent said it was mostly fair,” according to The New York Times.

How Colorado leaders are responding to federal actions

Some Coloradans praised the work of elected officials to stand in the way of federal immigration enforcement.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser has used his office’s powers to fight against federal immigration actions, from defending in-state tuition for noncitizen students to suing a sheriff’s deputy for involving ICE in a traffic stop that resulted in the detainment of a college student.

In the spring, state lawmakers passed a bill designed to protect undocumented immigrants from coming to the attention of federal authorities. And over the summer, Colorado’s Democratic members of Congress toured the state’s only immigration facility in Aurora, only to leave with more questions than answers.

Colorado governments are in danger of losing federal funds and the state is being sued by the federal government for so-called sanctuary policies, but Democratic leaders have so far resisted the administration’s pressure campaign, arguing immigration enforcement is not the state’s problem.

That doesn’t mean inter-agency coordination isn’t happening. Despite state laws strictly limiting when officials can cooperate with ICE requests, state agencies were found to have provided federal immigration officials with Coloradans’ personal information in response to subpoenas several times this year. Those actions by the Polis administration have riled fellow Democrats and immigration advocates.

Looking ahead

Even though state laws prohibit local law enforcement from helping federal agents, targeted immigration raids continue to take place across the state, including outside of metro regions. In the last couple of weeks, local news outlets have reported on an incident in Alamosa where ICE detained a family with a baby inside a vehicle at gunpoint, smashing a car window, and a situation in Routt County where a county commissioner was blocked by ICE vehicles.

For Pierce, it’s not just new policies that have made it difficult for him – or other lawyers – to do this job. He’s seen announcements of immigration court judges resigning or being fired, resulting in longer processing times for cases. Clients are also being transferred to detention facilities out of state, making it hard to connect with their legal counsel and putting them at risk of being deported within days.

“So when it comes to hurting people, the system's gotten a lot faster. When it's come to helping people, the system's gotten a lot slower,” he said.

The majority of Pierce’s cases involve Afghan men who fought alongside the U.S. military during the Iraq War and are now waiting to get legal residency. Most of them filed petitions in 2022 or 2023 but still don’t have a court date set. With the reimposition of the so-called Muslim ban by the Trump administration this summer, it has been difficult for them to be reunited with their families. Pierce says these policies betray a promise made by the U.S. government for fighting alongside its troops.

The situation is leaving the men with two options: risk likely death to join their families back home or wait in the U.S, in the hope that their families will eventually be allowed to join them.

It’s gotten so bad that Pierce has found himself for the first time ever advising people to seek asylum in Argentina or Chile. He’s even started to offer powers-of-attorney services so that family or friends with U.S. citizenship can take control of bank accounts and other assets if their loved ones are rapidly deported.

Only U.S. citizens, green card holders who have gone through a five-year waiting period, and some Haitian and Cuban nationals with special status will be eligible for SNAP. This means refugees, people who have been granted asylum and human trafficking survivors will all lose their benefits, according to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services.

The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service gave states 120 days to implement these changes, meaning Nov. 1 is the deadline.

More than 183,000 Franklin County residents receive SNAP benefits and most of them are children and seniors, said Joy Bivens, deputy Franklin County administrator of health and human services.

Immigrants and refugees made up about 56% of Franklin County’s population growth between 2020 and 2023, said Franklin County Commissioner Erica Crawley.

“The proposed changes to SNAP benefits will put many of these families in jeopardy,” she said. “They are people who have endured trauma, made tremendous sacrifices and risked their lives to give their families security and freedom. These individuals often arrive with no local family connections and no established community. Without this support, they are often left to navigate life in an unfamiliar country with very limited resources, they face food insecurity, housing instability and limited access to health care.”

Approximately 1.39 million Ohioans receive an average of $190 of SNAP benefits each month, ODJFS Spokesperson Tom Betti said. Ohioans must have a net income at or below federal poverty guidelines — $32,150 a year for a family of four — to qualify for SNAP.

“When families can’t rely on SNAP, they are forced to spend their limited income on food, and often at the expense of medical care, rent or utilities, perpetuating a cycle of poverty,” said Franklin County Commissioner John O’Grady. “Losing SNAP benefits isn’t just about hunger, it’s about health, stability and opportunity. Children may face developmental display delays. Families may confront chronic health issues.”

SNAP helps stabilize families when they are new to the U.S., said Jewish Family Services CEO Karen Mozenter.

“They have done everything right, and they are eager to contribute as Americans,” she said. “Cutting off the support that helps them feed their families and care for them while they find their footing in a new country, that hurts them and that hurts all of us.”

The Mid-Ohio Food Collective is serving 58% more families now than at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, said President and CEO Matt Habash.

“Unfortunately, we don’t expect those numbers to go down,” he said. “The cost of housing, the cost of groceries, the cost of health care, and more are all putting pressure on household budgets, and now we’re dealing with cuts to SNAP — America’s first line of defense against hunger.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-94/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gettyimages-1287472642-2048x1365-1-1024x6831746533271-11761296680.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=CuVmDKNI,N,,2025-10-24 11:59:33.586106

Elsewhere around the country, it will be at least days before the Guard could be deployed in Portland, Oregon, and federal appeals judges are weighing whether hundreds of California National Guard members should remain under federal control.

President Donald Trump’s push to send the military into Democratic-run cities despite fierce resistance from mayors and governors has unleashed a whirlwind of lawsuits and overlapping court rulings.

Here’s what to know about legal efforts to block or deploy the National Guard in various cities:

Judge weighs Guard in Chicago while awaiting Supreme Court decision

U.S. District Judge April Perry on Wednesday blocked the deployment of Guard troops to the Chicago area until the case has been decided either in her court or the U.S. Supreme Court intervenes. Perry had already blocked the deployment for two weeks through a temporary restraining order, or TRO.

Attorneys representing the federal government said they would agree to extend the order but emphasized that they would continue pressing for an emergency order from the Supreme Court that would allow for the deployment.

“Every day this improper TRO remains in effect imposes grievous and irreparable harm on the Executive,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a Supreme Court filing Tuesday.

Lawyers representing Chicago and Illinois have asked the Supreme Court to continue to block the deployment, calling it a “dramatic step.”

Guard deployment in Portland also in limbo

An appeals court said Monday that Trump could take command of 200 Oregon National Guard troops, but a separate court order still blocks him from actually deploying them.

U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, issued two temporary restraining orders earlier this month. One prohibited Trump from calling up Oregon troops so he could send them to Portland. The other prohibited him from sending any Guard members to Oregon at all after he tried to evade the first order by deploying California troops instead.

The Justice Department appealed the first order and — in a 2-1 ruling Monday — a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel sided with the administration.

However, Immergut’s second order remains in effect, so no troops may immediately be deployed. She has scheduled a hearing for Friday on the administration’s request to dissolve that order. Meanwhile, the state is asking the 9th Circuit to reconsider Monday’s ruling.

California legal battle goes before appellate panel

A 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel in Pasadena heard arguments Wednesday related to Trump’s deployment of Guard troops to Los Angeles.

A district court found the administration violated federal law when it sent troops to Los Angeles in June after protests over Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Judge Charles Breyer handed California Gov. Gavin Newsom a victory on June 13 when he ordered control of California’s Guard members back to the state. But in an emergency ruling, an appeals court panel sided with the Trump administration, putting Breyer’s decision on hold and allowing the troops to remain in federal hands as the lawsuit unfolds.

The appeals court is now weighing whether to vacate Breyer’s June order.

The same three-judge panel is also handling the Trump administration’s appeal of Breyer’s Sept. 2 ruling, which found the president violated the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law prohibiting military enforcement of domestic laws.

Groups aim to stop Guard deployment in DC

In Charleston, West Virginia, a state court hearing is set for Friday in a lawsuit filed by two groups seeking to block deployment of the state National Guard to Washington, D.C. More than 300 Guard members have been in the nation’s capital supporting Trump’s initiative since late August.

A separate federal court hearing centers on a request by District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb for a temporary injunction to stop the deployments of more than 2,000 guardsmen.

Forty-five states have entered filings in that case, with 23 supporting the administration’s actions in D.C. and 22 supporting the attorney general’s lawsuit.

Republican governors from several states also sent units to D.C. Although the emergency period ended in September, more than 2,200 troops remain. Several states told The Associated Press they would bring their units home by Nov. 30, unless extended.

Democrats sue to stop Guard deployment in Memphis

In Tennessee, Democratic elected officials sued last Friday to stop the ongoing Guard deployment in Memphis. They said Republican Gov. Bill Lee, acting on a request from Trump, violated the state constitution, which says the Guard can be called up during “rebellion or invasion” — but only with state lawmakers’ blessing.

Since their arrival on Oct. 10, troops have been patrolling downtown Memphis, including near the iconic Pyramid, wearing camouflage uniforms and protective vests that say “military police,” with guns in holsters. Guard members have no arrest power, officials have said.

He followed agents’ vehicles and then honked to warn others when he was pulled over. Masked federal officers pointed a gun at him and a staffer, attempted to break his car window and took photos of their faces, before issuing a warning, he recounted.

“We were non-violent,” Huynh said of Tuesday’s incident, part of which was captured on video. “We identified ourselves as an elected official and my hands were visible.”

As the Trump administration intensifies an immigration crackdown across the nation’s third-largest city and its suburbs, elected officials in the Democratic stronghold have been increasingly caught in tense encounters with federal agents. Members of the Chicago City Council and their staff, state legislators and congressional candidates report being threatened, handcuffed and detained in recent days.

The tense political atmosphere comes as President Donald Trump has vowed to expand military deployments and jail Gov. JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson over immigration policies the Republican claims protect criminals. But Illinois Democrats deem the actions as scare tactics and a calculated acceleration. The clashes, amid constant arrests of immigrants and protesters, have emerged as a top campaign issue in Illinois’ March primary where an unusually high number of congressional seats are open.

“This is an escalation with the interests of creating fear and intimidation in my community and in all of Chicago,” said Alderman Mike Rodriguez, whose ward includes heavily immigrant and Latino neighborhoods.

During an enforcement operation Wednesday in the city’s Mexican enclave of Little Village and adjacent suburb of Cicero, at least eight people, including four U.S. citizens, were detained, he said.

Two of those citizens work in his office, including chief of staff Elianne Bahena, and were held for hours. Bahena also serves on an elected police accountability council. Rodriguez said they did nothing wrong but didn't offer exact details.

“Trump sent his goons to my neighborhood to intimidate and in the process of helping people out, my staff got detained,” he said Thursday amid continued federal presence in Little Village. Among other things, agents deployed chemical agents and detained a 16-year-old, activists and elected officials said.

While the operation’s focus has been concentrated in Latino neighborhoods and suburbs, federal agents have been spotted all over the city of 2.7 million and its many suburbs. Word of pedestrian and traffic stops outside schools, stores, courts and an O’Hare International Airport parking lot used by rideshare drivers have triggered waves of frustration amid the city’s active immigrant rights network and residents who follow vehicles, blow warning whistles and take videos.

The Department of Homeland Security has defended its operations, including the detention of U.S. citizens, saying they are temporarily held for safety. The agency, which didn't answer questions about Rodriguez’ staff, accused Huynh of “stalking” agents.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said agents had to assess if he was a threat.

“This behavior is unbecoming of a public servant and is just another example of sanctuary politicians putting our officers at risk,” she said in a statement.

Also this week, City Council member Jessie Fuentes filed a federal tort claim seeking $100,000 in damages after agents grabbed and handcuffed her earlier this month at a hospital. She said she was checking on a person who was injured while being pursued by immigration agents and asked for a signed judicial warrant on the person’s behalf. She was handcuffed and let go outside the hospital. She wasn't charged.

“It is indeed a frightening time, when unidentified federal agents shove, grab, handcuff, and detain an elected official in the exercise of her duties,” said Jan Susler, Fuentes’ attorney.

Huynh, who was elected to the Illinois House in 2022, is also running for Congress to replace retiring U.S. Rep. Jan Schawkosky, among four open House seats in safely Democratic territory. Other candidates in the crowded primary have also publicized their opposition outside a federal immigration processing center, including Kat Abughazaleh who was thrown on the ground by federal agents as she protested.

For Huynh, who came to the U.S. in the 1990s from Vietnam and was granted political asylum, the feeling is eerily familiar.

“My family came as refugees from the Vietnam War where people were being picked up by the secret police all the time. We believed in the American ideal of due process,” he said. ""It is very concerning that in this country right now and very disturbing right now that we are living under this authoritarian regime.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/c278143e-e38e-45e7-bc2b-4ddef29bbcf9/wirestory_7624ff7cae0b58f9b8606deacffa2474_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-10-24 11:59:15.226221

Although ICE has sold its surveillance campaign as necessary to locating and deporting undocumented immigrations, the Trump administration has signaled that the technologies will also be used on American citizens.
In September, Trump signed an executive order designating antifa a domestic terrorist organization and signaled that federal agencies, including ICE, should devote resources to investigating the network.
Any political organizing people do,"" she continued, is ""typically on social media now, or over the phone.""
The expansion of tracking and surveillance technology deployed by ICE coincides with the Trump administration's crackdown on services used by the public to share information about federal immigration enforcement.","While a federal judge scrutinizes the constitutionality of tactics used by federal immigration authorities during ongoing protests in Chicago, these same agencies are quietly amassing behind-the-scenes surveillance technology. Originally slated to target undocumented immigrants, the technology is now being used to investigate protesters of President Donald Trump's mass deportation campaign.

Backed by funding from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed in July, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has entered into contracts with companies to provide surveillance capabilities like facial recognition algorithms, an iris-scanning identification app, controversial spyware on smartphones, and a real-time smartphone location and social media tracking system. In September alone, ICE racked up $1.4 billion in new surveillance technology contracts, the highest in at least 18 years, according to The Washington Post.

These contracts are in addition to any privately owned surveillance networks to which ICE has access. Flock Safety, for example, has allowed ICE to access over 80,000 of its AI-powered license plate reader cameras installed nationwide, according to 404 Media. The expansive—and growing—mass surveillance camera network captures the license plate number, make, model, and any distinctive features of all passing vehicles, making it possible to track cars and, by extension, drivers, often without a warrant.

Although ICE has sold its surveillance campaign as necessary to locating and deporting undocumented immigrations, the Trump administration has signaled that the technologies will also be used on American citizens. In September, Trump signed an executive order designating antifa a domestic terrorist organization and signaled that federal agencies, including ICE, should devote resources to investigating the network. Todd M. Lyons, acting director of ICE, told Glenn Beck during an interview shortly after the executive order was signed that the agency would ""track the money,"" ""ringleaders,"" and ""professional agitators"" who are ""being brought in"" from outside the Chicago area to protest against immigration enforcement. But whether from Chicago or elsewhere, protester or ""domestic terrorist,"" constitutional rights and limitations still apply, although adherence by federal agencies is being questioned.

Critics of mass surveillance have long warned that intrusive technologies could be used to violate Americans' privacy rights. ""We don't know if law enforcement or ICE are getting search warrants to deploy this spyware,"" Maria Villegas Bravo, counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, told the Post. ""It's also a First Amendment issue because your phone contains all your communications, all your expressions…it has your contact lists, it has your social media. Any political organizing people do,"" she continued, is ""typically on social media now, or over the phone.""

The expansion of tracking and surveillance technology deployed by ICE coincides with the Trump administration's crackdown on services used by the public to share information about federal immigration enforcement. Since early October, the Justice Department has successfully pressured social media platforms, including Meta, Apple, and Google, to remove online groups and apps that share where ICE and other immigration agents have been sighted. Although private companies are not governed by the First Amendment and are free to set their own rules about acceptable speech, it is extremely concerning that the federal government would use its power and influence to blatantly interfere with Americans' otherwise protected free speech.

The courts and public are right to worry about the constitutional violations taking place in plain view by immigration agents during protests and enforcement operations, and officers must be held accountable. But those same actors must also be held responsible for the privacy violations that are less obvious and happening behind the scenes.",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/10/10-22-25-v1-a-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 05:17:42.106429

The student, whose name was not released, had attended a routine immigration check-in at the Federal Building in Des Moines on Sept. 30, according to advocates with the Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice, and was detained by ICE officials at the building briefly before being taken to the Hardin County Jail in Eldora.

After being transferred to the Iowa jail, the student was later sent to a detention center in Louisiana before being deported to a Central American country, according to the advocacy group. Iowa MMJ did not respond to further questions about the student’s immigration status or background; though the Des Moines Register reported his guardian was not able to speak with him for four days following his detainment, and then did not hear from him until Oct. 12, when he had been deported.

DMPS officials said in a statement shared with media that the school district was “aware that one of our high school students was detained by federal immigration authorities late last month.”

“This situation did not occur on or near school property,” The statement said. “We understand that news like this can cause concern among our students, families, and staff. Our schools are committed to being safe, welcoming places for every student with principals, teachers and staff who care about their well-being.”

The news of the DMPS student’s deportation comes after the school district has faced the high-profile arrest of former superintendent Ian Roberts, a native of Guyana who was also arrested and detained by ICE officials in late September. Since his arrest, information has been released through reporting and federal authorities showing Roberts was given an order of removal by an immigration judge in May 2024, and faced previous criminal charges.

The prime minister said on Thursday that the government was planning to expedite the man’s return to France.
The Home Office is continuing to return asylum seekers to France who arrive in the UK on small boats, with 42 returned last week in return for 23 asylum seekers brought to the UK.
The Home Office initially flew small numbers to France on Air France jets but has now switched to using private charters for deportations.
It is thought that at least 10 more people were removed from UK detention centres to France on Wednesday.","The first group of asylum seekers removed to France under the “one in, one out” scheme includes potential victims of modern slavery, people suffering severe depression and those with family in the UK, a new report has found.

Humans For Rights Network (HFRN) interviewed those returned after crossing the Channel in small boats in mid-October while they were staying in their initial accommodation – a marquee next to a railway track in Paris.

The research was announced after the Guardian revealed that an Iranian asylum seeker, who was sent to France last month, returned to the UK just 29 days later and is being held in an immigration detention centre.

He has been referred to the national referral mechanism to investigate a claim that he is a victim of trafficking. The prime minister said on Thursday that the government was planning to expedite the man’s return to France.

A charity that has maintained contact with some of those returned to France has said that more of them may attempt to return to the UK due to the reception conditions in France.

The UK-France “one in, one out” treaty, which came into force on 6 August, allows the UK to detain and rapidly remove people who enter via small boats. In return, the UK will accept an equal number of people through a newly established safe and legal route, subject to security checks.

At the time of HFRN’s research, 24 people had been returned to France and they interviewed 12 of them.

At least three of them had relatives in the UK, including two people with sisters and one with an aunt. One man told the Guardian that he reunited with his sister in the UK for the first time in more than a decade when she visited him in a detention centre. But the contact was brief after he was removed to France shortly afterwards.

Four of the men claimed to be victims of modern slavery – two having experienced it in Libya, one in Ethiopia and one in Yemen. One man was blind in one eye while two others were suffering from severe depression and one experiencing suicidal ideation.

“Overwhelmingly these men were distressed and confused, some had no contact with their lawyer, while others were unsure about what their lawyers had done to make representations regarding these experiences,” the report said.

“HFRN considers that many of the men they engaged with have significant case facts indicating their removal should never have taken place.” The charity claimed accounts of torture from some of the men were not fully investigated by the Home Office before their removal to France.

The Home Office is continuing to return asylum seekers to France who arrive in the UK on small boats, with 42 returned last week in return for 23 asylum seekers brought to the UK. The Home Office initially flew small numbers to France on Air France jets but has now switched to using private charters for deportations. It is thought that at least 10 more people were removed from UK detention centres to France on Wednesday.

A spokesperson for Gatwick Detainees Welfare Group, which supports immigration detainees, said: “We are hearing from people who have been removed to France that they have been given no guidance on how to claim asylum or access legal support there. The impact on people who are currently detained for France is causing further anxiety and confusion, as well as suicidal thoughts.

“People in France have reported that they cannot access medical care, do not understand what is happening in their case, and many are frightened of being harmed or found by smugglers. People tell us they may risk their lives again and undertake unsafe journeys through desperation.”

One asylum seeker, who is part of a group of 11 who have been moved from Paris to new accommodation in Marseille, told the Guardian: “We don’t know what is happening to us. I have been given an appointment with the French authorities for next Monday but nobody has told me what it is for.

“Many of us have been threatened with removal to other EU countries because we were previously fingerprinted in those countries. Some people are scared of this happening and have now left the accommodation and are sleeping on the streets.”

A Home Office spokesperson said: “Those arriving in the UK on small boats illegally will now be detained and returned thanks to the deal. We make no apologies for cracking down on illegal migration and securing our borders, and we are ramping up the pilot. We continue to work closely with our French counterparts to ensure the pilot operates effectively.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3737deec96d645c992ac4ab535747595338c54aa/525_0_4000_3202/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3c6ebccff595bbd4e145919856c82c72",N,,2025-10-24 01:57:00.325090

The shutdown will last at least until Tuesday, when the Senate is scheduled to vote next on legislation to reopen the government.
Federal workers received partial paychecks, only for the days they worked before the shutdown began Oct. 1, what will be their final compensation as long as the shutdown continues.
Democrats have contested the memo, with Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., calling it “another baseless attempt to try and scare” federal workers.","The Senate voted 54-45, short of the 60 votes needed to advance, against the effort that would have allowed active-duty military and some federal workers who aren’t furloughed to continue receiving paychecks during the shutdown.

Democratic Sens. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., and John Fetterman, D-Pa., voted with Republicans to support the measure.

Following a more than 22-hour-long speech from Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., that began Tuesday night, the Senate voted 54-46 on Wednesday, falling short of the 60 votes needed to move the bill forward (no new Democrats crossed the aisle).

The bill failed again, receiving 50 “yes” votes and 43 “no” votes as seven senators did not vote.

The bill failed in a 51-45 vote, with four senators abstaining from voting and the same three members of the Democratic caucus—Fetterman, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., and Angus King, I-Maine—voting with Republicans to advance the bill, while Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., again voted with all other Democrats against it.

A federal judge blocked firings the Trump administration has carried out during the shutdown for at least two more weeks, granting a request for a restraining order filed by federal employee unions.

Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought said the Trump administration wants “to be very aggressive where we can be in shuttering bureaucracy, not just the funding,” during an appearance on “The Charlie Kirk Show” broadcast from the White House, adding he wants to close the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau within “the next two, three months,” alleging overburdensome regulations on financial institutions.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the shutdown could cost the federal government $15 billion in output daily, warning it was beginning to “cut into muscle” of the U.S. government, he said while speaking at CNBC’s Invest in America Forum, calling on Democrats to “break away” and vote with Republicans to reopen the government.

The Senate voted 49-45 in favor of a Republican-backed bill to reopen the government, which needed 60 votes to clear the filibuster.

The White House budget office said in a post on X it will “continue the RIFs [reductions in force], and wait,” blaming “the Democrats’ intransigence” for the shutdown.

The Office of Management and Budget sent layoff notices to about 4,200 government workers Friday, with the steepest cuts hitting the Treasury Department and Department of Health and Human Services, though it rescinded some hours after announcing them, including hundreds at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Reuters reported Monday, citing an unnamed source familiar with the issue.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., in a press conference raised the alarm of the shutdown approaching record territory, warning that the country was “barreling toward one of the longest shutdowns in American history.”

Kalshi’s forecast for the shutdown based on betting on its predictions market rose above 37 days, before falling slightly to 35.2—which would make it the longest government shutdown in history, breaking the record set during the first Trump administration in 2019 when a shutdown lasted 35 days.

The predictions market was offering 68% odds the shutdown will last more than 30 days and a 51% chance it will last more than 35.

Consumer sentiment was virtually unchanged from last month, dipping from 55.1 to 55, according to the University of Michigan, which reported that consumer surveys indicate the shutdown hasn’t impacted consumers’ views of the economy so far, while inflation and labor market prospects remain top concerns.

Kalshi forecasted a 28-day shutdown, with a 59% chance of it lasting more than 25 days, 50% odds it will last more than 30 days and 33% for more than 35 days. The shutdown will last at least until Tuesday, when the Senate is scheduled to vote next on legislation to reopen the government.

Federal workers received partial paychecks, only for the days they worked before the shutdown began Oct. 1, what will be their final compensation as long as the shutdown continues.

President Donald Trump said “we’ll be making cuts that will be permanent, and we’re only gonna cut Democrat programs,” in his latest threat to force Democrats to vote in favor of the Republican spending plan to reopen the government.

The Senate rejected the GOP-backed bill for a seventh time, in a 54-45 vote, short of the 60 needed to break filibuster, with no new Democratic votes supporting the legislation.

The Senate voted 54-45 for the Republican spending plan, failing to reach the 60-vote threshold needed to pass, and 52-47 against a Democratic proposal.

Johnson told reporters “I hope that the furloughed workers receive back pay, of course,” but acknowledged “there are some legal analysts who are saying that that may not be appropriate or necessary, in terms of the law requiring that back pay be provided.”

Johnson said he’s spoken to Trump about the issue, and the president agrees “he doesn’t want people to go without pay.”

Trump said “in four or five days” there will be “substantial” job cuts and “a lot of those jobs will never come back” if the shutdown continues, adding “we have a lot of things that we're going to eliminate.”

Federal workers might not receive back pay for days they have been furloughed, White House budget chief Russ Vought said in a memo, arguing a 2019 law that mandated back pay is invalid and that Congress must appropriate funds specifically for that purpose in order for employees to be paid, multiple outlets reported.

Democrats have contested the memo, with Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., calling it “another baseless attempt to try and scare” federal workers.

Republicans rejected a Democratic-backed measure that would have kept the government open and also funded subsidies for the Affordable Care Act that are set to expire at the end of the year, after a vote of 50-45 largely along party lines.

A second “clean” funding bill pushed by Republicans, which would have kept the government open until at least Nov. 21 under current spending levels, also failed after a 52-42 vote—falling short of the 60-vote threshold to overcome the filibuster in the Senate.

Speaking at Monday’s press briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt blamed Democrats for the shutdown and the firings the Trump administration has threatened to enact as pressure on the opposition party.

When asked if the administration has started firing government employees, Leavitt said the Office of Management and Budget is “continuing to work with agencies on who unfortunately is going to have to be laid off if this shutdown continues.”

The Senate rejected a GOP-backed bill to avert a shutdown until at least Nov. 21 in a 54-44 vote—failing to reach the 60 votes required to advance—and also voted down the Democratic proposal.

Earlier Friday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and Johnson told reporters they wouldn’t negotiate with Democrats on their demands to extend tax credits in the Affordable Care Act in exchange for their votes to break the 60-vote filibuster threshold.

The September labor market report was put on hold as the Bureau of Labor Statistics is closed due to the shutdown.

Vought announced $2.1 billion in federal funding for two major Chicago infrastructure projects—extension of the Red line and modernization of the Red and Purple lines—was “put on hold to ensure funding is not flowing via race-based contracting.”

It’s the latest move by the White House targeting federal funding in a Democratic-led state as it seeks to pressure Senate Democrats to vote alongside Republicans for a new federal funding plan that would lift the shutdown.

Thune told reporters senators would not vote over the weekend on a funding plan to avert a shutdown, meaning it would likely last until at least Monday.

Trump doubled down on threats to punish Democrats for withholding their votes on legislation to avert a shutdown, announcing he would meet with Vought “to determine which of the many Democrat Agencies, most of which are a political SCAM, he recommends to be cut, and whether or not those cuts will be temporary or permanent,” he wrote on Truth Social.

Vought said the Office of Management and Budget was canceling $8 billion in Biden-era energy projects “to fuel the Left’s climate agenda” in states won by Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, including Colorado, California, New Jersey and New York, though it’s unclear what projects specifically will be affected.

Vought also warned in a call with House Republicans on Wednesday other infrastructure projects in New York, home to Congress’ top Democratic leaders, are under review and said the government could begin permanent layoffs due to the shutdown in a matter of days, Politico reported, citing four anonymous sources.

The administration also halted $18 billion in funding for two major New York City infrastructure projects—the Hudson Tunnel and Second Avenue Subway—to “ensure funding is not flowing based on unconstitutional DEI principles,” Vought said, with the Department of Transportation warning a review of the funding could take longer due to the shutdown.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68d6c32f1206fc8b2f99b507/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-10-24 02:56:40.668321

Friends of the Everglades, the Center for Biodiversity, and the Miccosukee Tribe filed suit over the summer alleging the detention center violates federal environmental laws.
But a federal three-judge panel on Sept. 4 reversed, noting that because the site had not received federal dollars, and was entirely state-run, federal environmental regulations don’t apply.
“There’s a growing mountain of evidence that Alligator Alcatraz was built in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act,” Samples said.
“Meanwhile, the government is dragging its feet in court to dodge accountability — using the federal shutdown as an excuse to delay the appeal.","Environmental groups’ request that a federal court shutter the “Alligator Alcatraz” detention center was paused Wednesday because of the government shutdown.

Led by the non-profit Friends of the Everglades, a coalition of activists had asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit to reconsider its September decision to keep open the migrant detention center, located in the heart of the Everglades, despite environmental concerns.

But the court on Wednesday agreed with the Department of Homeland Security that the case should be paused until government attorneys can work again.

“The motion to stay the appeal is granted. The movant is directed to file a notice with the court when the purpose for the stay is obviated,” the two-sentence order reads.

Although this comes just weeks after the court expedited the appeal and scheduled oral arguments for January, the federal government’s shutdown on Sept. 30 set off a cascade of missed pay, furloughed workers, and in-limbo cases.

So, on Oct. 10, government attorneys, noting that many Justice Department lawyers are banned from working until the government comes online again, asked for a pause on the case until “DOJ attorneys are permitted to resume their usual civil litigation functions.”

How did we get here?

The state created the sprawling, 3,000-bed facility atop the seldom-used Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport in Big Cypress National Park, drawing scrutiny from Democrats, immigration groups, and environmental organizations since its July 1 opening.

Friends of the Everglades, the Center for Biodiversity, and the Miccosukee Tribe filed suit over the summer alleging the detention center violates federal environmental laws. A district judge agreed, ordering Florida to shut down the center by September’s end. But a federal three-judge panel on Sept. 4 reversed, noting that because the site had not received federal dollars, and was entirely state-run, federal environmental regulations don’t apply.

A week later, DHS and Florida Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie revealed that Florida had applied for federal reimbursement — though Friends of the Everglades believes the request was made earlier. On Sept. 30, the state received more than $608 million to pay for the construction, transportation, and equipment costs of the facility

The plaintiffs soon after appealed, asking the Eleventh Circuit to reconsider. When DHS pointed out that some government staff couldn’t work during the shutdown, Friends of the Everglades called the situation “regrettable” but argued it didn’t outweigh the environment “harms” caused by dragging out the case.

“An indefinite stay in this case … would cause Plaintiffs ongoing and irreversible harm where the federal action being challenged — the construction and operation of an immigration detention center in the Everglades that imperils sensitive wetlands, endangered Species, and communities in the area — would continue during the indefinite stay period,” the attorneys wrote.

When the Eleventh Circuit released its order against them, Eve Samples, executive director of the Friends of the Everglades, put out a statement calling the move a ruse to avoid accountability.

“There’s a growing mountain of evidence that Alligator Alcatraz was built in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act,” Samples said. “Meanwhile, the government is dragging its feet in court to dodge accountability — using the federal shutdown as an excuse to delay the appeal.

“We’re more resolved than ever to keep fighting to restore the lower court’s injunction to protect the Everglades.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/54627147996_e1b101abe3_k.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 11:22:51.336565

The ICE facility has been the site of ongoing protests denouncing the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration in Portland.

As of Monday, the Portland Immigrant Rights Coalition (PIRC) is operating out of a previously vacant unit of the Gray’s Landing building, which is also home to low-income housing.

PIRC is a nonprofit that works with immigrants and immigrant families to provide education and support, including resources to people with appointments at the ICE field office.

Joseph Grayson, a Portland resident and frequent protester outside of the ICE facility, told KATU it's a no-brainer for PIRC to operate right next door.

""It's awesome, especially for the people that's going through the immigration process,"" Grayson said. I think that would give them a little more solace, a little more security; knowing that someone is here to fight for them other than just their family; somebody with a voice that might know the legal system.""

In a letter written to Gray’s Landing residents on Monday, Margaret Salazar, CEO of REACH Community Development, which owns the building, wrote in part, “Starting this Monday, an organization called Portland Immigrant Rights Coalition (PIRC) will be operating out of a previously vacant commercial space in the Gray’s Landing building.”

According to Jaymee Cuti, spokesperson with the city of Portland, the city of Portland-initiated conversations between PIRC and REACH Community Development two weeks ago, writing, “The City of Portland proudly supports immigrants pursuing citizenship – and ensuring fair treatment for anybody interacting with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.”

Lauren Schmidt, REACH Fundraising & Public Relations Manager, told KATU their partnership with the city “ensures that PIRC can operate in a secure, designated space while maintaining the safety, privacy, and comfort of Gray’s Landing residents.

Long-time resident of Gray’s Landing Susan Dooley says she doesn’t mind the move and says she understands the location is ideal for the organization’s purpose.

“I think it’s probably a good idea, because if they have to go over there [to the ICE facility], it’s right across the street; they don’t have to go very far,” Dooley said. “It doesn’t bother me. They’re gonna have to have it somewhere.”

Other tenants are not so keen on the idea, concerned that it will bring even more conflicts amid ongoing protests in the area.

Gray’s Landing residents, including Dooley, say they did not receive a notice until the move was finalized, and told KATU they wish they had a say in the matter.

According to Schmidt, the collaboration with the city of Portland and PIRC “is part of REACH’s broader commitment to supporting community stability and minimizing disruption around the building due to its close proximity to the ICE facility.”

Residents of Gray’s Landing have continuously voiced their concerns with the noise and chemicals around the ICE facility.

Dooley told KATU the use of tear gas by federal agents is interfering with her ability to breathe.

“For the last few weeks, I have been extremely disoriented, and I actually have fallen three times in my apartment the last few weeks,” Dooley said. “I just feel very weak and extremely tired all the time.”

In the letter, Salazar also acknowledged the activity around the facility and said REACH is advocating for city support to help clean sidewalks as chemical munitions are continuing to be deployed on a weekly basis.

“REACH has purchased in-unit air purifiers, which will be arriving in multiple shipments beginning next week and continuing through the end of the month,” Salazar wrote to residents. “We wanted to bring these to you sooner, but delivery times were lengthier than we had hoped.”

Gray's Landing resident Lashawnda Shavers said she has lost trust in management and said this comes after she says she has been reaching out for help for months.

""You're out here tap dancing that you're doing something because you care about the community, residents, and immigrants, but no you haven't,"" Shavers said about REACH. ""I emailed in June about support for me and the other residents, and I was told to contact local authorities.""

“Yesterday, I granted a pardon for Lue Yang, a devoted family man and respected leader in Michigan’s Hmong community,” Whitmer said in a statement issued Thursday morning.
Whitmer’s statement explained that the pardon sets aside Yang’s conviction, allowing him to move forward without the conviction on his record.
Despite the pardon, Yang still faces threats of deportation, as he was slated to depart on an ICE flight to Laos as of Wednesday night.
“On behalf of Khone’s son, Khamsay’s sister, Lue Yang’s wife, Ann, and their families, we are all urging ICE to bring these men home.","Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced on Thursday she had granted a pardon request for Lue Yang, a Hmong refugee and president of the Hmong Family Association of Lansing who was detained by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement in July over a decades-old criminal conviction.

Yang was born in a refugee camp in Thailand, and came to the U.S. in 1979 as his parents fled Laos due to war and persecution for their support of the United States during the Vietnam War. In 1997, Yang was convicted on a home burglary charge, accepting a plea bargain and served a 10-month sentence.

In 2018, Yang’s conviction was expunged, however, the federal government does not recognize the expungement. Yang’s conviction complicated his immigration status, and he has been denied while applying for citizenship, State Rep. Mai Xiong (D-Warren), explained in a video advocating for Yang’s release. On July 15, Yang was detained by ICE while at work, and he has remained in custody since.

“Yesterday, I granted a pardon for Lue Yang, a devoted family man and respected leader in Michigan’s Hmong community,” Whitmer said in a statement issued Thursday morning.

Whitmer’s statement explained that the pardon sets aside Yang’s conviction, allowing him to move forward without the conviction on his record.

Despite the pardon, Yang still faces threats of deportation, as he was slated to depart on an ICE flight to Laos as of Wednesday night.

However, Aisa Villarosa of the Asian Law Caucus, which has been working with Yang’s attorney, told the Michigan Advance that, to the best of their knowledge, Yang remains in the U.S., noting that the lack of transparency from ICE leaves family members lawyers and advocates to cobble together his location.

Xiong, who was also a Hmong refugee, has strongly advocated for Yang’s return. Xiong said she was extremely grateful for the pardon, noting that his family is still facing difficulties in navigating the legal system to have him released.

“I’m grateful for that pardon from the Governor, because that means that [Yang] will have an opportunity to fight for his release, yes, but we can only do that if he is still on U.S. soil or in U.S. air,” Xiong said.

Yang’s attorney is working to vacate his case through the county court system, Xiong said.

Rising Voices, a nonprofit organization focusing on increasing civic participation among Michigan’s Asian American residents, cheered the decision in a statement while addressing the urgent action to keep Yang in the U.S.

“My family and I need Lue to return home where he belongs. This pardon shows the power of humanity and community,” Ann Vue, Yang’s wife said in a statement. “So many people stood with us, checked in on us, and refused to allow us to give up. We applaud and thank Governor Whitmer for her courage in granting Lue this pardon. Now we demand ICE and [the U.S. Department of Homeland Security] to bring Lue home to Michigan.”

On Thursday morning, state Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit) spoke out on the Senate floor about the deportation of several Hmong and Lao men, sharing the story of Khone Segmany, who like Yang, committed a low-level offense as a young man, as well as another man named Khamsay.

“On behalf of Khone’s son, Khamsay’s sister, Lue Yang’s wife, Ann, and their families, we are all urging ICE to bring these men home. They are members of our community, they are fathers, and their families deserve to have them by their side,” Chang said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_20251023_183750.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 01:17:09.857126

However, Trump did not say whether Customs and Border Patrol intends to deploy agents elsewhere in the Bay Area.
Oakland and Alameda County law enforcement officers don’t cooperate with immigration authorities on civil matters.
Oakland and the Bay Area will “collectively stand by our beliefs that terror and that violence inflicted by the Trump administration upon this community are unwanted, unwarranted, and illegal,” Simon said.
Supervisor Nikki Fortunato Bas shared that the Board of Supervisors has invested millions of dollars in immigration legal defense services.","Less than an hour after President Donald Trump called off an immigration enforcement surge in San Francisco, East Bay leaders held a press conference to calm residents and let them know officials are prepared if the administration still moves ahead with operations in this area.

But what exactly a federal surge in Berkeley, Oakland or other cities would look like is anyone’s guess.

Facing a packed conference room in Oakland City Hall, Mayor Barbara Lee acknowledged she has “no information we can bring to you today” about the federal administration’s plans.

“The federal administration, of course, has escalated its rhetoric and its enforcement posture in the Bay Area,” Lee said. “We know border patrol agents are being stationed on the Coast Guard Island, but let me be clear, we are fully prepared.”

Trump posted on Truth Social that he decided to call off a planned immigration enforcement campaign in San Francisco this Saturday after having a phone call last night with Mayor Daniel Lurie, who expressed concern that it would harm the city’s economic recovery.

However, Trump did not say whether Customs and Border Patrol intends to deploy agents elsewhere in the Bay Area. Sources told Cityside that deployments in the East Bay are still a possibility.

Lisa Hoffman, co-executive director of the East Bay Sanctuary Covenant, said her organization — which provides legal and social services, and leads know-your-rights trainings — is preparing for the possibility that federal authorities will launch operations on this side of the bay.

The advocacy group is encouraging those who could be at risk of deportation to stay home as much as they can.

In an email alert Wednesday, it advised that schools and hospitals are “generally safe,” but specifically recommended people avoid “Home Depots, the flea market and other high-traffic community spaces.” Hoffman said the advice was based on “what we’ve heard and also what we’ve seen in other cities,” where Home Depot stores have been targeted by immigration authorities.

“For those who have more protected legal status, we need to be standing up for those who may not have as much protection in this moment and offering help,” she said, which might include making trips to grocery stores or schools for neighbors who are undocumented.

“This is the time for us to be showing up for each other,” Hoffman said.

The “confusing and inconsistent” messages about the operation has added to the anxiety that both clients and staff feel at Oasis Legal Services, a nonprofit that supports LGBTQ+ immigrants, spokesperson Mateo Sánchez said. The organization is offering to meet with clients virtually or by phone, rather than having them come into its Berkeley office, Sánchez said, and has given staff the option of working from home in the coming days and weeks. That plan did not change in light of Trump’s announcement Wednesday morning.

“ICE is still around,” Sánchez said. “We don’t know what it means for the Bay Area more widely.”

Officials encourage peaceful protests

Lee and other elected officials, union representatives, and faith leaders encouraged residents to look out for one another and to peacefully protest the administration. But officials also warned people not to “take the bait” by committing any acts of violence against federal officers.

“We know that they’re baiting Oakland, and that’s why San Francisco is suddenly off the table,” said Alameda County District Attorney Ursula Jones Dickson. “So I’m not going to be quiet about what we know is coming. We know that their expectation is that Oakland is going to do something to cause them to make us the example.”

Earlier this morning, hundreds of protesters gathered near a road that leads to an island in the Oakland estuary that houses Coast Guard facilities, where CBP agents were reported to be arriving. Demonstrators who attempted to block the road were forced to disperse after agents deployed two flash bangs so several CBP vehicles could get through.

Oakland and Alameda County law enforcement officers don’t cooperate with immigration authorities on civil matters. But there are limits to that non-cooperation. Dickson noted that her office can’t stand in the way of a legal warrant. Assistant Oakland Police Chief James Beere said his department has no authority to oppose or prevent federal authorities from conducting immigration operations in Oakland.

“I want to make it clear that if anyone attempts to enter your house or detain you, and they’re not in uniform or they don’t show credentials, please call 911 immediately,” Beere said.

Congresswoman Lateefah Simon said her office will protect members of the community, including children, families, officers, and protesters.

Oakland and the Bay Area will “collectively stand by our beliefs that terror and that violence inflicted by the Trump administration upon this community are unwanted, unwarranted, and illegal,” Simon said.

In her State of the City speech Wednesday night, Berkeley Mayor Adena Ishii told an audience of supporters, “The moment that we’ve been preparing for as a city has arrived.”

Ishii echoed calls for people to express their opposition to the federal action peacefully.

“The feds are looking to make an example of us — they want a reason to send the National Guard here,” she said. “We want to circumvent them. When we protest, we must protest like we always do: peacefully and with intention.”

Ramped up efforts to defend against deportations

Several officials summarized efforts they’re taking to bolster the region’s defenses against federal incursions. Supervisor Nikki Fortunato Bas shared that the Board of Supervisors has invested millions of dollars in immigration legal defense services. The board also recently agreed to create an office focused on immigrant affairs to coordinate services throughout the county.

Lourdes Martinez, directing attorney of the immigrant rights practice at Centro Legal De La Raza, said ICE has already been operating in Alameda County. Her group, which runs a pro bono immigrant legal defense program, is anticipating an escalation, similar to what’s been seen in Washington D.C., Chicago, and Portland.

“If there has been deployment of federal law enforcement, it has really strengthened ICE and their ability to execute more detentions,” Martinez said. “So that is what we’re bracing for.”

The county also revived this year a rapid response hotline, which residents can use to call in reports of ICE activity. Martinez encouraged people to call the line instead of spreading unverified reports on other platforms. She also shared practical advice for immigrants, including that people should memorize important phone numbers and gather and keep safe documents like passports and medical records. She also recommended that people use PIN passcodes on their phones and consider disabling fingerprint or facial recognition on their cellphones.

“Just remember we are living under difficult times where ICE is allowed to racially profile,” she said.

Mike McBride, pastor of the Berkeley church The Way, advised young people to “not get caught up” engaging with federal officers, and to carry IDs and attend know-your-rights trainings.

“We will outlast this wickedness in high places, Oakland will counter hate, lies, and misinformation with love for all people,” McBride said. “Truth, justice, peace and joy. And we beg the Congress, please release the Epstein files.”",https://newspack-berkeleyside-cityside.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_7741-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 23:56:25.713997

The leaf blower ordinance was adopted by the City Council in 2021, banning the use of gasoline or propane-powered leaf blowers after April 1, 2023.
Tickets for the use of these leaf blowers will only be issued to property owners in the village, rather than contractors.

The moratorium’s purpose is to ensure landscapers’ safety and mitigate confusion regarding reporting of an ordinance violation by community members, according to the city’s website.

“We put a moratorium on enforcement of our leaf blower ordinance, and this is after (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) covered landscapers in Evanston just yesterday, and we received numerous requests from the community and from councilmembers to pause enforcement during this time,” Chief Legislative Policy Advisor Liza Roberson-Young said at the city’s Community Preparedness & Empowerment Seminar on Wednesday night.

Roberson-Young confirmed at the event that ICE targeted a landscaper in Evanston Tuesday.

Early Wednesday morning, an entire landscaping team was detained by ICE agents near the intersection of Waukegan Road and Church Street in Morton Grove, a Chicago suburb west of Evanston, according to an Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights alert sent around 11:18 a.m.

The moratorium is one of the efforts the city has taken to protect residents against federal agents. Since the beginning of the year, the city has strengthened its Welcoming City ordinance and more recently, City Council voted to establish “ICE free zones” on city property.

The leaf blower ordinance was adopted by the City Council in 2021, banning the use of gasoline or propane-powered leaf blowers after April 1, 2023.

Previously, violations of the ordinance with a signed witness statement and detailed description of the violation taking place were to be submitted to the city during business hours or to the Evanston Police Department’s non-emergency line outside of business hours. Violators received written warnings for first offenses and then increasing fines for further violations.

This will not be enforced under the temporary moratorium, which is effective through Dec. 31.

On Oct. 14, Oak Park also issued temporary changes to the enforcement of its own ban on gasoline-powered leaf blowers in reaction to heightened activity of federal agents in the area. Tickets for the use of these leaf blowers will only be issued to property owners in the village, rather than contractors.

Nicknamed ""Alligator Alcatraz"" by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and state Republicans, the facility has been a source of controversy.

What we know:

The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted a request from the Trump administration to halt proceedings while the shutdown continues.

The lawsuit, filed by Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity — later joined by the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida — challenges the facility’s operation on environmental grounds. The plaintiffs argue that federal law requires an environmental impact review before projects like the detention center can proceed.

In August, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ordered that operations at the facility be wound down. However, in September, a three-judge appellate panel stayed that order while the federal government appealed.

What we don't know:

It remains unclear when the case will resume, as the duration of the shutdown will determine when Department of Justice attorneys can return to work. The long-term future of the detention center is also uncertain.

The backstory:

The detention center has been a flashpoint in Florida’s immigration and environmental debates. Environmental advocates say it sits within sensitive Everglades habitat and was constructed without the legally required environmental assessments.

The case has drawn attention from both immigration attorneys and state watchdog groups. Separate lawsuits have been filed on behalf of detainees claiming inadequate legal access, and Friends of the Everglades has accused the state of withholding public records about the facility’s funding and management.

At the event, organized by the nonprofit Children’s Rights, panelists spoke on a variety of issues, including U.S. immigration policies, zero-tolerance school discipline and the harm caused by racial inequities in the foster care system.

A second panel discussion featured child welfare advocates, parents and former foster youth who spoke out against family separation and injustice perpetuated by child maltreatment investigations.

Panelists came together in response to what they view as a concerning pullback of U.S. participation in the protection of human rights on a global stage. In August, the federal government announced it would withdraw from the Universal Periodic Review — a nearly two-decade old program created by the U.N.’s Human Rights Council (HRC) that calls for a peer review of human rights records for all 193 member states.

According to Reuters, a U.S. state department official said participating in the review would imply endorsement of the council’s “persistent failure to condemn the most egregious human rights violators” and that the U.S. would not be “lectured about our human rights record by the likes of HRC members such as Venezuela, China, or Sudan.”

Global advocates denounced the U.S. decision to back out of the review, which occurs roughly every five years. Reports are reviewed by other members who offer non-binding recommendations. The U.S. was due to submit its report this November but has until July 2027.

Youth advocates consider the decision a signal of federal officials’ increasing apathy about the futures of vulnerable young people.

“They know that this is a review that will highlight the violations that are happening daily,” Jamil Dakwar, director of the American Civil Liberty Union’s Human Rights Program, said about the federal government.

Dakwar serves on a prominent New York based civil rights panel that advises the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. The group released a first-of-its-kind report last year demonstrating persistent discriminatory treatment of Black families in the state’s child welfare system, and asked Congress to implement certain changes.

Panelists came together Wednesday to demonstrate their unwillingness to allow these issues to be ignored, despite the government “doing everything in its power to circumvent accountability,” activist Joyce McMillan said.

“We have to hold them accountable and bring the human rights recommendations to them and push for the changes, whether to change the laws as they stand, abolish some of those laws that are really harmful and to enact ones that are consistent with international human rights law,” Dakwar added.

Domestic injustice also addressed

Although the global role of the U.S. prompted the gathering, domestic concerns drove the discussions.

Former foster youth on one panel described a culture of loneliness, abuse, and lack of mental healthcare access in foster care.

“Our stories carry the evidence that policies alone can’t capture — the fear of a knock on the door, or the loss of your child without due process.”

— Activist Tatiana Rodriguez

Youth advocate Jasiyah Gilbert, 24, spoke about the trauma he endured when he was separated from his family and placed in a group home. His mother struggled with housing and mental health issues, which the child welfare agency classified as neglect.

“It was a very carceral, jail-like environment where they’re told when to eat, when to use the bathroom,” Gilbert said of his and other foster youth’s experiences in congregate care settings. “Often, their education is sacrificed.”

Foster children frequently run away and end up homeless after being separated, he added. Solutions to the problem should focus on strengthening families by providing housing vouchers, cash assistance and other community services, he said.

Activists April Lee from Philadelphia and Tatiana Rodriguez of Massachusetts emphasized the importance of sharing parental perspectives regarding CPS investigations and foster care with policy makers.

“I also survived the system as a third generation foster youth and a parent being investigated, and I eventually lost my son,” Rodriguez shared. “Our stories carry the evidence that policies alone can’t capture — the fear of a knock on the door, or the loss of your child without due process.”

Panelist and attorney David Shalleck-Klein called the harms caused by the child welfare system “one of the most important civil rights issues of our time,” and pointed to a history of “illegal” practices by child welfare agencies in New York. Last year, he was part of a team that filed a class-action lawsuit defending the rights of parents under a child maltreatment investigation.

It’s easy for attorneys to identify that Fourth Amendment rights are violated when government agents enter homes without court orders, Shalleck-Klein said, or when “children are torn from parents” without judicial oversight.

“The hard part,’’ he said, “is understanding: How do we use the tools that we have as advocates to end up at a place where that stops happening?”",https://imprintnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/unitednations.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 01:00:46.185599

6:30 p.m. — Day 1 rally at Embarcadero, “We cannot claim victory yet”

Despite the “surge” of federal troops being called off, a crowd began to gather at Embarcadero Plaza on Wednesday evening bearing signs declaring “No Kings” and “No ICE or troops in the Bay.”

As the plaza filled with people, the event kicked off with local singer La Doña and a spiritual ceremony from the Danzantes del Bahia. Inside the plexiglass enclosure of the plaza’s temporary padelball court, a few muscular men in short shorts bounced around the astroturf, seemingly oblivious to (or unconcerned by) the goings-on.

“Whose head is spinning from all the news in the last 48 hours?” shouted one speaker. But, she said, “we cannot claim victory yet.” Protesters were encouraged to “adopt a corner” and look out for ICE activity.

“You should be proud of this,” added labor organizer David Huerta. You’ve kept ICE out of San Francisco.”

“But they’re still in Memphis, they’re still in D.C.” he reminded the growing crowd. “We need to continue to stand together.”

Some speeches at the 5pm rally mirrored closely those given at the noon rally, but District 9 Supervisor Jackie Fielder escalated her language from earlier: “While I’m here, I’ll just say. Fuck Marc Benioff. Fuck Elon Musk. Fuck David Sacks. Any anyone who ever suggested that this was okay.”

Fielder urged attendees to stay vigilant, noting that there was no guarantee that President Donald Trump could change course and send federal agents into the city any time.

District 5 Supervisor Bilal Mahmood condemned the current administration as a “dictatorship” that he compared to the one he lived under in Pakistan as a teenager. Toppling that dictatorship required people in the streets everyday, he said: “When a dictator sees that the people oppose him, he loses his power.”

“So many students didn’t show up in school today,” added Supervisor Chyanne Chen. “We don’t want them in our schools, in our hospitals … San Francisco is a sanctuary city. We will never back down. We will never leave anyone behind.”

Just before 6:30 p.m., organizers prepared the crowd, which now numbered at least a thousand, for a march to the Sansome Street immigration court. Vigils at public libraries tomorrow would continue as planned, they said.

“We didn’t see the invasion that we were worried about,” said Jane, an organizer with Bay Resistance, her voice trembling with emotion as she spoke. “What we did see today, is that the Bay is ready.” And with that, the crowd was on the march.

4 p.m. — An email to city employees on “federal deployment and employee safety protocols”

San Francisco city employees were sent an update on “federal deployment and employee safety protocols” via email on Thursday afternoon.

Employees were reminded that federal law prohibits the City from interfering with federal agents carrying out immigration enforcement. They may not prevent Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from accessing a public area of a city building or transit, said an email reviewed by Mission Local.

At the same time, city and state sanctuary policies prohibit employees from participating in immigration enforcement by giving ICE agents access to non-public buildings or records. Employees must only cooperate if there is a subpoena or warrant issued by a federal court.

They are also not required to show ICE agents personal identification or answer agents’ questions, the email added.

3 p.m. — City announces plan to dedicate $3.4 million more for immigrant legal defense and Rapid Response Network

Hours after President Trump withdrew a threat to send a “surge” of federal agents to San Francisco,” Supervisor Connie Chan announced that San Francisco would direct an additional $3.5 million to immigrant legal defense and the Rapid Response Network.”

The legal defense funds lawyers for immigrants who need representation, and the Rapid Response Network provides a 24 hour hotline for verifying ICE raids and connecting detained immigrants to attorneys.

Chan, the chair of the city’s Budget Committee, made the announcement alongside her co-sponsors Supervisors Bilal Mahmood, Chyanne Chen, Jackie Fielder and Shamann Walton.

“Despite this morning’s news, we know federal agents have been in San Francisco already. For months, we’ve seen how those attempting to follow our legal process abiding by the law at immigration centers are detained during routine check-ins,” Mahmood said.

2:55 p.m. — I told the mayor, “I love what you’re doing,” Trump says

As reported by the New York Times, President Trump spoke highly of Mayor Daniel Lurie at a White House round table. “I love what you’re doing,” he said to the Mayor. The comment comes following a phone call between Trump and Lurie, where Trump stated he would reverse his decision to deploy federal agents in San Francisco, including a planned “surge” in agents on Saturday. It is unclear how surrounding cities in the Bay Area will be affected.

District 9 Supervisor Jackie Fielder wrote: “I remain concerned that the Mayor’s statement today included that he would ’welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and the U.S. Attorney,’” in response to a previous announcement by Lurie.

At a press conference on Thursday, Fielder said she has “concerns that any federal agency under Trump is actually taking up immigration enforcement,” in response to Lurie potentially working with Pam Bondi and the FBI.

“We cannot have it both ways. We cannot say, I welcome this, but I don’t welcome that,” District 10 Supervisor Shamann Walton added.

12:40 p.m. — Trump’s conversation with Mayor Lurie answers some questions, raises others

At noon, Mayor Daniel Lurie, city department heads,and supervisors gathered in the mayor’s office to address President Donald Trump’s decision to call off the “surge” of San Francisco.

What exactly that “surge” would look like did not seem to have been defined over the course of Lurie’s conversation with Trump.

Lurie did not give answers to which federal agents would no longer be coming to the city — whether it be the National Guard, the border patrol agents, ICE — or all of them.

Lurie also said that his conversation did not include what will happen to other Bay Area cities.

“I was told the surge was being called off,” Lurie said. “He only spoke about San Francisco. So all I can say is what he told me.”

In addition to Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Lurie said he has also spoken with United States Attorney General Pam Bondi about working together to “hold drug traffickers accountable.”

In a Truth Social post, Trump said that he called Lurie after speaking with Marc Benioff, the Salesforce CEO — who on Oct. 9 called for the National Guard to come to San Francisco — and Jensen Huang, the president and CEO of NVIDIA.

Lurie said that he had not asked anyone to make calls on San Francisco’s behalf — “he picked up the phone and called me.”

Lurie affirmed that even with the “surge” called off for now, San Francisco will remain ready.

“I think we as a city should be prepared for any scenario,” Lurie said.

12:20 p.m. — Oakland mayor unsure if The Town is still a target

Oakland mayor Barbara Lee tells Mission Local that the situation is “fluid” and “all we know is what the press is reporting.” She confirms that “I haven’t heard from the president.”

Following a briefing from Lurie’s office, area politicians believe that the area will return for whatever passes as the “status quo.” There is no indication feds will instead raid nearby Bay Area cities. But there is no assurance that it won’t happen.

Meanwhile, Immigration enforcement activity has risen sharply in Oakland, according to Alameda County’s Rapid Response Network (ACILEP). It reported that its call volume increased from an average of 10 calls a day to 50 by 11:30 a.m.

Neither the Asian Law Caucus nor the Rapid Response networks in San Francisco or San Mateo County could confirm whether the cancellation of a federal deployment in San Francisco also included a stand-down of planned immigration operations in the region.

“No one knows for sure right now” whether Trump’s immigration enforcement will escalate across the Bay Area, said Lauren Nguyen of the Asian Law Caucus said.

12.01 p.m. — Despite news that the president has called off federal agents from entering San Francisco, at least 100 protesters gathered at City Hall for a rally at noon.

One man, Noah, came all the way from Sacramento, where he has been protesting daily outside an ICE facility where he believes people are being detained.

He said he wasn’t affiliated with an organization, and it has been just “me myself and I, and a couple of friends that are passionate about human rights.”

“If there was ever a time for us to be unified in San Francisco, it is now,” said Supervisor Shamann Walton, who started off the rally on the steps of City Hall. “We do not trust this administration. To say you’re not coming after you say you’re coming… we want to make sure our community is prepared.”

Rally emcee Sofia Bastida asked those gathered about the purported change in plans for ICE to enter San Francisco: “How are we feeling about that?”

Attendees hiss in response.

Supervisor Jackie Fielder accused tech billionaires like Marc Benioff, Elon Musk, and David Sacks of bringing about the current situation.

“I condemn every tech billionaire who supported this,” Fielder said. “We are here because Benioff of Salesforce put this idea into Trump’s head.”

“We cannot have tunnel vision,” said Olga Miranda, the head of the Local 87 labor union. She urged unity across the Bay Area. “An injury to one, an injury to all.”

As cars and trucks drove past City Hall, drivers honked in solidarity.

Those present were attentive and ready for action. Asked to repeat the rapid response network phone number, most in the crowd appeared to already know it and chanted the number in unison. (For those in San Francisco, the number is 415-200-1548.)

Celi Tamayo-Lee of SF Rising assured the crowd that the fight would continue and that the 5 p.m. mass rally to unite the region is still on.

That, she said, “is where we really show what we are about in the Bay Area.”

10:00 a.m. — Plans to deploy federal officers in San Francisco have been called off, according to a statement from Mayor Daniel Lurie.

Lurie wrote that he received a phone call from President Donald Trump last night, though he waited to release the statement till 9:30 a.m. this morning. What arrangements preceded that call are not known.

“In that conversation, the president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem reaffirmed that direction in our conversation this morning,” he wrote.

“My team will continue to monitor the situation closely, and our city remains prepared for any scenario.”

Shortly thereafter, President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social saying “we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday.” He attributed this decision to “friends of mine who live in the area,” naming Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. His post ended: “Stay tuned!”

Advocates say the change only affects the potential National Guard or military deployment, not ICE or Customs and Border Patrol operations.

Border patrol agents already have federal authority to operate in any U.S. city, while National Guard troops generally require legal authorization for domestic use, though those limits have weakened under Trump-appointed judges.

The fate of other Bay Area cities was not mentioned. Mission Local‘s message for Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee has not yet been returned.

Protesters march outside Coast Guard Island

2:15 p.m. — Two protestors arrested by California Highway Patrol

Over 60 California Highway Patrol officers in riot gear marched in on protesters. Using batons, they pushed protestors off the street to make a tunnel for a caravan of vehicles to exit the base. Two protesters were arrested and walked off with their hands zip-tied behind their backs. One man, who resisted being moved, was grabbed by CHP officers and subdued to the ground with an elbow to the neck.

10:03 a.m. — Trump says federal agents “will not surge” S.F.

President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that after a phone call with San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie last night, the federal government “will not surge San Francisco on Saturday.”

The post follows days of uncertainty and online rumors that Trump was planning a mass raid at a Home Depot within 40 miles of San Francisco this weekend.

Trump wrote that “friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge” because Lurie was making “substantial progress” on crime. He added that business leaders, including Jensen Huang and Marc Benioff, had contacted him to express optimism about the city’s recovery.

Still, organizers and advocates are urging caution, noting that Trump’s statement does not necessarily rule out immigration enforcement or other federal activity in the region. They emphasize that people in surrounding cities should stay alert and prepared in case the situation changes.

9:45 a.m. — Alameda Fire Department outside Coast Guard Island

A fire truck and two other Alameda Fire Department vehicles arrive at the intersection of Dennison Street and Embarcadero. They’re met with protesters.

Officers say they’ve arrived to take someone who was injured on the island to the hospital. Soon after, a man who was not involved in the protest is wheeled through the crowd on a stretcher.

The size of the crowd dwindles, but at 11 a.m. protesters are still circling the intersection. What appears to be pieces of a white vehicle and a flash grenade canister still litter the road, on both sides of the U.S. government property line.

9:20 a.m. — In the Mission, some workers stay home, others taking the risk

In the Mission District, many Latino-owned businesses are shuttered. Despite widespread fear, some street vendors continue to sell, and a few stores remain open.

“Since yesterday, there are fewer people out,” said street vendor María V. “They’re very scared.”

María said she’s part of several neighborhood groups keeping watch for any potential presence of federal agents. Some workers who spoke to El Tecolote anonymously said they were required to come into work, but hoped their employers would soon decide to close.

9 a.m. — Protesters singing

As the sun rises, the mood shifts from a standoff in the dark to skipping in the streets; literally, there’s a jump rope. Parents have brought their children. The crowd thins out slightly.

One protester wears a Stewie Griffin mask, another an inflatable chicken suit with a sign that says “Why did the chicken cross the road?” Faith leaders sing “We Shall Overcome” while a clown makes balloon animals.

— Abigail Vân Neely and Mariana Garcia, Mission Local

7:30 a.m. — Vehicle injures protester

The scene is less tense, but even more crowded, with at least 100 people.

Protesters continue to move back and forth along the crosswalk dividing the road to Coast Guard Island, but their numbers have grown, and the pace has slowed to a shuffle.

The road is now impassable. There is a line of cars backed up along Embarcadero East.

One protester, Matthew Leber, 50, limps away from the crosswalk. He says he was struck by the driver of a SUV, who refused to immediately back up when the crowd blocked the road.

“I’m still taking it in. I feel okay. I feel really proud of people standing up here against fascism,” he says. He sits on the curb and props up his leg, which is red.

Leaders reorganize the crowd to keep people moving around four crosswalks at the intersection of Embarcadero East and Dennison St. Observers with the National Lawyers’ Guild take notes to send to attorneys, if needed.

7:15 a.m. — Crowd blocks Border Patrol vehicles, flash grenades deployed

Protestors block a large white vehicle attempting to drive down the one road onto Coast Guard Island, despite organizers’ instructions to keep walking.

An officer gets between the vehicle and the crowd. Other cars start honking. Protesters are told to stay back from the blue paint designating U.S. government property beyond the crosswalk.

Two flash grenades are set off by Border Patrol as pickup trucks carrying a handful of federal agents drive through the crowd and across the bridge.

Protesters who were near the flash grenades, which can cause temporary blindness or deafness, step back to pour water over their faces. A faith leader is covered in debris from the smoke cloud the flash grenades emitted.

U.S. Coast Guard officers form a line opposite the demonstration.

6:30 a.m. — ‘We have to say no’

A couple dozen protesters are standing on either side of the one road leading into Coast Guard Island in Alameda, where federal immigration agents are set to arrive today.

Two U.S. Coast Guard officers are conducting traffic. A white shuttle bus has been let through, along with other cars driven by people who work on the island. There is a checkpoint further down the bridge.

An organizer is reminding protesters to keep moving: if they stand still in the crosswalk across the bridge, the organizer says, it will be considered an “obstruction.” It is still dark.

The organizer says law enforcement has instructed cars to keep driving as pedestrians continue walking back and forth. They play “Antipatriarcha,” a Spanish protest song by Ana Tijoux, on a speaker, and try to address the Coast Guard officers, who do not engage.

“ICE is on the island,” repeats a man who has been standing in the center of the intersection of Embarcadero East and Dennison St. for at least the last half hour. “We have to say no.”

The stream of people repeatedly crossing the road grows. One carries a small dog, called Rudy, short for Rutabaga. Rudy was brought to the protest because “he hates ICE,” his owner said. “He loves all his neighbors and he doesn’t want to lose any.”

Faith leaders begin to sing “We Shall Not Be Moved.”

“So much has been done in this administration under the name of God or some twisted version of Christianity,” said Reverend Penny Nixon with the Peninsula Solidarity Cohort. “In the Christian religion it is very clear everyone is our neighbor.”

Earlier in the day:

News of federal immigration agents coming to the Bay Area confirmed San Francisco officials’ worst fears. Though attention was recently focused on the possibility of the National Guard being sent in, those troops are heavily proscribed in their actions. Immigration agents are not.

More protests were planned for Thursday in San Francisco: The group Bay Resistance called for a “Hands Off the Bay” rally at 5 p.m. at the Embarcadero.

City officials rushed into action on Wednesday. Mayor Daniel Lurie said in a press conference that “Immigration officials are deployed to use aggressive enforcement tactics that instill fear so people don’t feel safe going about their daily lives.” He signed an executive directive reminding city workers that they cannot, in most cases, participate in immigration enforcement.

Mission residents on Wednesday reacted with a range of emotions to the news: shrugs, fear, and support. Many said they are carrying their papers, just in case.

El Tecolote and Mission Local have put together resource guides for those wondering how to protect themselves.

Mission Local and El Tecolote are teaming up to provide a live blog for up-to-date developments in federal immigration agents’ deployment to the Bay Area.

9:55 a.m. — At a food bank in the Mission

Claudia woke up to news of the arrival of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers at the Coast Guard base in Alameda. “The volunteers are fearful right now, “ she said in Spanish. She stood outside of La Ofrenda, a community space that offers free groceries to San Francisco residents. Behind her, about four other volunteers unpacked cardboard boxes of food.

“I feel bad that right now ICE is detaining anyone irrespective of if they have documents or not,” she continued. “They will detain you if you speak Spanish and look Latino or are brown.”

Roberto Eligió Alfaro, executive director of the non-profit Homey S.F., which supports Ofrenda, said that they now serve 200 families, but fear of ICE is keeping some home. Since the start of last month, Alfaro and José Luis Pavón have also helped operate Defensa Del Barrio, a patrol that visits neighbors in the Mission to inform them of their rights if they encounter ICE. They’ve met with about 50 businesses as well as a hundred families. “We cannot bow down to fear,” said Pavón in Spanish. “That is what Trump wants.”

Over on the 14 Muni, a woman from Daly City said in Spanish, “Truthfully, I’m not fearful about this. I’m OK.”

Others expressed worry over the news. An elderly man named Terry said he was worried that if President Trump cuts EBT and other resources he relies on, he and his neighbors could “end up on the streets.”

“If they’re coming to intimidate and toughen us up, I’ve got a problem with that,” Terry said, of CBPs arrival. “I know a lot of people that I haven’t seen lately, and I think they know that ICE is coming and that they’ve gone underground.” He added, “It makes me feel bad; it’s them, but it could be me next.”

“The world is messed up, period,” added Douglas, another man. “It’s going to take a while to fix it.”

6:30 a.m. — Immigrants carry passports ahead of potential crackdown

Last night, residents in the Mission District reacted to the planned deployment with emotions ranging from fear to calm.

More are carrying documents to prove citizenship, and at least one thought it was a good idea to send in federal agents. Many were still unaware that the president’s threats to deploy troops had escalated, with agents set to land at the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda on Thursday.

Those in the know largely remained calm.

“I’m good. I’m okay. I have papers, I have my license. I work here every day,” said Luis Ledesma who runs a jewelry stall near 22nd Street. He said he usually carries a copy of his documents with him, though he forgot to bring them today.

Others also said they are carrying their documents, believing that having proof of their status was the best way to prevent harm when faced with federal immigration agents. That hasn’t always been the case.

Originally from Nicaragua, Myriai Evarra, 59, and her cousin Chalina Mena, 62, have been carrying their passports and Real IDs with them everywhere for the last year, “just in case.” On Wednesday evening they were engaged in a spirited debate at the 24th Street Mission BART Plaza.

Evarra argued that federal agents should come to San Francisco to “clean up the drugs.” Mena disagreed.

When Mena insisted that immigration agents will not be involved in drug-related enforcement, Evarra insisted that “they will at least do something.”

The federal agents are “not going to fix fentanyl or the drugs. That’s an excuse to go after immigrants. I am angry because they are going to get very violent with people,” said Mena. When asked if she was afraid, she said she was more “uncomfortable” than afraid.

6 a.m. — How to prepare for immigration enforcement

Consulting with attorneys and immigration advocates, Mission Local has compiled a list of know-your-rights tips for people in San Francisco.

For protesters:

If you plan to participate in a protest, have a plan to contact legal assistance, such as the National Lawyers Guild’s S.F. Bay Area chapter.

You have the right to peacefully assemble and to record law enforcement officers in public spaces.

If stopped by law enforcement, you have the right to remain silent and don’t have to answer questions about your immigration status.

If you are stopped on the streets:

You must stay where you are until an officer tells you that you are free to go.

You don’t have to unlock your phone for any government officer who does not have a warrant.

For immigrants and their families:

When encountering law enforcement, you have the right to remain silent and are advised to refuse to answer questions about your birthplace, immigration status, or how you entered the country.

You have the right to refuse a search, and to prevent immigration enforcement agents from entering your home or workplace without a valid warrant signed by a judge.

You have the right to speak with a lawyer first and ask for interpretation services. Do not sign any document before talking to an attorney.

Keep the red card with you to assert your rights under the U.S. Constitution. These cards can also be used in various ways, including being slipped under your front door or being given directly to immigration enforcement offices to declare your rights to remain silent.

Save the number 415-200-1548 on your phone. This is the San Francisco Rapid Response network’s 24-hour hotline that connects detained immigrants and their families with legal aid and support.

Fill out an emergency preparedness plan in case you are arrested, such as the one offered by the San Francisco Immigrant Legal & Education Network. Make sure both you and your family member have your A-Number, full name, date of birth and country of origin. Make copies of your passport and immigration documents and ensure your family can access them.

Carry evidence that you have been in the United States for longer than two years to reduce the risk of being placed in a deportation process without the chance to argue your case.

Last night:

About 5,000 people attended an online mobilization call held by Bay Resistance on Wednesday evening to prepare for the arrival of federal agents in the Bay Area, according to organizers.

Speakers from labor groups, attorneys, and nonprofits called for peaceful protests, but also action. They gave attendees advice on to interact with federal agents, document detentions, and to inform a rapid response network if they saw immigration enforcement.

Organizers also urged participants to join an adopt-a-block program to observe areas where immigrant day laborers might congregate. Meanwhile, hundreds of questions flooded in from attendees eager to participate.

Emily Lee of the Bay Rising Alliance, who led the call, said organizers have learned from federal agents’ actions in other cities and that the group is prepared for the coming days.

She called for humor and joy in the coming actions that would start early Thursday morning, with a vigil on the road from the Alameda Coast Guard Island to San Francisco.

“We are not going to give them the spectacle they want,” she said.

The assertion came in response to a question from Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan of the Federal District Court in Washington. Judge Sooknanan was exploring the government’s position in a challenge brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, which claims the extraterritorial detention is illegal.

She asked if Kristi Noem, the secretary, could send immigration detainees to any U.S. military base around the world.

“I don’t see why not,” replied August E. Flentje, a senior Justice Department lawyer.

Judge Sooknanan is deciding whether to confer class action status on migrants held in homeland security custody at the U.S. base at Guantánamo Bay. The A.C.L.U. requested that status, arguing that the operation is illegal because the men are in a limbo between deportation and detention on U.S. soil, where they have greater rights.

Over the summer, the Trump administration also held eight men at a U.S. military base in Djibouti while it fought and defeated a court challenge over its plans to deport them to South Sudan.

The A.C.L.U. challenge accuses the current administration of housing small numbers of men at Guantánamo, rather then in U.S. facilities, as part of a messaging strategy “to frighten immigrants, deter future migration, induce self-deportation and coerce people in detention to give up claims against removal and accept deportation elsewhere.” It has called conditions inhumane, and the detainees’ access to legal counsel inadequate.

“The land is going to be next,” Trump said during a press conference after a roundtable with members of his administration.
During the press conference Thursday, Trump denied a Wall Street Journal report that the country flew Air Force B-1 bombers near Venezuela earlier in the day.
Some analysts have speculated that the Trump administration’s anti-narcotics efforts are actually a pretext for trying to oust President Nicolás Maduro, who Trump has called a “narco-terrorist”.
Democrats and even some of Trump’s strongest supporters have questioned the administration’s military strikes against Venezuela.","Donald Trump said on Thursday that his administration could soon expand its military attacks on alleged drug smugglers from Venezuela and also begin pursuing them on land.

Trump, who has faced questions over whether he has the legal authority to use lethal force against the people in boats from Venezuela, said during a press conference he was not sure whether the administration would seek approval from Congress to attack people from the South American country over land.

“The land is going to be next,” Trump said during a press conference after a roundtable with members of his administration. “And we may go to the Senate; we may go to the Congress and tell them about it, but I can’t imagine they’d have any problem with it.”

Trump and the US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, have justified the nine strikes in the Caribbean and Pacific side of South America, which have killed at least 37 people, by describing the alleged drug traffickers as terrorists.

“Just as al-Qaida waged war on our homeland, these cartels are waging war on our border and our people,” Hegseth posted on social media Wednesday, adding that “there will be no refuge or forgiveness – only justice”.

Francisco Miranda, a U.S. citizen born in California, was allegedly arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials outside his work in North Portland Oct. 2.

After threatening him with a dog and holding him at the Portland ICE facility for several hours, ICE officials drove Miranda back to his work with no explanation for his detainment.

On Monday, a representative from California and a Connecticut senator announced the joint congressional investigation of arrests of U.S. citizens by immigration officials since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term.

In a statement, U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, both Democrats, said, “President Trump has embraced the use of federal immigration agents to terrorize communities nationwide whose politics he disfavors, a campaign that has increasingly ensnared U.S. citizens.”

Garcia is a ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Blumenthal is a ranking member of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.

Their announcement of the “bicameral inquiry” came after an investigation by ProPublica found more than 170 American citizens have been detained by immigration officials this year.

Michael Fuller, a Portland attorney representing Miranda, said he spoke with Blumenthal about Miranda’s arrest on Monday.

Fuller said he hopes the inquiry reveals what sort of probable cause existed for Miranda’s “false arrest.”

The attorney said he has asked the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to explain probable cause for Miranda’s arrest, but the agency has not responded. As previously reported, Fuller sent a tort claim to DHS and U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem Oct. 6.

The tort demanded DHS produce documents that showed probable cause by Oct. 13.

‘What do you mean ‘overstay’?’

When ICE agents confronted Miranda in the parking lot outside his work around 6 a.m. Oct. 2, he immediately told them he was an American citizen and tried to show them his driver’s license, according to Fuller.

The federal agents then showed Miranda a photo of himself working on a fishing boat more than 10 years ago and asked, “Is this you?”

Miranda responded that it was him and restated that he was a citizen. The officers then said he was here on an “overstay,” suggesting he stayed in the U.S. beyond the time authorized by a visa.

In a video of the arrest, which Miranda filmed and his attorney shared with OPB, Miranda is heard saying, “What do you mean overstay? I don’t know what that is.”

Speaking with OPB on Wednesday, Fuller said, “I just hope to find out exactly – where did they get this information and why did they find it reliable enough to dispatch seven armed agents to come arrest and detain our client?”

Fuller said the only sort of explanation they’ve received for Miranda’s arrest came when ICE agents were driving him back to his work and told him sometimes the parents of people born outside the U.S. lie to their children about where they were born.

Miranda had a federally-approved Real ID, his attorney said, which is only available to citizens and legal residents.

In their own letter to Noem sent Monday, Blumenthal and Garcia also asked for documentation explaining the arrests of Miranda and other detained citizens.

The letter notes how the impacts of Trump’s escalation in immigration enforcement disproportionately impact certain communities, including the Portland area, and states the arrests coincide with “an alarming increase in racial profiling.”

After Miranda’s arrest, U.S. Rep. Janelle Bynum, the Democrat whose district includes Milwaukie, also called for an investigation into Miranda’s arrest.

“These ICE raids are reminiscent of the Fugitive Slave Act, when the U.S. Marshalls would hunt down and kidnap Black Americans,” Bynum said in a press release about the incident.

The Trump administration’s threats and harassment have spooked immigrant workers and businesses alike, and Los Angeles has at times felt like the epicenter of that tumult.","When Kent Wong died Oct. 8, labor and immigrant rights leaders across the country mourned the loss of a giant. For decades, Wong’s calm presence and iron will spurred significant advances in protections for immigrants and workers, especially those who were undocumented.

In Los Angeles, where the activist, organizer and educator was born and lived, the sense of grief among Wong’s friends and his longtime colleagues has been palpable. But the immigrant and labor movements also are wrestling with a different issue: What will happen to the myriad projects throughout California of which Wong was such a driving force?

“I worry about what the future’s going to be like without him,” said David Sickler, the former longtime regional director of the AFL-CIO, who was among the earliest organizers of immigrant labor in Los Angeles in the late 1980s and worked extensively with Wong on the issue over the ensuing years. Noting such Wong-led efforts as UCLA’s Dream Resource Center to support undocumented youth, Sickler added, “I am concerned for the many movements that he’s been a part of.”

By one friend’s count, Wong was actively involved in 14 different labor- and immigrant-related projects when he died at 69 from cardiopulmonary failure. Among his most recent achievements was guiding and supporting the 2023 creation of new labor research centers at five University of California campuses: UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Santa Cruz, UC Riverside and UC San Diego. Those join existing labor research facilities at UC Merced, UC Berkeley and Wong’s longtime professional home, the UCLA Labor Center.

“Those [new] centers are in their infancy,” Sickler said. “Without seasoned, guiding hands like Kent’s, they can stumble and fail, and universities can just get rid of them” — a concern that feels all too valid amid the Trump administration’s multipronged ongoing attack on university funding.

'Unwavering commitment to protecting and uplifting immigrant workers'

A fifth-generation Chinese American, Wong spent his career building a case for such initially unpopular ideas as protections for immigrant workers. He was a staff attorney for the Service Employees International Union, then led a seemingly endless series of initiatives — all of which had labor and immigration justice at their heart. (Disclosure: SEIU is a financial supporter of Capital & Main.)

Vice president of the California Federation of Teachers. Founder of the Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance. Board chair for the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy. And, for more than 30 years, director of the UCLA Labor Center and a lecturer at the university. (Disclosure: CFT is a financial supporter of Capital & Main.)

Wong’s tenure at UCLA’s labor center saw the expansion of staff from three members to 42. With the support of state Sen. Maria Elena Durazo (D-Los Angeles), a longtime colleague, Wong led an effort that secured $15 million in one-time state funding to establish a permanent home for the center in L.A.’s MacArthur Park neighborhood, within walking distance of nearly two-dozen labor union offices.

“At the heart of everything Kent did was his unwavering commitment to protecting and uplifting immigrant workers, whose struggles he understood deeply and whose dignity he fought to defend,” Durazo said in a statement upon Wong’s passing.

Wong’s father was a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge, his mother a psychiatric social worker. He graduated from the now-shuttered People’s College of Law, a four-year, unaccredited public interest law school in Los Angeles whose aim was to train legal advocates who would address inequities in the law and society.

Wong’s locus of activity was L.A., but his work took him all over California, across the country and around the world. Nearly 20 years ago, he spearheaded the process that led to the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor signing sister-city agreements with labor councils in both Shanghai and Beijing. These efforts led to the sharing of information and perspectives on labor standards, working conditions and multinational corporations that operated in both countries.

He was working on setting up a meeting of U.S. and Palestinian labor academics on many of the same issues earlier this summer. And in July, in the face of ICE and Homeland Security raids on workers and businesses in his home city, Wong facilitated a nonviolence training session for an estimated 1,400 people at the Los Angeles Convention Center.

'I'm helping to show you the moral pole'

Nonviolent resistance was at the heart of Wong’s work, but that concept is hardly as passive as the words might make it appear.

“To some people, nonviolence means doing a peaceful protest — but nonviolent resistance is a much more profound concept,” said Larry Frank, a longtime colleague of Wong’s at the UCLA Labor Center and a former deputy mayor of Los Angeles. “Nonviolent resistance means being able to create a moral force that publicly challenges what leadership is doing, and what is necessary in terms of resistance.”

Wong understood such principles well. He was mentored by the Rev. James Lawson Jr., a lion of the civil rights movement. For years, Wong and Lawson, who died in 2024, co-taught the course “Nonviolence and Social Movements” at UCLA.

Wong’s greatest professional gifts may prove the most difficult to replicate. Friends remembered him for his unique ability to quickly identify someone’s strengths and see where and how those might best be integrated into a specific labor or justice project.

“He’d spend a few minutes with somebody, and then his instincts would tell him what they’d be good at,” Sickler said. “He seemed to understand the talent they possessed — and whether they were genuine or not. He could read ‘phony’ pretty quick.”

Wong also maintained a respectful posture toward those who disagreed with him, a disarming and effective approach that feels increasingly rare in 2025. But Wong’s even demeanor was never to be mistaken for a lack of conviction.

“It wasn’t so much like, ‘We’re fighting on an issue and I’m going to craft a middle ground.’ That was not his vibe,” said Roxana Tynan, executive director emerita of the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy. “It was more like, ‘I’m helping to show you the moral pole here. You should come over here with me and my pals. It’s way more fun.’”

'A huge force in the movement'

Wong loved good food, and he and his wife, the community organizer and activist Jai Lee Wong, hosted friends for many a Chinese meal for which he hand-selected the ingredients from local markets and cooked everything himself. He was a jazz fan who’d go out of his way to find a good club on the road. He was a devoted husband and father. But he was fundamentally a person who felt called to a purpose that could, at times, be all encompassing.

“He was, for me, the most strategic thinker and strategic actor I’ve ever worked with,” Frank said. “He had put in this work to establish relationships with labor, but also with businesses, with management. All the pieces that made him so effective, he had built over many, many years, thoughtfully, strategically. And then he was able to move so many pieces of work forward in this town — a huge force in the movement.”

The movements for labor and social justice will continue, albeit in extremely challenging circumstances. The Trump administration’s threats and harassment have spooked immigrant workers and businesses alike, and Los Angeles has at times felt like the epicenter of that tumult.

Wong’s mass training session on nonviolent resistance in L.A. this summer, designed to instruct activists and organizers on how to effectively respond to such emergencies, was a direct response to the Trump-directed incursion into his city. It was the kind of cause that animated his life and work — and his absence from these battles, to which he constantly brought both resolve and respectfulness, is still difficult for colleagues to imagine.

Another group of recruits was dismissed after medical issues or failing the physical fitness requirements.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement is flush with cash for an aggressive recruiting campaign to fulfill Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda. But new recruits are reportedly failing physical fitness requirements and entering training programs before the agency performed background checks or finished a screening process.

ICE officials have discovered that some recruits failed drug testing or had disqualifying criminal backgrounds while they were already enrolled in training, according to NBC News.

Since the beginning of a summer hiring surge after the president approved $178 billion to expand the agency into one of the most expensive police agencies in the world, ICE has dismissed more than 200 new recruits while they were in training for falling short of requirements, according to agency data reviewed by NBC.

Most did not meet physical and academic standards — including failing open-book tests — while several were dismissed for their criminal backgrounds or over safety concerns that were flagged in background checks, the outlet reported.

At least one recruit at the agency’s training academy in Brunswick, Georgia, had been previously charged with strong-arm robbery and battery stemming from a domestic violence incident, according to a Homeland Security official speaking to NBC.

Several recruits also had not submitted fingerprints or gone through any background checks at all before entering the six-week training course, officials said.

Homeland Security deputy secretary Tricia McLaughlin claimed that a majority of new recruits are former law enforcement officers who go through a different hiring process; per ICE policy, applicants are required to pass drug tests and undergo a security check before they enter training.

McLaughlin said the figures in NBC’s report are “not accurate” and “reflect a subset of candidates in initial basic academy classes.”

“The vast majority of new officers brought on during the hiring surge are experienced law enforcement officers who have already successfully completed a law enforcement academy,” she said. “This population is expected to account for greater than 85 percent of new hires. Prior-service hires follow streamlined validation but remain subject to medical, fitness, and background requirements.”

The Trump administration has aimed for hiring 10,000 ICE agents by next year, or roughly doubling its footprint, with a major boost to the agency’s Enforcement and Removal Operations division.

Critics have warned that hitting that 10,000 target — without adequate guardrails to screen future agents and know exactly who is filling those roles — the government could open the door to repeat past mistakes, as ICE faces intense legal scrutiny over allegations of abuse and illegal use of force as Trump surges federal officers into cities across the country.

“The loosening of hiring standards and training requirements is unacceptable and will likely result in increased officer misconduct — similar to or worse than what occurred during a small surge in hiring U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers in the early 2000s,” Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin wrote to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem this week.

“Exacerbating our concerns, DHS has gutted offices responsible for overseeing ICE officers and ensuring accountability for use-of-force incidents,” he added. “Given these developments, greater congressional oversight of ICE’s hiring is essential.”

To boost recruitment, Homeland Security offered a “maximum $50,000 signing bonus” and student loan forgiveness. DHS also dropped age limit requirements, allowing people as young as 18 years old to apply and opening ICE to recruits older than 40 years old.

The training period at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Georgia shrunk from 13 weeks to eight — and then six.

Recruits must also pass a physical fitness test, including running 1.5 miles under 14 minutes and 25 seconds.

But dozens of new recruits were sent packing because they couldn’t pass a legal exam, in which officers are allowed to use their books and notes for a test on the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Fourth Amendment.

Another group of recruits was dismissed after medical issues or failing the physical fitness requirements. “It’s pathetic,” one career ICE official told The Atlantic.

The federal government has been struggling to enroll physically fit personnel to join the ranks since even before Trump, with military branches also regularly failing to meet recruiting goals.

One Pentagon study found that more than three-quarters of Americans between the ages of 17 and 24 were ineligible for service because they were overweight, unable to pass an aptitude test, afflicted by physical or mental health issues, or ruled out by a criminal record.","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/10/23/15/13/ICE-Detains-Immigrants-Inside-New-York-City-Courthouses-ocas0cn5.jpeg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-10-23 21:01:20.997564

From Los Angeles to Chicago, Portlandand New York, the evidence is ample enough that wherever Trump sends in the immigration agency, people get hurt. And not just protesters and immigrants.

That includes 13 police officers tear-gassed in Chicago earlier this month. And, now, a U.S. marshal.

Which brings us to what happened in South L.A. on Tuesday.

Federal agents boxed in the Toyota Camry of local TikToker Carlitos Ricardo Parias — better known to his hundreds of thousands of followers as Richard LA. As Parias allegedly tried to rev his way out of the trap, an ICE agent opened fire. One bullet hit the 44-year-old Mexican immigrant — and another ricocheted into the hand of a deputy U.S. marshal.

Neither suffered life-threatening injuries, but it’s easy to imagine that things could have easily turned out worse. Such is the chaos that Trump has caused by unleashing shock troops into U.S. cities.

Rather than take responsibility and apologize for an incident that could’ve easily been lethal, Team Trump went into their default spin mode of blaming everyone but themselves.

Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the shooting was “the consequences of conduct and rhetoric by sanctuary politicians and activists who urge illegal aliens to resist arrest.”

Acting U.S. Atty. Bill Essayli chimed in on social media soon after: “I urge California public officials to moderate their rhetoric toward federal law enforcement. Encouraging resistance to federal agents can lead to deadly consequences.” Hours later, he called Times reporter James Queally “an absolute joke, not a journalist” because my colleague noted it’s standard practice by most American law enforcement agencies to not shoot at moving vehicles. One reason is that it increases the chance of so-called friendly fire.

Federal authorities accuse Parias of ramming his car into agents’ vehicles after they boxed him in. He is being charged with assault on a federal officer.

Time, and hopefully, evidence, will show what happened — and very important, what led to what happened.

The Trump administration keeps claiming that the public anger against its immigration actions is making the job more dangerous for la migra and their sister agencies. McLaughlin and her boss, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, keep saying there’s been a 1,000% increase in assaults on immigration agents this year like an incantation. Instead of offering concrete figures, they use the supposed stat as a shield against allegations ICE tactics are going too far and as a weapon to excuse the very brutality ICE claims it doesn’t practice.

Well, even if what they say is true, there’s only one side that’s making the job more dangerous for la migra and others during raids:

La migra.

It turns out that if you send in phalanxes of largely masked federal agents to bully and intimidate people in American cities, Americans tend not to take kindly to it.

Who knew?

We’re about to enter the sixth month of Trump’s plan to rid the country of undocumented immigrants. Sycophants are bragging that he’s doing the job, but they’re not caring to look at the mess left in its wake that’s becoming more and more perilous for everyone involved. They insist that those who are executing and planning raids are professionals, but professionals don’t make constant pendejos out of themselves.

Professionals don’t bring squadrons to chase after tamale ladies or day laborers, or stage flashy raids of apartments and parks that accomplish little else than footage for propaganda videos. They don’t go into neighborhoods with intimidation on their mind and ready to rough up anyone who gets in their way.

A ProPublica investigation showed that ICE has detained at least 170 U.S. citizens this year, many whom offered proof that they were in this country legally as la migra cuffed them and hauled them off to detention centers.

Professionals don’t lie like there’s a bonus attached to it — but that’s what Trump’s deportation Leviathan keeps doing. In September, McLaughlin put out a news release arguing that the shooting death of 38-year-old Silverio Villegas González in Chicago by an ICE agent was justified because he was dragged a “significant distance” and suffered serious injuries. Yet body cam footage of local police who showed up to the scene captured the two ICE agents involved in the incident describing their injuries as “nothing major.”

Closer to home, a federal jury in Los Angeles last month acquitted an activist of striking a Border Patrol agent after federal public defender Cuauhtémoc Ortega screened footage that contradicted the government’s case and poked holes in the testimony of Border Patrol staff and supervisors. Last week, ICE agents detained Oxnard activist Leonardo Martinez after a collision between their Jeep and his truck. McLaughlin initially blamed the incident on an “agitator group ... engaged in recording and verbal harassment,” but footage first published by L.A. Taco showed that la migra trailed Martinez and then crashed into him twice — not the other way around.

Professionals don’t host social media accounts that regularly spew memes that paint the picture of an American homeland where white makes right and everyone else must be eliminated, like the Department of Homeland Security does. A recent post featured medieval knights wearing chain mail and helmets and wielding longswords as they encircle the slogan “The Enemies are at the Gates” above ICE’s job listing website.

The Trump administration has normalized racism and has turned cruelty into a virtue — then its mouthpieces gasp in mock horror when people resist its officially sanctioned jackbootery.

This evil buffoonery comes straight from a president who reacted to the millions of Americans who protested this weekend at No Kings rallies by posting on social media an AI-generated video of him wearing a crown and dropping feces on his critics from a jet fighter. And yet McLaughlin, Noem and other Trump bobbleheads have the gall to question why politicians decry la migra while regular people follow and film them during raids when not shouting obscenities and taunts at them?

As I’ve written before, there’s never a nice way to conduct an immigration raid but there’s always a better way. Or at least a way that’s not dripping with malevolence.

Meanwhile, ICE is currently on a hiring spree thanks to Trump’s Bloated Beastly Bill and and has cut its training program from six months to 48 days, according to The Atlantic. It’s a desperate and potentially reckless recruitment drive.

And if you think rapidly piling more people into a clown car is going to produce less clown-like behavior by ICE on the streets of American cities, boy do I have news for you.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/11b73f0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8256x4334+0+585/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F66%2F67%2F5ed35c45442fb42a524b3260fc73%2Fgettyimages-2240700506.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 19:01:32.466983

“Swapping out Illinois license plates on Illinois licensed vehicles is illegal,"" Giannoulias said in a video posted to YouTube. ""And as Secretary of State, I have zero tolerance for these types of illegal activities.""

“No one, including federal agents, is above the law, and we intend to hold them accountable, especially while driving on our roadways,"" Giannoulias said in a release containing the video. This is a matter of public safety and protecting the wellbeing of our communities.”

Giannoulias' message begins by showing a video that recently circulated on social media that appeared to show an ICE agent standing near a vehicle, saying ""you can record all you want. We change the plates out everyday.""

He went on to say that his office was investigating the allegations and launching a public, ""Plate Watch Hotline"" for people to report such activity. To make a report, residents can call the Secretary of State’s Plate Watch Hotline at (312) 814-1730 or email platewatch@ilsos.gov, Giannoulias said.

According to Giannoulias' office, state law says penalties for displaying a plate on a vehicle for which it was not authorized for use, or obscuring or modifying license plates in any way, include fines and potential jail time.

""In addition, the Secretary of State’s office has the authority to suspend or revoke the vehicle’s license plates in such instances,"" the release said.

JB Pritzker launching commission on Trump's immigration raids - Chicago Tribune,Olivia Olander,,,,,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/10/23/illinois-accountability-commission-immigration-raids/,"Now, in a move that could bolster both his public messaging and the state’s legal efforts to fight the Trump administration, Gov.
Pritzker has repeatedly acknowledged that Illinois, like other states, has few direct tools to counter federal actions beyond litigation and public accountability efforts.
While the panel will be empowered to recommend steps to hold the federal government accountable, Pritzker acknowledged it will have no subpoena power.
The panel will hold hearings and gather testimony from local officials, legal experts, faith leaders and journalists, with an initial report expected in January, according to the governor’s office.
The videos also have helped other state officials, activists and journalists keep track of federal officials’ actions in neighborhoods, even as the agents themselves remain largely masked and anonymous.","For weeks, Chicagoans and suburbanites have recorded masked federal agents pursuing people down streets, detaining them, and loading them into unmarked cars — scenes that have at times descended into chaos amid President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration.

Now, in a move that could bolster both his public messaging and the state’s legal efforts to fight the Trump administration, Gov. JB Pritzker is seeking to channel those videos, testimonials and any allegations of misconduct into a centralized record overseen by a new “accountability commission.” The panel, he said, will track and scrutinize the administration’s actions with an eye toward future efforts to hold federal officials and employees accountable.

Announced Thursday in an executive order establishing the commission, the move follows weeks of resistance from Democratic-led states that have sought to challenge the Trump administration’s law enforcement crackdowns largely through the courts. Pritzker has repeatedly acknowledged that Illinois, like other states, has few direct tools to counter federal actions beyond litigation and public accountability efforts.

Hamstrung by the state’s limited authority to restrict federal immigration agencies, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol, Pritzker said the commission will serve as a means of collecting and preserving evidence — material that could be used by a future Congress, presidential administration or in potential legal proceedings. While the panel will be empowered to recommend steps to hold the federal government accountable, Pritzker acknowledged it will have no subpoena power. It has no direct law enforcement authority.

The commission may, in the end, function as much as a public forum as a means for legal action, amplifying awareness of federal agents’ conduct as it documents possible abuses.

The panel will hold hearings and gather testimony from local officials, legal experts, faith leaders and journalists, with an initial report expected in January, according to the governor’s office.

“We have a duty to ensure that the truth is preserved, so the public can know what their elected and appointed officials have done, and so the courts and the Congress can eventually hold people accountable,” Pritzker said. “Donald Trump is counting on your silence. We are counting on your courage.”

Since the latest wave of federal immigration enforcement began in early September, local officials have said they are exploring a range of options to push back against what they describe as the Trump administration’s increasingly aggressive tactics in Chicago and the suburbs.

Pritzker’s executive order also comes as former Mayor Lori Lightfoot separately said this week that she and a group of attorneys were working to establish a nonprofit organization to serve as a “centralized archive” of alleged misconduct by ICE and Border Patrol agents, according to Fox 32. It’s unclear if the two efforts would work together. Pritzker and Lightfoot had a sometimes-tense relationship while she was mayor.

Though it’s not clear how strong the teeth of the new commission will be, its creation is the next step for Pritzker after he has asked Illinoisans, even before “Operation Midway Blitz” launched on Sept. 8, to record and share ICE and Border Patrol activity. In late August, during a news conference along the Chicago River with elected leaders across Chicago and the state, Pritzker issued a warning “to Trump administration officials who are complicit in this scheme, to the public servants who have forsaken their oath to the Constitution to serve the petty whims of an arrogant little man, to any federal official who would come to Chicago and try to incite my people into violence as a pretext for something darker and more dangerous: We are watching and we are taking names.”

Some videos people have taken were used in announcing Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul’s office’s case that obtained a federal judge’s temporary restraining order holding off the Trump administration from commanding National Guard troops onto city and suburban streets. The videos also have helped other state officials, activists and journalists keep track of federal officials’ actions in neighborhoods, even as the agents themselves remain largely masked and anonymous.

Pritzker’s order appears to centralize that information at the state level. The federal Department of Homeland Security, for its part, has discouraged journalists and others from sharing videos of federal agents, saying ICE and Border Patrol agents have been subjected to physical threats, which it says have increased by “one thousand percent.”

The commission is expected to be chaired by former federal judge Rubén Castillo, a former assistant U.S. attorney in Chicago who also served as a director and regional counsel for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the Latino civil rights and advocacy group known as MALDEF. He represented the group in redistricting cases that led to the creation of the first Hispanic-majority congressional district in Illinois and to an increase in the number of Latino-majority aldermanic and state legislative districts.

Pritzker announced his appointments to six of the nine expected seats on the new board. In addition to Castillo, Pritzker named former judge and federal prosecutor Patricia Brown Holmes, who is expected to serve as vice chair. The commission is set to last for a year but could be extended, according to the executive order.

A Homeland Security spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Illinois House Republican Leader Tony McCombie, in a statement, called the commission “another taxpayer-funded political stunt.”

The Trump administration is now heading into the eighth week of “Operation Midway Blitz,” during which at least 1,500 arrests have been made, the Department of Homeland Security has reported. The sight of ICE and Border Patrol has become common throughout Chicago and the suburbs, as agents have repeatedly detained people first and sought information about them later, without immediate regard for citizenship or legal status.

DHS has said it’s going after the “worst of the worst,” or individuals who both lack legal status and have committed violent crimes, and it has provided several examples of people arrested in the past two months that it says fit that description. But other studies have shown that many people arrested and detained as part of nationwide sweeps have been American citizens or had no criminal record.

The department has not released comprehensive lists of detainees widely.

Pritzker’s order follows Wednesday’s legal win for the state in its ongoing fight against allowing National Guard troops to be part of the crackdown: A federal judge in Chicago indefinitely extended her restraining order barring Trump from deploying the troops to Illinois as both sides await a U.S. Supreme Court ruling.

Other legal efforts against the Trump administration’s actions have come from outside the state government. In a separate lawsuit, a federal judge ruled earlier this month that federal agents violated the rights of news reporters and protesters who were responding to immigration arrests in Chicago and restricted some of the agents’ future actions.

Mary Meg McCarthy, executive director of the National Immigrant Justice Center and another expected member of the board, on Thursday drew a comparison to a 1991 report about the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet in Chile, which she said she had lived under in the 1980s.

“This report became a critical resource as Chileans worked to reestablish democratic and human rights norms,” she said. When she returned to the U.S., she added, “I never, never imagined that one day, I would be living through a similar authoritarian regime. But here we are.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ctc-l-pritzker-economic-club-04_244976626-e1761252007700.jpg?w=1024&h=719,N,,2025-10-23 19:01:00.404725

Pritzker told CBS News, in an exclusive interview, the state is documenting ""unlawful attacks"" by ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers under Operation Midway Blitz.

""They are attacking people on the ground — ICE, CBP — going after people just because they're Brown or Black,"" Pritzker said. ""No one above them is holding them responsible.

He described reports of Black Hawk helicopters, military-style weapons, and the mass detention of civilians, including children being zip-tied.

""There are people who just don't believe it until they see it,"" he said. ""We've seen pastors hit with pepper balls while praying outside ICE facilities. Peaceful protesters tackled or shot with tear gas and rubber bullets for exercising their First Amendment rights. ... That's why we're telling everyone: record it, document it, send it in.""

In his interview with CBS News, Pritzker detailed the timeline on these accountability efforts.

""We are taking those cases to court, and again we are winning. So we're taking action now. I don't want to make it seem like nothing is happening,"" he said.

The governor said they're taking cases to court now, but other actions could take years, when there's a change in administration at the White House.

""Someone's got to hold them accountable, and whether it's the courts now or the elected officials later, we've got to make sure we have a record to show,"" he said.

Pritzker said a report will be issued this January related to the work of the commission. They've created a website people can use to track this work and to report activity at ilac.illinois.gov.

Asked about this week's federal court decision blocking the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago, Pritzker praised the ruling but voiced concern about what may come next.

""The courts have done a very good job stopping the worst offenses, but I'm disturbed that the Supreme Court might allow federalized National Guard troops when there is no insurrection, no rebellion,"" he said.

Pritzker said he welcomes help from the FBI, DEA, and ATF to combat illegal guns and drugs, but rejected any military-style presence.

When asked what he'd say directly to CBP Chief of Patrol Bovino, who oversees the federal operation, Pritzker offered a pointed message: ""Follow the law. Follow your own protocols. Do right by the citizens of the United States who live here in Illinois. And, finally, pronounce the name of our state correctly. It's Illinois, not Illinoise.""

Bovino defends enforcement actions, claiming ""absolute chaos in the streets""

On Thursday, Bovino also talked with CBS News and pushed back on Pritzker's claims.

""Pritzker probably ought to set a hotline up for himself, for all the abuses that illegal aliens perpetrate on American citizens,"" Bovino said, accusing him and other Democratic leaders of spreading ""fake news"" about racial profiling. He denied that CBP agents have targeted neighborhoods by race or acted outside policy.

""We've arrested individuals from 30 non-Latino countries,"" he said. ""We go where the threat is.""

Bovino defended his agency's tactics, saying federal agents in Chicago have made nearly 2,700 arrests since Sept. 6 and used ""exemplary"" force amid what he called ""absolute chaos in the streets.""

""We've arrested a lot of very bad individuals: Latin Kings members, bona fide terrorists, and things like that,"" Bovino told CBS News.

Bovino said roughly 70% of arrests nationwide involve people with ""criminal or immigration history,"" though he declined to provide specific figures for Chicago, when pressed repeatedly. Earlier this month, CBS News Chicago dug into the data behind the arrests, and found some of the numbers reflected people arrested outside of Illinois.

Bovino also defended agents seen deploying tear gas and pepper balls at protesters outside the Broadview detention facility, despite a federal court order restricting chemical agents.

""The use of force I've seen has been exemplary, the least amount necessary to accomplish the mission,"" he said. ""Those protesters were trespassing and had been given multiple warnings. That was absolutely in line with policy.""

Bovino dismissed concerns that agents fired from elevated positions or above the waist, insisting, ""It doesn't matter where you fire from. That's not a violation of policy.""

Asked if any agents had been disciplined for excessive force, Bovino said, ""To my knowledge, no.""

He also defended the possible deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago, saying they would guard federal facilities, not patrol city streets.

""That was fake news,"" he said. ""It was never the intention for National Guard to be on the streets.""

Bovino described Chicago as a ""model"" for nationwide immigration enforcement and said CBP's mission will continue until ""we arrest them all or they self-deport.""

""We're here to protect taxpayers from violence and crimes by illegal aliens,"" Bovino said. ""We've had enough, and we're not going anywhere.""
