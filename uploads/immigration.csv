The city of Hillsboro is continuing to crackdown on what some leaders call unconstitutional tactics by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

City Council is looking at options including:

A civil and human rights office

A city-owned ICE response page.

Putting barriers around schools.

The police chief said officers will respond to reported ICE activity, possibly with lights and sirens, if necessary.

“It's indicative of a potential crime that's about to occur. And so, there might be an emergency response. It could play out a number of ways. There could be an emergency response all the way there. That's sort of unlikely,” Hillsboro Police Chief Jim Coleman told City Council. “There could be an emergency response part of the way there or none at all.”

It comes days after City Council unanimously approved the Hillsboro resolution.

It mandates training for city employees to handle ICE interactions and somehow make signs distinguishing between public and private spaces to ensure ICE cannot enter private areas without a judicial warrant.

“That doesn't necessarily mean ICE is going to follow that rule,” Rahim Harji, deputy city manager warned.

“I think it's important to focus on, you know, not giving people a false sense of security,” Councilor Cristian Salgado pointed out as he referred to possible solutions.

All this is in response to an increase in reported ICE activity in Washington County, including the high-profile detainment of a Hillsboro man named Victor Cruz due to an apparent mistaken identity.

After nearly a month in ICE custody, Cruz was released from detainment following a judge's order.

An ICE spokesperson told KATU that they were looking for another Victor Cruz in the Pacific Northwest who has multiple DUIs on his record.

KATU asked ICE repeatedly about their reaction to the resolution and whether it will hinder their work, but KATU has not received a response.

Meanwhile, this is all part of a plan City Council wants to vote on, though it's unclear when that vote could happen.

Some think the city's effort is not enough.

“I keep hearing people say that they are doing everything they can. No, they are not doing everything they can. Have they pushed that boundary?” Poddar said.",https://katu.com/resources/media/ba21fc5d-70f7-40ad-b606-d9ffb56804d0-IMG_1121.jpeg,N,,2025-11-25 08:59:14.141859

A curated weekday guide to major news and developments over the last 24 hours. Here’s today’s news:

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR – INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

President Trump’s 28-point peace plan to end the war in Ukraine now has 19 points following negotiations in Geneva, according to a Ukrainian official. A source told ABC News that the updated peace agreement no longer includes a strict limit on the size of the Ukrainian army, nor does it include a provision granting amnesty for acts committed during the war. “As of now, after Geneva, there are fewer points, no longer 28, and a lot of the right things have been taken into account in this framework,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said yesterday. It remains unclear exactly what points were removed. David Brennan reports.

U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll is set to meet with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi today to discuss the latest version of the peace framework negotiated in recent days between U.S. and Ukrainian officials in Geneva, according to a senior U.S. official. Paul McLeary reports for POLITICO.

The Kremlin said yesterday that a European counter-proposal to the U.S. peace plan was not constructive and simply would not work for Russia. The European plan significantly altered the meaning and significance of key points on NATO and ceding territory, as outlined in Trump’s 28-point plan. Vladimir Soldatkin reports for Reuters.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

A Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv this morning killed at least six people and injured 13, according to Zelenskyy. In a video address released yesterday, Zelenskyy had urged Ukrainians to “be cognizant that Russia will not ease its pressure on us, on Ukraine, on our people.” People were still being evacuated from buildings at the time of writing. Cassandra Vinograd and Maria Varenikova report for the New York Times.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

Israeli forces yesterday killed three Palestinians in Gaza near the yellow line, which demarcates areas of Gaza still under Israeli control, according to Palestinian medics. The Israeli military said it fired after identifying “terrorists” crossing the yellow line and approaching its troops. Nidal Al-Mughrabi and Alexander Cornwell report for Reuters.

The U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation will officially close its operations in Gaza after suspending its work last month, according to GHF’s director and two Israeli sources. “We are winding down our operations as we have succeeded in our mission of showing there’s a better way to deliver aid to Gazans,” GHF Executive Director John Acree said in a statement. Tal Shalev and Eve Brennan report for CNN.

SUDANESE CIVIL WAR

“In response to international efforts, chiefly that of…. President Donald Trump…I announce a humanitarian ceasefire including a cessation of hostilities for three months,” Gen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, leader of the Sudanese Rapid Support Forces paramilitary, said yesterday. Dagalo’s statement appeared to announce a unilateral ceasefire a day after the commander-in-chief of the Sudanese Armed Forces rejected a ceasefire proposal by the U.S.-led mediators. Nafisa Eltahir and Khalid Abdelaziz report for Reuters.

Amnesty International said in a report published today that the atrocities committed by the RSF in El Fasher constitute war crimes and may also constitute other crimes under international law. Samy Magdy reports for AP News.

U.S. CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC OPERATIONS

Trump told his advisers that he is planning to speak directly with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, administration officials told Axios. The sources said Trump’s decision could be a sign that U.S. strikes or direct military intervention in Venezuela are not imminent. “Nobody is planning to go in and shoot [Maduro] or snatch him – at this point. I wouldn’t say never, but that’s not the plan right now,” according to one official. Marc Caputo reports.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Afghanistan’s Taliban government today accused Pakistan of launching overnight strikes, killing 9 children and one adult woman. Chief spokesperson for the Taliban, Zabihullah Mujahid, described the attacks as “atrocities”, adding that “at the appropriate time, [Afghanistan] will give the necessary response.” Pakistan’s military and government did not immediately comment on the allegation. Abdul Qahar Afghan and Munir Ahmed report for AP News.

The U.N. World Food Programme announced today that nearly 35 million people in Nigeria could go hungry in 2026, adding that a surge in militant attacks and instability in northern Nigeria is driving hunger to record levels. The WFP also warned that it will run out of funds for emergency food and nutrition aid by December as a result of funding cuts. Elisah Bala-Gbogbo reports for Reuters.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

Trump yesterday signed an executive order launching “the Genesis Mission,” a new federal effort to “unleash a new age of AI-accelerated innovation and discovery.” The Genesis Mission will “dramatically accelerate scientific discovery, strengthen national security, secure energy dominance, enhance workforce productivity, and multiply the return on taxpayer investment into research and development.” The order describes the Genesis Mission as “comparable in urgency and ambition to the Manhattan Project.” Jared Perlo reports for NBC News.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

Following a call yesterday with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump said on social media that he accepted an invitation to visit Xi in Beijing in April. Chinese state media said that Xi had called Trump to maintain the positive momentum in their relationship since they met in South Korea last month. They are said to have discussed Ukraine, Taiwan, fentanyl and soybeans. Ana Swanson and Alan Rappeport report for the New York Times.

Trump yesterday signed an executive order that begins the process of designating certain chapters of the Muslim Brotherhood as “Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists,” particularly those in Jordan, Lebanon and Egypt. Alec Dent reports for the Washington Post.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

The Homeland Security Department announced yesterday that it is terminating the Temporary Protected Status designation for Myanmar, finding that it is no longer needed because it is safe for citizens to return. The status will expire for the roughly 4,000 Myanmar nationals under this protection on Jan. 26. Simon Lewis reports for Reuters.

The Trump administration has ordered a broad review of all 233,000 refugees who entered the United States under the Biden administration, according to an internal government memo signed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joe Edlow and seen by Reuters. The memo says that USCIS will terminate the refugee status of people already in the United States if they are found not to meet refugee criteria, claiming that the Biden administration potentially prioritized expediency and quantity over quality interviews and detailed screening. It also orders a halt to all processing of applications for permanent residence for refugees who entered under Biden. Ted Hesson and Kristina Cooke report.

The Justice Department has changed its position and will no longer try to stop Democratic-led states from using federal grant money to provide legal help to undocumented immigrant victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. 19 states and the District of Columbia yesterday agreed to drop a lawsuit filed last month over the new grant conditions. Nate Raymond reports for Reuters.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

A federal judge yesterday dismissed separate criminal charges against the former FBI director James B. Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, ruling that Lindsey Halligan had been unlawfully appointed as Interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia and therefore had no lawful authority to present the indictments. The cases were dismissed without prejudice, meaning the Trump administration could potentially re-file the charges under a properly appointed prosecutor. Attorney General Pam Bondi said yesterday that she will “take all available legal action, including an immediate appeal,” adding “Lindsey Halligan is an excellent U.S. attorney and shame on them for not wanting her in office.” Alan Feuer and Devlin Barrett report for the New York Times; Rebecca Falconer reports for Axios.

Attorney General Pam Bondi yesterday asked the Manhattan federal court to release sealed materials related to the grand jury investigation of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. The Justice Department made this same request over the summer, but it was refused on grand jury secrecy grounds. In the new request, Bondi said the DOJ interprets the new Epstein Files Transparency Act “as requiring [the court] to publish the grand jury and discovery materials.” Benjamin Weiser reports for the New York Times.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

The Pentagon announced yesterday that it is investigating Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ), a former Navy pilot, over possible breaches of military law after Kelly appeared in a video calling for troops to defy illegal orders. The Pentagon’s statement said Kelly may be recalled to active duty for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures, citing a federal law that allows for the recall of retired service members. Konstantin Toropin and Ben Finley report for AP News.

An Agonizing Choice Many parents, most of whom entered the United States during the Biden administration, told The Times that they were offered the choice to be deported with their children.
Tracking Down Children From Venezuela More than 17,000 Venezuelans, largely men, have been deported to Venezuela this year, according to Venezuelan officials.","The 11-year-old from Venezuela was alone in his Texas home, waiting for his mother, who had been detained by U.S. immigration officials. She would never come back.

The boy, Emmanuel Leandro Caicedo Venecia, ended up living by himself for three months this summer, attending school, even walking to his fifth-grade graduation to collect his diploma, his mother said. A neighbor brought food, but Emmanuel mostly fended for himself.

His mother had decided it had to be this way. Afraid that her son would be placed in foster care, she had made a choice while in detention: She lied to immigration officials, she said, telling them that Emmanuel was being taken care of by an adult. She was deported to Venezuela without him in late July, with Emmanuel eventually moving in with an acquaintance.

“I just keep hoping he’s reunited with me,” his mother, Deisy Carolina Venecia Farías, said earlier this year.

Venezuelan officials claim that 150 Venezuelan children, from newborns to teenagers, have wound up separated from their parents as President Trump’s deportation campaign has accelerated. Most of the children were born in Venezuela, and some in Colombia, but some of the youngest, including months-old babies, were born in the United States, complicating efforts to repatriate them.

While there is no tally kept by U.S. officials or advocacy groups, Venezuelan officials shared a list of children they said had been separated, and The New York Times interviewed the parents and relatives of more than a dozen children, corroborating their accounts with court documents, police records and immigration case files.

The Venezuelan government’s roster includes children whose parents were deported to Venezuela as well as children whose parents remain locked up in the United States.

In interviews, many of the parents said they had chosen to be deported without their children, a painful decision that they made to avoid months in detention. They hoped, they said, that returning to their homeland would expedite a reunion with their children.

Others asserted that they were pressured or misled by U.S. immigration officials into boarding deportation flights without their children, some of whom have ended up in foster care.

The Trump administration has said that it does not separate families, a divisive practice that roiled the president’s first term. During the summer, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency issued updated guidelines that require its officers to give immigrants who are in the United States illegally the choice to be deported with their children.

“ICE does not separate families,” the spokeswoman, Tricia McLaughlin, said. “Parents are asked if they want to be removed with their children, or ICE will place the children with a safe person the parent designates.”

While some families have been deported together, many mothers and fathers have been landing in Venezuela without their children, setting off a diplomatic scramble inside the Venezuelan government to track down and repatriate the children.

Other Latin American countries — including Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico — appear to be grappling with similar separations, sometimes involving U.S.-born children, according to media reports. But no country has been as vocal about the separations as Venezuela has.

The government of the country’s autocrat, Nicolás Maduro, has turned the separations into a national rallying cry against the United States amid rising tensions between both countries and a large American military buildup in the Caribbean.

Mr. Maduro’s own policies, including repression, economic mismanagement and human rights abuses, played the largest role in the migration crisis that pushed more than seven million people to leave Venezuela, according to a broad swath of political analysts and human rights groups. Now, he is attempting to cast himself as a champion for Venezuelans he claims have been mistreated by Mr. Trump.

Families clamoring for the return of their children have put almost all their hopes in Mr. Maduro. They have readily participated in government-led rallies in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, and recorded heartfelt videos shared on social media. In August, many families signed a letter to Melania Trump, the first lady, asking her “to listen to the cries of families.”

“My girls call me asking when I’m going to pick them up,” Anabel Bustamante, 26, who has been separated from her 3- and 7-year-old daughters for nine months, said in an interview.

“They asked recently if they could sneak into a box and be shipped to Venezuela,” said Ms. Bustamante, whose daughters, Diangerlin and Aranza, are living with their grandmother in Arkansas.

Ms. Bustamante hasn’t seen the girls since February, when police officers showed up at her house on a sleepy street in Arkansas, where the family lived after migrating to the United States two years ago. They charged her with nonfinancial identity fraud, according to police records, which she surmised was related to her work as a delivery driver without papers.

Ms. Bustamante was jailed and transferred to a detention center in Louisiana, where she said federal officials asked her to sign a document if she wanted to be deported with her daughters. She declined to sign it, she said, out of fear that ICE officers would detain her sister and mother if they went to retrieve her daughters.

In July, she was deported, leaving her daughters behind.

An Agonizing Choice

Many parents, most of whom entered the United States during the Biden administration, told The Times that they were offered the choice to be deported with their children.

Some of them regarded that as an agonizing pressure tactic: If they wanted to be deported with their children, some said ICE told them that they would have to spend as long as a year in detention while U.S. officials retrieved their children and made travel arrangements.

Jaimary José Cárdenas Paz said that she was urged by ICE and a social worker to deport without her 9-year-old, José Daniel Urdaneta Cárdenas, after ICE agents detained her with her partner outside an immigration courthouse in Boston on May 7.

On May 19, while Ms. Cárdenas, who had entered the United States in 2024, was in detention, an ICE officer interviewed her. She told the officer, “What I want is to get out of here and go back to my country with my son,” according to a transcript.

But she said that officials later told her that José Daniel, who was staying with his aunt in Massachusetts, “could have a better future in the United States,” and perhaps even be granted U.S. citizenship in the future.

She said officials told her that she would remain in ICE custody for six to nine months if she wanted to be deported with her son. She chose to leave without José Daniel, on July 11.

Ms. McLaughlin, the D.H.S. spokeswoman, said Ms. Cárdenas “chose to be removed by herself and asked her son be placed in the care of his aunt.” Her son was deported to Venezuela two months later, in September.

A few said that they were never offered a choice or were given misleading guidance, with one mother saying that she boarded a plane with the impression that her son would be on the flight, but wasn’t.

María Alejandra Rubio González said that she repeatedly asked immigration officials to be deported to Venezuela with her 8-year-old son, Anyerson, who stayed with a friend in the Atlanta suburbs after she was arrested on March 15. She was charged with driving under the influence and without a license by local officials, police records show.

“They told me, ‘OK, we’re aware. Don’t worry, you’ll be deported with your son,’” she recalled. When officers tried to place her on a deportation flight, she said she refused to board because she didn’t see her son on the plane.

“I cried and I cried, and I didn’t get on,” she said. “They tricked me.”

Ms. Rubio González was ultimately deported without Anyerson on July 23, along with more than 200 other Venezuelans, including four mothers who also left without their children, she said.

Ms. McLaughlin said Ms. Rubio González “chose not to file an appeal” after she was ordered deported by a judge and “relinquished custody of her son to a friend.” The mother was reunited with her son more than six months later, after the friend handed over Anyerson to ICE and the Venezuelan government facilitated his return on Sept. 17.

Tracking Down Children From Venezuela

More than 17,000 Venezuelans, largely men, have been deported to Venezuela this year, according to Venezuelan officials.

Along the way, Venezuelan leaders say, 150 children younger than 18 have been split up from their parents, after the adults were detained or deported.

Fifty-seven of those children have slowly been reunited with their families in Venezuela. They were placed on deportations flights following negotiations between the Venezuelan and U.S. governments.

Venezuelan officials have shared lists of children they want back with the U.S. State Department, which has forwarded that information to ICE. The diplomatic channels appeared to have deteriorated since the United States began striking suspected drug-smuggling boats off Venezuela’s coast, even as deportation flights continue

Officials in Venezuela have described the separations in stark terms, broadly accusing the Trump administration of “kidnapping” the children.

Cases reviewed by The Times show that many parents landed in ICE custody after being picked up by immigration officials — leaving immigration court or at a traffic checkpoint — or after having run-ins with the law, according to police records.

In Georgia and Texas, states in which local law enforcement officials regularly cooperate with ICE, some parents were pulled over by police and jailed for traffic violations, such as driving without a license, before being transferred to ICE custody.

“Just like American citizens who commit crimes may face separation from their family, so, too, can illegal aliens,” Ms. McLaughlin said.

‘Let It Be Mine’

During the past few months, anxious families flocked to Simón Bolívar International Airport, outside Caracas, propelled by the hope that flights from the United States would include a clutch of children who had been separated from their parents.

Mothers pray under their breath.

“Que sea el mío, Dios mío, que sea el mío.”

“Let it be mine, my God, let it be mine.”

One morning in September, a group of mothers crumpled to the floor upon learning that their children were not on the flight they had been waiting for. Their cries and pleas pierced the airport terminal.

But the agony has also given way to scenes of joy.

After nearly seven months apart, the mother of Emmanuel, the 11-year-old who lived alone for three months, arrived at the airport after being told that her son was coming home on Nov. 7.

The mother, Ms. Venecia Farías, 35, hadn’t seen him since she was detained by Border Patrol officers on April 21, along with her husband, while they were driving to their home near the U.S.-Mexico border, in Brownsville, Texas.

Ms. McLaughlin argued that she was detained by Border Patrol trying to “illegally re-enter the country” after leaving the United States without her child. Ms. Venecia Farías said that was false.

“That’s crazy,” she said, insisting that she never left the United States and was arrested after taking a wrong turn on her way home, driving into one of many Border Patrol checkpoints near the border.

She recounted the challenges that she originally faced to make it to the United States, including thousands of dollars paid to smugglers and a brief kidnapping in Mexico. “You think I was going to leave the United States? To Mexico?”

After his mother was detained, Emmanuel spent most of the summer living alone. He slept on a mattress on the floor and administered a nebulizer to treat chronic asthma, his mother said. He eventually moved in with an acquaintance in Texas, who charged his mother $400 a week to cover the boy’s expenses.

The sum was so large that Ms. Venecia Farías had to crowdsource money to pay the cost from Venezuela. Emmanuel, approaching adolescence, had grown more irritable. And asthma attacks always loomed.

All the worrying would come to an end.

Earlier this month, Emmanuel disembarked from a plane and spotted his mother among a throng of families. He hurried, brushing past the crowd as his mother spread her arms.

He leaped, so hard that they both fell onto a sofa, weeping and locked in a tight embrace.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ORDER TO RE-VET ALL REFUGEES IS SHAMEFUL MOVE TO BULLY THE MOST VULNERABLE

IRAP strongly condemns latest attempt to de-legalize migrants by threatening their status

(NEW YORK, NY)— Tonight, Reuters reported on a memo from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) ordering the agency to re-vet and re-interview all refugees who entered the United States during the Biden administration. According to the report, the memo also orders a halt to all processing of applications for permanent residence these refugees have filed. TheInternational Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) strongly condemns this latest attempt to target and de-legalize migrants by threatening their status.

The following is a statement from Sharif Aly, President of the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP):

“Trump campaigned on a promise to target immigrants. This order is one more in a long line of efforts to bully some of the most vulnerable members of our communities, by threatening their lawful status, rendering them vulnerable to the egregious conduct of immigration enforcement agencies, and putting them through an onerous and potentially re-traumatizing process.

Refugees who entered via the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program are already the most highly vetted immigrants in the United States. They have come here to find safety and stability after fleeing war, violence, and persecution – to threaten them like this is an insult not only to refugees but to all who have worked to maintain the integrity of this program for decades.

Besides the enormous cruelty of this undertaking, it would also be a tremendous waste of government resources to review and re-interview 200,000 people who have been living peacefully in our communities for years. Americans should be outraged that this administration is consistently targeting our friends and neighbors, just because of where they were born.”

Since then, federal agents have arrested undocumented immigrants on or near church properties, but incursions into sanctuaries and other buildings have not been reported.
In their action filed in January, the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship along with Sikh and Quaker groups were granted a temporary restraining prohibiting ICE raids on member properties.
An SBC spokesperson said neither Pressley nor the Executive Committee have been briefed about planned ICE raids, according to the report.
The presence of immigration agents during the holiday season would be harmful to faith communities even if the reported raids do not occur, according to the filing.","A coalition of religious groups has asked a federal court to prevent federal immigration agents from raiding houses of worship during the holiday season.

The plaintiffs in New England Synod, Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, et al., v. Department of Homeland Security, et al. filed the petition amid swirling rumors and news reports that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has plans to apprehend worshipers in Spanish-speaking and other congregations during Thanksgiving, Christmas and other holiday services in the coming weeks.

“If these reports are true, it is outrageous that the administration would so blatantly seek to undermine the freedom to worship freely as we enter an important time for many faiths,” said Skye Perryman, president of Democracy Forward, which serves as co-counsel in the action.

The possibility that raids could be carried out on church campuses and in sanctuaries creates even more urgency for the lawsuit on behalf of the Alliance of Baptists, American Baptist Churches in the USA, Metropolitan Community Churches and numerous Quaker and Evangelical Lutheran Church in America regions, Perryman said.

“The reports circulating this week are alarming and incompatible with our Constitution. We are taking swift action to ensure that the protections already recognized by the court are upheld and that faith communities can gather and worship, free from government coercion.”

The concern stems from the Trump administration’s January termination of longstanding federal prohibitions against immigration raids in sensitive locations such as churches, hospitals and schools. Since then, federal agents have arrested undocumented immigrants on or near church properties, but incursions into sanctuaries and other buildings have not been reported.

Yet multiple religious groups have filed lawsuits similar to this one seeking to bar ICE and other agencies from such actions.

In their action filed in January, the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship along with Sikh and Quaker groups were granted a temporary restraining prohibiting ICE raids on member properties. Fellowship Southwest, now known as FaithWorks, the Hispanic Baptist Convention and other groups were denied a restraining order in their separate lawsuit filed earlier this year.

Both social media and news accounts have been stoking fears that DHS plans to sweep through houses of worship during the holiday season. A WhatsAPP message warning of impending church raids in Atlanta sparked apprehension in that city, while reports of federal officials briefing Baptist, Catholic, Pentecostal and Jewish leaders of impending actions has raised concerns throughout New England.

“Two Hispanic pastors who lead Southern Baptist churches in New England say that SBC President Clint Pressley and its Executive Board received briefings on the plan and discussed it with Homeland Security Adviser Stephen Miller and White House Border Czar Tom Homan,” This Week in Worcester reported.

An SBC spokesperson said neither Pressley nor the Executive Committee have been briefed about planned ICE raids, according to the report.

A Hispanic Pentecostal pastor said his church had been visited several times by ICE and FBI agents, according to the publication, which cited unnamed DHS sources. “In all three conversations, agents asked questions about the names of specific congregation members, their home addresses and the frequency they attended church services.”

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin denied the agency is targeting churches, according to the National Catholic Reporter: “ICE does not raid churches — regardless of if it is holiday season or not. This is just another false narrative to try and demonize our brave ICE law enforcement who are facing a 1000% increase in assaults against them and a 8000% increase in death threats.”

However, the department vowed that no house of worship will be off limits thanks to President Donald Trump’s January directive opening health care, education and sacred spaces to enforcement actions: “Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America’s schools and churches to avoid arrest. The Trump administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement and instead trusts them to use common sense.”

But plaintiffs in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America lawsuit are taking no chances. The notice they filed Nov. 21 in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts cites continued immigration enforcement actions at or near member facilities, including the presence of masked and armed agents in church parking lots and apprehensions being made on or near church properties.

The presence of immigration agents during the holiday season would be harmful to faith communities even if the reported raids do not occur, according to the filing. “Plaintiffs respectfully request the court’s prompt intervention to prevent serious and irreparable harm to worshippers’ ability to practice their faith in community with others during a time of such vital religious significance.”",https://baptistnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/shutterstock_1144500824.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 07:56:31.199279

It looks like all the other office buildings on this commercial strip not far from the Mall at Prince George’s.

But it’s a place of life-changing decisions nonetheless. Some people come here and win appeals for asylum or an extension of their residency in the U.S. Others leave unsure of their future in the country.

“Have you seen ICE?” one man asked a passerby in Spanish on a recent day, hunched over a walker and clutching a folder of papers. He asked for help finding the right courtroom for his hearing, and he wanted to know if a man in a suit nearby was a lawyer. He said he didn’t have one.

It’s a common problem outside the Hyattsville court, where Capital News Service reporters have visited on multiple court days this fall, talking to people as they come and go.

Many of the respondents appear without lawyers. Many don’t feel comfortable speaking English.

Every day, respondents walk through the building’s sterile, white-washed hallways, where immigration policy meets the real life of Maryland residents. Thousands of people come through the Hyattsville Immigration Court every year. The backup of pending cases in this venue stood at around 21,000 during the fiscal year that ended in September, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.

During the same fiscal year, almost 8,000 new proceedings were filed in Maryland, slated for this court in Prince George’s County and its twin court in Baltimore, according to TRAC.

CNS reporters spoke with court observers who watch these cases play out on a regular basis.

“I think [immigrants are] very valuable in our culture and our economy. To me, they are most welcome, and certainly they’re making a huge economic contribution,” said Jim Bell, another court observer. “Them being here and them being in legal trouble bothers me a lot.”

Several weeks ago, Patricia Anne Murphy, a local resident who comes to observe court each week, saw one couple’s hearing was bumped from its original 8:30 a.m. start time. Murphy offered to get them food, but the husband responded by pointing to a sign stating that food and drinks aren’t permitted.

Murphy then offered to take them to lunch, but once again, she received a no. The pair was scared of ICE.

“His partner said, ‘We don’t dare go out, we’re afraid once we’re in here, we want to stay here until we’re done,’ ” Murphy said. “You know … talk about existential shocks of feeling this person’s fear.”

Daily proceedings

The day typically begins with sessions in the 8 o’clock hour.

The courtrooms occupy the sixth and seventh floors of the office building. The hearings are held in rooms the size of a high-school classroom, made court-like by a long wooden judge’s bench against the back wall.

The judges have years of experience in the legal system, many in immigration law, on both sides of the issue. Some have worked with the Department of Homeland Security, others have worked with immigrant rights organizations.

A respondent’s table sits directly before the translator to allow for clearer communication with non-English speakers. One by one, respondents are called to the table and asked a series of questions.

“Can you please state your name?” they’re asked. “Is this the language you best understand?”

During several weeks of observing the courtrooms, CNS reporters have witnessed different answers to the questions: “Si,” “Oui,” “Yes,” “I don’t understand.”

Before long, the questions shift.

“Do you understand that you’re in the United States without permission?” a judge asked one recent day. “Do you understand the consequences of what will happen if you don’t return to court?”

Their families sit on church-like pews, with children playing on the floor nearby.

Many respondents appear without legal representation. As of August in Maryland, that number is about 37% of respondents with pending cases and Maryland addresses, according to TRAC.

And in a time of shortage, some of the respondents may fall victim to lawyer scams.

“They hired quasi lawyers from other countries who claimed they were lawyers to help them fill out the asylum applications,” Bell said, of one story he heard at the Baltimore Immigration Court. “They had paid and trusted them to do it correctly. This didn’t happen.”

These quasi-lawyers are known as “notarios,” Bell said.

Families in the courtroom

But even within these stressful situations, there’s another emotion: joy. In one judge’s courtroom at the Hyattsville Immigration Court sits a large bin of stuffed animals, including a large shark with a zippered mouth.

Children, sitting with parents waiting to hear the date of their asylum hearings, dash over to the bin. One girl’s arm is swallowed by the shark as she runs over to her mother, pretending to be bitten by the shark. She’s joyous when a court employee tells her she can take a toy home.

In another courtroom, a pair of children play among the benches as their father’s hearing goes on. They giggle and crawl. At times, they appear to catch the judge’s attention, and their mother moves with haste to quiet them down.

They do not wear the same serious expressions as their parents, and, like passersby to the ordinary office building holding the court, they might not know or understand what happens here. For them, it is a new experience. New places to climb, new toys to take home.

What home will they take their new toys to? The homeland of their parents, or the home that they’ve lived in for much of their lives? It is here that those decisions are made.",https://thedailyrecord.com/files/2025/11/hyattsvile-court-2883-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 07:56:36.864287

The SSHD may then make a new, non-certified, decision refusing the human rights claim without the deportation order being affected.
(3) In neither case does the withdrawal of the decision have the effect of reinstating or resurrecting any leave to enter or remain which was invalidated by the deportation order.","If the Home Office seeks to deport a foreign criminal and certifies their human rights claim, but that foreign criminal successfully challenges the decision to deport (and to certify), what is the immigration status of the foreign criminal afterwards? The Upper Tribunal gives guidance on this question in MM, R (On the Application Of) v SSHD (effect of withdrawal section 94B) [2025] UKUT 385 (IAC).

Revival of leave?

The starting point is that the making of a deportation order cancels any permission, including settlement or indefinite leave to remain, that a person may have under s5(1) of the Immigration Act 1971.

The position since the Supreme Court’s decision in R (George) v SSHD [2014] UKSC 28 is that a successful appeal against a deportation order does not reinstate or ‘revive’ a foreign criminal’s previously held indefinite leave. Per current policy and practice, if you win your appeal on human rights grounds but have had your indefinite leave to remain cancelled, you are generally given renewable 30 month periods of permission to stay in the UK.

BUT: a deportation order made under s32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007 does not invalidate leave to enter or remain as long as s79(4) and s78 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 applies, i.e. while there is a pending appeal under section 82(1) of the 2002 Act, which has been brought when the appellant is in the UK.

Where a claim is certified under section 94B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 there is no in country right of appeal and so s79(4) and s78 do not apply.

The upshot of this is that some people who the Home Office attempts to deport keep their indefinite leave to remain after winning their appeals, others do not. It depends on the process that the Home Office followed when it made the decision to deport.

In the case of MM, the applicant attempted to challenge whether or not the Home Office took the correct path in his case.

The path not taken

MM arrived in the UK in 1984, and was granted indefinite leave to remain in 2003. He was convicted of various criminal offences, and received a sentence of imprisonment for 27 months in 2015 for burglary. The Home Office made a Stage 2 decision to deport on 20 June 2016, certifying his human rights claim under section 94B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. A deportation order under s32(5) UK Borders Act 2007 was signed on the same day.

In August 2018, following the Supreme Court judgment in R (Kiarie & Byndloss) v SSHD [2017] UKSC 42 (which challenged the lawfulness of s94B certification and out of country appeals), the Home Office withdrew the 2016 human rights claim refusal and the s94B certification and made a new decision, still refusing the human rights claim, but with an in-country right of appeal. MM exercised his in-country right of appeal, and eventually won.

However, since MM’s human rights claim had been certified under s94B so that he did not have a right of appeal exercisable from inside the UK, the protection in section 79(4) did not apply and the Home Office could therefore make a deportation order under section 32(5) which in turn invalidated his indefinite leave to remain. The Home Office therefore granted him 30 months leave in January 2023.

In his judicial review challenge to this decision, MM’s legal team argued that the Home Office should not have followed the course that they did and that (para 58)

… having withdrawn the section 94B certificate and the decision in [MM’s] human rights claim, the[y] ought at that point to have revoked the deportation decision or, if not, ought to have reinstated his ILR pending the outcome of the reconsideration of his human rights claim and pending his appeal against the refusal of his claim, restoring him to the position he would have been in if the section 94B certificate had not been made. Alternatively, that the applicant’s ILR automatically revived once the section 94B certificate was withdrawn.

The legal bases for the challenge are dealt with in some detail in the judgment (paras 47-81), but were ultimately rejected by Judge Kebede of the Upper Tribunal.

Of people booked into ICE custody this fiscal year (since October 1, 2025):

Nearly three in four (73 percent) had no criminal conviction.

Nearly half had no criminal conviction nor even any pending criminal charges.

Only 8 percent had a violent or property criminal conviction.

Only 5 percent had a violent criminal conviction.

A majority of criminal convicts had vice, immigration, or traffic convictions.

The appendix table at the end of this report provides the detailed breakdown of the data by detailed type of crime.

The earliest data I obtained that was reported in this way comes from April 26, 2025. Compared with October 2024 to April 2025—before the White House shifted focus completely away from criminals—80 percent of the increase in daily ICE book-ins have come from individuals without criminal convictions.

Since October 1, only 8 percent of detained persons had either a violent or property crime. As many people were detained with an immigration conviction (e.g., illegal entry/​reentry) as violent convicts.

In its posts on this subject, DHS and ICE often include people with pending criminal charges as “criminal arrests,” even though these people have never been found guilty, and the charges are often minor and regularly dismissed. ICE is depriving these people of due process by arresting them prior to a conviction. Nonetheless, ICE data show that nearly half (47 percent) of all ICE detainees this fiscal year

Other data sources support the conclusions from the number of ICE book-ins. The Deportation Data Project, which is run by UC Berkeley Law School in collaboration with the UCLA School of Law’s Center for Immigration Law and Policy, has obtained data on ICE arrests via the Freedom of Information Act. ICE arrests are individuals charged as removable by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, so it excludes people arrested by Border Patrol and referred to ICE for detention who are included in the data above.

This arrest dataset also does not disclose the type of crime committed. In any case, it similarly shows that by late July, 67 percent of ICE arrests were of people without criminal convictions. It also shows that by late July, nearly 40 percent of ICE arrests were of people without criminal convictions or criminal charges. This is a dramatic change from President Joseph Biden’s policies under which only one in 10 arrests were individuals without any criminal conviction or charge.

More important than the share of arrests is the absolute number of these arrests. Already by late July, ICE arrests of immigrants without criminal convictions had increased by 571 percent from the weekly average to start the calendar year. ICE arrests of immigrants without criminal convictions or criminal charges increased a staggering 1,500 percent since January 1.

Finally, the last data source comes from public data directly from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement website, showing that by mid-November, 69 percent of current ICE detainees who were arrested by ICE had no criminal conviction and 40 percent had no criminal charge. The number of people in detention who were convicted of a crime and had no pending charges increased a staggering 2,370 percent since January from fewer than 1,000 to over 21,000.

The ICE data show that the share of immigrants detained after an ICE arrest who had criminal convictions has fallen in half since January from 62 percent of detainees to 31 percent in November. At the same time, the share of detainees without a criminal conviction or criminal charge has exploded from 6 percent to 40 percent of detainees.

The same ICE dataset shows that in November 2025, 70 percent of those who ICE deported had no criminal conviction, and 43 percent had no criminal conviction or criminal charge. Across all available datasets, it is clear that the Trump administration is not living up to its promises to deport millions and millions of criminals or to prioritize the worst of the worse. So far, the administration has removed barely 90,000 individuals with criminal convictions and fewer than 150,000 individuals with convictions or pending charges.

President Trump’s deportation agenda does not match the campaign promises that he made nor the rhetoric from his officials. The president has already recognized that deportations are hurting the US economy in deporting good workers. But perhaps more importantly, the agenda is taking resources away from targeting true public safety threats, whether from immigrants or Americans. ICE should redirect its resources back toward serious public safety threats.",https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/styles/optimized/public/multimedia/podcast/cato_commentary_2020.jpg?itok=DYvnNPDY,N,,2025-11-25 03:57:19.989110

During a Monday status hearing, U.S. District Judge Sheri Polster Chappell set a conference for Dec. 16-17 in her Fort Myers courtroom.

“I think we’re closer on a lot of issues than we were before,” Polster Chappell said. “And I would think that the parties can come to the table and reasonably come to some agreements that aren’t going to be overly burdensome on the defendants but also will allow the plaintiffs to have the rights that they deserve.”

Attorneys representing detainees at the facility are seeking a preliminary injunction to make it easier for their clients to meet and communicate with them. The detention center was built last summer at a remote airstrip in the Everglades by the administration of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.

Eunice Cho, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, said Monday that detainees’ attorneys must make an appointment to visit three days in advance, unlike at other detention facilities where lawyers can just show up during visiting hours. She pointed out that detainees often are transferred to other facilities after their attorneys have made an appointment to see them and that scheduling delays have been so lengthy that detainees are unable to meet with attorneys before key deadlines.

Nicholas J.P. Meros, an attorney for the state, said most of the concerns initially raised by the detainees and their attorneys have been addressed and that previous delays were due to trying to construct a facility for thousands of detainees in a remote area with little infrastructure.

The lawsuit is one of three federal cases. In an environmental lawsuit, a federal appellate court panel in September allowed the center to continue operating by putting on hold a lower court’s preliminary injunction ordering it to wind down by the end of October.

Federal indictment in ‘Operation Creep’

The backstory:

Alexander Steven Back, a civilian auditor for the Department of Homeland Security, has been federally indicted on one count of attempted enticement of a minor in connection with a multi-agency sex trafficking sting known as ""Operation Creep."" Back is also facing an additional charge of soliciting a minor for prostitution in Hennepin County.

Back was among the 16 men arrested for allegedly trying to solicit sex from an undercover officer posing as a 17-year-old girl. According to the indictment, Back engaged in explicit text conversations with the undercover officer, even after being informed she was 17 years old.

According to the indictment, Back allegedly went to meet the girl and was arrested, with officers finding two cellphones and ICE identification.

In an interview with investigators, Back claimed he didn’t know why he continued talking to the girl after learning her age, stating, ""I don’t really know if there is anything to say. It’s all there in the texts.""

CHICAGO — When federal immigration agents detained a South Los Angeles tamale vendor, her husband and their customer in June, a multiracial group of neighbors organized a march and vigil to denounce the arrests and collect donations for the affected families. Neighbors grieved collectively and laid flowers at a makeshift altar.

“This cement, this corner needs transformation,” a speaker said at the vigil, a demonstration of cultural pride and unity among different racial and ethnic groups in the face of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests, according to social media posts about the event.

Over the months that followed, neighbors have been meeting in back yards and community spaces to develop plans to protect each other and “reclaim” their streets. Their work offers insights on how people across racial and cultural backgrounds are showing up for each other as federal agents sweep across communities.

In recent weeks, Block Club Chicago and LA Public Press have spoken to residents in both cities about building multiracial solidarity and caring for families affected by widening immigration enforcement efforts. For some, Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in both cities reflect a reality about state violence that Black people, including Black immigrants, have known for decades: Under the premise of law enforcement, armed agents can swoop in, wreak harm on a community and snatch people seemingly with impunity.

Enrique Gaspar, an organizer with the anti-poverty nonprofit Community Coalition, which organized the South LA march and vigil, told LA Public Press solidarity has become a daily practice after months of witnessing beloved neighbors get disappeared by federal agents.

“We made a plan to protect ourselves,” Gaspar said in Spanish. “Because an attack against one of us is a strike against all of us. We need to confront ICE terror together.”

After a spate of immigration arrests in the area, primarily Black and Latine neighbors came together to organize a “reclaim our streets” campaign to protest local ICE activity, inform immigrants about their legal rights and care for people affected by raids, Gaspar said.

People leaned on each other again when the time came to advocate for rent control in LA, or to canvas the neighborhood in support of Proposition 50. Members of the organization also drop off food and other mutual aid to neighbors who are too afraid to go outside due to their immigration status.

Neighbors realize they need to stand up for each other, regardless of anyone’s racial identity or citizenship status, because federal agents’ violent behavior is a threat to everyone, Gaspar said.

“We’re a multi-racial coalition working for a better place to live,” Gaspar said. “This is a community that needs to be defended. We’re affected by the same problems.”

South LA is home to a large number of immigrants, primarily from Latin America, though it was once a historically Black region of the city before waves of migration and gentrification changed its demographic makeup. It’s now a predominantly Latine region of LA.

The demographic changes reflect a nationwide trend of Black communities being pushed out by gentrification, disinvestment and pro-developer policies. As South LA changed, tensions emerged between groups, especially as public services were cut or social safety nets collapsed, but opportunities for mutual aid and solidarity also sprung up.

Gaspar, a former newspaper editor from Mexico, is clear-eyed about the challenges in building multiracial solidarity against ICE, but he’s not deterred by them. Cultural and language barriers come up during community meetings and they require deliberate, intentional work — and the financial capacity to hire translators — to ensure everyone can contribute fully.

Gaspar said Latine people must also work to eradicate anti-Blackness and racism if they’re to help build multiracial solidarity. Collective work on issues like rent control or immigrant defense helps neighbors identify the commonalities they share with each other, he said.

“We’re invaded by that [white supremacist] ideology, and the only way to rid ourselves of it is through education,” Gaspar said.

Immigration Enforcement In Black Communities

As both U.S. political parties have cracked down on immigrants and deported millions in recent decades, Black immigrants have been severely impacted, too.

Though images of predominantly non-Black immigrants being detained by ICE dominate news reports and social media, a review of federal immigration enforcement data reveals a more complex narrative.

Despite making up only 5.4 percent of the undocumented population in the United States, Black immigrants accounted for 20 percent of immigrants facing deportation based on criminal convictions, according to a data analysis by the Black Alliance for Justice Immigration and 76 percent of Black immigrants are deported because of contact with the police.

The study also found that people from predominantly Black countries who were detained by ICE were disproportionately more likely to be placed in solitary confinement.

Protecting immigrants from ICE raids and reforming immigration law isn’t an issue that solely Latine people must contend with, said Maraky, an LA-based Black Alliance for Justice Immigration member.

“The ICE dragnet makes all Black people vulnerable,” said Maraky, whose last name is being withheld by Block Club and LA Public Press due to credible fears of retaliation over their activism. “Immigration enforcement is an extension of anti-Black policing. We’re overpoliced and oversentenced.”

Since the second Trump administration began its recent crackdown on immigrants, the Black Alliance for Justice Immigration has been providing support for Black immigrants in LA and across the country.

LA County is home to at least 74,850 Black immigrants, the largest such population in California. Nationwide, one in 10 Black people are immigrants, according to a 2022 Pew report.

Black and Latine people share common struggles against state repression and injustice, Maraky said. Recent examples of solidarity between groups like the Brown Berets and Black Panthers provide roadmaps for how to challenge oppression together, they said.

But people have to keep showing up for each other, Maraky said.

“We have this shared class struggle that requires us to be able to be in solidarity with one another,” Maraky said. “But it’s important that solidarity not always fall on the most marginalized to produce their part in solidarity, and we look to our non-Black people of color in LA to really think about how we are showing up for each other.”

Maraky said LA Mayor Karen Bass should prevent the LA Police Department, known as LAPD, from providing support, even indirectly, to ICE operations. The department has faced criticism from residents who say LAPD’s actions — from standard traffic control to confrontations and, in some cases, violence against ICE protesters and journalists — during immigration arrests are a form of direct collusion with federal agents.

A spokesperson for Bass said the LAPD is prohibited from supporting immigration enforcement but her office didn’t answer questions about the department’s behavior when it responds to calls for support by federal agents.

From Slave Patrols To ICE Raids

For LA resident Joan Agoh, there’s a throughline between ICE arresting immigrants and the violence that the United States has inflicted on Black people for centuries.

The mechanisms targeting immigrants and the infrastructure caging people arrested by ICE is the same that criminalizes Black people, said Agoh, an organizer with the human rights organization Black Alliance for Peace.

When ICE agents have U.S. Supreme Court approval to factor someone’s race and whether they speak Spanish into justification for arrest, Agoh hears echoes of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which required police to arrest people believed to be fleeing enslavement.

“As Black folks in the United States, we know intimately what it is to be walking down the street and to be stopped simply for the color of your skin,” Agoh told LA Public Press. “These struggles are deeply connected.”

Seeing ICE agents clad in body armor and carrying high-powered rifles, Agoh sees remnants of undemocratic U.S. military interventions that have destabilized countries like Haiti.

She also sees the results of the ongoing “1033” federal program, which has transferred over $7 billion of U.S. military equipment to over 8,000 local police agencies in recent decades.

The LAPD and the LA County Sheriff’s Department have received over $3 million and $14 million, respectively, in equipment from the program, ranging from helicopters and rifles to sand bags and mine resistant vehicles, according to federal records analyzed by The Marshall Project.

“Where is ICE getting their armor from? It’s the same Pentagon pipeline that militarizes police nationwide, and it gets deployed oftentimes in Black, and indigenous and Brown communities,” Agoh said. “There’s no world in which we’re shouting to end police violence and say nothing about ICE.”

Block Club and LA Public Press were unable to verify the claim that Department of Homeland Security agencies such as ICE acquire equipment from the 1033 program.

BAP is calling on the federal government to shut down the program.

Since immigration enforcement operations surged across Southern California this summer, Black Alliance for Peace members have participated in protests against raids, mutual aid programs, and volunteer patrols tracking federal agents’ activity in various communities.

Over the past six months, Victoria, an LA-based member of Black Alliance for Peace, has joined other volunteers on morning patrols tracking ICE around Central LA. Riding in cars, on bikes or walking around, patrols also check in with people in the community and ensure day laborers are safe.

“We’re in a symbiotic relationship with the rest of the community to tell us if they’ve seen suspicious cars, or if they don’t recognize someone in their neighborhood taking pictures or harassing people,” said Victoria, whose last name Block Club and LA Public Press aren’t sharing due to concerns about retaliation stemming from their activism.

Victoria said the multiracial solidarity among patrollers has been vital in their work to keep immigrants safe, especially when communicating about new tactics federal agents employ or where sweeps are happening.

“I’ve seen a lot of community building of people who normally wouldn’t be talking to each other but are coordinating for the benefit of each other’s safety,” Victoria said. “There’s a strategic narrative that this is a certain type of person’s fight. ICE activity is going to affect all of us.”

In LA County, solidarity is “a necessity” for communities of color, Agoh said. Black LA residents in particular have dealt with decades of violence and racial profiling by the LA Police Department, even after a U.S. Justice Department consent decree sought to reform the agency.

Agoh said multiracial coalitions won’t be built overnight or easily sustained, but the work of practicing solidarity must continue.

“If I’m interested in the liberation of my people, I’m interested in liberation for all people.” Agoh said. “We can’t say this isn’t our fight.”

‘Heartening’ Connections Emerge In Chicago

As Porsha Weekly folded clothes behind the front desk at La Tiendita, a “free store” hosted at an African Methodist Episcopal church on Chicago’s South Side, a Latine woman approached and asked her a short question in English.

The woman and others in her group sought to browse the collections of donated clothing, toiletries and home goods. Weekly, a Black resident of the Washington Park neighborhood, responded briefly in Spanish.

After years of inflammatory rhetoric around the cultural differences between the South Side’s longtime Black residents and its new Latine arrivals, that mundane exchange at La Tiendita reflects a community working in ways big and small to adjust to those differences.

The two women continued communicating, mostly non-verbally, until two volunteers fluent in Spanish stepped in to guide the visitors through the shop. One of Weekly’s children, wearing a hoodie obtained from La Tiendita, passed the time playing with a rambunctious toddler from the shoppers’ group.

Such connections across language and cultural barriers “are very heartening,” said Dani Salazar, a lead volunteer at the shop who emigrated from Venezuela when he was 11.

“I would like to think that it’s not just because the situation has gotten so much worse for the [Latine] community, but also that it’s because [Black and Latine residents] have shared space for a while, and we are bonding [and] forming a closer connection with each other,” Salazar said.

La Tiendita has since early 2024 operated out of Coppin AME Church’s community center in Washington Park, one of the overwhelmingly Black South Side neighborhoods whose demographics have noticeably changed since Texas Gov. Greg Abbott began sending immigrants from his state to Chicago three years ago.

Now, three months after the Trump administration escalated its immigration enforcement in Chicago and created even more chaos for Latine and Black residents alike, members of each community say the need for unity has rarely been more obvious.

La Tiendita’s most frequent volunteers — half of whom are Black, the others Latine — recognize that such solidarity will only be built through consistency, Salazar said.

“This is a place that was built in a moment of crisis,” Salazar said of the shop’s founding as thousands of people arrived in Chicago with few resources or connections.

But even as city officials have pared back the infrastructure they established amid that crisis, La Tiendita’s organizers are “committed to continuing the work, remaining a part of this community and continuing to serve the Black and Latine communities here that still need the services we provide,” Salazar said.

A Unique Struggle On Chicago’s Southeast Side

A few miles south of Washington Park, on Lake Michigan’s shoreline, are the neighborhoods of South Chicago and East Side. They’re split by the Calumet River and joined by two bridges, which alternately serve as symbols of division and unity in the community.

More than nine in 10 residents across these working-class neighborhoods are people of color, yet they’re largely segregated: 70 percent of South Chicago is Black, while 86 percent of East Side is Latine.

“We are so unique when it comes to Black and Brown struggle,” said Eva Maria Lewis, who is from the Southeast Side and founded the violence prevention nonprofit Free Root Operation.

Despite the clear differences in neighborhood makeup, the Southeast Side’s collective response to Trump’s crackdown draws on a long history of cross-racial organizing. The community was once home to massive steelmaking operations, which for decades attracted workers from a multitude of cultures.

The neighborhood’s “rapid response” team — which alerts neighbors to the presence of “la migra” and mobilizes existing aid networks — features many familiar faces from more recent environmental justice, labor and pro-Palestinian movements in the community.

“Solidarity is important, because who else is going to look out for us?” said Marcelina Pedraza, a union electrician at Ford’s Southeast Side assembly plant. “The people in my community, in the schools, across the street from me — we are going to keep each other safe.”

That’s not to say Chicagoans of color always form a unified front.

Anti-Blackness is rampant across the city, Lewis said. For example, as shops were looted in Latine communities like Little Village and suburban Cicero during the 2020 uprisings, some Black Chicagoans shopping in or passing through those areas were targeted with bricks, bats and harassment.

On the flip side, some Black residents — many of whom descend from people who fled violence and poverty in the South during the Great Migration — have been among the loudest voices against the city’s support for migrants.

These barriers to unity are structural and intentional, locals said. On top of the mistrust sewn by decades of divestment, redlining and racial violence in Black neighborhoods, local leaders’ rollouts of migrant resources in those same areas have been plagued by flip-flopping and communication failures.

“It’s easy to take the bait when talking about resource scarcity in our communities,” Lewis said. “But when we are able to focus in on the root causes, it allows us to have more ammunition towards positive change.”

To overcome those barriers, some Chicagoans are turning to deceptively simple practices: self-reflection, pattern recognition and trust-building.

Weekly, who was a “shopper” at La Tiendita before she started volunteering, admits she was at first bothered by La Tiendita’s existence. With mostly Spanish-speakers running and receiving items from the shop when she first visited last year, she believed Latines were only looking out for their own in a neighborhood that’s 95 percent Black, she said.

But as Weekly continued to receive items and eventually volunteer — and as word about the store spread beyond Spanish-speaking communities — she said she saw the organizers prove their commitment to visitors of all backgrounds. By “very rough” estimates, La Tiendita’s visitor base is now about 70 percent Black and 30 percent Latine, Salazar said.

“I grew from that,” Weekly said of her initial frustrations. “I have befriended [Latine] friends, and I know a little Spanish. … We don’t see [race]. We see community and love and giving. That’s it, that’s all.”

Finding Common Ground, And Empathy

Amid the feds’ crackdown, residents are also drawing parallels between the seemingly exceptional violence of the immigration operations and the regularly inequitable tactics of local policing — and urging other Black and Latine Chicagoans to see their struggles as linked.

As agents chased and incarcerated immigrants around the city, they also detained, zip-tied and choked out Black U.S. citizens. Meanwhile, county and state police have for weeks arrested protesters of numerous backgrounds outside a suburban immigration processing center.

In one case, Customs and Border Patrol agents violently detained a young Black man outside an East Side Walgreens on Oct. 14, the same day agents fanned out across the community and crashed into, injured, arrested and tear-gassed people.

A month later, dozens of residents marched in the streets past the Walgreens and other sites of that day’s chaos with signs reading “Unity in Struggle” and “Until We Are All Free.”

“For me, it’s really valuable … to have a camaraderie with the neighbors,” said Frances Mercado, a biracial Black and Mexican woman who lives at the intersection where agents gassed residents in defiance of local cops’ requests.

“We all talk — maybe not in-depth, or not in [about] our whole family life — but at least we’re cordial and kind to each other and respectable.”

In another incident in South Shore, which neighbors the Southeast Side, 37 immigrants and additional U.S. citizens were detained in a military-style raid Sept. 30.

Weeks later, a small group of Black residents gathered on the sidewalk outside the South Shore building. Though the group had initially gathered to socialize, some shifted focus when they saw city workers filing onto the property to perform a code inspection.

Several in the group peppered a buildings department employee with questions about the city’s handling of the building, which had deteriorated for years prior to the mass arrival of immigrants in the neighborhood, let alone the September raid.

A few others, citing that same history, denied to reporters that Latine migrants were to blame for the property’s appalling conditions.

Black and Latine Chicagoans are also being brought together by fresh attacks on food access.

As the Trump administration refused to fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program during the recently ended government shutdown, Lewis’ Free Root Operation worked with Nuevo Leon Restaurant in Little Village to provide 260 people with free taco dinners one night last month.

Free Root Operation will continue food distributions, with further cuts to SNAP benefits on the horizon, Lewis said. Free meals allow neighbors in need to put “prejudices to the side” and focus on “the potential for us to get what we need — and for it not to come at the expense of each other’s wellbeing,” she said.

Extreme and visible pressures like sudden demographic changes, the immigration crackdown and cuts to federal benefits are pushing Chicagoans of color to find common ground. That gives community organizers an opportunity to build lasting connections, Lewis said.

“There is this line of empathy we can have on people,” she said. “There is a huge opportunity for us to learn from one another; an opportunity to be conscious around how these systems have caused our communities to play each other, and instead build and learn.”",https://bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/11/Rally-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 20:59:26.426228

For the second time in just over a year, farm workers and immigrant rights advocates last Saturday staged protests at multiple Hannaford supermarket locations to pressure the regional grocery chain to guarantee better labor conditions for dairy workers.

Locally, protesters gathered outside the Hannaford in Morrisville’s Fairground Plaza on Nov. 15 to push the company and its multinational Dutch parent company, Ahold Delhaize, to participate in immigrant rights advocacy group Migrant Justice’s Milk with Dignity program.

The Milk with Dignity program asks participating corporations to pay more for dairy products to ensure better working conditions for workers on dairy farms. Vermont-based ice cream giant Ben & Jerry’s has participated in the program since 2017.

In October, Vermont Way Foods, a progressive distributor of Vermont products, announced a partnership to allow Migrant Justice to monitor working conditions in their products’ dairy supply chain, and even promoted the partnership with a “Cheese with Dignity” product.

In a survey conducted by Migrant Justice of Vermont farmworkers, over two-thirds of survey takers said they make less than minimum wage — in some cases far less — while another two-thirds reported suffering an injury due to working conditions.

Though Migrant Justice has targeted Hannaford in pressure campaigns to join Milk with Dignity since 2019, the campaign has escalated since protestors last appeared at the Morrisville location in October 2024.

In April, Migrant Justice filed a complaint with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international trade forum in which 37 countries develop policy around economic trade, alleging “grave human rights violations” in Hannaford’s dairy supply chain.

Ahold Delhaize responded by commissioning an independent human rights investigation. Migrant Justice “recently hosted the investigators charged with looking into labor violations, connecting them with workers on farms supplying Hannaford-brand milk,” the group said in a website post promoting the Nov. 15 protests, as investigators return to the Netherlands to submit their report.

Representatives for Portland, Maine-based Hannaford grocery or Ahold Delhaize did not respond to requests for comment.

With Hannaford under greater pressure, protestors returned to Fairground Plaza on with makeshift instruments, blaring music and chants in English and Spanish, handing out flyers to would-be shoppers and asking them to boycott the supermarket for a day.

A farmworker employed on a farm that guarantees fair labor conditions as part of the Ben & Jerry’s supply chain and asked that his name be withheld due to concerns of retaliation said that he valued the working conditions guaranteed by the Milk with Dignity program compared to what he sees on other farms.

“I have a voice, and I know that I have rights,” he said in Spanish, according to Migrant Justice spokesperson Will Lambek, who acted as translator. “For example, if I get sick, I can take a day off and I’ll still be paid for it. For Hannaford supply chain workers, even if they get sick, they have to keep working.”

Hannaford responded with an increased security detail, employing not just private security guards as they had the previous year but also law enforcement with the Morristown Police Department and the Lamoille County Sheriff’s Department. Officers questioned anyone attempting to park in the Hannaford parking lot to ensure only customers were allowed.

Farmworkers and activists gathered publicly on Nov. 15 even as federal immigration detainment actions have become increasingly common, with nine people detained in Hardwick in September and another seven detained after a targeted raid at a gas station in Jeffersonville earlier this month.

Eight people were detained after an immigration police raid on a Franklin County dairy farm in April, and Jose Ignacio De La Cruz, an organizer with Migrant Justice, and his stepdaughter were detained after being pulled over on the road by the United States Border Patrol in Richford in June.

“We are here again, speaking up and demanding our rights, and there is a lot of risk to that,” the farmworker said. “We understand that, but if we were to let ourselves be conquered by our fear, that would be letting them win.”",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/farmworkers-protest-morrisville-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 20:59:16.457009

Bass joined Congressman Robert Garcia, Ranking Member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and other Democratic members to hear testimony from local and community leaders for the public record. Garcia said it is important to document allegations of misconduct by federal agents when they happen.

For months, local officials have alleged that immigration enforcement tactics used during raids throughout Southern California are unlawful. A lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Public Counsel and other immigration and civil rights attorneys claimed that federal agents were violating the Constitution by arresting people solely based on their skin color, performing raids without warrants and denying legal counsel to detainees.

A lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Public Counsel and other immigration and civil rights attorneys over the summer claimed that federal agents were violating the Constitution by arresting people solely based on their skin color, performing raids without warrants and denying legal counsel to detainees.

A lower court judge ruled to temporarily halt immigration raids in Southern California in July. In August, an appeals court ruled to largely keep the restrictions made by the lower court's ruling.

The Congressional field hearing featured several panels where leaders accused the Trump administration of sending masked men who have instilled fear in communities. Bass claimed that Angelenos are scared to leave their homes, which has a significant impact on the local economy. She explained that the Los Angeles economy cannot function without immigrant labor.

CBS LA has reached out to the White House for comment and is waiting for a response. Previously, President Trump claimed that mass deportations were necessary in Democrat-run cities because elected officials want to ""expand their Voter Base, cheat in Elections, and grow the Welfare State, robbing good-paying Jobs and Benefits from Hardworking American Citizens.""

Long Beach Mayor Rex Richardson called the immigration raids ""an erosion of trust"" and said local governments have like his have strengthened their resources and offered services like legal counsel to residents.

Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett accused President Trump of ""running the most openly racist immigration regime in modern American history.""

The committee also heard from U.S. citizen Andrea Velez, who claimed she was wrongfully detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents on June 24. Velez said she was accused of interfering with ICE and taken to the Metropolitan Detention Center. She claimed that while she was held, she was denied access to make a phone call to family or contact a lawyer.

Velez said her case was ultimately dismissed due to lack of evidence but said she fears for her safety and the safety of others.

Garcia said the committee is not only focused on possible violations on LA but across the country. He announced the official launch of the Oversight Immigration Enforcement Dashboard that is meant to document and archive possible misconducts by federal agents. He said the dashboard already has over 250 alleged documented instances.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/11/24/a535097b-510b-46b4-847b-d5b8b17e704c/thumbnail/1200x630/b4b929a33b5273483701ac90dc5a0538/congressional-hearing.png,N,,2025-11-24 21:57:14.370578

The Guardian last week initially reported that the FBI monitored immigrant-rights activists by accessing a “courtwatch” Signal group, which organizes volunteers who observe public hearings at three federal immigration courts in NYC. A two-page “joint situational information report” from the FBI and the NYPD dated from Aug. 28, which The Guardian obtained, had quoted from the encrypted messaging app Signal and characterized the court watchers as “anarchist violent extremist actors.”

The CITY was first to confirm that the NYPD had been involved in the operation. Despite Signal being end-to-end encrypted, the FBI stated that it obtained the messages through a “sensitive source with excellent access,” implying that someone within the chat was sharing information.

In a statement to amNewYork, an NYPD spokesperson on Monday distanced itself from the joint report, saying it is not an NYPD document. The department said it relates to a broader counterterrorism investigation into a range of potential criminal activities, including weapons training, violence against law enforcement, property damage, and discussions about bomb-making.

The NYPD added that the report has been reviewed by an external civilian representative under a standing court order that created 10-member NYPD Handschu Committee in the wake of federal lawsuits alleged the department improperly investigated the Muslim community.

The committee, which includes nine NYPD officials and a civilian representative, oversees the opening, extension, and closure of investigations into political activity, including terrorism.

The civilian representative, currently attorney Muhammad Faridi, serves a five-year term and can report potential abuses to the NYPD commissioner and the federal judge overseeing the Handschu case.

Faridi, appointed by Mayor Adams in 2023, told The City Friday that he had reviewed NYPD records, saying it referred to one surveillance subject and concluded that the inquiry meets Handschu Committee guidelines.

When asked about the NYPD’s involvement while speaking at Monday’s announcement in Central Park for his transition team, Mamdani said it was “deeply troubling” and “that’s something that we’re going to look into.”

Speaking on the important role court observers have played in the Trump administration’s ongoing immigration crackdown, Mamdani recalled a conversation he had a with a Brooklyn pastor on the campaign trail who spoke of an immigrant they had accompanied to a hearing “and part of the reason that she was able to go home that day is because of the court watchers who were there.”

He told reporters that the NYPD having any involvement in spying on court watchers is not something that will be part of his administration and “something that we follow up on.”

For months, amNewYork has been reporting on volunteer court observers who accompany immigrants to their required ICE check-in appointments on the fifth floor of 26 Federal Plaza, where they monitor and document what they believe are increasing detainments.

They say ICE is increasingly arresting individuals there, sometimes before they even reach their scheduled appointments, and have lately stressed that these moments happen out of sight of journalists and lawyers.

Responding to further questions about federal immigration enforcement, Mamdani said New York’s sanctuary laws already allow cooperation with federal authorities for a narrow list of serious crimes, but he criticized ICE for focusing enforcement on children and immigrants whose only offense is being present in the city.

“What I said to the president is that New York City sanctuary laws have a provision within them that allows the city to work with the federal government for a specific set of serious crimes, and that has been the law for decades here in New York City,” said Mamdani. “What’s giving so many New Yorkers, including myself, a deep amount of concern is that the focus of ICE’s immigration efforts has not been on those serious crimes. They have, in fact, been on children as young as six years old, being detained and deported. They have been on New Yorkers whose crime seems to just be being here in New York City.”

The mayor-elect added that his commitment to public safety is to keep all New Yorkers safe, and “that’s where we have a difference of opinion.”",https://www.amny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/the-big-story-reuters.jpg?quality=51&w=1200&p=q,N,,2025-11-24 22:56:50.660189

Schwartz Federal Building and United States Courthouse.

Reps. Juan Vargas and Scott Peters, both D-San Diego, were refused entry on Oct. 20. On Oct. 27, they were joined by Sen. Alex Padilla, D-California, Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-San Diego, and Rep. Mike Levin, D-San Clemente, and were again turned away.

""As members of Congress, we have the right and the responsibility to enter detention sites in order to conduct oversight without prior authorization,"" Vargas said. ""Today, we were again blocked from entering. If nothing is wrong here, why are we not allowed in? What is ICE hiding? We came here to confirm that the law is being followed.

""After being denied entry again, I cannot say for certain that's the case. We will continue to push DHS for answers to what is going on here. We will not stand by while we continue to hear reports that people are being held in concerning conditions.""

Monday is supposed to be different. The Representatives said they now have permission to visit the facility following the conclusion of the longest federal shutdown in U.S. history.

The legislators sent a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and acting director of ICE Todd Lyons in October, laying out a pattern of ""ignored requests and stonewalling"" by DHS, raising concerns that the agency is blocking congressional oversight in violation of the law.

""Last week, we began to hear alarming reports of increased numbers of people being detained in the basement facilities of the federal building during routine immigration check-ins,"" the joint letter read. ""We have also heard reports that people were being detained in subpar conditions, without access to attorneys, medical care, or proper nutrition.

""Even though we identified ourselves as members of Congress who were conducting federal oversight, local ICE officials denied us entry and told us that we needed seven days' notice to schedule a site visit. After the visit, we again reached out to reiterate our request in writing for a tour of the facilities. In response, ICE sent an automated response indicating that the `ICE Office of Congressional Relations staff are currently out of the office and unable to respond to emails, phone calls, or perform other work-related duties' and that `incoming inquiries' would be reviewed only `(o)nce funding is restored.'""

ICE at the time told the legislators that only requests approved seven days in advance would be allowed to inspect its facilities -- a new policy put in place this summer by the DHS.

As a result, for at least 43 days during the shutdown, these detention centers had little to no Congressional oversight, leaving the condition of those detained unknown to the general public. The leaders hammer this point.

""As members of Congress, we have the right and responsibility to conduct governmental oversight of federal agencies,"" they wrote. ""These oversight responsibilities are especially important in situations, like here, where reports indicate that people's well-being may be at risk. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. This administration has routinely denied this right and created arbitrary barriers in an attempt to prevent Congressional oversight.""

Although permission has been granted, it may not be enough. In June, Reps. Judy Chu, D-Monterey Park, Gil Cisneros, D-Covina, and Derek Tran, D-Cypress, were turned away from the Adelanto ICE Processing Center despite being legally authorized to visit the San Bernardino County facility.

""For nearly a decade, I've visited Adelanto because of its notorious history of violating detainees' basic human and constitutional rights,"" Chu said after she was denied entry. ""Unfortunately, it appears that Adelanto's inhumane track record continues as we hear reports that detainees rounded up after Trump's ICE raids in Los Angeles are being denied their right to due process and that even U.S. citizens may have been detained. And yet, our attempts as Members of Congress to conduct oversight at Adelanto, which is expressly permitted by law, were unlawfully denied, blocking us from getting the truth about what's going on behind illegally closed doors.

(AP) — A federal judge in Florida wants civil rights attorneys and lawyers for the U.S. and for Florida to meet next month to hammer out a settlement in a lawsuit over whether detainees at an immigration center in the Everglades known as “Alligator Alcatraz” are getting adequate access to legal representatives.

During a Monday status hearing, U.S. District Judge Sheri Polster Chappell set a conference for Dec. 16-17 in her Fort Myers courtroom.

“I think we’re closer on a lot of issues than we were before,” Polster Chappell said. “And I would think that the parties can come to the table and reasonably come to some agreements that aren’t going to be overly burdensome on the defendants but also will allow the plaintiffs to have the rights that they deserve.”

Attorneys representing detainees at the facility are seeking a preliminary injunction to make it easier for their clients to meet and communicate with them. The detention center was built last summer at a remote airstrip in the Everglades by the administration of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.

Eunice Cho, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, said Monday that detainees’ attorneys must make an appointment to visit three days in advance, unlike at other detention facilities where lawyers can just show up during visiting hours. She pointed out that detainees often are transferred to other facilities after their attorneys have made an appointment to see them and that scheduling delays have been so lengthy that detainees are unable to meet with attorneys before key deadlines.

Nicholas J.P. Meros, an attorney for the state, said most of the concerns initially raised by the detainees and their attorneys have been addressed and that previous delays were due to trying to construct a facility for thousands of detainees in a remote area with little infrastructure.

The lawsuit is one of three federal cases. In an environmental lawsuit, a federal appellate court panel in September allowed the center to continue operating by putting on hold a lower court’s preliminary injunction ordering it to wind down by the end of October.

A third lawsuit claims immigration is a federal issue and that Florida agencies and private contractors hired by the state have no authority to operate the facility.

President Donald Trump toured the facility in July and suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide as his administration pushes to expand the infrastructure needed to increase deportations. While the facility was built and operated by the state and its private contractors, federal officials have approved reimbursing Florida for $608 million.

Trump has largely halted refugee admissions, with the narrow exception of White South Africans.
For years, the US outpaced other countries in refugee admissions, allowing millions into the country since the Refugee Act of 1980.
The Trump administration knows this full well,” he said in a statement to CNN.
The agency has the authority to terminate refugee status, according to the administration memo, with no option to appeal the decision.","The Trump administration is moving to reinterview certain refugees who were admitted to the United States under former President Joe Biden as part of a comprehensive review of their cases, according to an internal memo and a source familiar with the plans.

The effort marks an unprecedented step in President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown — this time, targeting one of the world’s most vulnerable populations. Refugees must show that they were persecuted or face persecution in their home countries and undergo rigorous vetting prior to entering the United States in what is generally a yearslong process.

Trump officials have scrutinized the admissions program, which has historically had bipartisan support, and argued that the previous administration didn’t sufficiently vet the people who entered the US. Trump has largely halted refugee admissions, with the narrow exception of White South Africans.

US Citizenship and Immigration Services is expected to be charged with the review and reinterview process, according to the memo, dated November 21, citing an operational necessity to ensure refugees don’t pose a national security or public safety threat. Between fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2025, around 235,000 refugees entered the US after going through the admissions process.

CNN reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and the White House for comment. The State Department referred CNN to DHS.

For years, the US outpaced other countries in refugee admissions, allowing millions into the country since the Refugee Act of 1980. But the program took a hit during Trump’s first term when he slashed the number of refugees allowed to come to the US, and during the coronavirus pandemic, which resulted in a temporary suspension of resettlements. Biden tried to rebuild the program and eventually set an annual ceiling of 125,000 admissions.

“Just the threat of this is unspeakably cruel. … To threaten refugees with taking away their status would be re-traumatizing and a vicious misuse of taxpayer money,” said Mark Hetfield, the president of HIAS, a refugee resettlement organization, in a statement to CNN.

The president of Refugees International, Jeremy Konyndyk, echoed this, noting that “refugees who enter the US through the refugee admissions program are the most vetted and scrutinized of any migrants.”

“They pass intensive reviews of their refugee status, background checks, and security screenings. The Trump administration knows this full well,” he said in a statement to CNN.

“At a time when the Trump administration is trying to resettle White South Africans,” who he said don’t meet the criteria as refugees, “it’s very hard to see this as anything other than a pretext to revoke protections from those who actually need them.”

The anticipated interviews are intended to ensure that refugees met the criteria for admission when they were allowed in the country. The agency has the authority to terminate refugee status, according to the administration memo, with no option to appeal the decision.

The memo also orders a hold on pending applications for refugees to adjust their status in the US until the USCIS director determines otherwise. A year after refugees are admitted to the country, they are required under US law to apply for permanent status.

In remarks on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in September, Deputy Secretary of State Chris Landau argued that the current international asylum system and frameworks, including the Refugee Convention, are outdated and have been abused, making “mass illegal migration legal.”

“The asylum system has become a huge loophole in our migration laws, and we just have to be realistic about this,” Landau said at the US-led event, titled “Global Refugee Asylum System: What Went Wrong and How to Fix It.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2247321387-20251119021425881.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-11-24 18:57:04.478892

In a separate cable, the State Department also instructed embassies to begin collating its next annual human rights report, traditionally one of the most comprehensive studies of human rights abuses around the world.
It was also determined to address human rights concerns that have been ignored by the global human rights community “because they were politically incorrect, or they weren’t convenient to the prevailing narratives”.
Loading The senior policy adviser at the State Department’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labour, Samuel Samson, graduated from university in 2021.

The intervention into domestic affairs goes beyond illegal immigration and seeks to caution Canberra that a significant intake of migrants, “particularly of a culture that’s radically different from Australia’s”, can lead to political and economic instability.

A senior State Department official said the administration had instructed diplomats at its embassy in Canberra to “begin collecting data and reporting on migrant-related crimes and human rights abuses facilitated by people of a migration background”.

Similar cables were sent last week to all US embassies in Europe, as well as Canada and New Zealand. The governments of these countries were not consulted beforehand, but the US embassies have been instructed to contact them and offer to “help”.

The senior State Department official, who spoke on condition of not being named, said the US government was concerned a large influx of migrants could strain markets, naming Australia’s housing crisis as an example.

“Beyond that, we want to caution the Australians,” he told this masthead. “We love the Australian people … We just want to warn our friends that if you import a rapid number of individuals of any background, particularly of a culture that’s radically different from Australia’s, without any sort of mechanism for diffusing the impact, that can lead to political unrest, that can lead to economic instability.”

The official said that while illegal immigration was “the elephant in the room”, the Trump administration was concerned about mass migration more broadly.

“You have to have some common sense about that,” he told this masthead. “You also have to understand the limitations ... and the security concerns that come with mass migration, and what happens when you import a substantial number of people into a very tight particular area.”

Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to a request for comment overnight.

Australia admits 185,000 permanent migrants a year, mostly skilled workers. Net overseas migration, which includes temporary workers, international students and visitors, is falling rapidly from a post-COVID high of 538,000 in 2022-23. It has now dropped to about 316,000, lower than forecasted.

But Opposition Leader Sussan Ley has pledged to unveil a policy that would further cut the intake, amid a hot-button debate over immigration and population.

In a separate cable, the State Department also instructed embassies to begin collating its next annual human rights report, traditionally one of the most comprehensive studies of human rights abuses around the world.

The Trump administration is changing the focus of the report to scrutinise countries’ enforcement of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies, as well as government funding for abortion services and gender transition surgery for children.

The senior State Department official, on a briefing call to news media, said the administration was not afraid to call out its allies “just as much as we’re willing to call out our enemies”.

It was also determined to address human rights concerns that have been ignored by the global human rights community “because they were politically incorrect, or they weren’t convenient to the prevailing narratives”.

The official said the fact that the project was being overseen by the department’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labour underscored how seriously the administration was taking the issue.

The latest intervention continues a global project articulated by Vice President JD Vance when he spoke at the Munich Security Conference in February, warning European leaders their voters were rebelling against “out-of-control migration”, and that politicians ignored the will of the people at their peril.

President Donald Trump dramatically pressed the case when he told the United Nations in September that “the globalist migration agenda”, along with environmental and economic policies to combat climate change, were destroying Western societies. “Your countries are going to hell,” he said.

The senior policy adviser at the State Department’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labour, Samuel Samson, graduated from university in 2021. In May, he posted an essay on the department’s Substack shaming Europe for its “democratic backsliding”, facilitation of mass migration and descriptions of certain right-wing political parties as extremists.

“The global liberal project is not enabling the flourishing of democracy,” he wrote. “Rather, it is trampling democracy, and Western heritage along with it, in the name of a decadent governing class afraid of its own people … Achieving peace in Europe and around the world requires not a rejection of our shared cultural heritage, but a renewal of it.”",https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1656%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_54%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/484502fa862fb199336932a385b075c763332377,N,,2025-11-24 18:57:09.413075

College of International Studies professor Joshua Landis wrote in a Monday post on the social platform X that Vahid Abedini, an Iranian Studies professor, was boarding a flight on his way to attend the Middle East Studies Association in Washington, D.C. Abedini was then detained and placed in jail, according to Landis.

Landis wrote in the post that Abedini has an H-1B visa, which is given to immigrants who are temporarily employed in specialty occupations or services of exceptional merit and abilities, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Landis wrote that this designation includes higher education faculty.

According to Abedini’s OU profile, he earned his doctorate in political science from Florida International University. Before joining OU, he served as a visiting assistant professor in the department of political science at the University of Arkansas.

Abedini teaches courses on elite politics, development, technology and foreign policy, focusing on the Middle East and Iran, according to his OU profile. According to OU’s course catalog, he is teaching two classes this fall: The Global Politics of Oil and Political Economy of Development. He’s listed to teach one course, Elite Politics in Iran, in spring 2026.

“We are praying for his swift release,” Landis wrote.

Landis told OU Daily in a phone call Monday afternoon Abedini is currently being detained in Oklahoma. Since his arrest, Abedini has been in contact with his ex-wife and another OU professor, Landis said.

Landis said Abedini is working with a lawyer to resolve the situation, but Landis is unsure how soon he will get a court date.

“We’re waiting for him to get in front of a court. We were hoping (it) would be today, but of course, the lawyers say, ‘Oh, that’ll never happen,’” Landis said. “Because it evidently just takes forever to get a court hearing, so you just languish in jail.”

Landis, who also serves as the co-director of the Center for Middle East Studies and the director of the Farzaneh Family Center for Iranian and Persian Gulf Studies, said he helped Abedini with his legal documentation, and believes Abedini has followed all necessary steps to lawfully stay in the country.

“This guy is illegally detained. He's following all the laws. The university has been following the laws. He's been impeccable about doing everything and signing papers, and I was deeply involved in that process,” Landis said. “The university has been extremely diligent in doing its duty.”

Landis said he received an email instructing him to direct all inquiries about Abedini’s detainment to OU Marketing and Communications. OU Marketing and Communications wrote in an email to OU Daily Monday afternoon that it did not have a comment on Abedini’s detainment.

A spokesperson from ICE wrote in an email to OU Daily that it would look into the arrest.

Background

Since President Donald Trump took office in January, he has been vocal about his goal to increase immigration enforcement and border security, including the mass deportation of immigrants lacking permanent legal status.

In July, Congress passed a bill allocating about $170 billion for Trump’s immigration enforcement agenda, including $45 billion for detention centers, $30 billion for additional personnel and maintenance, and $46.5 billion for the southern border wall.

The Department of Homeland Security announced in a press release Oct. 27 that more than 527,000 “illegal aliens” have been deported from the U.S. under the Trump administration. According to the release, roughly 1.6 million others had “voluntarily self-deported.”

KOCO reported in September that deportations in Oklahoma have increased by 70%, from 1,000 deportations filed from January to March to 1,700 in the second quarter of the year. KOSU reported in October that, as of July 28, 1,994 people have been arrested and booked into one of 88 different local detention centers across Oklahoma, and flagged either for or by ICE.

In April, the Trump administration revoked visas of international students across the country. Schools that reported having students with a terminated legal status include Harvard University, Stanford University, the University of Michigan, the University of California at Los Angeles and Ohio State University.

On April 8, The O’Colly, the student newspaper at Oklahoma State University, reported that eight OSU students had their immigration records terminated by the U.S. government. The University of Central Oklahoma confirmed to KOCO on April 8 that four students had their visas revoked.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/oudaily.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/2f/22f9ca06-9ed3-4df2-8f3d-08a5464d017f/6924d28708c4d.preview.jpg?crop=700%2C368%2C0%2C49,N,,2025-11-24 17:57:59.801528

“ICE agents wrongfully detained a high school intern outside the Superior Court – an outrageous and indefensible act that could have completely upended a young person’s life,” McKee said.
A court staffer familiar with the situation told CNN that the situation began inside a courtroom, where ICE agents were taking photos of the high schooler.
Before the judge could leave with the student, ICE agents surrounded his car.
Their tactics have become so commonplace that protesters were already demonstrating outside the courthouse before ICE detained the teen.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have infuriated Rhode Island’s governor, a senator, and its state Supreme Court chief justice after officers detained a high school statehouse intern on suspicion that they were an illegal immigrant.

Recordings of the incident show ICE agents detaining the teen, who was traveling from the statehouse to his school as part of an internship at the Rhode Island Superior Court. The teen was being driven to school by a judge when ICE agents intercepted them.

Governor Dan McKee called the incident ""indefensible"" in a statement.

“ICE agents wrongfully detained a high school intern outside the Superior Court – an outrageous and indefensible act that could have completely upended a young person’s life,” McKee said.

A court staffer familiar with the situation told CNN that the situation began inside a courtroom, where ICE agents were taking photos of the high schooler.

Security reportedly asked the individual to stop taking photos of people inside the courtroom, which is when the individual identified themselves as an ICE agent.

It's unclear why the ICE agent was taking photos.

The student was reportedly disturbed by the incident, prompting Superior Court Associate Justice Joseph McBurney to offer the student a ride back to his school.

Before the judge could leave with the student, ICE agents surrounded his car. The footage shows at least six agents descending upon the vehicle and asking the teen and the judge to exit.

Approximately 30 seconds later, a federal agent can be seen on the video restraining the intern's hands and escorting him away as protesters shout at the agents.

""He's a f***** kid,"" one protester can be heard yelling in the video.

McBurney explained to the agents that the teen is an intern at the court and that they had made a mistake, according to CNN, citing the staffer.

The intern was taken across the street and was later released after ICE verified his identity, according to the Rhode Island Judiciary.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security reportedly told CNN that its agents had been searching for a ""child predator"" and ""briefly questioned someone who resembled the target,"" but that that individual was never taken into custody or arrested.

ICE has been criticized for stalking around courthouses and schools looking for people to abduct. Their tactics have become so commonplace that protesters were already demonstrating outside the courthouse before ICE detained the teen.

Rhode Island Supreme Court Chief Justice Paul A. Suttell said the incident only proves the point of the protesters at the courthouse.

“This egregious incident underscores both the community’s and the Judiciary’s concerns about how ICE is conducting its operations in Rhode Island,” the judge said.

Democratic Senator Corey Booker, who represents New Jersey, denounced ICE in a social media post on Sunday.

“A teenager. A U.S. citizen. Detained by ICE at a courthouse. This isn’t law and order—this is intimidation. It doesn’t protect our communities; it undermines them. It violates the trust people need to safely access the justice system,” Booker wrote. “It wastes law-enforcement resources that should be focused on real dangers, not innocent kids. We must condemn this and demand accountability. America is better than this.”

McKee blamed the situation squarely on the Trump administration, which has empowered ICE to operate with a vague and almost unrestrained mandate in America's cities.

“This was not a harmless mistake. It was the direct result of callous and chaotic policies by the Trump Administration,” McKee said. “Moreover, ICE’s failure to exercise even a shred of due diligence is shameful and underscores just how broken and dangerous these federal policies are.”",https://static.the-independent.com/2025/11/07/21/EEUU-NI%C3%91OS_MIGRANTES_04282.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2025-11-24 18:57:14.446565

Among those who provided testimony was Andrea Velez, a U.S. citizen who was on her way to work in June when masked men came running toward her.
She described using her work bag as a shield, as an ICE officer slammed her into the sidewalk.
“They didn’t believe I was a U.S. citizen or bother to check my ID,” Velez said.
“No citizen should have to carry a passport in their own country to prove that they’re an American.”","There was the U.S. citizen who said she no longer feels safe after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer slammed her to the ground in downtown Los Angeles and later accused her of assault — a case prosecutors dismissed soon after.

The Long Beach mayor, who said immigration agents have seized more than 50 residents off the city’s streets — including 11 in a single afternoon Thursday, among them a gardener tackled inside Polly’s Pies restaurant.

A Boyle Heights pastor who told of a mother who lost her young daughter after a failed organ transplant and was paralyzed over whether to cremate her or bury her, as she wanted, because she feared being deported and unable to visit her child’s grave.

During a congressional oversight hearing Monday in L.A., more than a dozen elected officials, experts and community members laid bare the impact of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown. It was an exclusively Democrat event and no one spoke up in support of the raids.

L.A. Mayor Karen Bass and the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Long Beach), announced last month that Congress was opening “a broad investigation” into arrests of U.S. citizens by ICE officers, as well as a separate probe into immigration raids overall.

“We want to establish a record, because when the political winds change, we want to hold those accountable,” Bass said ahead of the hearing. “We want transparency and accountability for all of the egregious unconstitutional acts that are taking place. The raids might be off the nightly news, but they continue every single day, and we don’t ever want anyone to forget that.”

U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas described the current situation as “an American nightmare.”

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

For months, agents have roamed the streets of L.A., toting guns and chasing down undocumented immigrants. The scenes that have played out here — protesters being arrested, immigrants dragged out of their cars — have been repeated in Chicago, Charlotte, N.C., and other cities with largely Democratic leadership.

As of last month, federal authorities had arrested more than 7,100 undocumented immigrants in the Los Angeles area since June 6, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

Among those who provided testimony was Andrea Velez, a U.S. citizen who was on her way to work in June when masked men came running toward her. She described using her work bag as a shield, as an ICE officer slammed her into the sidewalk.

“They didn’t believe I was a U.S. citizen or bother to check my ID,” Velez said.

Prosecutors initially charged Velez with assault on a federal officer, alleging that Velez, who is 4 feet 11 inches, stood in the path of an ICE officer with her arms extended, striking his head and chest when they collided. Soon after, prosecutors dismissed the case.

Velez told committee members that she now carries her passport with her.

“I think it is shameful that this administration makes citizens feel like they have to carry a passport in their own country,” Rep. Mark Takano (D-Riverside) said. “No citizen should have to carry a passport in their own country to prove that they’re an American.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6cb2493/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5542x2910+0+393/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F16%2Fb3%2F2c7223e24b9bb5eaedf190100075%2F1531307-me-robert-garcia-profile-009-eat.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 17:57:54.504360

Recent media reports indicate that the Trump administration is turning that purpose on its head by mandating reporting in support of ideological priorities at odds with governments’ human rights obligations.

The 2024 version of the State Department report issued by the Trump administration in August already removed or significantly reduced sections on political freedoms, corruption, gender-based violence, and LGBTQ+ persecution. New guidance sent in November to US embassy personnel worldwide looks set to do even more damage.

According to the Washington Post, embassies will be instructed to document whether governments are implementing various policies the Trump administration opposes as though they were human rights violations. In reality, though, many of these targeted policies are important efforts to support and improve respect for human rights. These include government policies to improve access to abortion services and gender-affirming care, as well as efforts to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion.

These changes would translate parts of the administration’s rights-abusing domestic policy agenda into US foreign policy.

This isn’t just about political slogans or ideological debates. US diplomatic pressure around these issues can influence whether people can exercise their rights, access essential services, and live with dignity. In many countries, restrictions on reproductive health care violate the rights of women and girls, while others on evidence-based gender-affirming careviolate the rights of transgender people, and attacks on inclusivity policies undermine the rights of marginalized people.

As the US government turns against key facets of international human rights protection, other governments should step forward.

On Monday, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a draft notice in the Federal Register, to be formally published the following day, revealing the change.

It credited Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem with making the determination to end the programme.

“After reviewing country conditions and consulting with appropriate U.S. Government agencies, the Secretary determined that Burma [Myanmar] no longer continues to meet the conditions for designation for Temporary Protected Status,” the document said.

“The Secretary, therefore, is terminating the Temporary Protected Status designation of Burma as required by statute.”

Some 3,969 citizens of Myanmar currently enjoy Temporary Protected Status, a legal immigration pathway for foreign nationals whose home country is unsafe to return to.

The status grants successful applicants already in the US the ability to legally stay and work in the country. Another 236 applications from Myanmar were pending as of November 10.

But the administration of President Donald Trump has sought to reduce immigration into the US.

It has therefore attempted to rescind Temporary Protected Status for several groups, including citizens of Haiti, Afghanistan, Venezuela and other countries facing instability.

Just last Friday, Trump posted on his platform Truth Social that he was “hereby terminating, effective immediately, the Temporary Protected Status (TPS Program) for Somalis in Minnesota”, accusing gangs of Somali nationals of “terrorizing” the state.

“Send them back to where they came from. It’s OVER,” Trump wrote.

Legal experts, however, question whether a president can revoke Temporary Protected Status from a specific group in a specific state. Some have accused Trump of attempting to intimidate immigrants, in order to force them to leave the country.

Under Trump, the federal government has also restricted its cap on refugee admissions to 7,500, a historic low.

In addition, the Trump administration has sought to strip hundreds of thousands of immigrants of another temporary protection called “humanitarian parole”. That programme allows immigrants to come into the country on a short-term basis due to emergency situations or humanitarian concerns.

Several of those efforts face ongoing legal challenges. So far, however, the Supreme Court has largely sided with the Trump administration.

In an unsigned May 30 decision, for instance, a majority on the high court lifted a lower court’s ruling that had barred the Department of Homeland Security from ending humanitarian parole for nearly 500,000 Cubans, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans and Haitians.

Two left-leaning justices — Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor — issued a dissent, warning that removing the pause would cause great harm to US immigrants while the legal challenge proceeds.

The decision, Brown Jackson wrote, “undervalues the devastating consequences of allowing the Government to precipitously upend the lives and livelihoods of nearly half a million noncitizens while their legal claims are pending”.

Unrest in Myanmar

In the case of Myanmar, the Department of State has issued a level-four travel advisory — the highest tier — warning against transit through the country.

It cited the risk of “armed conflict, the potential for civil unrest, arbitrary enforcement of local laws, poor health infrastructure, land mines and unexploded ordnance, crime, and wrongful detentions”.

In February 2021, the military toppled the government of President Aung San Suu Kyi, and the country has grappled with civil war ever since, marking the latest chapter in a nearly eight decades of internal unrest.

The military leadership is locked in a fight with members of the exiled government as well as armed ethnic groups and civilian opposition groups.

It has led a campaign of heavy air strikes, some of which reportedly targeted schools and hospitals. Both rebels and soldiers have been accused of human rights abuses, including torture.

The United Nations estimates the long-running conflict has created nearly 1,585,298 asylum seekers and refugees as of October, with many seeking protection in nearby countries like Bangladesh and Malaysia.

Members of the persecuted Rohingya ethnic group have been rendered stateless amid the fighting.

Citizens from Myanmar were initially given Temporary Protected Status in the US under former President Joe Biden in May 2021.

The administration then extended the protection designation twice: once in September 2022 and again in May 2024. The latest 18-month extension was slated to expire on Tuesday, November 25.

The termination of the Temporary Protected Status will take effect 60 days after the Federal Register notice is officially published.

In its statement, the Department of Homeland Security said Secretary Noem had deemed conditions in the country sufficiently safe for its citizens to return.

“Burma [Myanmar] continues to face humanitarian challenges due in part to continued military operations against armed resistance and the need for humanitarian assistance,” the notice said.

“There have, however, been improvements in Burma’s governance and stability at the national and local levels.”

The notice added that allowing Myanmar citizens to stay ran “contrary to the U.S. national interest”.

In March, the Department of Homeland Security told Congress that 9,590 Myanmar citizens were eligible for the protection, but had yet to apply.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-10T120242Z_1428126799_RC2MTHAVH2B8_RTRMADP_3_MALAYSIA-MYANMAR-CAPSIZE-1764007647.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-11-24 15:56:22.862029

SEIU President Verrett Calls on Airline Charter CEOs to Stop Profiting from ICE Deportations

Letter to Airline CEOs Demands Companies Sever Contracts with ICE Air as Trump Administration Leads Campaign of Terror Against Immigrant Communities

NATIONWIDE — April Verrett, president of Service Employees International Union (SEIU), today called on four major charter airlines to end their contracts with ICE and stop profiting from the Trump administration’s cruel and inhumane immigration policies. In letters sent to the CEOs of Avelo Airlines, Global X, Eastern Airlines, and Omni Air International, Verrett denounced the companies’ role in separating immigrant families and demanded the airlines they run immediately sever contracts with ICE Air, the agency’s air transportation arm.

Across the country, families and communities are being torn apart as ICE conducts raids that target people based on their skin color, language, workplace or neighborhood. Masked agents have detained and deported thousands, often without due process. Most of these deportation flights are operated by the four charter airlines.

In the letter to the airline CEOs, Verrett writes, “Terrorizing essential workers, families and entire communities is antithetical to responsible business practices, and it is also bad for business and the U.S. economy. Whether from a moral, legal, or economic standpoint, the bottom line is: it’s time for businesses to sever contracts with ICE Air.”

The letter is part of SEIU’s “De-ICE These Flights” campaign to protect immigrant workers and defend the constitutional rights of all working people. Nearly 10,000 SEIU members and allies have already signed the campaign’s online petition demanding the four charter airlines end contracts for ICE deportation flights.

SEIU’s campaign aims to educate institutional investors holding a stake in these companies or their parent companies on the inherent financial risks of enabling deportations, which destabilize the U.S. economy by attacking an essential immigrant workforce. SEIU members and millions of working people are participants in retirement security plans that may be exposed to the risks to the economy posed by these practices.

Avelo Airlines, Global X, Eastern Airlines, and Omni Air International and other private corporations are making millions in profits from government contracts that enable Trump’s deportation economy. On ICE deportation flights, immigrants are often shackled and subjected to abuse, including being denied access to air conditioning, toilets and the ability to protect themselves during an emergency if restrained.

SEIU represents 2 million service and care workers across the economy, including at colleges and universities, airports, hospitals, and federal, state, and local government agencies. The “De-ICE These Flights” campaign builds off SEIU’s Solidarity Summer organizing earlier this year, which culminated in a Justice Journey in Louisiana that mobilized tens of thousands of workers, allies, and communities to defend immigrant communities and ensure all workers are treated with dignity and respect.

The activists each purchased an ice scraper for just 17 cents at the store before getting back in line to return the item.
""We want to scrape ICE from our communities,"" said Palmira Figueroa, the communications director for the National Day Laborers Organizing Network.

The activists each purchased an ice scraper for just 17 cents at the store before getting back in line to return the item. The act clogged customer service lines, something they say is a political act urging Home Depot to keep federal agents out of their stores.

""We want to scrape ICE from our communities,"" said Palmira Figueroa, the communications director for the National Day Laborers Organizing Network. ""It's kind of symbolic, right, to use an ice scraper. Buy it and try to collapse their system for a moment, or for some time, with the group of people that are witnessing and are willing to stay, to stand up for the human rights of day laborers.""

For nearly an hour, the ""buy-in"" operation stalled the store from operating as usual. The protesters then marched through the aisles of Home Depot, which led management to close the store down. Figueroa said that demonstrators noticed the quick action the store took, despite not closing down for any immigration operations that had previously happened in their parking lots.

""Oh, you can actually shut a store, right? You can shut for this, but you cannot, you have not, shut them when an ICE raid and abuse is happening,"" she said.

CBS Los Angeles reached out to Home Depot officials for comment on the protest, but has not yet heard back. In previous requests for statements on immigration operations happening outside of their stores, Home Depot's communications team has repeatedly said that they do not cooperate with ICE agents and are not notified of operations before they happen.

""We want for Home Depot to condemn these ICE raids on their property,"" Figueroa said. ""We know they can do that. They should speak out, reject the use of its stores and their sites for fear and violence.""

She says that the group could organize another similar protest at another location in the near future.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/11/24/0e57f0b1-b5b9-4de5-9f22-707037da7d62/thumbnail/1200x630/98776fbc9510f631768089332be5987a/gettyimages-2247326008.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 15:56:32.161602

Its actions include unlawful detention of individuals, kidnapping people off the streets, punishing those who opposed the government and a lack of accountability to the public. There is only one organization that fits within the definition of secret police in the United States: Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE.

The agency was officially founded in 2003 under the Department of Homeland Security. In the aftermath of 9/11, agencies dealing with customs and immigration were combined. The goal was to find a more efficient way to deal with issues related to immigration enforcement.

But in the years that followed, ICE became the mechanism of the right-wing agenda for immigration. The agency under the second Trump administration has received a $75 billion increase in funding for the next five years. Huge amounts of money have been funneled to weapons, detention centers and recruitment.

The goal of this administration with ICE, along with many of its policies, has been vengeance — especially towards the enemies of the state — dictated by either the personal or political enemies of the president. Even the political staffers within the administration, who often hold antisemitic and racist views, have their own vengeance against groups who are not “Heritage Americans.”

The first target was international students who took a stand against Israeli actions in the Israel-Hamas war. ICE acted by arresting student activists, like Mahmoud Khalil, and columnists, effectively making criticism of American foreign policy illegal for foreign nationals.

But the main target of this vengeance has been Hispanic communities throughout the country. These communities have been terrorized, with streets emptied and businesses losing customers. Fear has become the norm for many millions of Americans, with or without legal status.

This has caused U.S. citizens to disappear from their families for days without any information, taken by masked men in unmarked vehicles and kept in appalling detention centers. Conditions there involve beating, lack of medical care and overcrowding, which have resulted in the deadliest year in detentions.

Such actions are done within an agency that is shameless and lacks any public accountability. ICE agents’ faces are covered, and detention centers refuse entry to congresspeople, despite being required to by law. This secrecy has given agents the ability to act without consequence in their behavior against migrants and protestors alike.

Civil liberties and human rights don’t end with foreign nationals; rights are universal. Giving the government the ability to restrict unalienable rights for some people gives it the authority to restrict those rights for all of us.

ICE is no longer just an agency focused on enforcing immigration laws in the United States, but rather has become a tool of the White House to destabilize the nation. The actions of ICE, whether in Los Angeles or in Chicago, have disrupted the community and inflamed tensions.This is by design — the White House pushed narratives of chaos and rioting in blue states to send in the troops and to exercise power over the opposition.

It is the authoritarian playbook to promote chaos in the streets, using the internal instability as an excuse to restore order. ICE has been used as a tool in this playbook, whether in Portland, Oregon, Los Angeles or Chicago.

The treatment of ICE agents or protests against the organization has been characterized as unlawful or rioting. This has been done with the ill intention of giving the president an excuse to use the Insurrection Act, giving him the authority to deploy the military within the United States.

Institutions once shaped into a certain culture often become very difficult to change. To allow an organization where the rot of abuse and racism is at its core to remain would be the greatest act of malpractice.

It will be like the failure of the Russian government to abolish the KGB following the fall of communism, an intact security apparatus that was more than happy to help facilitate the rise and rule of Vladimir Putin.

Just like the last four years, the organization will hide in the background, and the rot will grow, only to come out in full force in the next authoritarian administration to enforce its power over enemies of the state. Given that the Republican Party is indulging more in far-right beliefs, there is a possibility that the next Republican administration will be even worse.

For any reasonable believer in liberal democracy, there is only one solution to this violation of human rights: the abolishment of ICE, but also the prosecution of individuals who knowingly violate those rights. An institution that abuses people and a workforce that takes full enjoyment in inflicting harm has passed the point of reform; instead, it is a cancer on the American political system. The only option left is to remove this cancer before it kills our democracy.

This all comes less than 24 hours after ICE allegedly picked up the pieces of an NYPD enforcement operation in the same area.
Cops had confiscated more than 25 bags of counterfeit trademark items being illegally peddled by vendors in the area.
“NYPD personnel immediately left the area and did not interact with federal agents in any manner,” an NYPD spokesperson said.","The NYPD returned to Canal Street on Sunday and arrested a street vendor, confiscating counterfeit items, one day after ICE crashed a similar enforcement operation 24 hours earlier.

Just the sight of cops was enough to trigger a frantic fear of ICE on Nov. 23, as vendors were spotted stuffing their faux wallets, bags, and sunglasses into white sheets before hightailing it at the sound of a siren or the sight of a suspicious vehicle.

Throughout the day, officers from the 5th Precinct ,and others who told amNewYork they were placed on the detail from other commands, patrolled the Chinatown area in an attempt to keep the sellers away. Some of the offices stood on foot posts and prevented the vendors from returning to the area; others scouted the street, pushing the open-air market further and further back.

ICE agents, however, were not seen during Sunday’s operation.

As the day wore on, vendors stood in defiance, continuing to hawk their wares despite the NYPD’s presence nearby. This caused several clashes, with some cops pushing their way and gathering the bundles of goods, stuffing them in the back of their police cruiser, leaving a mountain in the rear seat.

In another instance, one vendor took off running, leading to a horde of cops chasing him through the street until they managed to cuff him and place him under arrest.

“Why did you run?” one cop yelled.

His fellow vendors approached the flashing lights of squad cars and argued with authorities, telling them that he was just “scared.”.

According to several vendors amNewYork spoke with, who asked to remain unnamed, many of those attempting to make a living by selling the products are on edge due to ICE activity and the prevalence of far-right influencers filming them.

One vendor named social media star Nick Shirley as being particularly problematic

“He is not a good person; he should not be doing that and working with ICE,” one man said.

“That is not what journalists should do,” another said.

This all comes less than 24 hours after ICE allegedly picked up the pieces of an NYPD enforcement operation in the same area. According to ICE themselves, they conducted an operation on Nov. 22 to arrest one Abdou Tall. The agenc caled him “an illegal alien from Senegal” and said he had multiple arrests “relating to trafficking counterfeit merchandise.”

“Tall fled from law enforcement on foot for several blocks before he tripped and fell and then continued to actively resist arrest. Our officers followed their training and successfully arrested him,” the agency claimed.

The NYPD stated that its operation took place just before 11:10 a.m. on November 22, near the corner of Canal Street and Broadway. Cops had confiscated more than 25 bags of counterfeit trademark items being illegally peddled by vendors in the area.

At around noon on Saturday, police reported, federal agents came to the location. Their operation, the NYPD said, was unrelated to any department activity.

“NYPD personnel immediately left the area and did not interact with federal agents in any manner,” an NYPD spokesperson said.

On Monday the Department of Homeland Security said it was terminating the designation of Burma (Myanmar) for Temporary Protected Status relief. It claimed that after reviewing conditions in Myanmar and consulting with appropriate US government agencies, “the secretary [Kristi Noem] determined that Burma no longer continues to meet the conditions” for TPS designation.

The order, set out in a post on the Federal Register, is expected to come in effect in 60 days.

The Trump administration has already withdrawn protected status for a number of other nationalities, including Afghanistan, Cameroon, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, South Sudan and Venezuela, as part of sweeping changes to immigration policy.

The TPS program allows immigrants from designated countries to remain in the US for up to 18 months with eligibility for legal work authorization when conditions like armed conflict or health crises make a safe return untenable. TPS status is typically renewable.

The DHS order said: “In parallel with the national political process, armed ethnic groups have established local and ethnic administrations, which have made tangible gains in governance and public services, signaling broader improvements in Burma’s stability.”

Myanmar is ruled by a military dictatorship that has a long and continuing record of executing people it deems part of resistance or pro-democracy movements.

The country was originally designated for TPS in May 2021 under the Biden administration, “on the basis of extraordinary and temporary conditions that prevented nationals of Burma from returning to the country in safety”. In 2022, the designation was extended for another 18 months, and again in March 2024 until November this year.

Nearly 10,000 people from Myanmar have been made eligible for protections.

In June, the Trump administration said it was adding Myanmar to a travel ban aimed to stop immigration from nations that it deems to have a “large-scale presence of terrorists”. The travel ban also affects citizens from Afghanistan, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.

The decision to end TPS status for Myanmar comes after a campaign to maintain the designation by the US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants (USCRI), along with dozens of relief and human rights organizations.

“The United States has a moral and legal obligation to protect those who cannot safely return to Myanmar,” said Eskinder Negash, the president of USCRI, in a statement. He said protected status for Myanmar was “not just compassionate – it’s essential”.

According to the Pew Research Center, an estimated 240,000 people in the US identified as Burmese in 2023, citing figures provided by census data.

The withdrawal of protection for Myanmar nationals comes two days after Trump also ended TPS protections for Somali immigrants in Minnesota. “Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State,” he claimed, and accused state governor Tim Walz of overseeing a state that was a “hub of fraudulent money laundering activity”.

Walz responded scathingly in a social media post: “It’s not surprising that the president has chosen to broadly target an entire community. This is what he does to change the subject.”

Each time the Trump administration has moved to end TPS relief, it has run into significant legal challenges. Earlier this month the American Civil Liberties Union warned that the administration had already placed more than 675,000 people at immediate risk of family separation, detention, and deportation. It group called the administration’s pattern of immigration actions “one of the most sweeping rollbacks of humanitarian protections in the program’s history”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aef4c8315fb8354fc145ed8377996b15e129bc88/667_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d9c8d54c5af20fc56bed8e79561006ad",N,,2025-11-24 14:57:43.240772

Congressman Krishnamoorthi underscored that the seriousness of the allegations requires a full accounting from DHS and immediate steps to restore confidence in ICE’s personnel-screening process.","WASHINGTON – Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) today sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem raising “serious concerns regarding recent reporting about lapses in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) hiring and vetting processes,” concerns made “even more urgent by the arrest of an ICE agent in Bloomington, Minnesota, during a multi-agency sting targeting individuals attempting to solicit a minor at the Mall of America.” In the letter, Congressman Krishnamoorthi wrote that although “public information about the individual’s background remains incomplete,” the nature of the allegations “heightens longstanding questions about ICE’s capacity to ensure that its personnel meet the agency’s own requirements.”

Quoting ICE’s own standards, Congressman Krishnamoorthi noted that “personnel vetting involves assessing an individual’s background, character, and other pertinent factors to ascertain their suitability” and that “all positions require security vetting and drug test,” with law enforcement vetting taking an average of three months to complete. Yet, “multiple recent investigations have revealed that ICE has permitted recruits to appear for training… before all required vetting steps were finished.”

The congressman also cited reports that instructors have discovered “disqualifying information only after recruits had already begun training,” including issues that “should have prevented their entry into the academy.” Additional independent reporting suggests that ICE’s accelerated hiring strategy could lead to “catastrophic” outcomes if vetting lapses continue unaddressed. Congressman Krishnamoorthi noted the “findings raise fundamental questions about the consistency of ICE’s practices with its own publicly posted protocols, and whether systemic weaknesses, procedural shortcuts, or oversight gaps are undermining the integrity of the personnel-screening process.”

Congressman Krishnamoorthi requested a detailed response from Secretary Noem by December 10 to oversight concerns in five key areas:

The vetting steps completed for the Bloomington employee and whether required procedures were followed.

The Associated Press has published the results of a wide-ranging investigation showing that the U.S. Border Patrol has built a nationwide dragnet driver-surveillance system that it uses to target people it thinks are “suspicious.” The Border Patrol, which most Americans probably just think, as its name says, patrols the border, has long been a lawless, rogue agency. Now it appears to have become an ugly new nationwide intelligence agency and police force that targets innocent people using techniques that should be unacceptable in a free society.

Congress needs to act rapidly to rein in this program, as do state and local governments that are allowing some of these federal agencies to put plate readers on their highways and their law enforcement officers to participate directly and through data sharing arrangements.

Here’s how it works:

Collect data on Americans’ movements. The U.S. Border Patrol (which is part of Customs and Border Protection [CBP], which is part of DHS) has secretively built a system of automated license plate readers (ALPR) across the nation that carries out dragnet surveillance of millions of Americans’ movements

Identify “suspicious” movement patterns. Border Patrol “intelligence” operatives monitor this data for movements they deem suspicious. We know little about what they consider suspicious, or what kinds of AI algorithms they are using to do so.

Find an excuse to pull them over. Local police, acting at the behest of the feds, then pull over the targeted driver using what is known as a “pretext stop,” in which officers use real or claimed minor traffic violations as an excuse to pull over a driver whom they really want to target for other reasons.

Interrogate, search, and seize. Once the person has been stopped due to some supposed legal violation, they are aggressively questioned, according to the AP, and often searched and subject to having their property seized without proof of wrongdoing in a manner tantamount to theft.

Not only is the Border Patrol engaging in a mass-surveillance domestic intelligence operation, but it’s about to receive billions more with which to build this system as the Trump Administration and Congress funnel money into anti-immigration efforts.

This system is rife with problems

The Border Patrol’s surveillance infrastructure is made up of its own plate readers strung across highways from the southern border to such faraway places as Illinois and Michigan. We don’t know the full extent of their placement. It also accesses a similar nationwide network of plate readers run by the DEA, and has been authorized to access systems operated by private companies. Immigration agencies’ access to data collected by the ALPR company Flock has sparked widespread controversy, and the company, which is feeling the heat, says it no longer has a formal relationship with any DHS agencies. But there are other companies in this space that engage in mass driver surveillance, including Motorola (operating as Vigilant) and Rekor. Neither company responded to a request for comment by AP. We know that at least ICE has direct access to the Vigilant database, and they and other immigration agencies may also have contracts with Rekor.

We know little about how the government singles people out for stops. We do know that private companies advertise the ability to not only collect data on Americans’ comings and goings, but also to use AI to flag some people with supposedly suspicious travel patterns. I recently wrote about how the company Flock has been doing this; both Vigilant and Rekor also boast that they do the same.

A former CBP official told the AP that the agency develops “patterns of life” about people to try to detect when they deviate from their normal daily routine in suspicious ways. This is a term for an activity that stretches back to the use of aerial mass surveillance during the Iraq war, when searches for patterns of life were used to try to locate Iraqi resistance fighters planting roadside bombs. Of unclear effectiveness and impossible to carry out at scale without watching everyone all the time, pattern-of-life surveillance has clearly now been brought home. (In 2021, an attempt by Baltimore police to deploy mass aerial surveillance akin to that used in Iraq was struck down by the courts).) Logs of nationwide Flock plate searches obtained by the ACLU of Massachusetts show that “pattern of life” has been listed regularly as the purpose of a search by police agencies across the country.

Once a target is identified, the AP reports, officers use such alleged violations as speeding (even slightly over the limit), failure to signal, window tinting, or a dangling air freshener supposedly blocking the driver’s view. “The beautiful thing about the Texas Traffic Code is there’s thousands of things you can stop a vehicle for,” declared a sheriff’s deputy in that state. (There’s no reason to think that Texas is an outlier among states when it comes to traffic law complexity.)

Law enforcement can’t search a person’s car under the Constitution without either permission or probable cause on the officer’s part to believe that the car contains evidence of a crime, but in reality intimidated drivers often give such permission, or officers use bogus dog sniffs to obtain probable cause. The AP also reported that the authorities “often” used the American policing profession’s corrupt and abusive practice of civil asset forfeiture, in which police seize cash and vehicles without proof of wrongdoing. That forces drivers to engage in expensive legal battles to regain their property; often they’re never able.

A secretive system hidden from Americans

Do Americans want their government engaging in this kind of activity? That’s doubtful, but they haven’t even been able to make a judgment because these agencies have been keeping it largely secret. According to the AP,

The Border Patrol has for years hidden details of its license plate reader program, trying to keep any mention of the program out of court documents and police reports, former officials say, even going so far as to propose dropping charges rather than risk revealing any details about the placement and use of their covert license plate readers. Readers are often disguised along highways in traffic safety equipment like drums and barrels.

This stratagem is known as evidence laundering or “parallel construction.” It was so-named by the DEA, which used it to hide leads that it was obtaining from NSA surveillance that was carried out without a warrant, under the justification that it was purely for national security purposes rather than for criminal law enforcement. “It's just like laundering money — you work it backwards to make it clean,” a former agent told Reuters of the DEA program.

The signs appeared in late October across the Southwest Side, which was heavily targeted under President Donald Trump’s aggressive deportation effort dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz” that began in early September.

Sarita Hernandez and Selva Zafiro, co-founders of Marimacha Monarca Press in McKinley Park, were working at a community art event when members of the Southwest Rapid Response team — part of the immigrant coalition — approached them with an idea.

The response team sought the art collective’s help to ensure the gravity of the unprecedented surge in immigration arrests isn’t forgotten.

The signs intentionally resemble the temporary no parking or tow zone signs familiar to Chicagoans.

“It serves as a made-you-look kind of intervention, but then what it actually is doing is documenting something that permanently has impacted many of our communities, has permanently changed people’s lives, has permanently ripped apart families,” Hernandez said.

Marimacha Monarca Press has printed at least 100 signs and plans to keep printing more until rapid response teams no longer request them.

Dozens of signs have been placed throughout Archer Heights, Back of the Yards and Brighton Park, said Karina Martinez with the Brighton Park Neighborhood Council, which is part of Southwest Rapid Response.

Other artists have caught on to the effort and designed similar signs that have appeared in some North and Northwest Side neighborhoods. Those signs are headed with a Chicago flag and the word “Emergency” and below read “ICE abducted someone here,” along with a date and time, and the same phone number.

The feds have scaled back “Operation Midway Blitz,” which brought about 250 immigration agents to Chicago. U.S. Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino and 150 agents left town this month after eight weeks of chaotic arrests that led to agents routinely using tear gas and pepper balls against protesters.

The Department of Homeland Security has not released a full account of how many people were detained during its increased activity between early September and mid-November. A DHS spokesperson didn’t respond to a request for comment.

A lawyer for the National Immigrant Justice Center has said more than 3,000 people were arrested. The exact number of people who have been released, deported or remain in custody is unclear.

A Chicago federal appeals court recently put a temporary hold on a judge’s order that would have released up to 615 people detained by immigration authorities this year. Those detainees come from a list of about 1,800 people arrested by ICE in the Chicago area between June 11 and Oct. 7, according to Mark Fleming, an attorney with the National Immigrant Justice Center.

Despite the feds’ curtailment, Martinez said there were still plenty the community is sorting through.

“This project was not necessarily to make people feel that there’s a danger in being outside but making sure that we’re making space to remember folks,” Martinez said.

“Let’s remember that there’s actual people who are impacted by these policies and these are families that are being impacted. This is someone’s dad, someone’s mom, someone’s child. And their presence being lacked in their community has an impact,” she said.

The signs appear similar to other remembrance sites throughout history, like the Stolpersteine stones across Europe that memorialize victims of the Holocaust at their last-known residence. The Chicago Race Riot of 1919 Commemoration Project has been installing brick-shaped glass memorials in sidewalks throughout Chicago where those killings a century ago occurred, as reported recently by the Sun-Times.

“That kind of public sign posting of injustice — that occurs to me as a parallel in Germany to what these people who are putting up these signs are trying to get people to notice,” said Peter Hayes, a history professor at Northwestern University who studies Nazi Germany and the Holocaust.

Martinez, with the Brighton Park Neighborhood Council, says the endeavor to tag spots where ICE has taken people was inspired by similar efforts in other cities, including Portland and Washington, D.C.

They started posting them around Día de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead.

“I think it was very intentional for us to take up space and bring awareness to people who have been taken and recognize that families are missing their loved ones,” Martinez said. “Maybe not in similar ways in that they have passed, but they are no longer together with their family.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c6b1fc9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x585+0+49/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F58%2Fa7%2F2c9c42434e91a494c06691a0490c%2Ficesigns-112025-05.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 12:57:18.724677

“This government got elected promising to reject Trump-style politics, but Bill C-12 is the opposite of that.","OTTAWA – A broad coalition of groups from across Canada is sounding an urgent alarm in advance of a critical parliamentary vote on Bill C-12.

The bill would open the door to discrimination and violations of human rights and due process in Canada’s immigration system, authorize sharing of sensitive personal immigration information, and expand dangerous approaches to drug policy. Yet it is being pushed through parliament with minimal debate while those that will be impacted by its sweeping changes are locked out of the process.

“This deeply concerning and highly controversial legislation will put many refugees in danger, risking their return to persecution in violation of rights protected under the Charter and international law,” said Gauri Sreenivasan, Co-Executive Director of the Canadian Council of Refugees. “And yet the bill is moving at break neck speed through Parliament while those with expertise and lived experience who want to advise on its dangers are shut out of the process. Neither the law nor the public interest is being served.”

The bill will deny many refugees access to fair and independent assessment and full appeal of their claims by the Immigration and Refugee Board because of arbitrary time limits and exclusions. This approach will not streamline Canada’s processing of refugee claims, but will lead to lower quality decisions while shifting backlogs to our already overburdened Federal Courts and to IRCC.

The bill will also compound harm arising from the Canada-US Safe Third Country Agreement, which abandons many refugees to the U.S. immigration system at a time when well documented human rights violations have become the dominant feature of that system.

”Bill C-12 would deny protection to vulnerable people irrespective of changes to their personal circumstances or political conditions back home. So many people like me, who sought safety here and have made lives here, would be shut out by this Bill. This isn’t just policy, it’s people’s lives,” said Tonny Muzira, Co-Founder & Director of Advocacy and Partnerships Centre for Black Development Options Canada. “Canada cannot turn its back on those seeking safety.”

Under Bill C-12, the government will also be able to cancel or suspend immigration documents and applications based on an undefined assessment of the “public interest”. This power grants dangerous discretionary power to the government without any individualized assessment or procedural safeguards.

“The bill sets up open-ended powers with little thought to the consequences and inevitable abuse”, said Louis-Philippe Jannard, of the Table de concertation des organismes au service des personnes réfugiées et immigrantes (TCRI). “We haven’t seen such broad, discretionary powers in our immigration system since the 1970’s, when their abuse led to rampant discrimination and fatal decisions.”

Bill C-12 would also authorize the government to share highly sensitive immigration information with few limitations. This includes changes in gender identity and the status of any refugee claimants, exposing vulnerable people in Canada to severe risk.

“Broad dissemination of sensitive personal information can place migrants and refugees at significant risk of discrimination and persecution in Canada and abroad”, said Tamir Israel, Director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association’s Privacy, Surveillance and Technology Program. “Despite this significant potential for abuse, Bill C-12 lacks minimum safeguards like the need to ensure information sharing is necessary and proportionate.”

Bill C-12 also doubles down on prohibition-based drug policy that has demonstrably failed to protect public health and safety.

“Instead of funding affordable housing and other health and social supports, Canada is supporting U.S.-led militarized drug enforcement,” said Nick Boyce, from the Canadian Drug Policy Coalition. “If Canada follows this path, it will be complicit in violations of international human rights law.”

In disregard of the dire risks posed by this legislative proposal, the bill has been fast-tracked and received minimal consideration in Parliament. It is scheduled for a final vote by the Standing Committee on Public Safety tomorrow—just three weeks after its study of the bill began.

Despite the highly attenuated timeline, dozens of refugee and migrant groups, human rights groups, labour organizations, health advocacy groups, representatives of the Black community, gender based violence groups, legal professional bodies, drug policy groups and others requested to speak at committee hearings but were denied. They have also submitted briefs expressing concern regarding Bill C-12’s consequences.

These groups were largely absent from committee proceedings and MPs will not have the time to consider the long list of concerns raised by these submissions. In contrast, MPs heard repeatedly from border and policing agencies and officials. The end result is that the voices of those most impacted by Bill C-12 have not been heard.

“MPs and the public should be extremely concerned that the government is fast-tracking legislation that will only multiply the possibility of discrimination, exploitation, and violations of human rights,” said Karen Cocq of the Migrant Rights Network. “This government got elected promising to reject Trump-style politics, but Bill C-12 is the opposite of that. This bill cannot be fixed, it must be withdrawn.”",https://ccla.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/travelers-stand-in-line-at-customs-and-immigration-ST7UX75.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 11:57:18.301535

An emergency meeting was set for 6 p.m. and the small chamber quickly swelled to capacity, packed with Newport residents waiting to hear how the council would react to what many saw as a dire threat.

“We’re going to do everything we can to fight this,” Mayor Jan Kaplan told his audience, to wild applause. “That’s where we stand.”

Days earlier, rumors had begun to blow through Newport like a stiff sea breeze. By the time of the meeting, many in the small coastal city were convinced: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was looking to build an immigrant detention center in town.

Evidence seemed to be growing by the day.

To start with, the U.S. Coast Guard helicopter that for decades stood ready to rescue imperiled crabbers and fishermen had disappeared from the city-owned airport. On the brink of a dangerous Dungeness crab season, the closest rescue aircraft was now 100 miles away.

“That ocean can get up on its hind legs and it can smack you down,” one man, a Navy veteran, testified at the emergency meeting. “We need that helicopter here.”

All signs of what might be on deck to replace the helicopter pointed in one direction.

On Nov. 4, a federal defense contractor wrote the city, asking to lease 4 acres of land at the local airport – right next to the base where the helicopter had lived.

Then other contractors popped up. One began asking about the cost of trucking thousands of gallons of human waste away from the airport every day. Another posted want ads for ICE detention officers in Newport.

The conclusion was inescapable to many residents: ICE was coming, and those who’d gathered in City Hall wanted none of it.

Some in the crowd wept when a teenage girl explained how frightening and sad her life had become since September, when her father was detained by ICE and sent to a detention center in Tacoma, Wash.

“No one deserves to get picked up,” the girl said. “My dad was my everything.”

With its scenic bayfront, popular aquarium and sizable commercial fishing fleet, Newport is an emblem of the Oregon coast – and, with 10,000 residents, one of its largest cities. But weeks after the meeting, the city finds itself in a sort of limbo.

Facing down twin crises – one over the wellbeing of its crabbers, the other over the wellbeing of its immigrant community – it’s still not sure when, or if, immigration agents might arrive.

ICE, the Coast Guard, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security have declined to provide details to local officials, members of Congress and the press. ICE may have backed off in the face of public blowback. Or it might be regrouping.

“Nobody within the administration, within DHS, has treated this city with a modicum of respect or courtesy,” Kaplan told OPB. “It’s like, ‘We’re going to perch on your doorstep, and you only know it because maybe there’s a rumor.’”

Taunette Dixon thought helicopter drama was behind her.

In 2014, the Coast Guard announced it intended to close its air base in Newport to save money. Dixon was one of those who fought back.

A nonprofit she volunteers with, Newport Fishermen’s Wives, sued to block the closure, alongside the city of Newport and Lincoln County. Congress wound up finding money to keep the base open.

In the years since, Dixon says the Coast Guard had been communicative and helpful. Any time the helicopter needed to travel away from Newport, for any reason, officials would call the Fishermen’s Wives to explain.

But suddenly, history was repeating itself.

“I had somebody call me and say, ‘I am pretty sure that the Coast Guard has removed itself from the air station,’” Dixon said in an interview with OPB last week. “I’m like, I can’t believe that’s true. We worked so hard to keep the helicopter here.”

The timing could hardly have been worse.

In the self-proclaimed “Dungeness crab capital of the world,” the beginning of December is something of an early Christmas, Dixon says.

Crabbing boats are preparing to start the season with a two-week sprint that will dictate whether or not they are successful.

“If it’s not good seas, then that’s a very unsafe position for boats to be in – especially the small boats,” said Dixon, who co-owns a boat with her husband. “Between the ocean, between the tides, between the environment, it doesn’t take long to lose your life.”

A sturdy pavilion perched above the Pacific Ocean illustrates what’s at stake. The Newport Fishermen’s Memorial Sanctuary is a pew-lined structure in a local state park, where houseless residents sometimes seek shelter.

At the building’s heart is a monument bearing the names and pictures of local fishermen who have died at sea. The Newport Fishermen’s Wives keep the vigil and assist families when it adds a name.

“Almost every year, I’m making phone calls to families because we have lost a boat and somebody hasn’t survived,” said Dixon, who is part of a generations-old fishing family that has lost loved ones in the Pacific Ocean. “If anybody had to meet these families, I think they would have a better idea of how crucial it is to have this rescue helicopter here.”

But the Coast Guard has refused to explain its decision.

Dixon says the agency has rebuffed her efforts to learn more about the helicopter.

U.S. Rep. Val Hoyle, a Democrat who represents Newport, says the same.

A hearing is about to start in Abrego Garcia's civil case. I'll try to cover for @lawfaremedia.org . Colleague @annabower.bsky.social might be joining. Among other things, govt is seeking to dissolve Judge Xinis's preliminary injunction preventing Abrego from being removed immediately. /1

We've been a little swamped here at @lawfaremedia.org so I'll do best I can. Little less prepared than usual. Judge Xinis wants to hear testimony from John Cantú, an ICE official, who said in a sealed declaration that Costa Rica now won't accept Abrego. Govt wants Cantu's testimony sealed. ... /2

Parts of this hearing could be quite technical. Govt argues that Abrego's claims at this point should be handled in the DVD class action in Massachusetts, or are barred by various ""jurisdiction-stripping"" statutes that bar district courts from getting involved. /3

Judge Xinis now on bench. counsel give appearances. Cantu is present. Xinis says this is probably last hearing on Abrego's habeas. First she wants to rule on some pending motions to seal. /4

She'll take open court testimony from Cantu followed by sealed testimony if necessary. Then she'll hear the motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction. She's now deciding whether certain exhibits should remained sealed. Andrew Rossman, for Abrego, is not fighting sealing. /5

Judge Xinis concerned that there's often over-sealing. Thinks some of these docs can be redacted. But some are diplomatic notes or documents Secy of State Rubio prepared, which she understands should be sealed. She's taking the matter under advisement. Wants attys to try to redact. /6

DOJ atty Jonathan Guynn points out some sealed info is about Abrego's personal background which he might want sealed. Xinis now says she'll unseal Cantu's declaration. She doesn't see any privileged info in it, though it may reference such info. DOJ atty Molina says govt's okay with unsealing. /7

So ECF 75-16 (Exhibit S) will become public, I think. Turning to testimony from John Cantu DOJ atty Guynn will do a quick direct and turn John Cantu over for cross-examination by Abrego's attys. John Edward Cantú Guynn: where are you employed? C: US ICE Enforcement & removal operations (ERO) /8

His testimony is done. no redirect. no sealed testimony. Judge Xinis is going to take a 15 minute break and then hear oral argument. /46

Now resuming. Xinis back on bench for argument. will start with Andrew Rossman for Abrego. Rossman: 3/12/25 Abrego taken into custody & removed to El salvador where prote cted by court order against being removed to. imprisoned. beaten. 5 orders & 3 months to get him returned. /47

Govt came in and told hyou they were powerless to bring him back. since that time we first came into this court, there's been unrelenting cmapaign to deprive him of due prodcess. to retaliate against him for asserting his c'l rights. make him poster child for broader agenda Adm has /48

I'm going to talk about treatment of Abrego & treatment of this court. history shows bad faith. shows malice— Judge: this course maybe relevant to Abrego I case, but i'd like you to focus on 5 counts are your principal ones & why & whether this court has jurisdiction to provide relief /49

Rossman: a\nd that's where i'm going. due process claims of habeas have 3 parts Judge says thing she's really focused on ... the absence of an order of removal. there is none in the docket. R: we've not seen one. we've seen order of withholding. the 2019 order proceeds as if there'd been one. /50

J: that argument in my view guides this case. guides the jurisdictional arguments. legality of wht govt did and what it's trying to do now. how do i say removal is reasonably foreseeable if there's no removal order? R: that's right. critically important. due process rights accorded to all /51

Rossman ... includes right to be heard before removal to a 3d country -- JGG, for instance -- in 2019 there was only one country govt sought to remove abrego to. withholding blocked that path. govt made no effort to remove him to 3d country. no opportunity to raise hand and designate another /52

R: ... everything has to start with final order of removal. not overly fastidious of us to insist on J: govt has quietly said it's the withholding of remov al order. they cite that opinion. that's only one ever given. makes oblique reference to removal to guatemala R: yes glitch in opinion /53

Judge: what do you say to argument: can't have withholding without an order of removal? R: that assumes to much. in convention against torture case we cite ... Riley case: (phonetic) wasn't sufficient to reference it, need to reference final order of removal /54

Judge: clear in 4th Circuit that one cannot substitute for other. but i think govt will say, you can't make that call cause you don't have j.d. Statutes that deprive you of j.d. to review final orders of removal--what's your response. Rossman: first level of response-- Mr. Jonathan Cooper /55

R: ... will address more particular questions but YH certainly has j.d. over due process violations. if you want to pivot immediately to jursidictional questions i can give you mr. cooper J: so much pivots on whether there's an order of removal. there's also ""parole."" /56

J: i think i've got to answer that first. if i have j.d. to take judicial notice of record, and there's no order of removal, than at a minimum Abrego is entitled to certain relief. R: that's right. entire structure govt has built crumbles if there's no final order of removal /57

R: most of our brief is about--even if they have one, there's legions of reasons there are violations of due process. i can unpack that or we can focus on jurisdiction. J: let's unpack that R: relief--we think relief should be granting petition. Abrego should be released. at minimum, /58

R: ... he should be provided conditional release. Give govt short period to show they have c'l valid basis to remove him. if they want to put him on next plane to costa rica, [fine with us.] J: govt saying costa rica saying no. i dont have any evidence of that, frankly. R: that's the problem /59

R: if govt fails to prove Costa Rica is off the table, our perspective we got a triple hearsay affidavit with zero evidentiary value. you ordered to produce a knowledgeable witness. he was a nice witness. but no knowledge. J:i thought govt's 1st level point was: your time to choose C.R. was ... /60

Judge: ... 6 years ago. now it's too late. Rossman: that would have to imagine that it's consistent with due process to reqwuire client who having rec'd withholding to one and only country govt sought to remove him -- imagine Abrego would have crystal ball that he'd be asked one day to go /61

... to Uganda, or Eswatini, or Ghana, or Liberia & then designate a country where he was willing to go. Judge: if you have that conversation in first instance, because there is no order of removal -- how can we hold abrego responsible for not designating country then R: i wholeheartedly agree /62

Rossman: ... without that order, you dont have effective functioning of the statute. Abrego's deprived of protections congress afforded him to make a designation. the language is ""shall"" not may. mandatory. only override: country unwilling. there's been a failure of evidence on that. /63

R: only other exception: prejudice to the US. clearly doesn't apply since govt went to Costa Rica and got assurances when they were trying to get him to plead. to complete the menu, govt takes position, pursuant to 3/31/25 memo, that can send him to Liberia so long as their own official ... /64

Rossman: finds no reasonable fear. there has to be review by an immigration judge -- that's bear minimum on procedural level in terms of due process. primary request: release. you could condition it on govt providing c'l valid basis of removal. J: i dont understand R: if govt does not do X ... /65

... 2 within 3 days -- like agreement to take him to Costa Rica -- then he will be released. give govt one last clear chance to do it right way. J: if i find no order of removal on docket-- R: he should be released. J: conditional -- should be given 3 days to get an order R: well, i don't know /66

R: ... about that. J: I remember Reuveni telling me on first day--'you're not gonna like it but' he didn't have a document called an order of removal. R: that hasn't changed. ... could give govt one last chance -- 3 days -- to do it right way. alternative minimum: injunction prohibiting ... /67

R: ... removal without according him immigration review process before he can be removed. they way i'm thinking of it. you dont need to reach the alternative minimum grounds if he's released. But Rossman wants to consult with co-counsel. Judge: if i grant relief, no basis to enjoin further /68

Judge: ... i dont see ongoing vitality to injunction if i accord the kind of relief you're talking about R: not sure that's right. Maldonado in DNJ. different issue. but court granted writ, released petitioner, but still enjoined govt from rearresting the person under the contested portion of /69

R: ... statute [Rossman now consulting with co-counsel Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg about this.] Sandoval-Moshenberg will address court directly. S-M: relatively common in Zadvydas petition for court to order release with no re-detention unless such-and-such. /70

Judge: thing i'm stuck on is to have such a fundamental absence in the record. different posture to be in. no order of removal. until govt comes up with one. what if they do get one. S-M: if no removal order, habeas should be immediate. immediate release. 7 months of litigating. no need for more /71

Judge: in Abrego I my order was to restore Abrego to status quo ante. return to MD and have his immigration case continue in MD. you moved to reopen and it got transferred outside my j.d. so after immediate release, & a notice to appear [materializes] ... /72

S-M: the existence or non-existence of order of removal is something you have j.d. to enter. when his valid parole expires, or they revoke it, he could receive a new notice to appear. The other option govt has, if willing to concede error--they could file motion to re-open. /73

Judge: what's going on with immigration case -- S-M: motion to reopen we filed seeking asylum, that was denied by immigration judge. we filed appeal to bureau of immigration appeals. it's not yet issued order. /74

Rossman: I'd just say, putting aside absence of order of removal, we think we've won overwhelmingly on the 1231b2 claim. that merits a grant of the petition. would not have qualms with giving govt 3 days to remove him to costa rica, which would [moot the issue]. /75

Rossman passes lectern to Jonathan Cooper to discuss jurisdiction and DVD Cooper: govt reads 8 uSC 1252 to create a jurisdictional black hole that [gives aliens no rights against being removed to 3d countries]. 2 bedrock principles. strong presumption in favor of judicial review of agency acts /76

other is presumption in favor of providing habeas jurisdiction. SCOTUS has rejected this notion in cases like Reno v -- Judge: but govt ssaying a lot of what you're asking for is substantive review. particular country. really not in this court. idea was to eliminate habeas & have those ... /76

Judge: ... be determined by Court of Appeals (reviewing BIA and immigration judge). Cooper: Abrego challenges process. congress has never withdrawn review for those kinds of claims. that's what scotus said in Reno v AADC and [other cases]. /77

Cooper: you asked Rossman, is there j.d. to decide if there's a removal order in the record. question in DVD class is that there must be an order of removal. for him to be in that class, govt must produce order of removal. /78

J: they'll say order of withholding assumes & subsumes order of removal C: [yes, but it's telling that 7 months after Reuveni told you about that absence, govt has still not come up with one.] [he cites an 8th Circuit case he says requires an actual order.] /79

Cooper: with respect to DVD, we submit that it does not foreclose Abrego's claims 1. no final order of removal on record 2. his claims are very different. he raises challenges to his detention. 3. procedural challenges to 3d country removal process, including unique challenges ... /80

Cooper: ... the failure to comply with his designation of costa rica. unique procedural challenges not covered lby DVD 4. even if he were a member of the class, 4th Cir has held that class actions are exception to ""splitting"" concept. Also think Abrego would have mandatory right to opt out /81

Cooper: ... of the class. J: and govt has argued that the DVD class is an improper class Cooper: [yes] we cite to Philips Petroleum case ... members of class involving monetary claims have due process right to opt out. should be true if you're being deprived of life & liberty as well. /82

Cooper now addressing 5 USC 1252g. (One of the jurisdiction stripping provisions.) it's narrow. applies only to discretionary decisions by AG in 3 limited situations. commencing proceedings, adjudicating cases, executing removal orders. /83

Abrego is challenging detention & processes for 3d country removal. [He cites rulings to effect that such issues not barred by 1252g] Next govt goes to 8 USC 1252a5 and b9--idea that these issues need to be funneled to US Court of Appeals (after immigration court & BIA). /84

Cooper makes similar argument as to those--challenges to detention or 3d country removal processes not covered. next govt talks about 1252a4 and FARRA section 2242d. those are similar. talk about challenges to immigration judge's resolution of Convention Against Torture claim. /85

Cooper: Abrego not challenging a CAT decision. Judge: ... he's not getting enough process to even tee that question up Cooper: exactly. last j.d. bar: 1252a2b, about denials of dlscretionary relief. nothing he's seeking here is discretionary. /86

Cooper: for all those reasons, none of j.d.'l bars apply here. Drew Ensign for govt: start with final order of removal piece. there is one. Judge: there's 3 aspects of that order. none says order removed to any country. doesn't say order removed. Ensign: not in so many words. /87

Ensign: it says application to asylum is denied. J: i am just interested in finding the order of removal. not here to fight on whethe IJ was right. this doc says denying asylum because of time it took Abrego to bring it. E: correct, but context of order is imoprtant. he conceded removability /88

J: point me to the language that is the order of removal. E: the withholding order necessarily would only exist bercause he otherwise had been determined removable. final order would hvae issued, and did by operation of law by rejecting his only defense--asylum. /89

J: there's ample law that says you can't just consider withholding a removal order by operation of law. judge wilkinson said it well. in opining on imporatnce of this question in [missed it] 943 f3d 205 : ... /90

Judge: when IJ grants withholding of removal, an explicit order of removal must be included in the decision. for 2 reasons. matter of simple logic. [she reads from Judge wilkinson's decision] Judge: jurisdiction begins with the order. why should i do it differently here? /91

E: [makes same argument as before] he's adjudicated all issues and by operation of law, by adjudicating abrego's only defense, this is a final order of removal. J: you're argument is not that the document says that. you're saying by operation i should construe it that way. E: [yes] /92

E: [E saying that the order in total context leads to that conclusion] ... Judge & Ensign now having back-and-forth I can't follow. J: This doesn't look anything like an order of removal. doesn't designate the country. does it? E: it does not. /93

J: it granted withholding to Guatemala. let's not gloss over that. people make mistakes. but notably in conclusion, said DHS hasn't shown changted circumstances in Guatemala. he got the country wrong. so how do i say what country he's been removed to. E: [there are ways to fix these mistakes.] /94

J: i'm just here to determine if i have j.d. All these sections you're citing depend on existence of removal order. E: i dont think that premise is correct for all of them. 1252g would not apply--does presuppose execution of order of removal. b /95

E: but a5 and b9 are different clauses that funnel everything thru a court of appeals. b9 does refer to final orders of removal but a5 does not. J: wait. you could say anything in the record is an order and if you say it's an order i'm barred from reviewing it? E: no ... /96

J: i'm not opining on sufficiency of an order. i'm taking notice of a court file and this thing is missing. if no order, on what authority can abrego be detained for imminent removal. removal is predicated on an order. under zadvydas--i have authority to review legality of prolonged detention /97

E: we agree a9 and b5 not bar to challenging prolonged detention. ... Zadvydas--those claims are reviewable. but those fails on the merits. [Zadvydas is idea that he's being subjected to prolonged detention without a reasonable likelihood of being removed.] /98

J: it doesn't seem to imminent or reasonable foreseeable that he'll be removed because no final order of removal. E: if no order of removal, zadvydas doesn't apply. J: principle remains. if a person ... if not 1231 it's nothing right now. you may proceed with new removal order with new plan. /99

J: but as of today ... if you're being held by govt for removal purposes and removal is not reasonably foreseeable, you're entitlted to release. E: i dont believe that's the state of the law. ... he cites scotus ruling in Jennings. J: only basis to hold abrego is 1231. without valid order /100

J: ... of removal ... E: several reactions YH. [she laughs] E: could issue new NTA [notice to appear] which would allow detentino under 1225 and 1226. could potentially detain him under original NTA. J: you may be right. lot of questions mooted out. /101

J: where we are now is only basis for holding him is 1231. (that's the provision about how you remove an alien to a third country if he has an order of removal and can't go to his home country.) /103

J: [curiosity you won't send him to costa rica] E: that is not an open door J: no basis to say that. we've had 4 applicant countries. every time the govt gives me factual predicate. this witness said nothing today. i just want underlying info. /104

J: do you know why costa rica is not on table? E: [he wasn't privy to any of the discussions] J: you're saying CR has rescinded the offer it made in record. it wasn't conditional. i'd love to see evidence. & rest assure this isn't empty word salad of an affidavit. /105

judge is pressing Ensign on why won't the govt just send him to costa rica. yhou want me to make finding CR is no longer on the table, but you won't show me the work. not for public consumption. record's going to be cflosed as of today. in terms of future proceedings where i issue an order /106

on what the witness should be prepared on. it's not followed. 3 times. i issue an order to provide a witness prepared to testify on an issue. it's not followed. this was the worst yet. he didnt know the meaning of rthe words in his affidavit. E: defendants believe this is not reviewable. /107

E: DHS Secy has power to say removal to CR is prejudicial to US and that's not subjecto to judicial review. J: i hear you. [we go back to jurisdictional issues]. E: turn back to 1252g. execution of removal orders is squarely within it. /108

J: and procedural challenges also barred? E: correct. they've also implied that these claims are not covered because it's not discretionary--that's been rejected by courts of appeals. 243 F3d at 214. /109

E: ... challenge that Liberia would torture or persecute him--only fears he raises in his brief. He's really concerned about being sent back to El Salvador. US has rec'd assurances that won't happen. J: Maybe IJ would agree with asylum officer. doesn't mean he doesn't get review. /110

J: speaking of foregone conclusion--how is it after abrego won, when i ordered him to be returned and restored to status quo ante, how is it when he is restored & detained in Baltimore & petitioners move to reopen, case is assigned to IJ with no ties to this j.d. E: i dont specifically know /111

J: you don't know? why sent to Atlanta. petitioner raises disturbing statistic. IJ has very high rate of denial for asylum claims. would mr. Molina know? E: dont know why it ended up there. happy to try to find out. J: if you start process over, where would it start? E: dont know. /112

E: dont know how DHS would handle. dont know of a parallel case. J: Is IJ that had it before still on bench? E: dont think so. J: and no Baltimore IJ available so it went to Atlanta? E: dont know. ... there's docket management. Molina: i don't know why. /113

Molina: it's something we can look. into. J: if it's out of the ordinary, that's a problem. my order was to restore him to status quo ante. M: new immigration judge uses baltimore heading ... J: would still be 4th Circuit case? /114

M: that's correct. ... govt's perspective is: when case is assigned to Baltimore, that's location of hearing even if IJ is in Hawaii. no venue change. still a baltimore immigration case. J: thank you for that /115

Ensign turns to due process. He is saying courts can't review diplomatic assurances. Munif categorically precludes courts as matter of law from second guessing executive's determination regarding torture and related matters are credible. /116

[Judge Xinis likes to talk things out. I'm running out of steam here. I'm only going to pipe in more periodically from here on out.] /117

[Ensign saying Liberia has given explicit assurances that no refoulement--that is, re-deportation--to El Salvador will occur, and courts can't review dept of state's assessment that those reassurances are credible.] /118

[Ensign now arguing that unlawful admission limits due process rights, even for those who have been inside this country for years. Accordingly, he's not due any more process than what's provided by statute. Can't relay on due process clause to create additional procedures.] /119

DOJ's Ensign now rebutting idea that jurisdictional bars create a ""judicial black hole."" Says 1252g is broad but it's not a black hole. it channels those claims to different courts--immigration judge to bureau of immigration appeals (BIA) to US Court of Appeals. /120

Ensign says govt reads SCOTUS's DVD ruling more broadly than they do. J: we can have long debate about the infirmities of how the class was defined. it's very broad. why isn't it possible SCOTUS stayed injunction just on breadth of class definition. can't read more into it. /121

Ensign is done. Judge: if i grant relief on Zadvydas, and adjudicate the petition, what assurance do I get that govt won't just remove him to 3d country? E: too many permutations to answer that question. /122

J: what if it's based on prolonged detention because there's no order of removal. E: strongly suspect, if court holds no final order of removal, govt would take the position that additional injunction not needed. we'd disagree that j.d. exists for that. /123

J: well maybe i'll table the motion to dissolve the petition. if i deny petition, i'll dissolve injunction. if i grant petition, i'll see. maybe i'll do petition and then turn to the motion to dissolve. E: makes sense. decide the habeas first. Rossman agrees to table the injunction issue. /124

Rossman: Ensign cited Kaplan case. 1925 case. Detainee stopped at ellis island. was minor. middle of the war. didn't send back to russia. held him in constructive custody of an orphanage. had never crossed theshold into US. /125

Zadvydas 60 years later says after person enters country things change. same in clark v martinez, 7-2, by Scalia. zadvydas applies to inadmissible immigrants. once they're here, no question at all they're entitled to full measure of due process. govt trying to transport us back /126

... to a [different] century. ... on issue of status of my client would have in liberia--critical that liberia has only said it would be temporary. has not agreed to give him travel docs to stay permanently. ""assurance' we hear is that Liberia would not send him directly to El Salvador. /127

R: but what happens after his temporary status ends. he wouldn't have travel docs. naturally he'd be sent to his home country--el salvador. R: i dont see how Abrego, left to his own devices in Liberia, could engineer exit to Costa Rica or anywhere else. /128

R: govt's brief was telling in its callousness. ... Govt focuses on whether he'll experience persecution in Liberia. what happens outside liberia is not issue, per govt. but what happens when temporary status ends? /129

Rossman: there's a reason why there's an extraordinarily small fraction of people sent to 3d countries before this year. wherever you send someone, unless they have status, at risk directly or indirectly to refoulement. all i am saying, abrego entitled to is review by IJ to a final conclusion. /130

J: if you're asking for my than IJ review burden gets heavier under [federal due process standard]. There are regulations in expedited removal--get review but it stops at the IJ. it's odd to me, seems irrational, he wouldn't get that, but why unconstitutional? /131

R: in weighing the 3 Mathews v. Eldridge factors, have to weigh burden of providing procedure. when weighed against fundamental liberty interests of abrego it seems quite modest. won't halt machinery of govt to give him appeals. /132

Rossman's last substantive point is on Costa Rica. we've had 3 hearings. before we got to courtroom we took 3 depositions. supposed to provide us with witnesses with knowledge. mr giles, schwartz, cantu. no evidence at all that costa rica is unwilling to take my client. /133

R: you've given the govt every chance. Judge: if no order of removal -- govt may issue a new order. that will allow you to timely designate costa rica as your 3d country. *today was a zero in my view.* but i dont have to reach the import of it. /134

R: Ensign says Secy of HLS has right to choose 3d country designation. we don't think that's right. it's a ""shall"" when it comes to my client's designation of Costa rica. Can be overridden if 3d country won't take or Secy has determined it would prejudice US. [No showing of either.] /135

R: it's been a parade of less than memorable witnesses, YH. we're left with a plain winner for my client. Cooper now addressing some of the technical jurisdictional questions. He gives her some cases where courts have exercised jurisdiction when there was no order of removal. /136

Judge: I dont have any other questions. i consider the record and argument to be closed. will reach as quickly as I can. weighty issues. I'll likely not reach the motion to dissolve till I decide the petition ... /137",https://www.lawfaremedia.org/assets/icons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-24 10:58:37.875064

“For real, I thought I was going to Jamaica,” Etoria told me.
“For the first three days, we ate only porridge, and I raised my hand real quick and said, ‘No more!’ ” Etoria told me.
Jim told me that he was trying to stay indoors, for fear of being detained or extorted by officials in Togo.
“They cried so helplessly, and they were scrambling and running for their lives,” Jim told me.","One Saturday morning in early September, I got a WhatsApp video call from eleven strangers locked inside a secretive detention camp in a forest in Ghana. Their faces looked glazed with sweat and stricken with fear. In the background, I could hear birdsong and the drone of insects. An armed guard watched over the group as they huddled around a shared cellphone.

“There are big snakes here, and scorpions!” a male voice with an American accent called out.

“My stomach is really hurting, and we have to beg for food,” another man said.

A third added, “We fear we’ll be tortured and killed.”

One of the men, a car salesman and a real-estate agent from Miami, whom I’ll call Jim, gave me a tour of the scene: an open-air military complex known as Bundase Training Camp, some forty miles from Accra. “I have five U.S.-citizen children, and they don’t know where their father is,” Jim said.

Just months earlier, one of these men had a job with UPS in Chicago. Another had lived in Houston, where he worked for his mother’s catering business, composed R. & B. music, and babysat his little brothers. Some had lived in the U.S. from an early age. Jim, a political refugee, had come to Miami from Liberia in the early nineties, when he was twenty-three, after his parents were murdered for their tribal and political affiliations during the country’s civil war. Others, including a twenty-one-year-old woman who had fled Togo fearing genital mutilation, had arrived in the U.S. recently, seeking asylum.

All of them had been taken from the United States against their will. Nearly all had been granted forms of legal relief that bar the government from deporting them to their home countries. At the heart of the protections they’d received was one of the most basic and sacrosanct concepts in both U.S. and international law: non-refoulement. This principle means that no nation should intentionally deport or expel people to a place where they are likely to face torture, persecution, death, or other grave harms.

The forest detainees had got my number from an Atlanta-based immigration attorney named Meredyth Yoon, who works as a litigation director for a nonprofit called Asian Americans Advancing Justice. “Traditionally, we focus a lot on immigration detention, and we engage in advocacy on issues affecting Asian American and Pacific Islander communities,” she told me. But, in recent months, Yoon has had to repeatedly reimagine her work, racing to help community members whose loved ones were seized in large-scale ICE raids and working to defend lawful immigrants from unlawful deportations. This spring, she’d agreed to represent Jim after learning that he’d been held in an ICE processing center in Folkston, Georgia, for more than two years. Jim had won asylum and become a lawful permanent resident of the U.S in the nineties. But, in 2011, he’d been convicted of bank fraud and, more than a decade later, ICE had initiated removal proceedings against him and detained him.

In late summer, Yoon learned that ICE had moved Jim to its Alexandria Staging Facility, in central Louisiana, from which detainees tend to get deported. Yoon contacted ICE to find out where the agency was planning to send him. ICE never answered her e-mails. At that point, Yoon told me, “more alarm bells started going off.”

Then, on the morning of September 8th, Jim called Yoon in a panic. “I’m in Ghana!” he cried out. Yoon scrambled to gather information on Jim and the other detainees who were being held with him. Four days later, she and her colleagues filed an urgent lawsuit, sketching the life-or-death fears of five of them. The next morning, I received the call from all eleven individuals held in Bundase Training Camp, who asked me to describe their plight. “They didn’t tell us where we were going,” Jim said that morning. “They just kidnapped us overnight and whisked us out.”

For months, I had been trying to document the Trump Administration’s secretive third-country removals. At first, getting access to any information was daunting. Some of the deportees were held in far-off prisons or detention sites; others had gone into hiding. Friends and relatives in the U.S. often felt terrified of speaking out, fearing retaliation. “I don’t know that the piece you’re contemplating is necessarily writable right now,” a leading lawyer on the topic, Anwen Hughes, of the advocacy group Human Rights First, wrote to me in late July.

Initially, I’d focussed on two groups of third-country deportees, known to human-rights lawyers as the South Sudan Eight and the Eswatini Five. The first group, from countries including Myanmar, Mexico, and Laos, had been deported, in early July, to South Sudan, a nation struggling to recover from a civil war. Days later, the second group—five men from Cuba, Jamaica, Laos, Vietnam, and Yemen, all of whom had lived in the U.S. for many years—had been deported to the southern African nation of Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland. There, they were detained in a maximum-security prison, without clear justification.

These deportees appeared to have been handpicked by the Trump Administration to test a new approach to mass deportation. According to the Department of Homeland Security, all of them had been convicted of serious crimes, including murder. Announcing the flight to Eswatini, Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for D.H.S., had called the five deportees “so uniquely barbaric that their home countries refused to take them back,” a claim that at least one of the countries disavowed. Arguably the most surprising part of these early removals was also the least understood. It wasn’t just that these men were being sent to nations where they had no ties, and to places that were not safe. It was also that, in many cases, men who had completed their sentences in the U.S. years ago were now being subjected to indefinite detention abroad.

The wider strategy of forced third-country transfers had clear policy roots. On January 20th, the first day of Donald Trump’s second term, Trump issued an executive order called “Securing Our Borders,” which, among other things, declared an intention to expand the use of third-country deportations. On February 18th, D.H.S. issued an internal guidance memo, instructing immigration officers to “review for removal” all cases “on the non-detained docket”—meaning anyone with an immigration case who was not in ICE custody. As part of this review, D.H.S. officials would “determine the viability of removal to a third country”—and, if they found that third-country removal was viable, attempt to detain the person. The first large-scale third-country removals occurred that month and targeted newly arrived asylum seekers. Between February 12th and 15th, the U.S. sent two hundred and ninety-nine people—from countries such as Afghanistan, Cameroon, Somalia, and Iran—to Panama. On February 20th and 25th, the U.S. sent an additional two hundred people, including eighty-one children, to Costa Rica. Soon afterward came third-country-deportation flights to Uzbekistan and El Salvador, where more than two hundred and fifty non-Salvadoran immigrants were detained in the brutal Terrorism Confinement Center, also known by its Spanish acronym, CECOT. Some of the men held at CECOT were transferred there as part of another third-country-removal experiment: the President declared that the U.S. had been “invaded” by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, authorizing the removal of supposed gang members. (In June, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg found that the government had violated the rights of those men by not giving them an opportunity to challenge their deportations.)

In late March, a young, gay Guatemalan asylum seeker, known to the court as O.C.G., filed a class-action lawsuit with several other plaintiffs, challenging the new policy of deporting people to third countries without meaningful notice or a chance to contest their removal. According to the complaint, O.C.G. had fled Guatemala because of “multiple death threats on account of his sexuality.” An immigration judge barred his deportation to Guatemala. The Department of Homeland Security then placed him on a bus with some twenty other men and, without issuing a new removal order, deported the group to Mexico. O.C.G. was not able to protest that he also feared persecution and torture in Mexico, where he’d been held hostage and raped while on his journey to the U.S. The lawsuit, known in the courts as D.V.D. v. D.H.S., became the primary legal battlefront for an urgent question: Can the government deport people to third countries without giving them an opportunity to claim that they could be tortured or killed there?

In April, a Massachusetts federal judge, Brian E. Murphy, issued a preliminary injunction, saying that the government must grant people at least fifteen days to challenge third-country deportations. But two months later the Supreme Court granted a stay, reversing Murphy’s order. (Using the so-called shadow docket, the Court offered no public explanation of its reasoning.) The result is that, for now, D.H.S. can deport people to countries not listed on their removal orders without giving them any notice. Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, decrying the government’s “flagrantly unlawful conduct.” Sotomayor wrote, “In matters of life and death, it is best to proceed with caution.”

McLaughlin, the D.H.S. spokesperson, had a different response: “Fire up the deportation planes.” Shortly after the ruling came down, ICE deported the South Sudan Eight and the Eswatini Five. Among those sent to Eswatini was Orville Etoria, a sixty-two-year-old man who’d lived in New York for nearly fifty years.

In late August, I met with Etoria’s aunt Margaret McKen at her home in Canarsie, Brooklyn. A professor at Hunter College’s School of Education, McKen confessed that she was reluctant to talk with me. (I agreed to use her maiden name.) “I’ve been a naturalized citizen for thirty years, and I don’t even have a parking ticket, but you never know what they can do to you,” she said. “I’ve started to have a phobia that ICE will come and break down my door.”

Still, McKen felt that the public ought to know what had happened to her nephew, and who he was. Born in Jamaica, Etoria came to Brooklyn at the age of twelve, in 1976. He lived with his mother in Crown Heights, where she worked at a day-care center. As a young adult, Etoria suffered from psychiatric problems. In 1997, he was convicted of second-degree murder, for shooting a man in a leather-goods store, and received a sentence of twenty-five years to life. Eventually, an immigration judge issued an order of removal against him, meaning that he could be deported once he got out of prison.

Etoria had been convicted of a serious crime, but, McKen said, he had evolved as a person. While incarcerated, Etoria had earned a bachelor’s degree in behavioral science and worked toward a master’s in divinity. After his release, in 2021, he got a job at a homeless shelter in Queens, helping to get health care and housing for men who needed support, as he once had. He lived in a three-story brownstone, which he shared with his mother and one of his two adult sons.

They were a close-knit family, McKen told me, noting that, upon his release, Etoria had cared for his mother through a terminal illness. “When Orville was in prison, his mom was like the mailman—rain, sleet, or snow, she’d always travel to see him,” McKen said. “When he came home, he eased his mother’s burden, cleaning the house, buying groceries, and cooking her oxtail and salmon.” More recently, McKen recalled, “He got a car, and he told me, ‘I’m paying my own water bill!’ ”

At a routine ICE check-in this past spring, an agent told Etoria that he had ninety days to prepare his Jamaican passport. Shortly after he reported back to ICE, in June, McKen got a call from one of Etoria’s sons, saying, “They detained him and he’s not coming home!” She tracked Etoria’s whereabouts, using ICE’s online locator, as he was transferred from Manhattan’s Federal Plaza to Orange County, New York, and then back to Manhattan. She arranged for relatives in Jamaica to prepare a place for him to stay, in case he was sent back there.

Then Etoria vanished from the ICE tracker. McKen panicked. “God, are you going to send us a message?” she asked. He had been missing for more than two weeks when, one morning, McKen looked at her phone and saw an image that made her jump: Etoria’s face, in an online news dispatch. McKen clicked on the story. She found her way to McLaughlin’s announcement that Orville and four other “barbaric” men had been deported to Eswatini.

“Orville isn’t a monster,” McKen told me. “We get it—we know what he did was wrong. We raised our children to respect that there are consequences. But, if you paid for those consequences once already, why a second time? It’s a political ploy, to keep us in line. It’s them saying, ‘I have the power to destroy you.’ ”

McKen called the office of Jamaica’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade and learned that the country had not declined to take Etoria back. The minister implied online that the government had not even been asked. McKen couldn’t reach Etoria in Eswatini. “We are wondering if we will ever see him alive again,” she said.

McKen wondered, too, who else the Trump Administration might deport this way. It had started off its third-country removals with men like Etoria, who had served out criminal sentences. But soon she saw more third-country removals unfolding in the news, affecting a broader group. Less than a week after our conversation, news broke about the third-country deportations to Ghana, which included men and women who’d never been charged with any crime.

On September 12th, Meredyth Yoon and her colleagues filed their lawsuit on behalf of five of the people who’d been sent to Ghana. The attorneys pleaded that their clients were “now in immediate danger of being sent on, within hours, to their countries of origin,” despite the fact that immigration judges acknowledged that they would likely face persecution or torture there.

Late that night, I spoke to Yoon. She told me, “It’s absolutely shocking and illegal. And it fits this Administration’s general pattern—draconian, cruel processes that create a spectacle and coerce people into leaving of their own accord.” She added, “I hope we can do something. I hope we can stop this train.”

The next morning, I received the call from Yoon’s clients in the Ghanaian military camp. “Here, it’s all bushes and forest,” Jim told me. He wanted to start his story back in Louisiana, where a violent removal operation had taken place in the dark on September 5th. “They came to our cell,” he said, “and woke us in the middle of the night.”

Jim had asked the agents where they were taking him. They refused to answer. “I need to talk to my attorney,” Jim said, adding, as Yoon had advised, “I fear for my life if sent back to Liberia.” An agent called over a group of colleagues. “They punched me—I have bruises right now from it—and they kicked me,” Jim told me. “Then they put me on the ground, handcuffed me, and put me in a straitjacket.” He’d wept as they dragged him through the dark onto a tarmac. Other men in full-body restraints and chains were also being forced onto the flight, screaming and crying.

“Sir, all I asked is to speak to an attorney because I fear for my life,” Jim repeated. At that point, he told me, the agents carried him “like cargo” onto the military plane. “That’s what you get for not coöperating,” one of the agents said, according to Jim.

As Jim spoke, other men crowded around the phone, calling out similar stories. A heavyset Chicago resident, T.L., confirmed the violence of ICE’s initial removal. “They beat me up and punched me to the ground,” T.L. told me. He’d come to the U.S. years ago, fleeing political persecution in Nigeria. He made a good life for himself in Chicago, and had children; he found work as a cleaner in a hospital and at UPS. But, in 2022, he was sentenced to two and a half years in federal prison, for bank fraud. When he got out, he said, ICE agents instantly detained him.

T.L. fought his deportation, and a judge granted him relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), agreeing that T.L. was “more likely than not” to face torture in Nigeria and barring the government from sending him back there. Protection by way of CAT—and a similar status known as “withholding of removal”—doesn’t include the full benefits of asylum, such as a path to citizenship. But typically, under both Republican and Democratic Administrations, people granted these forms of relief have been allowed to keep living in the U.S. Technically, they could be deported to a country where they did not have credible fears of torture or persecution, but that rarely happened, and, when it did, it required a series of careful steps. (The American Immigration Council has attested that a mere 1.6 per cent of people who were granted withholding of removal in 2017 were deported to a third country that year.) Clear due-process rights governed such removals. “But then, when the ICE agents came for me,” T.L. said, “no laws worked.”

T.L. told me that he refused to board the ICE flight on September 5th without speaking to his attorney. He said that he’d also been placed in full-body restraints and dragged onto the plane by ICE agents. T.L. and Jim both told me that the agents had said, “Either you go the easy way or you go the hard way.” Trump used similar phrasing earlier this year, in a promotional video for a new Customs and Border Protection app that allows immigrants to declare their intent to self-deport, saying, “People in our country illegally can self-deport the easy way or they can get deported the hard way, and that’s not pleasant.”

In a statement to The New Yorker, McLaughlin, the D.H.S. spokesperson, said, “Any claim that ICE personnel ‘beat,’ ‘kick,’ or ‘drag’ detainees or use ‘straitjackets’ is categorically false.” She also wrote, “Every single detainee receives due process. Get a grip.” Of the people who were sent to Ghana, she added, “Many of these were heinous criminals with rap sheets that included injury to a child, robbery, aggravated assault, and fraud.”

But the group in Bundase Training Camp also included people such as D.A., a Nigerian human-rights advocate who’d never been convicted of a crime. In Nigeria, his work on behalf of tribal groups facing displacement by the government had led to death threats. Eventually, he’d sought asylum in the U.S., and an immigration judge granted D.A. protection from deportation to Nigeria through CAT, affirming his fear of torture. But, on September 5th, he said, he was beaten and forced onto the flight. D.A. recalled an ICE agent telling him, “Your ass is getting on the plane.” He responded, “You’re abusing your badge.”

As we spoke, D.A. looked terrified. “I did everything possible to try to do the right thing,” he told me, emphasizing that he’d followed U.S. asylum law. He is married to a U.S. citizen from Texas. “Today, they brought a Nigerian officer from the consulate to see me!” he said. “I want the people of the United States to know my life is in danger—not just back home in Nigeria but also in Ghana.”

As D.A. and others panned the camera across the camp, I noticed several women standing in the group. I asked if they, too, wished to speak. A woman whom I’ll call Miriam stepped forward. She had lived in Lomé, the capital city of Togo, where, she explained, in a warm, gentle voice, she’d studied marketing, earning bachelor’s and master’s degrees, and hoped for a career in the import-export business.

But, when Miriam was in her twenties, her life took a turn. Her relatives expected her to return to her father’s ancestral village, to submit to ritual genital mutilation. She refused and escaped to Ghana, where, she said, an uncle offered her protection but raped her instead. She tried hiding in another city in Togo, she recounted, but relatives found her there and tortured her for days. Finally, Miriam fled to the U.S., taking a flight to Brazil and trekking across more than a dozen borders to reach Texas. “I fought as best I could,” she told me. An immigration judge in Arizona granted her withholding of removal. She assumed this meant safety. “But instead they just deported us,” she said.

Miriam ushered forward the youngest person in the group, a slender woman with braids who stood there putting on a brave face. “She’s only twenty-one years old,” Miriam said, of the woman, who was also from Togo.

The twenty-one-year-old waved. She did not speak English, but others interpreted. She’d arrived in the U.S. seeking asylum last November. An immigration judge granted her withholding of removal. I later obtained her account in writing, translated by another detainee. “I was forced to go through female genital mutilation for them to give me to an old man for a marriage which I refused,” it read. “I ran to the U.S. to save my life.”

One result of the surge in third-country deportations has been the creation of a detective agency of sorts, comprising attorneys, human-rights groups, and flight-tracking experts. Together, they’ve been trying to solve the mystery of who is being deported, and to where, and when.

The flight trackers are often the first to warn that a deportation is afoot. Their digging originated with the work of a retired JPMorgan Chase executive named Tom Cartwright, who, in 2020, took up a new volunteer effort: using publicly available aviation data to track ICE flights. Human Rights First has formalized and expanded Cartwright’s log, tallying more than seventeen hundred deportation flights in the first nine months of the second Trump Administration. “Just keeping up has been a monumental effort,” Savitri Arvey, a refugee-protection expert working on the project, told me.

Arvey gave me an example. “Late Wednesday night, there was a flight out of J.F.K. with all the characteristics of a third-country removal to Uzbekistan,” she told me. “It wasn’t the normal flight number for flights to Uzbekistan, and we saw that the plane was parked on the tarmac, not at the gate, and it left six hours late,” she said. “The stars align with a repatriation, but we’re digging to get confirmation, since it’s all been a mystery.” Unless a person on a deportation flight calls someone in the U.S., Arvey said, that person’s fate remains “a total black hole.”

The State Department declined to comment on the details of its diplomatic communications with other governments. But the U.S. has reportedly sought third-country-deportation agreements with nations including Ukraine, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Uganda, and Kosovo, sometimes threatening countries with economic or diplomatic consequences if they don’t oblige. In court, ICE has invoked agreements for which no records were apparent. I obtained a sworn declaration from an ICE officer which stated that “the U.S. Department of State currently has a valid agreement with Bolivia to accept third country removals.” The officer attested that ICE had served a young Colombian woman with “notice of removal to Bolivia” and that D.H.S. had scheduled her flight. But the woman’s lawyer told me that she could find no public reports or evidence of such a deal. The lawyer won her client’s release after an ICE official admitted in court that the woman could not, in fact, be sent to Bolivia.

The financial incentives driving these agreements have also been hidden from public view. Last March, the Trump Administration paid El Salvador more than four million dollars to imprison non-Salvadoran deportees. But in most places the numbers remain undisclosed. I obtained a copy of the “memorandum of understanding” that the U.S. government signed with Eswatini, revealing that the U.S. had agreed to pay the country more than five million dollars in exchange for accepting up to a hundred and sixty foreign-national deportees. I also reviewed a copy of the deal struck with Rwanda: in that instance, the U.S. pledged $7.5 million in exchange for taking up to two hundred and fifty deportees. Both Eswatini and Rwanda made a commitment to “prevention of refoulement.” In June, two activist groups, the National Immigration Litigation Alliance and Refugees International, sued the State Department, seeking the release of deportation agreements with a half-dozen countries. In the lawsuit, which is ongoing, the groups argue that the government shirked its duty to fulfill their Freedom of Information Act requests, leaving critical information “shrouded from public view.”

In Eswatini, where Orville Etoria and four other men had been detained, Etoria’s family and a group of U.S. advocates found a local lawyer named Sibusiso Magnificent Nhlabatsi to take up their cause. “These men haven’t committed any crime in Swaziland, and they finished their sentence in the U.S., so under what circumstances are they being detained without access to counsel?” Nhlabatsi asked me in September. “It’s a textbook case of kidnapping and human trafficking, at the center of which is the United States, with Swaziland as an active accomplice.”

When Nhlabatsi first went to visit the men, he told me, “I thought I’d walk into the prison, see these men, help out, and that would be the end of the matter.” But the prison deputy denied him access to them, saying that they hadn’t yet had a chance to reach their families. Nhlabatsi returned the following week, and was told to come back the next day. When he returned again, he was informed that the men had refused to see him. Later in the day, Etoria and the others called home, and all said that they had not been told of such a visit.

On July 31st, Nhlabatsi filed a habeas petition in a court in Eswatini, asserting the men’s right to legal counsel. “The right to legal representation is not a privilege to be granted at the convenience of the correctional services, but a non-negotiable right that attaches from the moment of detention,” he wrote. But, on multiple occasions, the government ignored its legal deadline to respond to the case. When Nhlabatsi was slated to appear in court in mid-September, the court went into recess without informing him. “These men have a right to a fair hearing, and the right to be presumed innocent, and the right to a speedy trial,” Nhlabatsi told me. “I cannot let this injustice go unchallenged.”

Nhlabatsi was frustrated. He knew, too, that he was risking his life to stand up for these men. In 2023, his mentor, a prominent human-rights lawyer and pro-democracy activist named Thulani Maseko, was shot dead in front of his wife and children, after years of advocating for an end to Eswatini’s monarchy. Now that Nhlabatsi was in the local press defending the U.S. deportees’ basic right to counsel, he was getting regular calls from friends. “They weren’t encouraging me,” Nhlabatsi told me. “They were saying, ‘Are you sure you’re safe?’ ”

Then, in late September, I got an update from Etoria’s lawyer in Brooklyn, Mia Unger, of the Legal Aid Society. He had just been released, and was the first person to make it out of Eswatini’s black site. He was nervous about speaking out—the Trump Administration had described him to the public as “barbaric,” and he worried about the repercussions for his family. But, eventually, he decided that he would talk to a journalist for the first time.

When I reached Etoria, I learned that he had been my near-neighbor in Brooklyn. We spent our weekends in the same parts of Prospect Park, enjoying the people-watching. “I love Eastern Parkway—just sitting on the benches under the trees in the summertime, watching kids go by on their bikes and families hanging out,” he told me. “New York is what I know.”

When Etoria showed up to his ICE check-in last June, he knew immediately that things had changed. “I gave my passport to the officer, and he said, ‘Step to the back wall,’ ” he told me. At 26 Federal Plaza, in lower Manhattan, he slept on the floor. “That place was too filthy for any human being to live,” he said. From there, he was punted between ICE facilities and finally taken to the El Paso Service Processing Center, in Texas.

The true shock came soon after. On July 14th, Etoria was called down to intake with a group of men of diverse nationalities. He assumed that they’d be deported to their respective countries. They walked onto the tarmac. “For real, I thought I was going to Jamaica,” Etoria told me. “Why would I think I was going anywhere else?”

The men boarded the ICE flight in shackles. The idea of returning to Jamaica felt, to Etoria, like “an unimaginable loss.” Someone asked, “Where are we going?” An agent replied, “The first flight is six hours, and then the second flight is eight hours.” Etoria felt his stomach drop. They stopped in Djibouti, where the men were transferred onto a military cargo plane. “It was like something you’d see in a movie, as if we were some notorious gangsters,” Etoria said. Roughly a half hour before that flight landed, the men learned their true destination. “The officer came around wanting us to sign a paper saying we agreed to go to Eswatini,” he told me. “I’d never even heard of Eswatini!” Panicked, he refused to sign.

“We all expressed the same disconnect from reality in that moment,” Etoria said. He told me that an ICE official had snapped paparazzi-style photographs as he stepped off the plane, still wearing chains. He felt like an unwilling prop in an ad for the Trump Administration. “You could tell it was a charade, all for show, so that they could use it and say, ‘Look what we did,’ ” he said.

“To be honest,” Etoria added, “it helped me imagine how the slaves might have felt, going to another land in shackles and chains—that loneliness, that disconnect, that sense of loss.”

Local guards shuttled the group to Matsapha Correctional Complex, a maximum-security prison. No one explained the grounds on which the men were being held. At first, Etoria said, the guards treated the U.S. deportees with suspicion. “They’d seen a military plane come onto their land—the kind of plane that drops bombs on people and takes troops to war—and they were told, ‘These five men are people to be afraid of.’ But, over time, we conversed with the guards, and they could see that they’d been lied to about who we really were.” Soon, the guards gave the men a chessboard. They fielded Etoria’s complaints about the food, although it hardly improved. “For the first three days, we ate only porridge, and I raised my hand real quick and said, ‘No more!’ ” Etoria told me.

The Eswatini Five had only occasional monitored calls to their families and little to no access to their lawyers in the U.S. Mostly, they spent time in their cells. “We looked up at the ceiling a lot, and we talked about our families,” Etoria said. “We tried to help each other release the thoughts that were inside of us that were screaming to come out, the things that meant the most to us, and family was the No. 1 thing. The second-biggest thing was realizing that our lives had meaning—that we weren’t the bad, bad people that society had told us we were.”

Weeks passed. One day in late summer, officials from the International Organization for Migration visited the group. They brought “mental-health” provisions: badminton equipment, a basketball, Ping-Pong paddles, and five novels. Etoria stressed that what he really needed for his mental health was freedom. Soon after, he said, I.O.M. informed him that he would soon be able to return to Jamaica. On September 21st, he boarded the first in a series of four commercial flights that brought him to the island. No one knows how much money the U.S. government spent on this elaborate detention detour to Africa.

In Jamaica, Etoria has wondered about the men left behind: the Eswatini Four. They remain imprisoned without explanation, and without clear paths to repatriation. Ten more people have been added to the group. “There is something sinister going on here, and something has been taken from my spirit that I might never get back,” Etoria said. In mid-October, his Cuban cellmate, Roberto Mosquera del Peral, began a monthlong hunger strike. “Roberto is an unbelievably kind dude, who likes to analyze stuff with a critical mind,” Etoria said. Mosquera del Peral’s attorney, Alma David, of Novo Legal Group, told me during the strike, “I’m very worried—he has been in pain and looks very thin.”

Eswatini has continued to rebuff Nhlabatsi’s attempts to meet with the detained people. He finally won his habeas case in front of a judge, only to have the government file an appeal. In response to Mosquera del Peral’s hunger strike, Eswatini issued a press release. “The third country national was found to be in good health and spirits,” it read. “He did, however, mention that he was currently fasting and praying because he was missing his family.”

When we spoke recently, Etoria was hunkered down without electricity in the home where he’s been living in Jamaica. His phone was dying, and Hurricane Melissa—a Category 5 storm—was headed toward the island. He worried about not having stocked up on groceries. “I’ll just rough it out,” he told me. Since landing in Jamaica, he said, he has felt completely lost. “I’m trying to catch up, trying to fit in, but, at my age, it’s not easy to get a job here,” he said.

Etoria hopes that, at some point, he can confront the U.S. government about his treatment. But, even more so, he wishes that he could speak to African leaders, as a Black man who feels he was sent across the Middle Passage in reverse. “I want to say, to all the African nations who are taking people into their country in chains and shackles, it’s not a good picture,” he said. “You’re hurting these people, spiritually and emotionally. I don’t just want Eswatini to hear it. I want Ghana to hear it. I want South Sudan to hear it. I want Rwanda and Uganda to hear it.” He paused. “Please,” Etoria said, “let the Trump Administration take care of its own dirty work.”

On a recent evening, I spoke again to Meredyth Yoon, who told me that another deportation flight from the U.S. to Ghana—she believed it to be the fourth—had just landed. Among the latest deportees was a Maryland nurse named Rabbiatu Kuyateh, who’d lived in the U.S. for roughly thirty years and has never faced criminal charges. Kuyateh had won withholding of removal, convincing an immigration judge that she’d likely face serious harm in her native Sierra Leone. Even so, she was shackled and sent to Ghana, where she and others were held under armed guard at a hotel near Accra. Yoon had been on the phone with Kuyateh and other detainees, she said, when Ghanaian officials came to the hotel and dragged Kuyateh away. They put her on a flight to Sierra Leone.

Since we’d first spoken, Yoon had been trying to defend the rights of dozens of people who’d been deported to Ghana. In mid-September, she and her colleagues had appeared in U.S. district court, where they argued that members of the first group of deportees should be returned, swiftly, to America. At the time, eleven men and women were still held at Bundase Training Camp; they were hearing rumors that at any moment they could be sent back to their home countries, from which the U.S. government had promised them protection. “There is still time to act,” Lee Gelernt, who had joined the case from the American Civil Liberties Union, had pleaded. “We would implore you to do some kind of relief now.”

The Justice Department attorney, Elianis Perez, did not contest the basic fact of the removals. Instead, she insisted that the U.S. had obtained “diplomatic assurances” that Ghana would comply with the Convention Against Torture and other safeguards. Yet one member of the group—a bisexual Gambian man who had been granted protection under CAT by a U.S. immigration judge—had already been returned to his home country.

“How is that O.K.?” the judge, Tanya Chutkan, asked.

“Your Honor, the United States is not saying that this is O.K.,” Perez replied. “What the government has been trying to explain to the court is that the United States does not have the power to tell Ghana what to do.”

Two days later, Chutkan issued her decision. The deportations “appear to be part of a pattern and widespread effort to evade the government’s legal obligations by doing indirectly what it cannot do directly,” she wrote. Even so, she concluded, her “hands are tied.” The court lacked the jurisdiction to prevent Yoon and Gelernt’s clients from being deported by Ghana to their home countries. The resulting policy, Gelernt told me, is “unprecedented and wholly at odds with the humane discretion exercised by past Administrations of both parties.”

I wondered what would become of the terrified men and women I’d talked to in Bundase Training Camp. I soon found out. When I got hold of Jim, in early October, he and nine of the other people I’d spoken with had been placed in vehicles and driven out of the camp, to the border of Togo. Among them was Miriam, who feared torture or death if she was forced to return there, and the twenty-one-year-old Togolese woman who had also fled genital mutilation.

“Right now, we’re in Togo illegally!” Jim told me. He explained that Ghanaian immigration officials had left the group with Togolese officials who, rather than affording them proper documentation, had pushed them quietly across the border. “They passed us through the back door into Togo, but we aren’t invisible, and we’re an easy target for the cops,” he said. “We don’t speak the language here, and we have no money.” His family had tried to send him funds through Western Union. But he couldn’t easily obtain them, he said, because the U.S. government had confiscated his I.D. He and others in the group had to beg strangers to get the funds, for a cut of the cash.

Jim told me that he was trying to stay indoors, for fear of being detained or extorted by officials in Togo. But, on occasion, he’d been sneaking out to the ocean, to listen to the waves. He worried most about the Togolese women in their group. “They cried so helplessly, and they were scrambling and running for their lives,” Jim told me. “They’ve gone underground.”

A few days later, I spoke to Miriam, who was hiding in a boarding room. A local journalist had learned Miriam’s real name and published it on social media. Soon afterward, her cousin began receiving ominous calls from strangers, asking, “Where is Miriam?” She sobbed as we spoke.

“This morning, I drank a porridge, and it’s the only food I’ve had,” she told me. In her hiding place, she’d been rehashing her trajectory. She’d been shipped like cargo “from Arizona to Louisiana, and then Louisiana to Ghana, and then Ghana to Togo,” she said. “ICE treated us like animals, handcuffed us, and wouldn’t let us eat—just bread and water.”

At Bundase Training Camp, “they didn’t tell us that they would take us to Togo,” Miriam continued. She had tried to confront the Ghanaian officials as they shoved her group across the border. “Why are you doing this? You’re supposed to protect us, as a third country!” Miriam pleaded. An officer, she told me, said, “Shut up. We have to respect the orders we were given.” Some of the detained men were told they’d be shot if they tried to escape.

Back in May, Miriam told me, she’d been elated to receive protection from a U.S. immigration judge. She thought that this offer of refuge was what defined the United States. It was true, I told her. After the last British ship left New York Harbor in 1783, George Washington and his officers famously made a toast: “May America be an Asylum to the persecuted of the earth!”

“As I’m talking to you right now, I don’t know what will happen to me,” Miriam said. But, for the moment, she had one wish: “I need other people to know that this is my true condition. I am not free.” ♦","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/691e1c444e8e8117138da09d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/r47863_rd.jpg",N,,2025-11-24 11:57:21.933118

While federal agencies may exercise restraint, private plaintiffs, state agencies and advocacy groups can continue to pursue disparate impact claims.","Background

In response to President Trump’s April 23, 2025 executive order, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is scaling back (though not entirely abandoning) its enforcement of disparate impact discrimination claims. Disparate impact discrimination claims refer to those which allege that a facially neutral employment policy disproportionately harms a protected group or groups. The U.S. Supreme Court first recognized the theory of disparate impact liability under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in Griggs v. Duke Power Co. in 1971. The Court there ruled that an employer’s policy requiring employees in its highest-paying departments to attain a particular level of education or pass an internal test as a condition for employment was unlawful because the policy had a disparate impact on racial minorities. The EEOC will no longer pursue such claims, standing alone. Only those disparate impact claims which are accompanied by an intentional discrimination claim, otherwise known as a disparate treatment claim, may continue. Importantly, however, even under Trump’s executive order, Title VII and Griggs still provide grounds for private individuals to pursue disparate impact claims directly.

An Ideological Shift At The EEOC

According to a recent internal memorandum, the EEOC has directed its staff members to close most pending disparate impact investigations and begin issuing right-to-sue letters to the charging parties, permitting them to file private claims in federal court. The intention was to conclude those cases by September 30, 2025, and issue letters to affected parties by October 31, 2025. The issuance of right-to-sue letters may have been delayed due to the recently ended government shutdown. The change in the EEOC’s enforcement policies is a direct response to the Executive Order’s mandate, and it is likely to create a surge in private litigation as individuals and advocacy groups seek to pursue claims in court where agency enforcement is lacking.

The EEOC has already begun to withdraw disparate impact lawsuits initiated by the Commission in response to President Trump’s April 2025 executive order. In response, plaintiffs are continuing to pursue the claims in federal court, serving as an example of the path we can expect many similarly situated claimants to follow. The Commission’s decision to stop the investigation of disparate impact claims in the absence of an intentional discrimination claim has also resulted in litigation against the Commission. Recently, a claimant filed a lawsuit against the EEOC after the Commission stopped investigating the claimant’s unintentional discrimination charge. In that lawsuit, the claimant alleges that the Commission violated its statutory obligation to investigate discrimination complaints, including ones that involved disparate impact. The claimant also alleges the Commission exceeded its authority under the Administrative Procedures Act by issuing its disparate impact directive. The case, Cross v. EEOC (No. 1:25-cv-03702), was filed on October 20, 2025, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.

The October 27, 2025 swearing in of Republican Brittany Panuccio as an EEOC Commissioner formally created the three-member quorum and restored the agency’s ability to vote on major policy changes and litigation for the first time since January. With the government reopening, this development will allow the new EEOC leadership to carry out its agenda which, under Acting Chair Lucas, will include initiating litigation, challenging DEI programs and targeting religious discrimination in the workplace.

Moving Forward

Despite the executive order, legislative avenues remain open. Congress retains the authority to amend statutes explicitly to restrict or define the scope of disparate impact liability. As legal challenges and court decisions unfold, the landscape remains fluid. Courts are likely to grapple with the tension between statutory rights, Supreme Court precedent and the executive branch’s policy directives. Employers and federal contractors must adapt to this evolving environment. In the short term, they should:

Conduct comprehensive audits of employment practices, testing and selection procedures to ensure compliance with current legal standards.

Monitor regulatory guidance and administrative agency positions, especially regarding the use of disparate impact analysis and anti-harassment guidance.

Continue to implement fair, inclusive practices that focus on merit and individualized assessments, avoiding quotas or race-based decision-making.

In the longer term, employers should prepare for potential shifts in litigation patterns. While federal agencies may exercise restraint, private plaintiffs, state agencies and advocacy groups can continue to pursue disparate impact claims. State laws, such as California’s Fair Employment and Housing Act, New Jersey’s Law Against Discrimination and New York’s Human Rights Law, remain active avenues for systemic discrimination claims. While the legal foundations remain intact, the administrative enforcement landscape is shifting, with federal agencies deprioritizing such claims and courts potentially seeing an increase in private litigation.",https://www.bipc.com/assets/images/thumbnails/post-social-L_and_E-eeoc-issues-directive-to-close-all-pending-charges-alleging-only-disparate-impact-in-the-wake-of-trump’s-april-23-executive-order.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 11:57:34.344303

Immigration is arguably the defining issue of our age. Its social, economic, and cultural effects are vast—and the subject of some of our most bitter debates. The discontent it has generated has powered political revolutions across the West, including Donald Trump’s improbable rise (and stunning return). Now, with Trump’s administration aiming to deport a million people a year, immigration is becoming the most contentious issue of his second term.

Immigration is also something that goes to the heart of American identity. We are, as the cliché has it, “a nation of immigrants,” and home to more immigrants than any other country. From the Mayflower on, waves of new arrivals have defined what it means to be American, while the Statue of Liberty urges us to “Give me your tired, your poor / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.”

Lofty principles are one thing; the messy reality, with all its moral dilemmas and painful trade-offs, is another. We’ve reported a lot on that reality here at The Free Press, from the tragic consequences of Biden’s extremely lax border policy to how Trump’s crackdown has upended the daily lives of migrants across the country.

This week, for the latest chapter of our yearlong America at 250 project (read all about that here), we’re building on that reporting and going deeper on immigration. Today, we start with the politics of it. We’re bringing you two of the sharpest minds we know—with different views of the issue—on the question of how immigration came to dominate our politics.

Tyler Cowen supports immigration, but he argues that too many of those he agrees with fail to see the quandary at the heart of the issue. Tyler says it explains why immigration restrictions have to “become more oppressive and more unpleasant as time passes” and turn the liberals into illiberals. Read his essay to understand why “humane” immigration policy ends in cruelty.

For two periods in American history, the country more or less halted the influx of migrants. Now, we are in the middle of what Christopher Caldwell calls the “third great slamming of the Golden Door.” For many Americans, this is a source of national shame, and a sign the country is “turning away from its good ‘welcoming’ side and toward its low-class ‘xenophobic’ side.” That’s not the case, argues Christopher. Read his essay to learn why.

On Conversations with Coleman: The Viral Educator Warren Smith on Wokeness, Campus Culture, and Losing His Job

Last year, a video went viral of Warren Smith, then a high school teacher, speaking with an off-camera student. In it, Warren responds to his student’s claim that J.K. Rowling is a bigot by posing a series of calm, logic-driven questions. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Warren’s employer was less enthusiastic about this conversation, and he lost his teaching job as a result. Today, Coleman Hughes sits down with Smith to discuss his cancellation, why so many institutions continue to struggle with balancing open inquiry against mounting social pressures, and what it will take to build a better future for American students.

You can watch the full conversation here, and listen to below:

Ukraine and many of its key European allies met in Geneva Sunday to discuss a new U.S. peace plan. President Trump has given Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky until Thursday to accept the deal, otherwise he can “continue to fight his little heart out.”

Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene announced Friday that she will resign from Congress. After clashing with President Trump in recent weeks, Greene said that she didn’t want her district “to have to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the president we all fought for.”

The Israeli military struck Beirut on Sunday in a targeted attack against Hezbollah’s chief of staff. It is the first strike on the Lebanese capital since June. “We will continue to act forcefully to prevent any threat to the residents of the north and the state of Israel,” Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement.

The State Department announced on X that they will require all U.S. embassies to produce reports on the human rights implications and public safety impacts of mass migration. In the post, the department called mass migration “an existential threat to Western civilization” that “undermines the stability of key American allies.”

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has officially been disbanded, with 8 months remaining on its charter. When asked about the department’s status, Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor answered, “That doesn’t exist.” (Read Joe Nocera on “Why DOGE Failed.”)

Saudi Arabia is beginning to loosen their drinking restrictions. According to sources familiar with the matter, the Gulf nation will reportedly allow non-Muslim visitors with “special residency status” to purchase alcohol from a store previously reserved for foreign diplomats, as the country continues to court Western influence.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oyQa!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7c4518b-d648-4909-8c63-f912a7aea977_1250x703.png",N,,2025-11-24 11:57:26.421686

In records filed with the habeas petitions, Louisiana detainees expressed frustration with ICE for failing to provide answers about when they will be released or deported, making their detention feel indefinite.
As of Friday, the four Sudanese men, whose habeas cases are pending, remained detained in Louisiana, according to ICE’s detainee locator.
Now, those immigrants are asking for bond through habeas petitions, he said, adding that some federal judges have disagreed with the Hurtado decision.","As President Donald Trump’s administration aggressively pursues its mass deportation campaign, the number of immigrants challenging the legality of their detention at ICE facilities in Louisiana – a state that has become a major detention hub in recent years – has surged.

In the roughly 10 months before Trump took office in January, 23 habeas petitions – a type of lawsuit that claims a person is being illegally detained – were filed in federal courts in the state.

Between Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration and Nov. 1, that number soared, with at least 95 Louisiana ICE detainees challenging their detention here, a review of federal court records found.

Among the petitioners are a Pakistani man with an American wife and kids who took a wrong turn after visiting Niagara Falls and ended up at the Canadian border, where he was detained; a Ukrainian truck driver who was detained when he made a delivery at a military base in Texas; and a Russian who opposed the war in Ukraine and spent a year and a half in detention while his asylum claim was processed.

The lawsuits illustrate how the Trump administration's push to detain and deport immigrants in record numbers is sweeping up many people who previously would not have been targeted. And critics argue it shows how those efforts are sometimes crossing legal lines.

“Any insinuation that the Trump administration is detaining people illegally is another smear peddled by the media,” Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, said in a statement.

McLaughlin argues the spike in habeas petitions is a natural result of increased detention and deportations.

""President Trump and Secretary Noem are now enforcing the law and arresting illegal aliens who have no right to be in our country and reversed Biden's catch and release policy,” McLaughlin continued, referring to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. “We are applying the law as written. If a judge finds an illegal alien has no right to be in this country, we are going to remove them. Period.”

Meanwhile, immigration attorneys say the Trump administration’s fierce deportation tactics, which include a push to send immigrants to third countries, and recent decisions from the Board of Immigration Appeals have set the stage for a surge in habeas petitions.

Louisiana has the second most ICE detainees behind Texas. ICE has nine holding facilities in the state, which advocates say house over 7,000 detainees. It also has a staging area by an airfield in Alexandria that has become a hub for deportation flights.

In records filed with the habeas petitions, Louisiana detainees expressed frustration with ICE for failing to provide answers about when they will be released or deported, making their detention feel indefinite. In some cases, they begged to be sent to another country because they did not want to remain in ICE custody.

“I gonna go crazy and die in here,” an Afghan contractor who worked with the U.S. military and fled the country after the Taliban retook power wrote in a September letter filed in court. “please Release me or deport me to Latin American countries instead of Afghanistan.”

As of Nov. 20, the man, who said he was detained in May 2024 and ordered removed in late January, remained in custody in Louisiana, according to ICE’s detainee locator.

A push for third country removals

ICE has detained four Sudanese men for months after they won court orders blocking their deportations because they were at risk of persecution, the men’s habeas petitions say. Sudan is in the middle of a civil war, and images of genocide there have recently shocked the world.

The men were detained in August of 2024, according to their petitions, which show judges blocked their removal orders within the first few months of the Trump administration. The government has not appealed those orders, according to the Executive Office of Immigration Review’s case database.

Their cases are an example of a pattern immigration advocates say is becoming more common under Trump: ICE is less frequently releasing people who are under final removal orders but cannot be deported to their home countries, often as the government tries to send them to third countries.

Though third country deportations occasionally occurred before Trump took office, his administration is pursuing them far more aggressively.

“ICE is detaining all these people that have won their cases, won protection to not be deported to a certain country, and then they’re like, ‘Let’s try to send them to a third country,’” said Jeremy Jong, an immigration attorney based in New Orleans. “Before, those people were, for the most part, released.”

The Sudanese men, like many other habeas petitioners, are using a 2001 Supreme Court case called Zadvydas v. Davis to challenge their confinement. Though it is not a hard and fast rule, that case set a precedent that ICE cannot hold an immigrant for more than six months after a final removal order without a significant likelihood that the immigrant will be deported in the foreseeable future.

In one court filing, the Trump administration argued that the possibility of third country removal allowed them to legally detain an immigrant for longer by increasing the likelihood of his deportation.

Immigrants and lawyers are fighting that notion, sometimes describing cases where people have already been rejected by multiple countries.

The Sudanese men filed petitions more than six months after they received their final, deferred removal orders. ICE has attempted to send at least two of them to third countries, court filings show

“Sir, why I’m still here? If you want to deport me which country you try on it? And if release when?” one of the men asked ICE in September through a communications form.

“Your case is in HQ for 3rd country guidance and assistance,” an ICE officer wrote back. “Please be patient your case/response is in progress.”

ICE has denied release requests for the men, deeming them “flight risks,” according to court records.

Like many detainees who filed petitions, the men are representing themselves.

Not all the challenges filed in Louisiana have held up in court, and many remain pending. In at least two cases, judges have dismissed habeas petitions as premature. Other cases have been dismissed for procedural reasons.

As of Friday, the four Sudanese men, whose habeas cases are pending, remained detained in Louisiana, according to ICE’s detainee locator.

New immigration court precedents

As DHS uses the threat of detention to pressure people into giving up on their immigration cases, a recent Board of Immigration Appeals decision has made it even harder for some detainees to be released on bond.

In the Matter of Yajure Hurtado, the board ruled that immigration judges could not hear bond requests from people who had entered the country illegally but lived here for at least two years without being apprehended.

That decision upended how bond proceedings had been conducted for 40 years, denying bond hearings to a large group of people who were previously eligible, said Homero López, the managing attorney of Immigration Services and Legal Advocacy in New Orleans.

Now, those immigrants are asking for bond through habeas petitions, he said, adding that some federal judges have disagreed with the Hurtado decision.

The Hurtado ruling is part of a flurry of BIA rulings that have generally made it more difficult for immigrants to win their cases or be released on bond, López said, describing the board as being in “lockstep” with Trump’s deportation agenda.

“The Executive Office for Immigration Review is restoring integrity to the immigration adjudication system, and Board of Immigration Appeals decisions reflect straightforward interpretations of clear statutory language,” a spokesperson for the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees the BIA, said in a statement.

A long wait for asylum

A physician and former police officer, Azat Garaev arrived at a U.S. border checkpoint in California in April of 2024 to apply for asylum during President Joe Biden’s administration. He left Russia after he defied mobilization orders to join the war against Ukraine and encouraged soldiers to resist fighting in a war he considered illegal, an immigration judge later wrote.

Garaev had to leave his wife and children behind because he felt that was safer for everyone, his sister said in a letter to the Western District Court of Louisiana.

Upon his arrival in the U.S., authorities immediately detained Garaev, who was left to wait for his asylum case to unfold. Two months later, a judge granted him asylum, but the government twice appealed the decision, once under the Biden administration and once under Trump.

Once the second appeal was dismissed, Garaev was finally released — after having spent roughly a year and a half at River Correctional Center, an ICE facility in Ferriday.

“What truly breaks you is the uncertainty — not knowing what’s ahead, or how long you’ll be trapped in it. That kind of waiting eats away at you,” he said through a family member who helped translate. “I found myself sinking deeper into depression, drifting between hopelessness and anger.”

His sister requested his release numerous times, to no avail, she said. Garaev himself requested parole at least twice and was denied both times, once because ICE deemed him a “flight risk,” an ICE official said in a statement filed in the Western District Court of Louisiana as part of Garaev’s habeas case.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/12/212a5162-2b63-4e9e-a221-b92e5ae10231/69222fc87ec36.preview.jpg?crop=1819%2C955%2C0%2C92&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-24 10:58:27.629521

“They feel the lack of their father now,” said Dadfar’s wife, speaking with the help of a translation app.
Dadfar, his wife said, was a security officer with the Afghan military and moved around the country with U.S. troops.
Because he had helped the U.S. military, Dadfar was targeted by the Taliban, his wife said.
Indiana State Police held Dadfar for five hours without providing a reason or a warrant, according to the lawsuit.","The younger children of Mohammad Ali Dadfar believe their father is away, working. That’s what they’ve been told.

Only the oldest, an 11-year-old girl, and Dadfar’s wife know the truth.

The father of four, an immigrant from Afghanistan who helped the U.S. military fight the Taliban, is in a Springfield, Missouri, jail — held with other immigrants picked up in nationwide sweeps.

Dadfar is 37 and an asylum-seeker with work authorization and a job as an over-the-road trucker.

He’s been held in the Greene County Jail since early October and fears being sent back to Afghanistan.

“They feel the lack of their father now,” said Dadfar’s wife, speaking with the help of a translation app. “And every time their question is, ‘When will father come home?’“

The Beacon is not naming her due to privacy concerns for the minor children.

A Kansas City-based immigration attorney has filed a federal lawsuit challenging Dadfar’s warrantless arrest and detention as unlawful.

Dadfar’s case is among a spate of federal lawsuits contesting warrantless arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and is part of continued legal attempts to hold the Trump administration accountable to a 2022 consent decree.

The Department of Homeland Security can arrest people without a warrant, but only in limited circumstances, such as when there is a fear that the person will escape before a warrant can be obtained.

Dadfar, the lawsuit argues, was not a flight risk.

Dadfar is represented by Rekha Sharma-Crawford in the case, which alleges that his detention is a violation of the 2022 Castañon Nava federal consent decree.

Dadfar’s case was filed Oct. 12 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri.

Named as defendants in the complaint are Greene County Sheriff Jim C. Arnott, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and ICE’s Chicago Field Office Director Samuel Olson.

The Greene County sheriff’s office was not aware of the filing and declined to comment further.

The Department of Homeland Security did not reply to a request for comment.

The Trump administration says it wants to remove dangerous immigrant criminals from the country, what officials often call “the worst of the worst.”

But 97% of the more than 600 undocumented immigrants arrested during the recent Operation Midway Blitz around Chicago had no criminal record, according to reporting by NPR, citing the Department of Homeland Security’s records submitted in ongoing cases involving the consent decree.

The lawsuit also asks that Dadfar not be transferred out of the jurisdiction of ICE’s Kansas City field office.

“Despite over 100 courts having determined that the government’s interpretation of law is incorrect, and the government not appealing those cases, people continue to be unlawfully denied due process and denied their freedom,” Sharma-Crawford said. “It’s un-American.”

Fighting the Taliban

Dadfar is among thousands of Afghans who assisted the U.S. military during the 20-year war in Afghanistan, the longest war in U.S. history.

The U.S. entered Afghanistan in retaliation after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

Afghans helped as part of the Afghan military, as translators, drivers and intelligence operatives and helped with logistics and understanding the country’s culture.

Dadfar, his wife said, was a security officer with the Afghan military and moved around the country with U.S. troops.

Ultimately, the U.S. and allied efforts failed and the Taliban retook the capital of Kabul in 2021.

Dadfar was left behind in the highly criticized, chaotic final withdrawal of U.S. troops under the Biden administration.

Because he had helped the U.S. military, Dadfar was targeted by the Taliban, his wife said.

Subsequent years were treacherous for Dadfar, his wife and their children, who are all under the age of 12.

Their journey to the U.S. took three years, with stays in Iran and Brazil.

A toddler daughter nearly drowned as the family crossed the roadless jungle of the Darien Gap, a dangerous passage between Colombia and Panama.

In June 2024, Dadfar and his family made it to the U.S. southern border. They had an appointment with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, made through an app set up by the Department of Homeland Security.

At the border, they began the process to apply for asylum.

Dadfar was released on a parole that is valid until June 17, 2026.

Dadfar’s work permit is also valid through June 17, 2026, according to the lawsuit.

Operations Guardian and Midway Blitz

Dadfar’s Oct. 10 arrest at an Indiana weigh station came just three days after ICE had been found in violation of the original consent decree.

He was stopped there as part of his route as a commercial driver.

On Oct. 7, a federal judge for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, ruled in favor of a group of immigrant workers, including 11 employees who had been apprehended during a raid at a Mexican restaurant in Liberty earlier this year.

The Liberty workers were already out on bond. But their cases were part of a class action challenge to how ICE is operating under the Trump administration.

The judge also agreed that immigration officials were concocting details for warrants after they had made arrests, rather than having the necessary warrants ahead of actions.

The 2022 consent decree is named for one of the original plaintiffs, Margarito Castañon-Nava, and covers six states — Missouri, Kansas, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Kentucky.

Additional rulings by the same judge have ordered the government to release more than 400 immigrants it is holding under warrantless arrests or probable cause, placing the detainees on monitoring programs.

A stay on the order was issued by an appeals court on Nov. 20, and a hearing will be held in early December.

Dadfar might have come under scrutiny through Operation Guardian, an effort by ICE to target undocumented immigrants working as truckers.

A trucker from Uzbekistan, accused in his native country of being a member of a terrorist organization, was arrested Nov. 17 as he drove in Kansas, according to DHS. The man was living in Pennsylvania.

Operation Midway Blitz targeted immigrants in the Chicago area, an effort that coincided with Dadfar’s detainment.

Indiana State Police held Dadfar for five hours without providing a reason or a warrant, according to the lawsuit.

He then was sent to Chicago and held by ICE officials there for two days, again without reason, the suit said.

DHS paperwork filed with the lawsuit said Dadfar was detained without bond and would be held in ICE custody pending his immigration proceedings.

His next hearing before an Denver immigration judge on the asylum application is Feb. 3, 2026.

The lawsuit alleges: “Mr. Dadfar was present … under his valid grant of parole, and there existed no justification for his detention or arrest during a routine matter. He was paroled into the U.S. for the purpose of seeking asylum, which he did timely. He was awaiting his court hearing and was not a flight risk.”

Sharma-Crawford said that she had spoken with Dadfar by phone.

He is represented in his asylum case by a Colorado immigration law firm.

The Missouri suit also questions Homeland Security paperwork that states Dadfar denied having a fear of being deported to Afghanistan.

But Dadfar was never asked by immigration officials about his fear of returning to Afghanistan, Sharma-Crawford said.

Attempts to help Afghans who were left stranded after the U.S. withdrawal are ongoing and increasingly difficult.

Thousands have a claim that they aided our military. And some were separated from their families as they tried to board planes after Kabul fell to the Taliban.

President Donald Trump suspended the U.S. refugee program shortly after taking office, leaving immigrants who had already been approved for travel without a route to enter the U.S. And the State Department suspended funding to help resettle Afghan refugees already in the U.S.

Dadfar’s wife said she is grateful and prayerful for the many people who have stepped forward to help her family resettle and, now, to challenge her husband’s detention.

But as time passes, the family’s distress builds.

“Every time Ali calls, he tells them (the younger children) that he is at work and that he is trying to finish work as soon as possible and return home,” she said.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Dadfar.png,N,,2025-11-24 10:58:45.286910

And while one failure won’t derail this out-of-control president or the blatant lies and hypocrisy that pervade his administration, it would be a start.","THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION’S lying-to-Congress case against former FBI director James Comey is a comedy of legal errors that could move offstage soon. But it has highlighted the plain fact that American life and America itself are now being shaped—in terrible, even tragic ways—by people who really did mislead and outright lie to Congress under oath.

Let’s start at the top. Not just once but twice, Donald Trump put his hand on a Bible and swore to “preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.” He’s been violating that oath, and lying nonstop in all conceivable venues, ever since.

Right below Trump on the organizational chart is the problem wreaking daily havoc on the country: that so many of these havoc perpetrators were less than forthright when they were trying to get their jobs.

For instance, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., founder of an anti-vaccine nonprofit, is a notorious spreader of medical misinformation—he even captured the “top superspreader” title in a 2021 study of COVID-19 misinformation reshares on Twitter. This year he told the Senate Finance Committee under oath that he is not anti-vaccine and would do nothing as health secretary “that makes it difficult or discourages people” from taking vaccines. He also made several commitments to Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician, to win his support in the closely divided Senate, then went on to break them.

Among these was a promise to keep language on the Centers for Disease Control website that says vaccines do not cause autism. Kennedy personally broke that one last Wednesday, the latest of the many ways he has undermined and restricted vaccines since becoming health secretary in February, even amid ongoing measles outbreaks. And the misinformation avalanche has not abated. Last month, the man in charge of U.S. public health asserted without evidence that Tylenol and circumcision cause autism.

Then there’s the defense secretary (or, as prefers, war secretary), Pete Hegseth, who has derided the idea of women in the military and in combat. “What do you have to say to the almost 400,000 women who are serving today about your position on whether they should be capable to rise through the highest ranks?” Sen. Jeanne Shaheen asked him at his January confirmation hearing.

Hegseth said he’d tell them he’d be “honored to serve alongside you, shoulder to shoulder, men and women, black, white, all backgrounds with a shared purpose . . . and you will be treated fairly.” But by February he had fired the black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and ousted all four women who were four-star generals. Last month he said he’d hold the military to “the highest male standard” for combat positions—which would likely result in large numbers of women removed from combat roles. “So be it,” he said.

Peak political theater

Kristi Noem, under oath at her confirmation hearing to be homeland security secretary, assured senators that “under President Trump’s administration, disaster and emergency relief will not be handed out with political bias. Every American will be responded to and treated equally.” But that is not what’s happening. She also said Trump has been “very clear that his priority is going to be deporting criminals.” That’s not happening, either.

The crackdowns at workplaces, streets, parks, homes, and courthouses across the country have swept up citizens, legal residents, applicants for legal status, a daycare teacher with a work permit, and even a teenage intern for a judge. They’ve broken up families and destroyed tourism. As of mid-November, nearly three quarters of over 65,000 ICE detainees had no criminal convictions, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, which said “many of those convicted” had committed minor offenses such as traffic violations.

The shows of force by immigration agents and even military troops are designed to terrify communities—the height of performative politics, and it’s working. This after Noem agreed under questioning that immigration policy would be driven by “facts and information,” not “political theater.” Still, as secretary, she quickly earned the nickname ICE Barbie “for her love of dressing up for PR opportunities,” as Daily Beast writer Tom Latchem put it.

Noem “brought her hair extensions to El Salvador,” one headline said, where she posed for a glam shot in front of caged prisoners at CECOT. In other publicity photos, she rides on horseback with the border patrol. She’s usually among men in uniform, often holding a gun, wearing a cowboy hat, a baseball cap with official insignia, whatever headwear fits the cosplay at hand. Political theater is alive and well, a jarring backdrop to the careless brutality of immigration policy under Noem and Trump.

Tense hearings for Trump’s Justice Department picks elicited some whoppers. FBI Director Kash Patel, pressed during his confirmation hearing by Sen. Richard Blumenthal to say he’d protect federal prosecutors who worked on the January 6th case, said under oath that “every FBI employee will be held to the absolute same standard, and no one will be terminated for case assignments.” Pressed further, he added, “All FBI employees will be protected against political retribution.” A few months later, Blumenthal told Patel: “I’m not going to mince words: You lied to us.”

Attorney General Pam Bondi made a similar commitment—in her confirmation hearing’s opening statement, no less. “Most importantly, if confirmed, I will fight every day to restore confidence and integrity to the Department of Justice and each of its components,” she said under oath. “The partisanship, the weaponization will be gone. America will have one tier of justice for all.”

Since her promises, and Patel’s, many prosecutors have been fired, forced out, or moved to resign in protest. Among the lawsuits so far are one from Comey’s daughter, former federal prosecutor Maurene Comey, claiming she was fired for unconstitutional political reasons, and one from several ousted agents in part over a demand that the FBI hand over a list of prosecutors who worked on the January 6th case. On top of that, Trump has issued pardons or commutations to hundreds of allies, including 17 politicians and nearly 1,600 who were prosecuted in connection with the January 6th Capitol riot, while urging Bondi to prosecute his enemies—Comey included—as quickly as possible.

A ridiculous case against a hapless foe

Did Comey lie to Congress and obstruct justice? In May 2017 testimony under oath, eight days before Trump fired him, he said he had not been an anonymous source regarding the FBI’s investigations into Trump and Hillary Clinton, nor had he authorized someone else “at the FBI” to be an anonymous source. In 2020 he told senators that he stood by his earlier testimony. The person prosecutors say they’re talking about, Comey friend and adviser Daniel Richman, was not “at the FBI” during the time period in question, according to a Lawfare analysis, and the evidence does not show he was an anonymous source before Comey’s 2017 testimony. Beyond that, the question posed to Comey in 2020 seemed to refer to his deputy, Andrew McCabe—not Richman.

I’m no fan of Comey, whose grave 2016 misjudgments on his Clinton and Trump investigations set us up for the existential crisis we face today. But the case against him is so weak that Erik Siebert, the interim U.S. attorney, declined to prosecute and was then forced out of his job. The episode has grown increasingly surreal under his interim successor, friend-of-Trump and former insurance lawyer Lindsey Halligan.

One judge alone listed eleven findings that “establish a reasonable basis” for a defense challenge, ranging from the painfully inexperienced Halligan seeming to mislead the grand jury on crucial (and far from esoteric) matters of law, to an apparent gap in the record of grand jury proceedings, to an FBI agent exposed to possibly privileged material who “chose to testify before the grand jury” rather than “contain any further exposure to privileged information and limit any prejudice to Mr. Comey.”

Also: Halligan may have been improperly appointed (we’ll likely get a ruling on that question by Thanksgiving). This may be a vindictive prosecution. (Ya think?) On Wednesday, we learned that the grand jury did not see or vote on the final two-count indictment—and by Friday, Comey had filed for dismissal due to these “fundamental errors.”

The whole flimsy, incompetent attempt to punish Comey seems doomed. And while one failure won’t derail this out-of-control president or the blatant lies and hypocrisy that pervade his administration, it would be a start.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NGal!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F790edc73-2ee0-4544-ab6e-20560ac41c62_3546x2364.jpeg",N,,2025-11-24 11:57:13.457192

TOP TALKER

HOMETOWN BOY: Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego returned Friday to the Chicago streets where he grew up, bringing with him a warning for Republicans: The federal immigration enforcement tactics deployed this year in Illinois — particularly in Little Village — will cost them at the ballot box.

On the ground: The Democratic senator shared the prediction in an interview after touring the Chicago neighborhood, where he met with shopkeepers to discuss the aggressive raids carried out by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents under “Operation Midway Blitz.”

A battle-tested veteran: “I fought in urban combat, and the tactics they were using in Little Village, they were treating it like a war zone,” he said, reflecting on his service in the U.S. Marines. “These men were dressed in battle fatigues with automatic weapons in an area that just doesn’t need it.”

His backstory: Gallego serves on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which oversees such matters. He also reports receiving daily updates from his sisters and other family members who live in Illinois.

Seeing red: Reflecting on Latino voters who drifted toward the GOP in 2024, Gallego said “it was frustrating” to see the key voting bloc shift right because he believed Donald Trump “was not going to care about working class people once he got in” and that adviser Stephen Miller would push for “racial profiling and mass deportations.”

Counter-raid: Gallego said many Latino voters initially believed the president intended to target only criminals. But after witnessing the aftermath of the raids in his hometown and hearing from residents, he argued they now see that “that’s not the case.”

He also offered a warning for Democrats. While the party may benefit from growing frustration among Latinos, he said it cannot take that shift for granted. “I don’t think we can just assume that Latinos are going to vote for Democrats if we don’t actually talk to their needs,” he said, adding that Democrats must deliver on economic priorities and immigration reform. “You promised that multiple times. You guys have never done it. So, this is definitely a lesson learned for us.”

Gallego’s visit to Chicago was also sentimental. Walking along 26th Street with Ald. Gilbert “Gil” Villegas — who, like Gallego, served in the Marines — he pointed out restaurants and businesses his family frequented during his youth.

Everywhere he went — the bakery, the grocery store, the quinceañera shop — he said he heard the same concern. “Fear,” Gallego said. “Their own government came and brought fear onto them.”

More on his Chicago visit, from the Tribune’s Andrew Carter.

THE BUZZ

President Donald Trump renewed his push for federal action to curb violence in Chicago after shootings Friday left a 14-year-old dead and eight teens injured.

The shootings happened downtown on the heels of the city’s annual tree-lighting ceremony. Block Club has details.

Mayor Brandon Johnson acknowledged the “emotional whiplash” of the “peaceful” tree-lighting and the shootings that followed. “When we have a setback like this, it just reminds us of the long road that we have to build the city that we all want to live in,” he said Saturday in a press conference to address the shootings.

Trump referenced the incidents in a social-media message posted Saturday. “Massive crime and rioting in the Chicago Loop area,” he wrote. “Governor Pritzker and the Low IQ Mayor of Chicago are refusing Federal Government help for a situation that could be quickly remedied. The people are chanting, BRING IN TRUMP!!!,’ via his Truth social network.

It’s a familiar refrain by Trump who has often characterized Chicago as “a mess.”

So, no surprise, Johnson and Gov. JB Pritzker didn’t comment on Trump’s post.

Abigail Spanberger was elected to serve as Virginia’s next governor, leading a wave of wins for Democratic candidates and giving the party a legislative trifecta entering this winter’s General Assembly session.

Amidst the backdrop of change in Richmond, including 13 seats changing parties in the House of Delegates, legislators began prefiling bills for the January session on Nov. 17.

While still in the early stages, and with the session not opening for several more weeks, the Legislature is expecting to take up several issues that could impact lawyers and the legal community at large.

Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, anticipated that the Legislature would take up a variety of issues impacting several areas of law practice.

“In terms of subject matter areas, the big ones are criminal, family law, personal injury, trusts and estates and commercial litigation,” he said.

Meanwhile, the Virginia State Bar has petitioned the Supreme Court of Virginia to engage in legislative activity on several issues in the 2026 session, including bar dues paid by Virginia attorneys.

Bar activity

In September, the Supreme Court of Virginia approved a VSB petition requesting approval to engage in legislative activity to amend Va. Code § 54.1-3912, which governs the cap on bar dues.

The statutory cap on annual bar dues is $250, which has been unchanged since 1995. Annual dues have not been raised since 2000, which the VSB said in its petition to the court makes Virginia’s dues among the lowest in the country.

But rising costs, statutory inflexibility and a drop in new attorneys have led to financial challenges for the bar, which has used reserve savings to supplement a deficit in operating revenue.

Per a news release from the VSB earlier this year, a dues increase “will avoid VSB insolvency by [fiscal year] 2029.”

Representatives of the VSB have not commented beyond what has been made public, including a March release requesting public comment stating that dues would increase “no more than 20 percent [from] the current $250 dues assessment” should the General Assembly amend the code.

A dues increase would also not be automatic, as the VSB has to get approval from the Supreme Court of Virginia for any increase, regardless of the cap.

Earlier this month, the VSB also began soliciting public comment on proposed legislative action to support an increase in pay for guardians ad litem.

The current rate of pay for a guardian ad litem is $57.50 per hour for time spent out of court and $78.85 for time spent in court. A 2025 report by the Office of the Children’s Ombudsman said that “low hourly rate and insufficiency of the recent pay increase” is an underlying reason for a decrease in GALs, with some regions seeing as much as a 37% reduction.

“State leaders should consider providing a more reasonably rate of compensation for the attorneys advocating for Virginia’s children,” the report stated, suggesting a 13.5% increase to $65 per hour out of court and $90 per hour in court.

Glen Allen attorney Joshua Farmer, who focuses his practice on family law and is a guardian ad litem, said the compensation is not what convinces attorneys to do such work.

“I don’t know a single GAL who does the job for the money,” he said. “There’s none to be had. Doing it right requires a significant time commitment.”

Farmer said the low pay is leading to some firms not allowing attorneys to accept GAL appointments, leaving much of that work to solo practitioners and small firm lawyers “who don’t have to explain to a boss why we just spent the whole day on a case that we bill at one-fifth of our normal hourly rate.”

“I do the work because I still find it personally satisfying, but it doesn’t pay the bills,” he added.

Reconsidered measures

During his term, Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed more than 400 bills, more than any governor in Virginia history. The bulk of the vetoes came during the last two years of his term, when Democrats controlled both chambers of the General Assembly.

Among the pieces of legislation vetoed or otherwise left behind from prior sessions that Surovell expects to be reintroduced in 2026 are bills on creating a vehicle for class action lawsuits in state courts, the medical malpractice cap, sovereign immunity and the retail sale of cannabis.

Criminal law related topics Surovell said might be addressed range from the “boyfriend loophole” for firearm possession to rules on criminal discovery.

“There’s some bills that Youngkin has been vetoing for the last two years that are definitely going to be on the table this year,” he said.

While its early, it’s expected that some pieces of legislation vetoed by Youngkin could have an easier time being enacted once Spanberger takes office in January.

As of press time, only a handful of bills had been filed for the 2026 session. Among those were two bills that have been referred to the Senate Courts of Justice Committee.

Senate Bill 23 proposes prohibiting plea agreements and court orders from containing provisions waiving a defendant’s Fourth Amendment rights and providing for a right to file a petition requesting police and court record expungement and a right to sealing of criminal history record information.

Senate Bill 24, if passed, would require the Commonwealth to copy or photograph discovery materials that an accused person is permitted to inspect or review upon request. Those materials could include relevant police reports, criminal records and police body-camera footage.

Criminal justice reform not expected

One bill from the 2025 session that will not be refiled is the “Virginia Access to Justice Act,” a sprawling criminal justice reform measure that was left in the Senate Appropriations Committee last session.

The proposal would have established a public defender’s office in each judicial circuit as well as an appellate defender’s office to represent indigent persons in appeals of convictions, raised the limitation on fees that per-hour court-appointed counsel can receive, required commonwealth’s attorneys prosecute misdemeanors that are jailable offenses, and expanded the Virginia Victims Fund to provide financial relief to more victims.

But the bill had a price tag of more than $100 million, which lawmakers and stakeholders balked at.

Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, the bill’s patron, told Virginia Lawyers Weekly he would not reintroduce the act in 2026.

“While it is the right thing to do and sound public policy, this is not the year because of the current fiscal climate,” Deeds said via email.

Surovell said that budget concerns will be an issue in the upcoming session, with lost revenue creating “very little money for new programs or increasing spending.” He added that a recent analysis showed a potential loss of billions of dollars of revenue over the next two years.

“The amount of money that we pay for court-appointed counsel and GALs should be offensive to everybody, and we’re working hard to try to come up with more money,” Surovell said. “But there is very little.”",https://valawyersweekly.com/files/2023/12/Richmond-VA-State-Capitol.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 16:57:48.927755

Investigations and lawsuits The number of lawsuits triggered by the crackdown is growing, including on agents' use of force and conditions at the Broadview center.","CHICAGO — Chicago has entered what many consider a new uneasy phase of a Trump administration immigration crackdown that has already led to thousands of arrests.

While a U.S. Border Patrol commander known for leading intense and controversial surges moved on to North Carolina, federal agents are still arresting immigrants across the nation's third-largest city and suburbs.

A growing number of lawsuits stemming from the crackdown are winding through the courts. Authorities are investigating agents' actions, including a fatal shooting. Activists say they are not letting their guard down in case things ramp up again, while many residents in the Democratic stronghold where few welcomed the crackdown remain anxious.

""I feel a sense of paranoia over when they might be back,"" said Santani Silva, an employee at a vintage store in the predominantly Mexican neighborhood of Pilsen. ""People are still afraid.""

Intensity slows, but arrests continue

For more than two months, the Chicago area was the focus of an aggressive operation led by Gregory Bovino, a Border Patrol commander behind similar efforts in Los Angeles and soon Louisiana.

Armed and masked agents used unmarked SUVs and helicopters throughout the city of 2.7 million and its suburbs to target suspected criminals and immigration violators. Arrests often led to intense standoffs with bystanders, from wealthy neighborhoods to working-class suburbs.

While the intensity has died down in the week since Bovino left, reports of arrests still pop up. Activists tracking immigration agents said they confirmed 142 daily sightings at the height of the operation last month. The number is now roughly six a day.

""It's not over,"" said Brandon Lee with the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. ""I don't think it will be over.""

Suburb under siege

Bearing the brunt of the operation has been Broadview, a Chicago suburb of roughly 8,000 people that has housed a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing center for years.

Protests outside the facility have grown increasingly tense as federal agents used chemical agents that area neighbors felt. Broadview police also launched three criminal investigations into federal agents' tactics.

Community leaders took the unusual step of declaring a civil emergency last week, after Bovino left the area, and moving public meetings online.

Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson said the community has faced bomb threats, death threats and violent protests because of the crackdown.

""I will not allow threats of violence or intimidation to disrupt the essential functions of our government,"" Thompson said.

Questionable arrests and detentions

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has touted more than 3,000 arrests, but the agency has provided details on only a few cases where immigrants without legal permission to live in the country also had a criminal history.

The Trump administration takes to social media to post photos of supposed violent criminals apprehended in immigration operations, but the federal government's own data paints a different picture.

Of 614 immigrants arrested and detained in recent months around Chicago, only 16, less than 3%, had criminal records representing a ""high public safety risk,"" according to federal government data submitted to the court as part of a 2022 consent decree about ICE arrests. Those records included domestic battery and drunken driving.

A judge in the cases said hundreds of immigrant detainees qualify to be released on bond, though an appeals court has paused their release. Attorneys say many more cases will follow as they get details from the government about arrests.

""None of this has quite added up,"" said Ed Yohnka with the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, which has been involved in several lawsuits. ""What was this all about? What did this serve? What did any of this do?""

Investigations and lawsuits

The number of lawsuits triggered by the crackdown is growing, including on agents' use of force and conditions at the Broadview center. In recent days, clergy members filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging they were being blocked from ministering inside a facility.

Federal prosecutors have also repeatedly dropped charges against protesters and other bystanders, including dismissing charges against a woman who was shot several times by a Border Patrol agent last month.

Meanwhile, federal agents are also under investigation in connection with the death of a suburban man fatally shot by ICE agents during a traffic stop. Mexico's president has called for a thorough investigation, while ICE has said it did not use excessive force.

An autopsy report, obtained recently by The Associated Press, showed Silverio Villegas González died of a gunshot wound fired at ""close range"" to his neck. The death was declared a homicide.

In October, the body of the 38-year-old father who spent two decades in the U.S. was buried in the western Mexico state of Michoacan.

A chilling effect

Many of the once bustling business corridors in the Chicago area's largely immigrant communities that had quieted down were seeing a buzz again with some street vendors slowly returning to their usual posts.

Andrea Melendez, the owner of Pink Flores Bakery and Cafe, said she has seen an increase in sales this week after struggling for months.

""As a new business, I was a bit scared when we saw sales drop,"" she said. ""But this week I'm feeling a bit more hope that things may get better.""

Eleanor Lara, 52, has spent months avoiding unnecessary trips outside her Chicago home, fearful that an encounter with immigration agents could have dire consequences.

Even as a U.S. citizen, she is afraid and carries her birth certificate. She is married to a Venezuelan man whose legal status is in limbo.

""We're still sticking home,"" she said.",https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/rockcms/2025-11/251124-chicago-immigration-mb-1356-57fd93.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 11:57:41.785626

During the past 10 months during Trump’s second term, there have been an average of 1,500 daily procedures officially known as “removals,” and the numbers are ballooning, aided by the $76 billion allocated to immigration enforcement over the next four years in the “Big Beautiful Bill.”

A series of concurrent rulings of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and another one this summer upheld four of them, rejecting claims to allow them to remain in the country.

The concurrent ones involved different factual settings for immigrants from three different countries. But they shared common features: In each, the immigrants sought asylum in this country and avoidance of removal from it; in each, their requests were denied by immigration judges and by the Board of Immigration Appeals in administrative proceedings; and in each of them the 8th Circuit in per curiam rulings upheld the denial of their petitions for relief.

The prevalence of the topics of immigration and deportation these days as Thanksgiving approaches provides an opportune occasion to review the trio of cases.

“I’ll never understand how destroying families through deportation benefits our society.”

“You can’t undo a deportation.”

Author-attorney Jonathan Shapiro (1980- )

Torture topic

The Convention Against Torture was unsuccessfully invoked as a topic for asylum prevention of removal in Ramos-Ramos v. Bondi, 2025 WL 2058350 (8th Cir. July 23, 2025) (per curiam). The claimant tried to prevent deportation of herself and her minor daughter to their native Guatemala under 8 U.S.C. §1101 (a)(42)(A), 1158 (b)(1).

But the 8th Circuit, without discussing the underlying circumstances, upheld the administrative determination that the immigrant did not prove a “well-founded fear of future persecution” and that the “generalized” condition of violence or crime did not warrant relief.

The claim under the Torture Treaty also did not prevail because there was no evidence of torture for “reasons unrelated” to her asylum claim.

Guatemalan group

Another Guatemalan had her application for asylum and ban to removal rejected in De Martinez v. Bondi, 2025 WL 2092391 (8th Cir. July 25, 2025) (per curiam). The asylum seeker, a woman fearing gangs in her country, claimed to have been assaulted twice there by men before joining her husband in this country. But her concern of future harm failed because she did not seek law enforcement assistance after the attacks because of her unwarranted assumption that the local authorities would not help her.

But the key to the appellate affirmation of the administrative decision was that the woman did not belong to a cognizable “social group” entitling her to asylum. That she was living with a brother-in-law when attacked precluded classification as “living alone” for purposes of asylum protection.

Reopening refusal

The 8th Circuit also upheld refusal by the Board of Immigration Appeals to reopen an asylum proceeding on behalf of an Indonesian woman who overstayed her non-immigrant visitor status in Tan v. Bondi, 2025 WL 2083117 (8th Cir. July 24, 2025) (per curiam).

The attempt to remain here failed because she did not show a “particularized persecution” based upon her religion or ethnicity in her homeland. Her effort to reopen the asylum case was rejected because the deportation ruling occurred two decades after her original proceedings, and there had not been any “material change” in conditions in her homeland since that time.

A couple of weeks later, the Circuit Court upheld denial of a petition for asylum by another Guatemalan who failed to establish a high level of past persecution in her homeland so that the authorities there were “unwilling or unable” to protect her and her family in Rodriguez v. Bondi, 2025 WL 2254129 (8th Cir. August 7, 2025) (per curiam). The challenge to the BIA determination failed because the alleged persecution was attributable to “private individuals,” and the petition did not establish that the government “could not or would not” control their behavior.

This quartet of cases reflect how President Trump has wished to “get cooperation from the courts” in requiring undocumented immigrants with scant judicial process. “Trump Says Undocumented Immigrants Shouldn’t Get Trials before Deportation,” April 22, 2025, edition of The New York Times.

Lack of independence limits immigration court’s authority Almost from the outset, immigration courts were plagued by a lack of resources, authority and judicial independence.
“We were a legal Cinderella,” said Dana Leigh Marks, who retired as an immigration judge in 2021 after a 34-year career.","The government lawyer knew what was coming as she stood inside a courtroom and texted an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent waiting in a corridor a few feet away.

“I can’t do this,” the lawyer said in a text message as she looked at her docket of cases. “This is a new emotional load.”

“I understand,” the agent responded. “Hopefully we meet again in a better situation.”

Nearby, a Cuban man who had lived in the United States for years stepped from an elevator and into the courtroom where the government lawyer was waiting for what the man thought was a routine hearing.

The man was doing what the law required, and brought along his wife, a legal resident, and their 7-month-old infant.

Then the lawyer quickly moved to have the man’s asylum claim dismissed and a judge agreed, making the man eligible for “expedited removal.” As he left the courtroom, the man was swarmed by plainclothes immigration agents who had been surveilling him. A struggle ensued and the wife’s shouts could be heard from the hallway as the lawyer moved on to the next case.

The agent replied four minutes later: “Got him.”

Similar scenes of courthouse arrests, part of a makeover of the immigration courts under President Donald Trump, are playing out across the United States as his call for mass deportations of migrants is executed with unusually aggressive tactics.

Trump’s pledge during his 2024 campaign to impose hard-line immigration policies was a major reason he won a second term. Now that Americans have seen how the plan is being implemented, there are signs that many think he has gone too far. About 57 percent of adults disapprove of Trump’s handling of immigration, according to a survey this month by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

Over several months, reporters for The Associated Press observed immigration court proceedings in 21 cities. Hearings repeatedly ended with cases dismissed by the government, allowing plainclothes federal agents to carry out arrests in courthouse hallways in close coordination with attorneys from the Department of Homeland Security.

Screenshots of the text messages were obtained by The Associated Press from a government official who feared reprisal and provided them on condition of anonymity. The messages offer a rare look at how the nation’s 75 immigration courts are churning out rulings in an assembly-line like fashion and how, for many people, the courtrooms have become deportation traps.

Courthouse arrests coordinated days in advance

In a court system with a backlog of about 3.8 million asylum cases, families have been torn apart and lives upended. Due process seemingly is an afterthought.

“When Americans picture a courtroom, there are a few core expectations” of fairness, dignity and impartiality, said Ashley Tabaddor, a former immigration judge in Los Angeles and past president of the National Association of Immigration Judges.

“That’s what makes a court — not a room with a bench or person with a robe,” she said. “But what we have here is a vision completely turned on its head.”

Over the past nine months, the Trump administration has fired almost 90 immigration judges seen by Trump’s allies as too lenient, directed masked officers to handcuff migrants at closed asylum hearings and sent memos instructing judges to fall into line.

Unlike federal courts, where there are strict rules of procedure and judges have lifetime tenure, the Justice Department runs immigration courts and the attorney general can fire the judges with fewer restraints.

Nine current officials spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. Most expressed deep misgivings about punishing people who had followed the rules and showed up for court hearings.

“As a government attorney, my duty is to uphold the law and protect the public interest — not to secure removal or detention outcomes by default,” a government lawyer wrote to the American Bar Association seeking professional guidance.

But that is not how cases are often unfolding.

Courthouse arrests are coordinated days in advance to meet quotas with little regard for the particulars of a case, according to several of the U.S. officials.

According to one official, Homeland Security lawyers note on a spreadsheet which cases are “amenable” to dismissal, allowing an asylum-seeker to be immediately rearrested and placed in expedited removal proceedings. Most of those detained are men without lawyers who entered the U.S. alone and are expected to appear in court in person. Contrary to Trump’s claims that he is targeting the “worst of the worst,” most don’t have a criminal conviction, according to a Cato Institute analysis of ICE data.

ICE reviews the spreadsheet and selects which people it wants to pursue if cases are dismissed. On the hearing date, federal agents communicate directly with DHS lawyers, who act as prosecutors in immigration courts. The lawyer often provides near verbatim updates of the proceedings over text message to agents waiting outside the courtroom.

“Black shirt? Let me know if the judge dismissed,” an ICE agent texted during one hearing.

Lack of independence limits immigration court’s authority

Almost from the outset, immigration courts were plagued by a lack of resources, authority and judicial independence.

The courts were established in 1952, but it was not until 1973 that “special inquiry officers” were given the “judge” title and allowed to wear judicial robes. The Executive Office for Immigration Review, or EOIR, was created in 1983. But that agency remained a part of the Justice Department, giving the attorney general authority to override decisions.

“We were a legal Cinderella,” said Dana Leigh Marks, who retired as an immigration judge in 2021 after a 34-year career. “No other court in the nation functions like this.”

The first Trump administration undertook a series of changes to reduce the case backlog, including instructing judges to deny entire categories of asylum claims such as for victims of gang or domestic violence.

It also set up a dashboard that would become the bane of many judges: Red, yellow and green gauges measure each judge’s performance on goals ranging from completed cases — a minimum of 700 annually, regardless of complexity — to how many custody cases were decided on their first hearings.

To meet the metrics, judges must race through dockets, sometimes devoting mere minutes to evaluate asylum-seekers’ claims.

“It’s like deciding death penalty cases in a traffic court setting,” Marks said.

Administration refers to immigration judges as ‘inferior officers’

When Trump returned to the White House in January, his allies took direct aim at the court.

Since then, the Justice Department has issued 52 policy memos — more than the previous six years combined — making it easier to hire and fire judges and warning against pro-migrant bias.

The memos highlight the courts’ weakened status by referring to judges as “inferior officers” — a rarely used term taken from the Constitution.

In early September, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he would lend 600 military lawyers to the immigration courts, about equal to the current number of judges. The goal, according to the administration, is to more effectively reduce caseloads by widening the pool of potential judges to include people already steeped in administrative law. But many migrant advocates are concerned the incoming judges lack the necessary experience to decide asylum cases.

“It makes as much sense as having a cardiologist do a hip replacement,” said Ben Johnson, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

The administration has pushed back against criticism it is co-opting the courts to accelerate its deportation goals. In a statement, Justice Department spokeswoman Natalie Baldassarre said DHS decides whether to arrest migrants and that most judges consider it an “honor rather than an insult” to be called an inferior officer empowered by the Constitution and serving at the will of the attorney general.

Baldassarre likened a record surge of asylum-seekers during the Biden administration to an “improper conspiracy between DHS and the Immigration Courts to effectuate an unlawful amnesty for hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens.” The Justice Department, she said, had “restored the integrity, impartiality, and independence of the Courts.”

DHS did not respond to repeated email and phone requests for comment.

Government attorneys fear harassment, haunted by arrests

For some inside the courts, work has become a stressful, lonesome grind. Fear prevails. Resumes are being updated.

One DHS lawyer described being haunted at night by the sound of jangling shackles of migrants the lawyer helped arrest. The lawyer joined the government after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, believing that protecting America’s borders was a patriotic duty.

The lawyer still cherishes a signed copy of Nobel Prize winner Elie Wiesel’s memoir “Night,” which was handed out at a work seminar. “Think higher, feel deeper,” reads the author’s inscription of the book, which is marked DHS “Training Material.”

Today, its message torments.

“This isn’t what any of us signed up for,” the lawyer said.

After a turbulent summer, the courthouses are starting to look lonely, too. With word spreading that a trap had been laid, many migrants, fearing arrest, are asking to appear online or are skipping hearings altogether.

Meanwhile, ambitious managers are publicly upbraiding those who raise doubts about the legality of locking up migrants with no criminal record in packed facilities. In a recent town hall with DHS principal legal adviser Charles Wall, several lawyers complained about the pressure, confusing orders and lack of resources, according to notes from the meeting shared with AP.

Wall said the pace is likely to continue for years, the notes say. When one federal employee asked about bringing firearms to work for fear of harassment by activists inside courthouses, Wall said that judges should not hesitate to kick out the public. Wall could not be reached for comment.

‘I want to go back to my country’

The harsh tactics have had one effect the administration wants: Voluntary migrant departures have soared, with more than 14,000 people seeking court permission to self-deport in the first eight months of 2025, according to federal data collected by Mobile Pathways, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that pushes for transparency in migration proceedings. That is more than the previous five years combined. The number is almost certainly an undercount because most migrants do not withdraw their asylum claim before self-deporting.

At immigration court in Tacoma, the detainees came up one after the other with the same plea.

“I want to go back to my country,” a Venezuelan man told Judge Theresa Scala.

“I want to leave the country,” said a man from Mexico.

Immigrants know what they face: detention centers with ominous names — “Alligator Alcatraz,” “Louisiana Lockup” and “Speedway Slammer” — as well as workplace raids and neighborhood dragnets.

Fired judges targeted as too liberal

Tania Nemer believes she was cut out to be a judge. From the bench at immigration court in Cleveland, she prided herself on listening carefully to each person’s asylum claim.

“There’s a simplicity about it that I just loved,” she told the AP. “If you can provide justice in an efficient manner, you can really help a lot of people.”

The decision to apply to become an immigration judge in 2023 was deeply personal. Her father fled turmoil in Lebanon and arrived in Ohio at 16 with $6 in his pocket. He washed cars, learned English and eventually opened a namesake bar — Manny’s Pub — that allowed him to provide for his family. When Nemer married, her wedding gift was the unspent dollar bills, so she would never forget her roots.

But Nemer’s fondness for the law came crashing down Feb. 5. In the middle of a hearing, her supervisor opened the door of her packed courtroom and told her she needed to come with him.

“As soon as he said ‘Grab your ID,’ I knew I was being terminated,” she said.

Still in shock, she was handed a two-paragraph letter, digitally signed by Sirce Owen, the acting director of the Executive Office for Immigration Review. It said she was being removed because the agency “has determined that retaining you is not appropriate, and we thank you for your service.”

No justification was given. But she thinks she knows some of the reasons: her Arab-sounding name, a history of previously representing migrants and diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, course work from Cornell University. She filed a discrimination claim with the Justice Department to find out why she was fired; the complaint was dismissed.

Nemer was the first judge fired after Trump returned to the White House. But 86 have been sacked since. Dozens more took the Department of Government Efficiency’s “Fork in the Road” resignation offer.

The majority were hired under Democratic President Joe Biden and are still serving two-year probationary periods, according to a list of the fired judges obtained by the AP.

It is unclear who ordered the firings or how they were selected. But those removed granted asylum at markedly higher rates than their peers — in about half of all cases since August 2023 compared with 34 percent nationwide, according to Mobile Pathways.

Among those purged were all 10 that appeared on the DHS Bureaucrat Watch List, a website created last year with funding from The Heritage Foundation, whose Project 2025 was a blueprint for the Trump administration’s policies and personnel decisions.

The list includes names, Facebook photos, salaries and campaign donations for what it calls “America’s most subversive immigration bureaucrats.” One target was Emmett Soper, a judge in northern Virginia who worked at EOIR headquarters during the Biden administration.

“As soon as I saw that, I knew the rules were changing, that I was under some kind of microscope that didn’t exist before,” he said.

Tom Jones, the conservative creator of the website, declined to be interviewed.

Baldassarre, the Justice Department spokeswoman, said the department is not targeting specific individuals for firing but does continually evaluate all judges.

“All judges have a legal, ethical, and professional obligation to be impartial and neutral in adjudicating cases,” Baldassarre said. “If a judge violates that obligation by demonstrating a systematic bias in favor of or against either party, EOIR is obligated to take action to preserve the integrity of its system.”

The wave of firings and new directives from the Justice Department has had a chilling effect. Denial of motions to appear for hearings online tripled after a March memo repealing Biden-era guidelines instructing judges to generally grant such requests, according to Mobile Pathways data. Denial of continuances, which allow migrants extra time to seek legal counsel, have also spiked as have the number of cases classified as abandoned.

Nemer returned to immigration court in October for the first time since being fired to represent a Mexican client she has known for 20 years and who was picked up by unidentified agents. While the man was jailed, his girlfriend, who was five months pregnant, miscarried.

Word of the former judge’s return quickly spread and a stream of former colleagues came to the courtroom to hug her and express their dismay over her firing.

“By the third hug I couldn’t hold it in and just started crying,” she said.

Legal assistance for migrants dries up after Trump budget cuts

Bug spray, sunscreen, fans and umbrellas compete with legal binders in the bed of a Toyota pickup across the street from immigration court in San Antonio.

This is the new office of American Gateways.

In April, the administration eliminated programs worth $30 million to provide free legal assistance to migrants, the vast majority of whom represent themselves in court.

The flood of claims threatens to clog the already crowded federal docket, which has little authority in immigration cases.

“The administration is attempting to press the gas at such an unreasonable speed without considering due process,” said Annelise Araujo, a Boston-based immigration attorney.

One petition, filed in Miami, was from a Cuban man detained the same day he and his American wife and 10-month-old daughter were moving into their first home. Several petitioners said they had survived torture at the hands of gangs in Mexico, Ecuador and Venezuela.

Another legal challenge was introduced by an HIV-positive man from Brazil taken into custody four days after his husband died of a heart attack. With the body of Frederico Abreu’s husband still at the funeral home, ICE officials knocked on his door stating they had documents belonging to the deceased man.

A father pulled away from his sobbing family

Those unable to afford a lawyer so they can sue in federal court have little recourse.

One was a man from Honduras who showed up at the northern Virginia immigration court with his wife and their infant baby. Another child, a son, unable to walk, pushed himself in a wheelchair studded with flashing, colorful lights. The family, fearful of further immigration problems, did not want to be identified.

The judge denied a government request to deport the man. But seconds later, as the family stepped from the courtroom, they were stopped by four ICE agents.

The wife sobbed, hanging on her husband’s arm as she pleaded: “Por favor, Por favor.”

The husband clutched the sleeping infant’s carrier. Their son sat playing with a cell phone.

“I need you to go ahead and say goodbye,” an agent told the man. Crying, the man knelt to hug his son, who clung to his father, yelling repeatedly: “Papa! Papa!”

Finally, the father managed to pull himself away and started to leave with the ICE officers.

The boy tried to chase them. But the ICE agent was holding the back of the wheelchair as the boy futilely pumped his arms.

The Department of Homeland Security confirmed his July arrest. The family said he was later deported. Homeland Security said he voluntarily agreed to leave the country and returned to Honduras on Oct. 8 after three months in detention.",https://www.columbian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Immigration_Court_Takeover_00070-384de.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 10:58:50.504652

The revisions to state law were made in response to residents’ concerns about federal immigration policy. Divided along party lines, state Democrats have worked to address immigrants’ assertions that they are living in fear.

Here’s what you need to know about what ICE can do in Connecticut.

What changes were made in the latest state legislation?

In November’s special session, state lawmakers passed House Bill 8004 which included sections that limit ICE from making arrests at courthouses. The bill prohibits representatives of a local, state or federal law enforcement authority from arresting people inside state courthouses without a judicial warrant. ICE agents are also not allowed to wear masks on courthouse grounds without a medical requirement.

There are also measures to protect immigrants’ personal information. State agencies are not allowed to share personal information such as dates and times of court hearings and appointments, home addresses, and workplaces.

Gov. Ned Lamont signed the bill into law shortly after the special session.

Can Connecticut law enforcement turn immigrants over to ICE?

In 2019, Connecticut lawmakers passed the Trust Act, which specified the grounds on which local and state officials are allowed to turn over unauthorized migrants to ICE. The Act prohibits state law enforcement from arresting individuals solely on the basis of detainers — requests from ICE to hold someone for up to 48 hours so agents can then pick them up.

Law enforcement officers may comply with detainers only if ICE has a judicial warrant to make an arrest, or if the individual in their custody has been convicted of a class A or B felony, or identified on a terrorist watch list. Class A or B felonies include murder, kidnapping, sexual assault, robbery, and first-degree manslaughter.

The Trust Act was modified in May of this year. Now, individuals can sue cities and towns if the Act is violated. Further, the circumstances under which law enforcement must comply with ICE requests for detainment were expanded to include 13 more crimes and broaden who is considered a law enforcement official.

What happens when ICE makes an arrest?

While the recent laws intended to make courthouses safer for immigrants in Connecticut, ICE agents can still make arrests in other public areas without a warrant if they have a reasonable suspicion to believe that the individual they are targeting is an unauthorized migrant, as per the Immigration and Nationality Act.

Further, aside from courthouse grounds, there are no laws requiring ICE agents to show their face, or prohibiting masks. This means that ICE agents may still approach an individual in a mask and make an arrest, without a warrant.

How does the state recommend state agencies respond to ICE visits?

In a document from Lamont’s office issued in January, the state provides guidance on how state agencies should handle visits from ICE to comply with state and federal laws while also protecting individuals’ privacy rights.

The guide instructs state officials to request information on why the ICE agent is making a visit, notify legal counsel, and refrain from sharing any personal information or documents such as immigration status until a legal counsel reviews the request.

ICE also has limited access to non-public areas. They are prohibited from accessing non-public areas of a state agency building without a judicial warrant. But there is no legislation to limit their movements in public premises of an establishment. For example, an ICE agent could make an unwarranted arrest on a sidewalk outside of the state facility.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP-ice-arrest.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 09:56:53.270155

The office of CORE is intended to review complaints about human rights abuses by Canadian companies abroad in the oil and gas, garment, and mining sectors.
For Canadian companies, committing to them can offer the veneer of dedication to fair labour practices and environmental responsibility without much scrutiny.
“Maybe Canadian companies are a little bit cleaner than other companies in a global comparison,” he says.","On August 21, the Federal District Court in Miami ordered the closure of the Florida detention centre known as Alligator Alcatraz. Two weeks later, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled to pause that lower court decision. Alligator Alcatraz—and all the controversy surrounding it—was resurrected.

Built in just eight days in the Everglades wetlands, the facility was intended to hold up to 5,000 federal immigration detainees. In July, around 1,800 people were confined there in groups of thirty-two inside disaster-relief tents, where conditions reportedly swung between extreme cold and heat, with sewage hauled out and drinking water brought in. Speaking to the Associated Press, migrant detainees and their lawyers described worm-infested food, swarms of mosquitoes, windowless cells, flooded floors with fecal waste, and insufficient showers and toilets.

The centre faced lawsuits from the American Civil Liberties Union and others citing due-process violations. Environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe also challenged the site, arguing no environmental review was conducted before it was built. In her late-August ruling on the latter case, US district judge Kathleen M. Williams ruled that detainees must be relocated within sixty days, barred new transfers, and ordered much of the facility dismantled. The state appealed and asked the ruling be paused while their appeal was heard. The stay was granted, and detainees once again began to be transferred to the Everglades facility.

Among the companies contracted to provide services for Alligator Alcatraz are IRG Global Emergency Management—a US offshoot of ARS Global Emergency Management, a Toronto-based company also known as Access Restoration Services Ltd—and a US-based business unit of Quebec-based security operator GardaWorld. IRG Global Emergency Management was incorporated only this past February, yet it has received a total of $25.8 million (US) from the state of Florida so far this year—$6.2 million (US) of that in contracts to provide operational support to Alligator Alcatraz.

Headquartered in Virginia, GardaWorld’s US arm—GardaWorld Federal—has an $8 million (US) contract to provide services for the detention site. (In an email, a GardaWorld spokesperson wrote that the company could not comment on a specific facility or service due to its contractual obligations with the Florida Department of Emergency Management.) In July, it was advertising vacancies for full-time positions based in a remote part of southern-central Florida for armed security guards and correctional officers, with a preference for candidates who were bilingual in English and Spanish.

While the job advertisements did not explicitly cite Alligator Alcatraz, it is the only detention facility in that location. The job descriptions indicated a potentially dangerous working environment, noting that “employees may be exposed to extreme cold or hot weather conditions, fumes, or airborne particles, toxic or caustic chemicals, and loud noise.” (According to a GardaWorld spokesperson, GardaWorld Federal is governed separately and the parent company does not have visibility on its hiring practices.) Such conditions are legal under Florida jurisdiction, says Thomas Kennedy, a policy analyst and a spokesperson for the Florida Immigrant Coalition. “Unfortunately, Florida does not have any real meaningful labor laws,” he wrote in an email. “We live in a hellish state.”

While it may seem disturbing for any Canadian-linked entity to be involved in the operations of a detention centre accused of human rights abuses, they aren’t breaking the law. And that’s part of a bigger problem, says Aidan Gilchrist-Blackwood, network coordinator at the Canadian Network on Corporate Accountability. “There is, unfortunately, a precedent of really serious abuses being documented and linked to the Canadian security sector around the world.” The CNCA, a coalition of forty-two civil society groups, fights to hold Canadian companies to account for human rights abuses and environmental destruction.

Whether IRG or GardaWorld are implicated in the allegations against the facility is not clear, and there may be no way to hold them responsible even if they are. “Right now,” says Gilchrist-Blackwood, “there really are not good mechanisms in Canada for accountability for abuses linked to Canadian companies outside of Canada.”

The Chaos Trump Unleashed Is Just Getting Started

Migrants Follow Risky Path into Canada as US Deportation Threats Grow

I’ve Visited Guantánamo 28 Times as a Reporter. It Still Defies Belief

In 2019, the federal government under then prime minister Justin Trudeau created the office of the Canadian Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise. The office of CORE is intended to review complaints about human rights abuses by Canadian companies abroad in the oil and gas, garment, and mining sectors. The body reports to the minister of international trade.

But from the start, the office was criticized as toothless because it lacked the ability to compel witnesses and documents in its investigations. It was also limited in its scope, as businesses outside the sectors monitored could not be examined. Its first ombudsperson, Sheri Meyerhoffer, stepped down from her five-year term at the end of April 2024. An interim leader occupied the role until this past May. Meyerhoffer’s replacement hasn’t yet been appointed, and there has been no job application posted to fill the role.

The minister of international trade under Global Affairs issued a review of CORE at the time of Meyerhoffer stepping down, but that report has not been presented to Parliament. The CORE website still invites people to email or call to file complaints, but without an ombudsperson appointed, those complaints cannot be investigated. (A recent CTV report noted that the newly released federal budget does not specify whether this role will be filled.)

Even if CORE were fully staffed and its mandate extended to cover the security sector, it would most likely not apply to the Canadian companies whose US affiliates have contracts with Alligator Alcatraz. “There’s really nothing to stop a Canadian company from going out anywhere in the world and getting involved in serious human rights abuses,” said James Yap, a Toronto-based lawyer specializing in business and human rights. “And it extends far beyond the US.”

This gap in oversight points to a larger trend: the steady outsourcing of state functions to private operators. Beginning in the 1980s in the US and 1990s in Canada, governments started to reduce state services and embrace privatization for certain nationally run institutions, such as prisons, as a way to trim bureaucracies and cut costs. Many private security companies then further honed their expertise during the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, setting up and then managing the daily operations of military bases. Security operators “have the gear at the ready in their storage houses, and it’s great for the government because it doesn’t have to worry,” says Aaron Ettinger, associate professor of political science at Carleton University. “But moving fast often means making a lot of mistakes, and that is certainly what is happening in Florida right now.”

In January 2023, Florida governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency in the state, citing a crisis due to the influx of illegal migrants. This state of emergency has been extended multiple times—most recently in late September of this year—and grants the government extraordinary powers. DeSantis and the Florida Division of Emergency Management (FDEM) are able to award contracts without the usual regulatory oversight and bypassing procurement and competitive bidding rules. And no audit has been completed of this spending. (DeSantis’s office and FDEM did not respond to interview requests.)

Both the US-based entity of ARS and IRG have enmeshed themselves in Florida state affairs to varying degrees. The Orlando Weekly and other outlets have reported that, in 2022, Access Restoration Services US, Inc. made a $99,980 (US) donation to the governor’s political action committee at the time, Friends of Ron DeSantis. The donation was made several days before DeSantis was re-elected. The company donated a further $99,980 (US) to the Republican Party of Florida in 2023 and $50,000 in 2024, plus an additional $75,000 to former Florida attorney general Ashley Moody. While reporting varies, the total contributions amount to at least around $325,000 (US). In 2023, the company also hired Tallahassee-based Ballard Partners to lobby on its behalf; the group’s lobbyists include former DeSantis administration officials, and head Brian Ballard is a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump.

ARS USA landed an open-ended contract in 2023 to transport unauthorized migrants, and in July of that year, it received the first state payment for $6 million (US). Subsequent contracts came from the US federal government and at state level to do rescue operations in Israel and Haiti, as well as hurricane disaster relief in North Carolina and Florida.

That year, a Houston law firm in which ARS had previously invested $3 million (US) was alleged to have engaged in insurance fraud concerning hurricane damages in multiple states. According to reporting by WGCU, an NPR and PBS affiliate for Southwest Florida, ARS also faced lawsuits and accusations that it had inflated its restoration costs. (ARS reportedly broke ties with and sued the law firm and has denied all allegations against the company.)

This involvement did not seem to harm its reputation in the eyes of the US government. The Orlando Weekly and the Miami Herald reported that, this past June, ARS offshoot IRG Global Emergency Management received its initial two contracts. The first was for $19,678,600 (US) to transport Israeli evacuees from Cyprus. And the second was for $1,180,000 (US) for operational support services for “migration efforts.” This second contract was granted on June 24, the same day IRG made a $10,000 (US) donation to the Republican Party of Florida. Later, IRG signed a further two contracts worth $2.2 million (US) and $2.9 million (US) to provide onsite emergency services, site shuttles, and arms management for the facility.

“All of this is basically a legalized form of bribery: it’s favour-buying from elected officials.”

According to a newsletter from ARS Responds Canada, a company that shares the same Toronto business address as ARS Global Emergency Management, chief executive officer Joseph Gagliano is based in Toronto, where his family founded the company in 1959. In July of this year, the CEO of IRG was listed as Giuseppe Gagliano, and the president was Robbie Meek. As of October, Meek is now listed as CEO and president on the company’s website. Only weeks after IRG was formed, Meek and the company donated a total of $6,000 (US) to the campaign account of Florida attorney general James Uthmeier, a key figure spearheading the plans for Alligator Alcatraz. The Orlando Sentinel reported that IRG donated another $3,000 (US) to Uthmeier in June.

“All of this is basically a legalized form of bribery: it’s favour-buying from elected officials. It’s also standard procedure and entirely out in the open,” says Ettinger, who notes that while campaign donation rules vary by state, they are porous enough in the US that corporations can often donate without significant limitations. “It undermines the public’s interest in government contracting based on merit because it introduces quid pro quo motives into the mix. It’s good for business, not good for democracy or efficient market-based government contracting.”

When reached for comment on this story, ARS emailed that “ARS USA is not affiliated with ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ in any capacity,” that it is a “completely separate and independent entity from IRG Global Emergency Management,” and that it “does not hold, manage, or participate in any contracts related to” the Florida site. The spokesperson referred further questions to the Canada-based office, which offered a similar clarification, saying that it “delivers emergency response and restoration services for the insurance and property management sectors” and “operates as a wholly independent entity, and is in no way associated with the operations of ARS USA or IRG USA.” IRG Global Emergency Management did not respond to interview requests.

“There is no enforceable due diligence responsibility that companies would have to monitor what their foreign subsidiaries do,” says Burkard Eberlein, professor of public policy and sustainability at Schulich School of Business. “Under Canadian corporate law, these are separate legal entities, so a subsidiary would be a separate legal entity, and there’s no automatic responsibility.”

Some companies and industries may have their own code of conduct—like the Mining Association of Canada’s Towards Sustainable Mining Protocol—but such codes are voluntary. “Those standards, if they exist, what can they do?” says Eberlein. “There’s definitely a difference between mining, where there’s at least an attempt to have those standards and implement them, versus the private security business.”

Canada also lacks supply chain–tracking regulations, which would require subsidiary companies to ensure materials sourced from abroad meet domestic standards. There is nothing here comparable to European Union supply traceability mechanisms like the EU Deforestation Regulation, which mandates that companies of a certain size demonstrate that products such as coffee, cocoa, and rubber are produced in compliance with the laws of their country of origin and have not contributed to deforestation before they can be sold in the EU.

The federal government’s fall 2024 economic update indicated that the Canadian government would introduce legislation that would hold Canadian companies responsible if any component of their supply chains involves forced labour or child labour. But there have been no updates on any such legislation since then.

To Eberlein, all of these voluntary codes and standards are about reputation management. For Canadian companies, committing to them can offer the veneer of dedication to fair labour practices and environmental responsibility without much scrutiny. “Maybe Canadian companies are a little bit cleaner than other companies in a global comparison,” he says. “Is that good enough? No, but if you want to do more, it would shake up the whole sector and be quite costly.”

Founded by Canadian Stéphan Crétier in 1995, GardaWorld operates globally, offering services such as private armed guards, bank security, armoured trucks, and airport security screening. (The Canadian branch of the multinational business is headquartered in Montreal, while Crétier resides in Dubai.)

GardaWorld’s financial contributions in Florida seem relatively minor; the Miami Herald reported that GardaWorld Cash—a subsidiary of GardaWorld—donated $5,000 (US) to a DeSantis PAC in 2018. (In an email, a GardaWorld spokesperson wrote that the company’s “political activities, if any, comply with applicable laws and are disclosed through public reporting channels. Beyond that, we do not comment on specific contributions made by our business units.”)

Yet the firm has courted its own share of controversy. Four GardaWorld staff were killed in Iraq after they were kidnapped in 2007; the company reportedly never confirmed if it attempted to pay a ransom. A GardaWorld spokesperson wrote they were not authorized to comment on the incident, but that the description “does not accurately reflect what transpired.” The spokesperson added that “this tragedy continues to pain all of the team, and our sympathies remain firmly with the families and colleagues of those team members.”

In 2012, two GardaWorld staff in Afghanistan, where the company provided security work for the US government, were found with stockpiles of unlicensed assault rifles. (In an email, a GardaWorld spokesperson stated that the weapons “were being taken to be tested at a firing range before being purchased and properly licensed by GardaWorld,” and that it had complied with all Afghan laws and regulations in its operations in the country.)

Two years later, Afghan officials detained GardaWorld’s country manager and accused him of holding unlicensed rifles and radios. (In an email, a GardaWorld spokesperson described the incident as “the result of an administrative misunderstanding” which was resolved, and added that GardaWorld “continued to operate in the country, uninterrupted.”) In 2020, a former GardaWorld employee sued the company, accusing it in part of falsifying the training records of staff heading to Afghanistan. Some of the accusations were dismissed, while others were allowed to go forward. The company denied the allegations in court, and it settled the case with the former employee in 2024.

In 2023, the city of Denver opted not to contract GardaWorld, operating as Aegis Defense Services LLC, to run its migrant centres after the non-profit American Friends Service Committee released a report linking the company to unsafe conditions at other detention facilities where it was contracted. (In an email, a GardaWorld spokesperson wrote that the report “mischaracterizes GardaWorld Federal’s activities” and that it “incorrectly attributes activities or vendor roles to GardaWorld.”)

Those facilities include a centre in Fort Bliss, Texas, where the report noted that GardaWorld was contracted with the federal government to provide services to migrants who had crossed the border as unaccompanied minors. In 2022, an internal report from the US Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General detailed poor living conditions and administration of services at the facility. (GardaWorld Federal is not mentioned in the government report. In an email, a GardaWorld spokesperson wrote that GardaWorld Federal’s “primary role at the facility was to provide medical care for unaccompanied children waiting to be reunited with their families.”)

In a separate investigation, the Tampa Bay Times found that GardaWorld’s armoured truck business often used drivers with insufficient training and failed to maintain their trucks, putting them at risk for accidents. GardaWorld has disputed these findings, and a spokesperson wrote in an email that the claims against the company “have long been dismissed without any finding against GardaWorld Cash.”

GardaWorld’s revenue amounted to around $4 billion in 2021. In 2022, the Quebec government invested $300 million into GardaWorld through Investissement Québec, purchasing preferred shares at market conditions. “Anyone who owns a $300 million chunk of any company [this size] has significant influence in the operations of that company,” says Yap. The office of Christine Fréchette, Quebec’s minister of economy, innovation, and energy, has not responded to interview requests.

Québec solidaire’s Andrés Fontecilla, member of the National Assembly of Quebec for Laurier-Dorion, has been critical of the provincial government’s handling of this issue. “We denounce the fact that government money is being used to finance, even indirectly, concentration camps for migrants whose only crime is being illegal immigrants,” Fontecilla wrote in a statement over email.

The MNA explained that the Quebec government–granted financial assistance takes the form of preferred shares, a financial tool halfway between equity and a loan. The government will adjust the interest rate paid by GardaWorld based on the number of jobs created. Fontecilla points out that since the 2022 loan from the government is tied to subsidies for increasing jobs, it could be possible that Alligator Alcatraz contracts count toward those job increases, in which case government money is entangled in the detention centre. (In an email, a GardaWorld spokesperson wrote that the GardaWorld Federal “would not be the recipient of any funding from Canada-based government entities attributed to GardaWorld.”)

“Quebec should absolutely hold GardaWorld accountable for the investments it makes in various projects,” wrote Fontecilla. “Even if the government says that Quebec’s portion of funding did not go toward investments in Alligator Alcatraz, it remains a significant amount, and it’s not clear that the government actually has figures to demonstrate that no Quebec taxpayer money was used for this purpose.”

Amidst growing reporting on both companies’ involvement with Alligator Alcatraz, Ettinger believes the Canadian government has kept silent on this issue because making a statement condemning it could antagonize Trump and unsettle ongoing trade negotiations.

This would not be the first ethically messy entanglement between a federal Liberal government and a private corporation accused of wrongdoing. In 2019, a division of the Montreal-based engineering conglomerate SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. was alleged to have paid $47.7 million to Saadi Gaddafi, son of former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, for help in securing Libyan construction contracts. Ethics commissioner Mario Dion found four significant troubling attempts by then prime minister Justin Trudeau and his staff to influence attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to issue a deferred prosecution agreement, which would have allowed the company to dodge criminal charges. Wilson-Raybould and another cabinet member, Jane Philpott, resigned in protest, and the Public Prosecution Service of Canada ultimately found that SNC-Lavalin should stand trial.

“We don’t have these laws; we have these massive gaps in our regulation.”

Karen Hamilton, director of Above Ground—a group advocating for Canadian corporate accountability—is concerned about how the volatile US–Canada relations may be shaping the current federal government’s handling of corporate human rights concerns abroad.

“It’s a specific moment, there’s a threat to Canadian identity, there are concerns around tariffs, and that’s taking the immediate attention of the new government,” said Hamilton.

When reached for comment, John Babcock, a media relations spokesperson at Global Affairs Canada, wrote: “The Government of Canada expects Canadian companies operating abroad to abide by all relevant laws, to respect human rights in their operations, and to adopt best practices and internationally respected guidelines on responsible business conduct.” He noted that a new five-year strategy for Responsible Business Conduct abroad was launched in 2022. The strategy includes a focus on due diligence and accountability and applies to all Canadian companies active abroad, regardless of size, sector, or scope. These guidelines are, however, voluntary.

France passed legislation in 2017 requiring its multinational companies to guard against human rights abuses irrespective of whether they are operating on French soil or abroad. In June 2024, South Korea proposed its own such law. And the EU has been negotiating a similar legislative framework. Reflecting on GardaWorld, Hamilton noted, “We don’t have these laws; we have these massive gaps in our regulation.”

As of mid-November, the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit’s ruling remains in place. The appellant court has halted Judge Williams’s verdict, siding with the federal and state governments’ petition asking to pause the lower court ruling to shut down the facility. In a 2–1 decision, the appellant court found that Alligator Alcatraz could not be considered to be a project of the federal government because Florida built and operates the facility with state money. And, as it is not a federal initiative, the demand for a mandatory environmental assessment study did not apply. Such assessments are obligatory under the National Environmental Policy Act for all federal projects.

“Florida will undoubtedly be harmed if it cannot ‘apply its own laws’ to respond to an immigration crisis and serve the public interest,” the majority appeals court ruling stated. Both judges who were in favour of the government—Judge Barbara Lagoa and Judge Elizabeth L. Branch—were nominated by Trump. Dissenting Judge Adalberto Jordan was nominated by former president Barack Obama. Judge Lagoa is married to lawyer Paul Huck of Florida firm Lawson Huck Gonzalez. According to WUSF, an NPR affiliate in Tampa Bay, the law firm has ties to the DeSantis administration and has secured over $10 million (US) in state contracts since its founding in 2023. The firm has no ties to Alligator Alcatraz.

The original appeal against Miami’s Federal District Court ruling will now go ahead, with the case being heard by a fresh slate of appellate judges. And this further ruling will determine whether to reinstate Judge Williams’s injunction to shut down Alligator Alcatraz or overrule the closure decision altogether. On October 10, the Department of Justice requested the appeal proceedings be paused, citing the federal government shutdown at the time.

Despite the uncertainty around the Everglades complex, the DeSantis government has opened a second immigration detention facility—currently given the moniker “Deportation Depot”—at a state prison west of Jacksonville. And plans are being discussed to open a third centre in the Florida Panhandle.

Five months into operations, both IRG Global Emergency Management and GardaWorld Federal continue to fulfill their contracts with Alligator Alcatraz. And according to the Globe and Mail, the US offshoot of GardaWorld has been shortlisted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), along with thirty-nine additional companies, to compete for further detention centre contracts.

“It’s always been very difficult and painful, but it’s never been this bad,” says Mich P. González, a lawyer at Sanctuary of the South. SOS is a group providing legal services to migrants and fostering sanctuary spaces, and it’s being represented by the ACLU, ACLU of Florida, and Americans for Immigrant Justice in a lawsuit against members of the Trump administration, De Santis, and other state officials over “the government’s attempts to prevent people detained in civil immigration custody at Alligator Alcatraz from communicating with legal counsel and from filing motions with the immigration court that could result in their release from detention.” (One count in the complaint was dismissed in August.) Based out of New Orleans, González is representing several clients being held at Alligator Alcatraz.

One of them, Michael Borrego Fernandez, is a lead plaintiff in SOS’s lawsuit. A Cuban national, he was arrested on June 10 for a parole violation and outstanding traffic violations. He was transferred to the detention centre on July 5, and he alleges that, while there, he had to have an emergency surgery due to excessive bleeding and did not have access to essential post-surgery medications.

His mother, Yaneisy Fernandez Silva, says she had no direct communication from immigration officials or staff at Alligator Alcatraz. Her son had access to a monitored phone. González attempted to visit Borrego Fernandez on July 30 but was turned away at the facility and told no visit would be possible until August 4. On August 1, Borrego Fernandez was transferred to another detention centre—the Krome facility in Miami—where González was able to see him in person without an appointment the following morning.

“It is not a place for human habitation, it’s a concentration camp.”

González describes a concerted effort to make Alligator Alcatraz’s operations clandestine. He notes that, while it is standard practice to have a hard time contacting authorities at migrant detention centres, Alligator Alcatraz has been exceptionally untransparent and difficult.

“There’s no clear source of authority over their custody that you can ask for help,” says González. “It took us forever just to get a good contact to request a legal virtual call. And there are no in-person legal visits—that is unheard of.”

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, has continually argued that it is not running Alligator Alcatraz. In early October, however, the Federal Emergency Management Agency reimbursed the state of Florida $608 million (US) for its spending on Alligator Alcatraz and other immigration detention centres now operating within Florida. In the Court of Appeals ruling, the majority sided with Homeland Security and the other defendants, stating that even with such federal funding assistance, Alligator Alcatraz should not be considered to be federally managed.

Adding to an already murky chain of authority, under the 287(g) program—referring to section 287(g)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act—ICE can authorize state and local law enforcement to perform immigration officer duties. In this case, the state of Florida is detaining undocumented migrants at the centre. The majority of detainees held at Alligator Alcatraz do not appear on ICE’s public database, making it difficult to verify who is there at any given time. Immigrants held at such centres are also being transported via chartered flights run by private contractors to other detention facilities away from their families and legal representatives, often with little to no notice. At least twenty people have died this year while in ICE custody, including forty-nine-year-old Canadian Johnny Noviello, who died at a Miami detention facility in June. (ICE did not respond when contacted for this piece.)

For Fernandez Silva, fifty-one, the only thing that matters in the bureaucratic and moral mess of Alligator Alcatraz is her son. She says Borrego Fernandez was deported to Mexico in September, and she does not know why he was sent there. Asked what she would want Canadians to know about Alligator Alcatraz, she says, “It is not a place for human habitation, it’s a concentration camp. They should see for themselves the conditions of this concentration camp, and the total inhumanity of the people who are running it.”",https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Ladly_AlligatorAlcatraz_1800.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 11:57:54.965416

(KRON) — In North Hayward, messages on Cherryland Elementary School windows read, “Be kind,” and their marquee reads, “Be responsible, be respectful, and be safe.”

But on Friday, the community didn’t feel safe.

“Schools are just tender places that when families begin to lose trust and faith in their school to protect kids, that’s a problem,” said Hayward Mayor Mark Salinas.

Immigration legal advocates say ICE agents walked onto campus in the middle of the school day, asking administrators for information about a former student.

Advocates say the school immediately turned them away.

Monique Berlanga, the Executive Director of Centro Legal de la Raza, calls this unacceptable.

“I think it’s wildly inappropriate,” Berlanga said.

She says ICE agents even went door-to-door in the neighborhood, knocking and asking residents for information.

“Created a real chilling impact in our community, we had folks calling their hotline all day because they were afraid to pick up their children because they didn’t know what to do,” Berlanga said.

Salinas says city leaders still don’t know exactly what ICE agents were looking for on Friday.

“We’re the third largest city in the county, we are home to Latino immigrants,” Salinas said.

Municipal and local governments have no control over ICE. Immigration enforcement is a federal power.

However, Hayward is a sanctuary city.

This means Hayward has city ordinances in place to educate the community about immigration rights and connect them with agencies that can support them if they are detained.

“Hayward police, their mission first and foremost is to protect the city of Hayward. If it is an immigration warrant, the city of Hayward will not support and participate in providing aid to that,” Salinas said.

Mayor Salinas says county agencies and local officials, including himself, meet monthly to review ICE activity.

He says their most recent update showed Hayward and Oakland are the two cities seeing the most ice activity in the area.

“I hope that any time federal agents come to Hayward, they notify the police department because professionally,” Salinas said. “I think it’s the most appropriate thing to do, so there is no confusion out on the street.”

Ms. McLaughlin said 70% of the illegal immigrants ICE has arrested have had criminal convictions or pending charges and that the administration is on pace for 600,000 deportations this year.","ICE is shattering records for immigration enforcement, setting new high-water marks for arrests, deportations and detention.

The agency reported holding more than 65,000 migrants as of Nov. 15, a record by far. It had fewer than 60,000 in late September, just before the government shutdown, and fewer than 40,000 in January when President Biden turned over power to President Trump.

Fueling the rise is a surge in arrests. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement averaged nearly 1,200 arrests daily since Oct. 1, a record pace.

ICE is deporting illegal immigrants at an even higher rate, more than 1,250 daily.

If that held for 12 months, it would exceed 450,000 for the entire year, surpassing the record set in 2012.

The number is still shy of the 1 million mark the administration has set.

“They need to ramp it up,” said Rosemary Jenks, policy director at the Immigration Accountability Project. “There’s a big population that should be easier to remove, and we need to get to those and remove them. Americans are willing to support mass deportation, but it has to be mass deportation.”

The numbers were released as part of a periodic update of ICE detention data. Releases were suspended during the government shutdown, so this was the first data for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.

From Oct. 1 to Nov. 15, the date the data was current, ICE reported that its personnel recorded 54,735 book-ins, which serves as a yardstick for overall arrests. Customs and Border Protection reported another 7,066 book-ins.

During the Biden administration, those numbers were reversed. CBP book-ins were dramatically higher than those of ICE.

The border chaos left ICE scrambling to deal with the migrants picked up by the Border Patrol and unable to focus on its arrests in the interior.

The vast majority of ICE activities were pickups of migrants from prisons and jails. Nearly 95% of ICE arrestees in detention in 2024 had either criminal convictions or pending charges.

That number has now dipped below 60%, fueling complaints that ICE is not focusing on the “criminal aliens” who Mr. Trump said were his priority.

Ms. Jenks said she wasn’t bothered by the decreased criminal ratio.

“I couldn’t care less how many of them have committed extra crimes. We need to deport all of them,” she said.

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said ICE has funding to hold up to 100,000 migrants on any given day under Mr. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. She said the funding helps deportations.

“With innovative partnerships like Alligator Alcatraz, Speedway Slammer, Louisiana Lockup, and Cornhusker Clink, we’ve significantly expanded detention space. Despite a rapid number of injunctions, DHS is working rapidly to remove these aliens from detention centers to their final destination — home,” she said.

She also provided numbers that appear to differ from ICE’s published data.

Ms. McLaughlin said 70% of the illegal immigrants ICE has arrested have had criminal convictions or pending charges and that the administration is on pace for 600,000 deportations this year.

That 600,000 figure appears to include CBP border ousters, which are not part of ICE’s formal removal numbers.

It’s also still shy of the 1 million deportation mark.

When asked about that target, Homeland Security Department officials have cited “self-deportations” as a means of meeting that goal.

Ms. McLaughlin said the government estimates that 1.6 million illegal immigrants have returned to their home countries without formal removal.

Officials have been cagey about the source for that figure. Ms. Jenks said she is not sold without hard data.

“We need those numbers. If they’re not releasing them, then the assumption, logically, is they’re not good enough,” she said.

She said a major selling point of Mr. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act this summer was an infusion of tens of billions of dollars to ICE to carry out mass deportations.

“We need to see a million removals a year,” she said. “I get they have to ramp up to that. I have been defending them on giving them a minute to ramp it up. But they have to ramp it up.”

The deportation push has fierce critics among immigrant rights groups and has sparked a strident resistance in some communities, where arrests are labeled “kidnappings.”

Still, polling shows the public largely backs deportations.

A Harvard CAPS-Harris survey this month found that 54% of respondents supported the deportations of “all immigrants who are here illegally.” When asked specifically about those who “have committed crimes,” 79% of respondents supported deportation.",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/01/25/US-Immigration-Border_84213_c0-21-2000-1187_s1200x700.jpg?47b7c4f496188daa612ed15b1d86d9c404eb0b17,N,,2025-11-24 06:56:51.158189

Organizers began planning the chaperone program last year and saw “decent turnout” at training sessions, Toppins said.
But after union members “dispersed over the summer,” turnout has been waning, he added.
In addition to the chaperone program, union members have also begun working with the Deportation Defense Network, Lehrer said.
Along with the Defense Network, union organizers have hosted a series of “regular organizing meetings,” where attendees are trained “how to do outreach” and “how to spot ICE,” Lehrer said.","In response to recent federal immigration enforcement across Rhode Island, student labor organizers are joining local activists in efforts aimed at protecting community members from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions across the state, and more specifically, on College Hill.

The RIFT-AFT Local 6516 — which represents unionized student workers and postdocs at Brown — plans to launch a “walking chaperone” program that trains student volunteers to “escort noncitizens as needed between campus locations and nearby sites,” the union wrote in a Nov. 10 Instagram post.

According to Victoria Antonetti GS, the vice president of Local 6516, the organization’s chaperone program was “inspired by the work of the Deportation Defense Line” — a hotline run by members of the Deportation Defense Network of R.I.

The network is composed of several local organizations, including Alliance to Mobilize Our Resistance, the Olneyville Neighborhood Association and the Party for Socialism and Liberation R.I.

Union leaders intend for the chaperone program to “fight against” ICE activity within the Brown community, said Maya Lehrer MAT’23, an organizer with the Deportation Defense Network.

EJ Toppin GS, the Graduate Labor Organization’s chair for social justice and accountability, told The Herald the organization plans to resume chaperone volunteer training sessions early next semester. “We are trying to get the word out,” he said.

Provided they recruit enough volunteers, the union plans to operate the chaperone program on weekdays from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., he said.

Local 6516 Chair of Communications Adit Sabnis GS said that the organization “can’t prevent ICE from coming here,” but still hopes to make graduate student employees “less scared to go about their daily lives.” A large share of graduate workers, he noted, are not U.S. citizens.

Organizers began planning the chaperone program last year and saw “decent turnout” at training sessions, Toppins said. But after union members “dispersed over the summer,” turnout has been waning, he added.

In addition to the chaperone program, union members have also begun working with the Deportation Defense Network, Lehrer said. The network’s volunteer staff operate a handful of “neighborhood groups” across the Greater Providence area which patrol outside courthouses, The Herald previously reported.

The network’s courthouse outreach initiative came as a response to growing federal immigration enforcement operations near Rhode Island courts, Lehrer said. Volunteers with the initiative patrol near Providence courthouses, keeping an eye out for ICE presence.

The initiative “is designed to alert people” to possible ICE presence and to provide the number for the Defense Hotline to “people who are going into or out of the courts,” she explained.

Along with the Defense Network, union organizers have hosted a series of “regular organizing meetings,” where attendees are trained “how to do outreach” and “how to spot ICE,” Lehrer said. She estimated that over the course of the semester, 200 people have participated in training sessions across Providence.

On Nov. 20, ICE activity was identified by volunteers near the Rhode Island Superior Courthouse on College Hill.

“We had volunteers on the ground warning people coming in and out” of the courthouse, as well as “people on bikes and cars patrolling,” Yosan Alemu GS, a GLO steward, wrote in a message to The Herald.

Alemu added that ICE vehicles were parked near the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Library, spurring a demonstration outside the Superior Court.

Around 100 people showed up at intersection of N. Mendenhall Rd. and Summer Ave. to voice their concerns about ICE in the city.

“Stay strong, we see them, we’re with them,” explained organizer Jose Salazar. “They’re not alone and we’re here with them.”

The protestors say ICE is tearing up immigrant families all over Memphis. They claim ICE is going into churches and neighborhoods making arrests.

While ICE can be seen in the city, the Memphis Safe Task Force stopped publicly announcing its ICE arrests, so it’s hard to tell how active they are.

The task force is releasing how many warrants have been cleared, how many missing children they’ve found, and their total arrests. They’ve stopped publicly releasing how many total ICE arrests have been made weeks ago.

On Nov.12th, the Memphis Safe Task Force announced they were responsible for 2,500 arrests, but didn’t specify how many were ICE arrests.

Protesters say regardless of how many ice arrests there have been in Memphis, one is too many.

Salazar explained why the protesters felt the need to come and voice their opinions.

“So that the immigrant community can say that they’re not alone and send all of these federal agencies that we’re not going to stay quiet and that we’re not going to take this any longer,” he said.

They say all immigrants are being targeted but tell WREG the Hispanic community has been hit the hardest.

Memphian Ashley Delgado, came out to show her support, saying since the Memphis Safe Task Force has been around the city hasn’t been the same.

“They walk around with big guns, that’s not necessary for people that aren’t criminals right, that affects your mental health, you know people are scared,” Delgado said. “Our city is like a ghost town now.”

While it is unclear how long ICE will be in Memphis, Salazar hopes local politicians focus on the city’s immigrant community and sees their importance to the local economy.

“The labor that they do when it comes to the money that they spend, I feel like if the economy’s are already bad and you’re coming after the immigrants, you’re pretty much kicking down the businesses,” he said.

WREG has reached to ICE for an updated number of the task force’s immigration-related arrests in Memphis and are still waiting to hear back.",https://wreg.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2025/11/ICE-Protest-1.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-24 04:56:21.988595

Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, like the George Bushes, professed to want to enforce immigration laws.
Political parties that campaign for restrictions on immigration are treated as pariahs with which established parties must never allow in coalition governments.
But her 30-year-old deputy, Jordan Bartella, appears more popular than other parties’ leaders.
Excluding people with different cultures and attitudes from your country is not the moral equivalent of murdering all your Jews.","Whence cometh the conviction, in America and even more in Britain and Europe, that open borders is the only moral immigration policy? Of course, not everyone believes that, and many who do stop short of saying so. But, the contrast between the rhetoric and policies of the first two decades of the century and those that have prevailed since President Donald Trump’s election is unmistakable.

Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, like the George Bushes, professed to want to enforce immigration laws. They decried the flood of illegals that crested in the prosperous decade before the financial crisis, and afterward saw with relief that the flow of illegals slowed.

As I wrote recently, careful projections of the illegal population estimate that it peaked at about 12 million in 2007, fell to about 10.5 million in 2019, then increased by about 4 million during the Biden administration, which essentially opened the borders to the point of paying for illegals to live in New York’s Roosevelt Hotel, two short blocks from where Jamie Dimon’s JPMorganChase was constructing its $3 billion office tower.

The impetus for this policy came from something other than the usual elite economic argument that, as population growth is slowing, advanced countries need more workers to maintain economic growth. That something else can be summarized in the phrase “Orange Man Bad.” If Trump wants to stop people at the border, then we shouldn’t stop anyone there.

There is another element here, seen more prominently in Europe. And that is the conviction that barring people from your country who are different, in ancestry or customs, from the preexisting population is invidious discrimination.

Immigrants to the United States over the past half-century have come mostly from Latin America and Asia from countries that to varying degrees share religious orientations, market economic norms, and cultures of literacy and numeracy with most Americans.

It’s likely true that a flood of mostly illegal immigrants, like those welcomed by the Biden administration, will tend to have a higher proportion of violent migrants than among legal immigrants. And a higher proportion of arrivals with adversarial attitudes toward American mores, traditions and government.

But that is a problem orders of magnitude greater in Britain and Europe, where very much larger shares of immigrants, from Africa, the Middle East and South Asia, are Muslims. Many are quite ready to assimilate to European mores. But many — especially the floods welcome by former German Chancellor Angela Merkel starting in 2015 — are not. They want to impose their religion and their culture on the host society, and elite leaders of such nations have been willing to let them do so.

An example is the scandal of Britain’s “grooming gangs,” often long-settled immigrants from Pakistan and Afghanistan, who sexually abuse and enslave adolescent working-class English girls. For at least two decades, this oppression has been largely ignored by Britain’s political parties, local and national police forces, national press, and certainly by the TV-set-owner subsidized BBC.

This oppression of women and violation of human rights is virtually unknown to American liberals, as the liberal talk show host Bill Maher has pointed out with appropriate indignation. Nor are they aware, despite mention of the practice, that Britain has been arresting thousands of citizens for social media posts that are thought to hurt immigrants’ feelings.

European elites, in government and the press, have suppressed news of immigrant violence, even when directed at women and gays. Both center-right and center-left governments have professed themselves unable to reduce the flow of immigrants with cultural attitudes adversarial to European norms. They profess they must obey rulings by international courts and agencies whose personnel are immune to democratic checks.

Political parties that campaign for restrictions on immigration are treated as pariahs with which established parties must never allow in coalition governments. This includes Britain’s Reform party, which currently has huge poll leads, and France’s Rassemblement National, whose leader, Marine Le Pen, was blocked from running by a dubious court decision. But her 30-year-old deputy, Jordan Bartella, appears more popular than other parties’ leaders.

Germany’s AfD, which is currently tied in the polls, is treated with particular scorn by the two main parties, which, between them, capture less than 50% in polls. Within AfD’s ranks are some with nostalgia for Germany’s Nazi past, and the nation’s leading parties deserve respect for their longstanding commitment to renouncing Nazism and making reparations for the Holocaust.

But it’s not apparent that AfD’s policy of restricting the inflow of immigrants, or those of Eastern European democracies like Poland and Hungary, which are decried by unelected European Union leaders, is the moral equivalent of Nazism. Excluding people with different cultures and attitudes from your country is not the moral equivalent of murdering all your Jews.

Those leaders who treat the two as morally equivalent are captive to bad ideas. They have been taught to divide the world into oppressors and the oppressed, to cast immigrants as virtuous victims and their own citizens as culpable oppressors. They have been instructed to see colonialism not as a limited chapter in history but as its dominant theme, and to treat its harms as a kind of second Holocaust.

From these delusions, most ordinary Americans, including recent legal immigrants and their offspring, and large numbers of ordinary Britons and Europeans, seem happily immune. Perhaps in time, their common sense will dissuade the elites of their “luxury belief” in open borders.",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.thealpenanews.com/images/2016/11/15143024/fblike.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 02:57:41.894768

If we want our children to receive quality health care and be respected and cared for, then state and local governments need to step up to the plate.
It’s going to be easy to forget about local governments with the coming onslaught of articles about the Senate and House races in 2026.","Many Americans are — to massively understate — upset with Congress. The U.S. government went through the longest shutdown in American history for little gain, as the provisions in the shutdown deal are largely identical to what was proposed prior. The final bill also only funds the government until January, meaning we may very well get to go through all of this again. Deadlock in the legislative branch is certainly not new, but in the age of Trump, it’s made the experience all the more frustrating. Trump managed to halve the staff of the Department of Education and impose the totality of his tariff regime without Congressional approval. Our government is meant to be a collaborative act between multiple institutions representing the American people, but more and more it feels like a one-man show. Yet, there are thousands of government entities with the power to stand up to the executive when Congress sits down: state and local governments.

The cooperation of local governments is vital for the successful implementation of many federal laws and programs, and even more so for the current administration. As the Trump administration rapidly expands and contracts government agencies, policy implementation has relied on local government support. Take, as an example, the relationship between ICE and the country’s sheriffs. ICE has a major issue with its crackdown on immigrants: There isn’t enough space to detain them. The existing detention centers aren’t big enough to hold the record number of immigrants being detained. Instead, ICE has contracted with sheriff departments across the country to keep detainees in county jails. Some detainees are only in jail for a short period of time before being transferred to dedicated detention facilities, while others are held for longer. Most jails, however, aren’t equipped to meet the needs of those under ICE detention. Conditions vary widely. Facilities are often overcrowded, unsanitary and inhumane. Immigrants have recounted being denied mattresses, bedding, spoons or cups.

Not all sheriffs, though, are complying with the administration’s mass deportation campaign. In Indiana, Attorney General Todd Rokita has sued our very own St. Joseph County sheriff Bill Redman for alleged failure to cooperate federal immigration officials. Redman has characterized the lawsuit as an attempt to deputize law enforcement to enforce federal immigration laws. Redman’s refusal to cooperate more than what the law requires may seem minuscule compared to the scale of mass deportations, but his actions have made undocumented immigrants in South Bend safer and put a hole in ICE’s network of sheriffs and county jails.

ICE is just a part of the Trump fallout facing localities. Our disemboweled federal bureaucracy will not be able to deliver the same quality of service with the skeleton crew that remains after the Trump purges. The Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights — which investigates schools violating the rights of students — has closed 7 of its 12 regional offices. The Medicaid cuts mandated in the One Big Beautiful Bill will kick 7.5 million people off Medicaid and risks health coverage for one out of every five children enrolled in the program. If we want our children to receive quality health care and be respected and cared for, then state and local governments need to step up to the plate.

It’s going to be easy to forget about local governments with the coming onslaught of articles about the Senate and House races in 2026. Keep your eye on the ball. The success or failure of Trump’s project depends not just on Congress, but on sheriffs, treasurers and city councils across the country.

It was also great to be able to touch on fundamentals of trust in news, and discuss how places like advocacy marketer Public Narrative, the neutered Chicago Independent Media Alliance and Northwestern's non-journalism-accredited Medill School cause the same type of harm to trust in journalism and the news industry as manipulative rightward sources, dancing through a profitable masquerade of fraudulently presenting advocacy as journalism.

On Nov. 21, Bucks County Sheriff Fred Harran confirmed that he “never fully implemented” the 287g program after a Bucks County Common Pleas Court judge ruled in his favor Oct. 15.

Harran said that he was waiting until after Judge Jeffrey Trauger’s ruling before moving forward with writing the 287g guidance. Nearly three weeks later Harran was defeated in the election Nov. 4 by Democratic newcomer Danny Ceisler, who promised to formally end the agreement.

While Harran and 16 sheriff officers were formally certified as ICE officers months ago, after his reelection loss Harran said he “stopped everything” involving 287g, citing Ceisler’s intention to end the program.

The sheriff’s office never received the necessary equipment to implement the program, which authorizes local and state law enforcement officers limited ICE authority, though Harran said employees of the federal agency provided his office with access to their warrant and detainer database.

Harran described the scope of work his office had with ICE as “very, very limited,” involving assistance to federal agents in September. Deputies twice notified ICE after picking up undocumented individuals on county criminal warrants who also had active detainers, Harran said.

Also in September, Harran said he authorized deputies to assist ICE agents in removing individuals ICE detained from the courthouse.

Harran added that neither he nor the sheriff’s office were involved in two July incidents where ICE agents detained allegedly undocumented individuals who had appeared inside the Bucks County Justice Center while appearing for scheduled criminal hearings.

Throughout his reelection campaign Harran defended partnering with ICE through the 287g program. He called it a crime-fighting tool that wouldn't cost taxpayers anything and target only undocumented immigrants who were incarcerated at the county jail or wanted on bench warrants.

Harran repeatedly promised that he didn't intend to exercise the full authority granted him, and that he had no intention of checking immigration status of witnesses or crime victims, or people at Domestic Relations Court. He said he and his deputies wouldn't be stopping individuals in the community.

Opponents of the program weren't convinced.

They organized two community rallies attracting more than 100 participants and filled one of the largest courtroom at the Justice Center on the first of two days of testimony in the ACLU-Community Justice Project lawsuit seeking to nullify the agreement.

These critics argued that 287g opened the door to racial profiling, put taxpayers at risk for lawsuits, discouraged immigrants from reporting crime, and eroded trust between the immigrant communities and law enforcement.

They also noted that Harran retained the authority for deputies to question any person believed to be undocumented and arrest them if determined to be a removable alien.

Temporary Protected Status allows people from countries in turmoil because of a civil war, natural disaster or other crisis to live and work in the United States.
Protected status was first granted to Somalis in 1991, when the country was torn apart by civil war and its national government collapsed.
Though there are an estimated 42,500 foreign-born Somalis living in Minnesota, only a small number of them are covered by the Temporary Protected Status program.
Tim Walz, a Democrat, said on social media that Mr. Trump had chosen to “broadly target an entire community.""","President Trump intends to strip hundreds of Somalis living in the United States of the protected status they have had for decades under a program for immigrants from countries in crisis.

Mr. Trump specifically targeted “Somalis in Minnesota” in a social media post on Friday, writing that he was terminating their eligibility for the Temporary Protected Status program. More Somalis live in Minnesota than in any other state.

Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said in Minneapolis on Sunday that her office would evaluate whether to end protection for Somalis under the program. Doing so would require giving 60 days’ notice. Ms. Noem suggested that, if the status was revoked, the change would apply to Somali immigrants across the country, and not just in Minnesota.

Temporary Protected Status allows people from countries in turmoil because of a civil war, natural disaster or other crisis to live and work in the United States. Technically, the status is temporary, and meant to last about 18 months unless it is renewed — but it has often been renewed, and for several groups including the Somalis, it had become all but permanent.

Protected status was first granted to Somalis in 1991, when the country was torn apart by civil war and its national government collapsed. The designation has been extended many times since, including under the prior Trump administration. The most recent renewal was to last until mid-March.

Though there are an estimated 42,500 foreign-born Somalis living in Minnesota, only a small number of them are covered by the Temporary Protected Status program.

As of March, there were 705 Somalis in the whole United States who were covered by the status, according to the Congressional Research Service. Counting people from other covered countries as well, Minnesota has about 8,460 people with the protected status.

On his social media platform, Truth Social, Mr. Trump wrote on Friday that “Somali gangs are terrorizing the people” of Minnesota, and said that the state was a “hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.” Several Somali immigrants in Minnesota have been convicted in fraud schemes in recent years, including embezzlement of government funds from food-aid programs for hungry children.

Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, said on social media that Mr. Trump had chosen to “broadly target an entire community."" Mr. Walz suggested that the president’s move was an attempt to distract attention from other issues in the administration.

Somalia is home to about 18 million people and is part of the Horn of Africa on the continent’s eastern side. The country has been racked by problems including violence, drought and poverty for decades. Recently, American aid groups have had to limit their work in the country because Mr. Trump dismantled the Agency for International Development.

About 73 percent of Somali immigrants in the United States are naturalized U.S. citizens, according to the Census Bureau.

Mr. Trump has moved to end T.P.S. protection for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from other countries, including Venezuela, Honduras, Afghanistan and, earlier this month, South Sudan.

Under President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Homeland Security Department allowed Somalis who had arrived in the United States in recent years to apply for the protection. The agency estimated last year that as many as 4,300 people could become eligible under that policy.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/23/multimedia/23NAT-SOMALI-TPS-vtjq/23NAT-SOMALI-TPS-vtjq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 17:56:56.442951

Cornwallis occupied Charlotte after facing stronger-than-expected resistance and suffered constant attrition from a guerrilla campaign by the outnumbered revolutionaries.","“The operation is not over and it is not ending anytime soon.”

The message from the Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin went out to Charlotte, North Carolina, on Thursday afternoon, in response to an announcement by Sheriff Garry McFadden that Customs and Border Protection (CBP) was done with its immigration enforcement sweep.

Earlier that day, a CBP spokesperson sent a different note from McLaughlin: “Every day, DHS enforces the laws of the nation across the country. We do not discuss future or potential operations.”

The two statements contradict each other. The sheriff’s statement contradicts the federal government’s statement. But the facts on the ground were easy enough to see.

A network of observers – including the sheriff’s office itself – had been tracking the movement of CBP and Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) agents since they arrived in the Charlotte area just over a week ago. Watchers had reported a convoy of federal vehicles moving south on I-85 toward Atlanta before the sheriff’s message went out.

“They want you to feel fear, panic, terror, to not know where the danger is,” said Andrew Willis Garcés, a senior strategist with Siembra NC, a grassroots advocacy group for immigrants and Latino communities in the state.

The reaction to immigration enforcement surges varies with the character of the communities. Los Angeles raged against the machine. Portland staged street theater. Washington DC jurors refused to convict people charged with crimes of resistance.

Charlotte has engaged in a bless-their-hearts approach to the surge befitting a city full of bankers who want results while minimizing risks. “Bless your heart” sounds nice, often said in complete sincerity, but widely understood by southerners to be a quiet way to tell someone they’re an idiot when offered in the right context.

People outside of Charlotte’s political power structure have led the resistance in a grassroots movement that left little for Donald Trump to latch on to for formal reprisal. Activists focused on intensifying the discomfort of the agents while mobilizing a wide-ranging early-warning system for their targets that spanned from Tryon Street downtown to the mountain towns of western North Carolina.

Thousands of volunteers had been trained to observe and report on ICE activity in North Carolina even before the announcement of enhanced enforcement, Garcés said. Volunteers shifted focus to neighborhood patrols when CBP arrived, he added.

“How do we get people to work and school safely,” Garcés said. That had been a consistent problem even before the surge. “Every day, basically of the year, there has been early-morning traffic stops, ICE arrests that were where people were going to school or work.”

Activists patrolled neighborhoods where CBP and ICE had been seen operating, following vehicles and at times honking horns in warning. Border patrol agents arrested two women who had been honking horns in a truck behind their own, smashing a window to get at them.

Others documenting CBP and ICE presence at hotels in the region, tracking license plates and car types, going as far as searching Walmart back parking lots looking for early-morning staging areas in the towns surrounding Charlotte and in the Appalachian mountains.

Between the work of groups such as Indivisible and Siembra NC, they’ve been able to discern clear patterns in how immigration enforcement operates. Agents would target work vehicles early in the morning, for example, said Garcés. “It’s actually not out of totally out of our control to know where are these guys hunting people down,” he said. “We can know that and we can also be much more in communication about what we see and where we see.”

When CBP left Charlotte, Siembra NC published video evidence of a 47-vehicle convoy on its way to Atlanta.

In contrast, the city and county government response to the enforcement surge has been muted, with anodyne statements of support for immigrants, and instructions to its entities to minimize cooperation with the federal immigration enforcement surge. McFadden won election on a pledge of noncooperation with ICE.

The cautiousness reflects the political reality in North Carolina, with a near 50-50 split between Republicans and Democrats and a Republican supermajority in the state legislature.

“North Carolina is not Illinois,” Garcés said. “We all know it’s not the same political train, it’s not the same playbook about how to defend against these particular kinds of federal attacks. But overall, I think there is too much instinctual cautiousness. There’s a little bit of an overcautiousness in terms of what we won’t even explore … You don’t have to use the same talking points and don’t have to have the same policies, but what if the question is just: what can we do?”

North Carolina’s Criminal Illegal Alien Act took effect on 1 October, passing over the veto of the Democratic governor, Josh Stein, in the Republican-dominated legislature. The law requires sheriffs to contact ICE if someone subject to ICE detention in their custody is charged with a felony, and to hold that person for up to 48 hours if ICE asks for detention.

“We will continue to follow the law as it relates to [the Criminal Illegal Alien Act] and release those in our custody to ICE within the 48-hour time period,” McFadden said in a statement.

Speaking to Jesse Watters on Fox News on Wednesday night, the CBP chief agent, Gregory Bovino, described resistance to his agency’s efforts as cultlike. “I was talking with my team today, and we came to the conclusion that this is a cult,” he said. ‘This is cult behavior. These individuals oftentimes don’t even know why they are protesting ICE and border patrol in their communities.”

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg police department confirmed the sheriff’s statement about CBP leaving at about around noon on Thursday, citing unspecified “reliable information”. Local leaders including Charlotte’s mayor relied on reports from the sheriff and police to assure people that agents had departed.

“I’m relieved for our community and the residents, businesses, and all those who were targeted and impacted by this intrusion,” the mayor, Vi Lyles, said in a statement. “As we move forward, it is essential that we come together – not as separate groups divided by recent events, but as one Charlotte community. Our strength has always come from our ability to support one another, especially in challenging times. I am calling on all members of our community to join in this effort.”

CBP had evidently lied to the public about their activities. Local observers said they had expected “Operation Charlotte’s Web” to continue until December, adding the disruption of holiday plans to the general chaos created by the deployment of hundreds of agents across the region. The withdrawal looked like a hasty retreat.

The city of Charlotte has long adopted the hornet as its symbol. It stems from revolutionary America and the militia’s fight against Charles Cornwallis and British troops. Cornwallis occupied Charlotte after facing stronger-than-expected resistance and suffered constant attrition from a guerrilla campaign by the outnumbered revolutionaries. Sixteen days in, he quit the place in humiliation. He was heard to say as he left: “Let’s get out of here; this place is a damned hornet’s nest.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62368af9dc3fa2803bd0f41f31265ac75fe70763/0_0_4552_3643/master/4552.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6cb9e63334d545bcddcc3174e25f2b2a",N,,2025-11-23 20:57:41.536536

We, the Leadership Team of the Congregation of the Sisters of St Joseph of Peace, reaffirm our 2016 Congregation Statement, 'Welcome Immigrants and Refugees'.

Our Congregation, ""had its origin in the founder's response to the social concerns and needs of the time."" (Constitution 4) At our founding, we were a congregation of immigrants, serving immigrants, knowing their pain and suffering. Throughout our history, we have stood in solidarity with recent arrivals to our countries, helping them find safe and stable housing, providing job and skills training, and offering pastoral care in the face of undignified treatment.

With the changes of government that have taken place in both the US and the UK, we have witnessed not only increasingly alarming rhetoric against asylum seekers, immigrants, and refugees, but also the disturbing violent action that is playing out in the streets and in public policy. We continue to urge our governments to follow international law and protocols guaranteeing the rights of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers.

We join Pope Leo XIV and our brother Bishops in denouncing the inhumane and unjust treatment of our immigrant brothers and sisters. We call for an end to harmful rhetoric meant to instill fear and create division. In an era where we see mass deportation and the erosion of due process, we recall the words of Pope John Paul II who named arbitrary imprisonment and deportation as intrinsically evil acts ""offensive to human dignity."" (Veritatis Splendor, 80).

On November 12, 2025, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops released a special pastoral message regarding immigration. We share the concerns expressed by the bishops regarding the climate of fear and anxiety created by harsh immigration enforcement, increased profiling, inhumane conditions in detention centres, arbitrary revocation of immigration status, and indiscriminate mass deportation.

We also welcome the message that Bishop Paul McAleenan, Lead Bishop for Migrants and Refugees of the Catholic Church, England and Wales, offered for the annual World Day of Migrants and Refugees. ""Hostility and prejudice towards migrants and refugees, whatever its source - whether it is spoken or indicated in another way - must not make us lose hope or harden our hearts. It is our obligation to try and understand why migrants appear among us; our duty is to care for those who seek refuge in our country.""

We are troubled by the UK government's proposal to reverse many of the protections guaranteed to people who seek asylum. In a country whose residents are raising alarm because of increasing inequity, immigrants and asylum seekers should not be made the scapegoats and receive unjust treatment as a result.

We urge the bishops, as models and teachers of the Catholic faith, to use their authority, standing, and connections to act on behalf of migrants. The teaching of Jesus Christ demands that we act on behalf of our suffering neighbour. We encourage the bishops to join religious congregations, Catholic welcome centres, legal clinics and individuals in the advocating for human rights and concrete actions on behalf of migrants that bring the light of Catholic Social Teaching to this moral moment.

""The Church,"" writes Pope Leo in 'Dilexi Te', ""like a mother, accompanies those who are walking. Where the world sees threats, she sees children; where walls are built, she builds bridges. She knows that her proclamation of the Gospel is credible only when it is translated into gestures of closeness and welcome. And she knows that in every rejected migrant, it is Christ himself who knocks at the door of the community (73).""

Asylum numbers have dropped across Europe, making it hard to say exactly how much of it owes to Danish policy.","Britain’s government is joining the rest of Europe in taking a stricter stance on asylum, turning to the nation that has become something of a migration role model: Denmark.

Right-wing parties across Europe have sought for years to limit migration, often arguing that too many migrants could overwhelm public services and fracture social cohesion. Denmark stands out, though, because here it was a center-left government that doubled down on strict rules. Asylum flows have steadily fallen, and the Danish Social Democrats have retained national power.

But as Keir Starmer’s Labour government in London takes notes, unveiling a plan last week that openly borrows elements of Denmark’s policy, the way the Danish approach has worked on the ground offers reasons to proceed carefully. The political gains that the approach seemed to offer now show some signs of cracking, and policies meant to limit the entry of asylum seekers may come at a social cost.

Lars Lokke Rasmussen, the moderate politician who was prime minister when Denmark adopted many of its strictest policies, said immigration policy was about both limiting big flows of potential refugees and welcoming needed foreigners.

“They should just recall that we need this balanced approach,” said Mr. Rasmussen, who is now the Danish foreign minister. “It’s not black and white. It’s a colorful world, and it comes with a lot of nuances.”

‘Unwelcoming Country’

Over the years, but especially since the Syrian refugee crisis of 2015 sent a flood of newcomers into Europe, the Danish government has enacted policies to make life challenging for asylum seekers, trying to discourage them from coming.

Danish officials say the nation wants to slow the flow of new asylum seekers so it can adjudicate their cases carefully, and thoroughly integrate the people whom it does accept, even as it still takes a large number of documented migrants. The point, they say, is to avoid pressures that rapid migration has put on other societies, including homelessness, while maintaining public support in a society with high taxes and generous welfare policies.

Copenhagen pioneered a number of policies that Britain hopes to emulate. Some were largely symbolic, like threatening to confiscate the jewelry and valuables of would-be refugees to pay for their expenses. It also has made the process to gain permanent residence longer and subject to review. And it houses would-be refugees in conditions that it hopes discourages them from remaining.

That’s the case at Avnstrup return center, a former sanitarium filled with sparse, dormitory-like rooms in the countryside about an hour outside of Copenhagen. The Danish government sends some asylum seekers there, including people who are waiting on decisions and others who have been rejected but who cannot be returned to their home countries.

Ayfer Tepe, 52 and from Turkey, has lived in limbo at the Avnstrup center since 2019, when Denmark first rejected her asylum application. She has no money and no permission to work, and must check in twice a day. She compares it to life in an open-air jail.

Still, she has no intention of leaving. She said she fears the police in Turkey, where her ex-husband, a left-wing political activist, ran into trouble with the law and where the authorities repeatedly visited her house. And her 15-year-old son has largely grown up in Denmark, so she worries he would no longer fit in back in her home country.

“Where would I go?” she said from a worn couch in the center’s cafe, where residents and volunteers had gathered for coffee and cake on a clammy November afternoon.

Some human rights experts argue that even as governments make asylum processes more difficult, people in danger will still seek refuge, but they will be caught in worse conditions.

It is a “race to the bottom,” said Michala Clante Bendixen, who runs the refugee advisory group Refugees Welcome Denmark, which creates a “constant atmosphere of stress and insecurity.”

And migration researchers say the policies could have a long-run social cost, making even legal migrants and their descendants feel unwanted in Danish society.

“We’ve really branded ourselves as a more unwelcoming country,” said Thomas Gammeltoft-Hansen, a professor of migration law at the University of Copenhagen.

‘Open and Closed at the Same Time’

Denmark is not alone in restricting asylum. The Biden administration progressively tightened American rules over its time in office and in some cases went further, turning away potential asylum seekers at the U.S.-Mexico border. And countries across Europe are becoming steadily stricter about who enters and stays.

But Denmark’s tough stance on asylum came early. Its policies began to tighten notably after 2015 and continued after 2019, when Mette Frederiksen, the prime minister, came into office. At the time, the policies made her Social Democrats an outlier on the left.

Mr. Rasmussen, the prime minister who oversaw the early shift toward a stricter approach, pointed out that Denmark still welcomes many legal migrants. But, he added, with its high taxes and generous welfare state, it also needed to limit asylum flows.

“If we can’t solve that dilemma, being open and closed at the same time, then we will lose our people’s support,” he said.

The Danish approach seemed to work. Denmark has not experienced some of the acute migration-related strains of nearby nations like Germany, Sweden and Belgium. In 2015, about 21,000 people sought asylum in Denmark, with the largest numbers coming from Syria and Eritrea. That figure fell to just over 2,000 last year, based on Eurostat data.

Asylum numbers have dropped across Europe, making it hard to say exactly how much of it owes to Danish policy. Still, today Denmark ranks toward the bottom of the pack in applications among the European Union’s 27 nations.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/24/multimedia/24denmark-migration-01-cjtv/24denmark-migration-01-cjtv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 15:57:56.224345

In a hard-hitting statement released this week, the State Department said that countries in the West were enduring terror attacks and sexual assault as a result of mass migration – and listed the rape of thousands of girls by “grooming gangs of migrant men” as an example of concern.

“Mass migration is a human rights concern. Western nations have endured crime waves, terror attacks, sexual assaults, and the displacement of communities,” the statement said.

And the State Department said it would be working to encourage governments to “defend citizens” against the threats it perceived are being posed by mass migration.

“U.S. officials will urge governments to take bold action and defend citizens against the threats posed by mass migration,” the State Department announced.

It said that State Department officials “will also report policies that punish citizens who object to continued mass migration and document crimes and human rights abuses committed by people of a migration background.”

It said that “these issues have plagued citizens of Western nations for years” before listing examples including a high-profile Swedish sentencing – the rape of girls in the UK by gangs of men mostly of Pakistani heritage.

“In the United Kingdom, thousands of girls have been victimized in Rotherham, Oxford, and Newcastle by grooming gangs involving migrant men,” the State Department said. “Many girls were left to suffer unspeakable abuse for years before authorities stepped in.”

“In Sweden, an Eritrean migrant convicted of raping a 16-year-old girl was allowed to remain in the country after a judge ruled that the incident was not an “exceptionally serious crime” and did not warrant deportation,” the statement continued.

“In Germany, nine men – several of whom were migrants – were convicted for the gang rape of a 15-year-old girl. A German woman who insulted one of the rapists online was given a harsher sentence than the perpetrators themselves.”

The Department said that U.S. officials “will now scrutinize policies in Western nations that give leniency to migrant crime and human rights abuses or that create two-tiered systems that prioritize migrants at the expense of their own citizens”.

“The United States supports the sovereignty of our allies and calls on governments to constructively engage with the growing numbers of citizens concerned about mass migration.”

“The United States stands ready to assist our allies in solving the global crisis of mass migration,” the statement concluded.

Last month, Minister for Justice, Jim O’Callaghan, said that there is no link between asylum centres and crime levels in communities in Ireland. His predecessor, Helen McEntee, said last year that there is a false perception in Irish society that crime is on the rise because of increased levels of migration in this country.

Earlier this year, in a landmark speech at the Munich Security conference attended by leading politicians and policymakers, U.S. Vice-President JD Vance has lashed out at suppression of free speech and freedom of association in Europe – pointing towards censorship of political parties, of Christians, and of peaceful pro-life prayer activists.

Vance raised, as examples of threats to free speech coming from within, the annulment of a recent election in Romania, the conviction of a Christian activist in Sweden, and the prosecution of a man for praying for his aborted son at an abortion clinic in Britain.

“The threat that I worry the most about vis à vis Europe is not Russia, it’s not China, it’s not any other external actor. And what I worry about is the threat from within. The retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America,” he said in a blistering speech.",https://gript.ie/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/asylum-shutterstock_2438065389.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 14:57:01.051701

But we did so knowing we need to stay vigilant, because the threats to democracy aren’t stopping any time soon.
Trump’s biggest loss came Tuesday, with a federal court ruling blocking Texas’ extreme gerrymander.
Then on Friday night, Jen reported that Texas had urged the U.S. Supreme Court to put the ruling on hold.
Finally, we’ve been tracking another outrageous GOP effort to suppress democracy that frankly deserves to be a national story.","This was a week when President Donald Trump’s authoritarian power grab — from his bid to rig the 2026 midterms to his corrupt, revenge-driven prosecutions — suffered some major setbacks.

At Democracy Docket, we definitely enjoyed covering Trump’s reversals. But we did so knowing we need to stay vigilant, because the threats to democracy aren’t stopping any time soon.

Trump’s biggest loss came Tuesday, with a federal court ruling blocking Texas’ extreme gerrymander. The state undertook the redraw, you’ll remember, after pressure from the president.

At Democracy Docket, we covered the ruling from every angle. Jen Rice was among the first to report the news. Not long after, Yunior Rivas had zeroed in on a key part of the story: A letter sent by the U.S. Justice Department, which was intended to give Texas a less partisan rationale for its redistricting — it said there were constitutional concerns about the use of race in Texas’ existing map — but which the court cited as evidence that the redraw had been driven by race, which is illegal. In other words, a major self-own by the Trump administration.

But the court battle over Texas’ map isn’t over. Yunior followed up that night with a detailed explanation of what comes next. And when one judge issued his frankly unhinged dissent the following day — attacking not just his fellow judges but George Soros, as well — Yunior was on top of that, too. Then on Friday night, Jen reported that Texas had urged the U.S. Supreme Court to put the ruling on hold.

With five congressional seats on the line, it’s hard to have much confidence that the high court’s conservative, GOP-appointed majority will let this pro-democracy, pro-minority ruling stay in place. But whatever happens, we’ll continue covering every step in this fight.

Trump’s political prosecutions of his perceived enemies also didn’t fare well this week. As Democracy Docket’s Jacob Knutson explained in a deep dive Saturday, the efforts to go after former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) “are so flawed that they might not even make it to trial.” Both defendants have argued in court that the acting U.S. attorney in the case, former Trump personal lawyer Lindsey Halligan, was improperly appointed, meaning she lacked the authority to bring the charges. And, as Jacob reported earlier this week, the judge in the Comey case pointed to “profound investigative missteps” made by Halligan, which may rise to the level of misconduct.

Still, Jacob warned, there are signs that new indictments against others that Trump wants to get back at may be on the horizon.

“Justice is definitely coming,” one top Trump ally involved with the effort announced in a recent podcast appearance. “So, lawyer up, motherf*****s.”

But we didn’t just cover the news, we also broke some. After we exclusively reported last month on a top federal election official who unleashed a wild rant about non-citizen voters, Democracy Docket’s Jim Saksa followed up by scooping that a group of Democratic senators is calling on her to recant her comments or resign.

Meanwhile, Democracy Docket’s Matt Cohen had a scoop of his own — getting his hands on notes from a conference held by anti-voting activists, at which Cleta Mitchell, a close Trump ally, set a goal of going back to one-day elections. That would mean no more early or mail voting — and vastly restricted access to the ballot.

Finally, we’ve been tracking another outrageous GOP effort to suppress democracy that frankly deserves to be a national story.

Back in September, Missouri passed its own Trump-driven gerrymander — but pro-democracy activists are fighting back, organizing a campaign to get a measure on the ballot that would give voters a chance to reject the new map. In response, Republicans are doing everything they can — and I mean everything — to prevent the referendum process from working as it was intended to.

On Monday, Jen reported on deceptive text message sent by the Republican National Committee — in case you doubted this was a national priority for the GOP — that falsely claimed signatures for the ballot measure had been “improperly collected” and urged Missourians to “withdraw your signature before it’s too late.”

Republicans also have tried to sabotage the measure by writing blatantly biased ballot language to describe it to voters. On Friday, as Yunior explained, the measure’s organizers filed a lawsuit challenging the language written by the secretary of state, which falsely claims that the GOP gerrymander “better reflects statewide voting patterns.”

Yunior also brought you news of the craziest GOP move, which came later that day: The state’s attorney general posted on X alleging that signature gatherers are “reportedly employing illegal aliens,” — her office offered no support for the charge — and adding: “We have referred this matter to ICE.”

Amid concerns that the Trump administration will try to use federal law enforcement to harass and intimidate voters, Missouri is test-driving that very tactic to suppress direct democracy — another form of political participation that threatens Republican power.

Most of the national press corps seems to have shrugged its shoulders. But we think this story is pretty revealing about one side’s disdain for ordinary citizens. We’re going to keep following it closely.",https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ap25205765794710-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 21:56:39.047668

""I think we're looking at particular types of payment and so on like that,"" Mr Martin said.","Taoiseach Micheál Martin has confirmed that certain types of welfare payments, paid to people seeking Irish citizenship, will be taken into consideration as part of the application process.

The Government is due to consider proposals from Minister for Justice Jim O'Callaghan that will reform Ireland's migration policy.

The Government is going to progress changes to the asylum system here this week.

Attending the G20 summit in South Africa, the Taoiseach indicated that those seeking citizenship could be prevented from doing do if they received certain welfare payments over a specific period.

The changes going to Cabinet will also tighten the rules around family reunification applications - plus there will be a focus on any debt owing to the State.

While those granted refugee status may have to wait five rather than the current three years before applying for full citizenship.

Sinn Féin and Aontú both expressed concern that the Government's plans are not adequately responding to the impending changes to the British asylum system.

Britain is set to overhaul its approach to human rights' laws to make it easier to deport migrants who arrive illegally, in a major shake-up of asylum policy.

The full extent of the changes to the migration laws will be outlined in legislation due to be published before the end of the year but Mr O'Callaghan is set to give an update on the measures after the Cabinet meeting concludes on Wednesday.

""I think this is a modest enough overhaul, but an important one,"" Mr Martin said.

""We've always taken a humanitarian approach, but I think there is necessary tightening up that is required in terms of both the asylum process and in terms of the citizenship process in Ireland.

""That's in essence, what is envisaged by these reforms,"" he said.

Mr Martin said the reforms had come before the party leaders and also before the Cabinet sub-committee.

The Taoiseach was asked about reports that refugees will not be allowed to become Irish citizens if they have received welfare payments within a certain period of time.

He was specifically asked if that would mean a female refugee should avoid getting pregnant if she wants to obtain Irish citizenship.

""So we've discussed these in relative detail and I think we will work through these as the legislation comes in, but that wouldn't be on the agenda,"" he said.

""I think we're looking at particular types of payment and so on like that,"" Mr Martin said.

The Taoiseach was also asked what he hoped the new reforms would achieve.

""I think a sense that Ireland is not an outlier in terms of benefits,"" he said.

""We see what's happening in the United Kingdom, even though we were looking at these reforms before the UK's latest reforms, there are knock-on effects, consequences from what others do. That's the reality.

""We have to be realistic about it, and we have to be firm about it, and also we have to accelerate because it's taken too long historically for people to have their asylum applications processed and concluded,"" Mr Martin said.

""We've now made a lot of progress on the first phase of that, the appeal stage is being staffed up, and Minister [Jim] O'Callaghan has particular plans to enhance the resources there so that we get a faster timeline in terms of appeals as well, so that people aren't waiting for prolonged periods of time,"" he added.",https://www.rte.ie/images/002385a0-1600.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 12:57:32.410461

That ended last week when eight senators — seven Democrats and one independent — voted with 52 Republicans to restart federal operations.

What some on the left have condemned as a capitulation was instead an acknowledgment of the pain inflicted by the shutdown. It ends the uncertainty for millions of Americans who struggled to make ends meet as Congress dithered.

The defectors' gambit may not be successful — chances are high that it will fail — but the shutdown illuminated the targeted cruelty of the Trump administration. The two parties' starkly different views of governance couldn't be clearer.

In mid-September, the Republican-led U.S. House passed what House Speaker Mike Johnson imprecisely termed a ""clean"" continuing resolution and promptly adjourned the chamber, forcing the Senate to accept or reject federal funding on their terms.

The Senate rejected that bill and a competing bill from House Democrats, with neither measure reaching the 60-vote threshold to overcome a filibuster. The inability to reach agreement — and a refusal by Republicans to negotiate a bill that could earn Democratic votes — set the stage for the longest shutdown in U.S. history.

Though Republicans control the House, Senate and White House, they framed Democrats as responsible for the impasse, falsely claiming that the minority party shut down the government to provide health care benefits to illegal immigrants. The Trump administration went so far as to (illegally) put that partisan lie atop the websites of all executive agencies.

Democrats argued that the expiration of tax credits associated with the Affordable Care Act necessitated a legislative fight. The expansion of those benefits during the pandemic provided essential coverage for millions; its elimination would leave that population without affordable access to care.

That was a minor but important point in the larger opposition to Trump administration actions and the disastrous effects of the Republican spending bill passed during the summer.

The so-called ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" Act will drive up health care prices and slash funding for social safety nets such as Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security and food assistance which help vulnerable, elderly and needy families — all to extend lucrative tax benefits that accrue to the richest Americans.

Democrats were right to be wary of negotiating with President Donald Trump's White House. The administration faces numerous lawsuits for firing federal workers, withholding federal funds appropriated by Congress and generally acting as if the executive branch, rather than the legislative, is empowered by the U.S. Constitution to make spending decisions.

The longer the shutdown dragged on, the more Trump and his administration squeezed. They accelerated federal layoffs, which have been challenged in the courts. They (again, illegally) used private funds and money from other sources to meet the military payroll. And they appealed to the Supreme Court in a bid to ensure that hungry Americans were denied their monthly SNAP benefits.

Ultimately, Democrats buckled. While that ensures funding flows again to federal workers, service members and needy families, the shutdown made clear what each party values and the lengths each is willing to go in service to those ends.

Americans, even those who backed the Democrats' approach, should be relieved that Washington is open again. And they should remember how this played out — especially when they flock to the polls next year.",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/img/2025/11/25/103858998_AP25317127455615_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-11-23 12:57:24.020510

The NZ picture: steady support despite noise overseas In New Zealand, DEI remains firmly on the HR agenda.
Public-sector agencies continue to publish DEI strategies, and obligations under the Human Rights Act and Employment Relations Act hold steady.","A major change in how the United States defines human-rights breaches is drawing international attention and could prompt organisations in New Zealand to think carefully about how they position their diversity and inclusion work.

The US State Department has instructed its diplomats to treat certain DEI policies, affirmative-action measures, state-funded abortion services and even some forms of migration and online safety laws as potential human-rights violations. Officials say the new approach tackles “new destructive ideologies”, although critics argue it’s an attempt to recast long-agreed human-rights principles to suit domestic US politics.

A senior official described the new rules as “a tool to change the behaviour of governments,” while deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott warned that the administration would not allow what it sees as violations “to go unchecked”, adding, “Enough is enough.”

What this means for NZ workplaces

For HR leaders in Aotearoa, the US shift does not alter New Zealand’s own employment law or DEI expectations. But it does highlight how sharply different countries are now approaching inclusion—something global employers will need to navigate with care.

New Zealand’s direction is unmistakably different from Washington’s. The Public Service Commission’s 2024–25 DEI plan centres on building a workforce that reflects and serves the country’s diverse communities. NZTA’s 2025–28 roadmap ties inclusive leadership directly to organisational performance. And tools like the Aotearoa Inclusivity Matrix, widely used by HRNZ and Diversity Works NZ, provide a local framework for what good DEI practice looks like.

Because many New Zealand organisations operate internationally, these contrasting signals matter. The concern is not about legal exposure, but about how DEI work is understood and communicated across different markets, particularly if US stakeholders are involved.

The NZ picture: steady support despite noise overseas

In New Zealand, DEI remains firmly on the HR agenda. The 2024 New Zealand Workplace Diversity Survey shows strong focus on ethnic representation, gender equality and rainbow inclusion, alongside ongoing work to address pay gaps. Public-sector agencies continue to publish DEI strategies, and obligations under the Human Rights Act and Employment Relations Act hold steady.

What HR teams should focus on now

Be clear about the “why”

In a more contested global landscape, it’s important to explain the purpose of DEI—improving performance, culture and fairness—rather than relying solely on acronyms or assumptions.

Stay aware of global shifts

If your organisation has US investors, clients or operations, consider whether your DEI messaging is framed in a way that travels well.

Anchor everything locally

New Zealand has its own cultural foundations, legal requirements and expectations—especially relating to Te Tiriti o Waitangi—that should guide DEI efforts.

A moment for clarity, not retreat

While the US is taking a far more combative stance, New Zealand organisations still operate in a context where inclusion is tied to performance, culture and fairness—not ideology. For HR leaders, the task now is to keep DEI grounded in local values, communicate it clearly and ensure it reflects the people and communities of New Zealand.",https://cdn-res.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0311_638995122457260197.png,N,,2025-11-23 11:57:51.175667

But for many of us it was a welcome reminder that the old Christianity has not yet been stamped out entirely.","Trumpism’s most revealing and defining moments – not its most important, nor cruelest, nor most dangerous, nor stupidest, but perhaps its most illuminating – came earlier this autumn. In the course of a few weeks, the US president started showing everyone his plans for a gilded ballroom twice the size of the White House and then began unilaterally ripping down the East Wing to build it. Then, after nationwide protests against his rule, he posted on social media an AI video of himself wearing a crown and piloting a fighter jet labeled “King Trump”, which proceeded to bomb American cities and Americans with a graphically vivid load of human poop.

He has done things 10,000 times as bad – the current estimate of deaths from his cuts to USAID is 600,000 and rising, and this week a study predicted his fossil fuel policies would kill another 1.3 million. But nothing as definitional. No other president would have dared – really, no other president would have imagined – unilaterally destroying large sections of the White House in order to erect a Versailles-style party room, with the active collaboration of some of the richest Americans, almost all of whom have business with the government. And no one – not Richard Nixon, not Andrew Jackson, not Warren Harding, not anyone – would have imagined boasting about defecating on the American citizenry. Even the worst American leaders were willing to maintain the notion that they represented all the people; Trump has managed to turn America’s idea of itself entirely upside down. And he has done it with the active consent of an entire political party. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, when asked about the poop video, for once did not bother lying that he had not seen it. Instead he said: “The president uses social media to make the point. You can argue he’s probably the most effective person who’s ever used social media.”

As disorienting as it is to watch the president try to upend the old idea of democracy and replace it with its polar opposite, there is one large group of Americans who should not find it completely novel. That is those of us – in older age cohorts a near majority – who were raised as mainline Protestant Christians.

We have watched over the years as rightwing evangelical churches turned the Jesus we grew up with into exactly the opposite of who we understood him to be. At its most basic, they turned a figure of love into a figure of hate who blesses precisely the cruelties that he condemned in the Gospel; we went from “the meek shall inherit the Earth” to “the meek shall die of cholera.” This has happened more slowly, over decades instead of months, but it is nonetheless unsettling in the same ways, a disorienting gut punch for many of us.

What particularly hurts is the fact that at no point did we manage to fight back, not effectively anyway. Without intending to, we surrendered control of the idea of Jesus. It is a story that may provide some insights into how to fight the attack on democracy.

Many readers, younger ones especially, will require some backstory. In 1958, President Dwight Eisenhower laid the cornerstone for the building that would house the National Council of Churches on the Upper West Side of Manhattan – on that day, according to a history of Protestantism by Mark Silk, a cool 52% of Americans were part of the so-called mainline denominations: Methodists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Episcopalians and the like. That meant most of the nation subscribed at least nominally to a religious life marked by a kind of polite civic normality and a somewhat progressive reading of the Bible – every one of these denominations eventually backed the civil rights movement, and Dr Martin Luther King’s March on Washington was literally planned from the Methodist national headquarters, the closest private building to the Capitol. (Catholicism accounted for another third of Americans, an important piece of the story I will get to eventually.)

In the 60 years since, all that has changed; the mainline denominations are now barely a sixth of population, our churches largely aged and declining. Now the most public and powerful forms of Christianity, the vast and often denominationally independent megachurches and TV ministries, are as wildly different from that version of Protestantism as Donald Trump is from Eisenhower.

Paula White-Cain, for instance, who leads the newly created “White House Faith Office”, held a livestreamed prayer service the day after the 2020 election to call on “angelic reinforcement” from Africa and South America to swing the election away from Joe Biden. Doug Wilson, the self-taught pastor who co-founded Pete Hegseth’s denomination has insisted that it was a mistake to let women vote. (He also teaches that sex “cannot be made into an egalitarian pleasuring party”, because “a man penetrates, conquers, colonizes, plants. A woman receives, surrenders, accepts.”)

Christianity, it must be said, has always trafficked in angels and had some serious trouble with the role of women. The actually distinctive things about this newly ascendant version of Christianity is that it meshes easily with the savage cruelty of the new political order, one whose tenets and tempers are directly contradictory to that older version I grew up in. They share the same forms, in that all pay homage to Jesus and quote from the Bible, just as the president still inhabits the same White House (or what is left of it). But the Jesus of this imagination – muscular, aggressive and American – is a different man than the one I grew up worshipping. The idea that he can be invoked to justify cutting off aid to foreign countries and bundling immigrants into the back of unmarked vans is repulsive to me, but also mystifying – as if gravity suddenly pulled objects upward.

A toxic Christianity takes hold

So let me first describe the Jesus that I grew up with, because theoretically Jesus is the center of any Christian faith, and because the fastest-growing cadre of Americans might have little sense of him since they are atheists or agnostics or nones. I have no problem with any of these traditions, nor with any other faith (of my three particular political heroes, only one – Dr King – is a Christian. Gandhi was Hindu, and his colleague, the too-little-known Abdul Ghaffar Khan – was a Muslim). But I do think that there are pearls of great price in the Christian story (though it should be said that I am no theologian, only a layperson and occasional Sunday school teacher).

It is emphatically not the story of a mighty king arising; instead, a baby is born to homeless parents in a garage, who must quickly flee to a different country to evade secret police. The baby grows up in humble circumstances, a working carpenter; his message is about love for others, especially for the poor – and not a sentimental love, but a concrete one, expressed by feeding and sheltering. Christ’s response to violence is to turn the other cheek – not as an act of passive acceptance, but as a way to educate the attacker; his crime policy is that if someone steals your coat you should give him your sweater too. This person’s message is sufficiently subversive that he is eventually put to death by the reigning imperial power, but that execution is powerless to quell his spirit or his message, which then spreads across a growing community of followers who try to behave as he had.

It is entirely fine to reject the supernatural elements of that story, or to bemoan the fact that it has been repeatedly captured, twisted and exploited by the powerful – but the story itself is one of the unlikely, distinctive and remarkable expressions of human civilization; it has been pressed into service behind any number of bad and violent plans from the Crusades on down, but it has also inspired an unfathomable number of artists, educators, physicians and helpers across the centuries.

In no small measure, it made me who I am. I grew up in the suburbs in the 1960s and 70s when mainline Protestantism retained its strength. I was baptized as a Presbyterian in California; the pastor who previously led my church, Eugene Carson Blake, headed the National Council of Churches, marched with King, and was on the cover of Time in the days when that was ultimate imprimatur. I was confirmed in a Congregational church in Lexington, Massachusetts – the direct descendant of the church where the original Minutemen had worshipped 200 years before. In college, at Harvard, my preacher was a man named Peter Gomes who exemplified the cross-cultural power of that tradition: a Black American with an anglophile’s appreciation for high church solemnity and a Republican by temperament who prayed at Ronald Reagan’s first inaugural, he was nonetheless a profound believer in the liberal tradition in which he came up. And when I left college I ended up for a few years in William Sloane Coffin’s Riverside church in New York, built by John D Rockefeller as more or less the St Peters of American Protestantism where Harry Emerson Fosdick had once preached – a name few recognize today but all would have known at a certain point in our history, for he was the foremost preacher of the first half of the 20th century. Riverside was right next to that building that Eisenhower had dedicated in 1958, the National Council of Churches headquarters sometimes known as “the God Box” – though that institution was already turning into a shell of its former itself, its corridors emptying as the mainline denominations downsized and then downsized again. Sunday morning church was no longer a civic obligation for Americans the way it had been in my youth, and for those who still wanted a Christian life, the evangelicalism we now see in full flower was beginning its rise.

I am less concerned with the shrinkage of the mainline church than with the replacement of its Jesus with this very different one. In some ways the Jesus of my early years was a good fit with the New Deal and then postwar politics – at once concerned with others, and also a figure of peace in a tense bipolar world. Not a pacifist, but an apt figure for an age reacting to Auschwitz, Hiroshima and Montgomery. The new Jesus is none of that. Indeed, according to his acolytes, he rejects all of it, and utterly.

Consider, for instance, one heir to Charlie Kirk’s place at the top of Maga Christianity. Allie Beth Stuckey, grew up in a megachurch; her father, a Texas state legislator, is senior adviser to the Heritage Foundation, the cradle of Project 2025. She is a distillation of the currently dominant American Christianity, and above all, her Jesus rejects empathy. This year, she published a bestselling book describing the concept as toxic and unbiblical; she is enthusiastic in her support for the president, including his immigration policies, which she describes as scriptural. As she told a reporter recently: “We can only look to scripture to see the principles of nations, of governance, of laws, of borders, of security, of God’s provision through walls, the Book of Nehemiah, and say: ‘OK. Can we apply those principles to America today? Do they still have wisdom? Does it make sense why God wanted secure walls for Jerusalem? Does that still apply to America?’”

Basing your support for ICE raids on terrified immigrants on a relatively obscure passage in a relatively obscure Old Testament story is a good example of what is known as prooftexting – the citing of some verse somewhere to support your predetermined beliefs. In this case, a story about Nehemiah rebuilding walls in parts of Jerusalem becomes a reason to ignore the utterly clear and oft-repeated instruction of Jesus to welcome the stranger. Indeed, Jesus tells the parable of the good Samaritan, which quite clearly extends this welcome beyond our nationalities. “Philoxenia” is the Greek term used in the New Testament for this love of strangers – it is the opposite of xenophobia, which is what JD Vance and Trump were practising when they started lying about immigrants dining on cats and dogs. To continue with the gastronomic theme, as a theologian the cherrypicking Stuckey, in her citation of Nehemiah and his walls, is like a restaurant critic who has visited a steakhouse, noted that it has creamed spinach on the menu, and declared confidently that it is a vegetarian eatery. (And as long as we are on the subject, Nehemiah, once done with his wall project, spent a fair amount of time chasing entrepreneurs out of the Temple because they had been using it for their own commercial purposes; tickets for Stuckey’s recent Share the Arrows conference, according to the Wall Street Journal, cost between $99 and $5,000, which bought VIP seating and a private lunch and dinner with Stuckey. Attenders strolled hallways lined with vendors selling everything from Christian-themed clothing and children’s books to Patriot cell service: “America’s Only Christian Conservative Wireless Provider – Defending God-Given Rights & Freedoms”.)

But the Bible at least talks about walls. It has almost nothing to say about the rest of their favorite culture war hobby horses – you can find five scattered references to what might be homosexuality in the Bible, though recent scholarship makes clear they were actually attacks on prostitution and abuse. Jesus himself had exactly nothing to say on the topic – not a sermon, not a parable, not even an offhand nasty joke. He also did not talk about transgender people, even though they have been a feature of every culture any anthropologist has ever studied. In her concession speech after her loss in the Republican Virginia governor’s race, Winsome Earle-Sears declared that she was “a Christian first and a Republican second”. But 57% of the Republican party’s advertising spending in her race had reportedly gone to attacking transgender people, a topic – again – that Jesus ignored. None of that spending went to attacking Elon Musk (a recently self-proclaimed “cultural Christian”), who had managed to kill 600,000 poor people by “feeding USAID into a woodchipper” in the first weekend of his Doge campaign. Musk’s new pay raise means that he could have, if he had pleased, made each of those 600,000 people a millionaire instead, but he did not, which may explain why Jesus thought that it was easier to get a camel through the eye of a needle than a rich man to heaven. If you think I am being hyperbolic here, a “rich young ruler” actually presented himself to Jesus and asked what he should do, and Jesus said he should sell his stuff and give it to the poor. This is what Jesus was about.

The obvious and straightforward fact that the Jesus of the gospels calls for a kind of radical love centered on the poor is what has always made Christianity something of a scandalous religion: appealing to the masses, but because of its inherent radicalness needing to be contained. In the 1950s it was contained by dilution – Protestantism was so dominant that it basically baptized the status quo. The 1960s broke that – the leadership of these churches, who were among the most committed followers of Jesus, found that they had little choice but to march in Selma, literally or figuratively. But many of their followers did not want to; they had been on board because Protestantism was part of the fabric of American life, not a challenge to it. Membership in mainline churches began dropping off. And for many of those who still felt a cultural or personal need for Christianity, evangelicalism was on the rise: it meshed wonderfully with the emerging Reagan-era emphasis on individualism and spoke directly to Americans who rejected the movements of the civil rights era.

The idea that personal salvation – as opposed to concern for others – was at the heart of Christianity always bordered on the heretical, but over the decades it has morphed into the absurd farce we see now, where Jesus is held to bless every show of dominance and aggression we can imagine. There is, by now, a well-established genre of Republican officials posing for Christmas cards with submachine guns; Nashville Republican congressman Andy Ogles passed them out to his entire family for a picture. He was one of the congresspeople who led the charge not only to freeze USAID funding for the poorest people in the world, but to use that money instead for increased deportations from this country. It is as if he had decided to see exactly how un-Christlike it was possible for one human being to be – indeed, he demanded that the local private Christian college Belmont University lose federal funding because it had a hope, unity and belonging department that he thought was too much like “DEI”.

Evangelicals are not unanimous in their support for Trump. For years I have written a column for the progressive evangelical magazine Sojourners, for example, but even its publishers would confess that they are very much a minority. Realistically, white evangelicalism is the base of Trump’s support, and this flock has not broken with him the way many of his other followers have in the past nine months.

For most readers, rightly, none of this inside baseball will matter much. For me, personally, it certainly does: it is as weird to me as a Christian as it to me as an American to see King Trump fantasizing about offloading his bowel movements from a plane on our heads. But the reason I bother to write about it is not personal but strategic. That is because mainline Protestantism made a serious mistake: surrendering its vision of Jesus without much of a fight. It is not entirely gone – there remain thousands of wonderful and vibrant congregations, and leaders like the Rev William Barber who occasionally manage to break through in public. Episcopal bishop Mariann Edgar Budde raised a ruckus this winter when, with Trump in attendance, she prayed for him to show compassion to immigrants; there have been more than a scattering of pastors in the protests outside immigration offices, just as there are in almost every social movement in this country. But these exceptions prove, I fear, the rule of general passivity: in general, the old mainline Christianity never was able to offer a very potent defense against the aggressive and toxic new forms of Christianity.

There were structural reasons for that passivity – five or six declining and theologically similar denominations never really considered uniting into one more powerful one, and there were conservative movements within Methodism or Presbyterianism or most of the others that sapped their strength. And there were intellectual reasons – this older tradition wrongly believed, right back to the days of Jerry Falwell and the Moral Majority, that the new emerging take on Jesus was so transparently bogus that eventually people would snap out of it and return to their former orthodoxy. They were wrong, and that is not an error I would like to see repeated in the struggle for democracy; having lost for now the cross, I am not eager to surrender the flag as well.

A struggle for the best of us

So I have been heartened to see the steadfast resistance to Trump arise in this past year. It has been great solace to help build the movement that has taken to the streets in rally after rally, and seems to have inspired voters to turn out in numbers in the off-year elections earlier this month. (As the founder of Third Act, which organizes progressives over 60, I am especially gratified by the number of older Americans in the streets, many of them the children of the Eisenhower era, and appalled as I am at the foulness of the president). We will need to continue it, and in the same spirit, with American flags at every demonstration and appeals to the best parts of American history.

And indeed, there are signs of this starting to happen. In Texas, a young Democrat named James Talarico has surged into contention in the state’s Senate race largely on the strength of his forthright declaration of the kind of retro Christianity I have been describing. A part-time seminary student (Presbyterian, one of those mainline denominations that used to dominate America’s spiritual landscape), he said in a sermon two years ago: “Jesus came to transform the world. Christian nationalism is here to maintain the status quo. They have coopted the Son of God. They have turned this humble rabbi into a gun-toting, gay-bashing, science-denying, money-loving, fear mongering fascist. And, it is incumbent upon all Christians to confront it, and denounce it.” (Talarico is doing well enough that he recently came under attack for the sin of following several OnlyFans models on Instagram; his campaign has said that he “follows back and engages with supporters who have large followings and does not investigate their backgrounds”. Given that the president’s record with, say, Stormy Daniels, it is one more example of evangelical absurdity).

Talarico is still an outsider. But Pope Leo is not, and in his first months he has begun at least to suggest that the Roman Catholic church may not watch from the sidelines as this era plays out. Catholicism has been a largely conservative force in American politics in recent years, institutionally obsessed with the abortion debate above all things. Globally, however, things are a little different. If you had suggested a generation ago that the Roman church might become one of the planet’s more progressive large institutions, I would have giggled. But Pope Francis made clear that abortion was not the only issue that counted, insisting that the church focus on the poor. His remarkable encyclical, Laudato Si’, usually described as “about global warming”, was actually much broader, a scathing critique of modernity and the politics of division and exploitation. He followed up, in the last year of his life, by firmly correcting new convert JD Vance, who argued that Augustine preferred that people centered their compassion on family and neighbors. Francis schooled him on the saint, explaining that “Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups” and urging him to meditate on the parable of the good Samaritan.

I was in Rome earlier this autumn for a session to mark the 10th anniversary of that encyclical, and so got to watch Leo close up for a little while. I was glad to hear him say that he will continue the church’s environmental activism unabated – indeed the Vatican will soon be the world’s first fully solar-powered nation. But I was equally as interested to simply take his measure. He is very much recognizable as a midwest American – if he showed up at your Thanksgiving table as a bachelor uncle in a White Sox cap, you would not find him out of place at all. But his 20 years in Peru and elsewhere around the poor world accomplished two things. One, clearly, was to make him as sensitive as Francis to the plight of the impoverished and vulnerable.

Just as important, Leo – Robert Prevost – was more away than not from America all those decades. So in some ways you see preserved in a kind of amber the attitudes of a man who took his first vows in the 70s, when the kind of ugly Christianity that marks the Trumpers was almost unimaginable. Many American bishops moved hard to the right in the decades that followed, identifying themselves with the Republican party, but Leo seems not to have followed. This month, he explicitly called out American immigration authorities for their brutal treatment of arrested immigrants, particularly the fact that they were being denied communion. “Many people who’ve lived for years and years and years, never causing problems, have been deeply affected by what’s going on right now,” he said. But he went further, saying that when God judged humans: “We’re going to be asked, you know, how did you receive the foreigner? Did you receive him and welcome him or not? And I think that there’s a deep reflection that needs to be made in terms of what’s happening.”

In the eyes of the new Republican Christianity, that reflection would involve the sin of empathy. Better to build some walls. (This week the president’s staunchest defender, Laura Loomer, accused the Catholic church of “work[ing] so hard to try and destroy our country” by “condemning deportations”.) But for many of us it was a welcome reminder that the old Christianity has not yet been stamped out entirely.

I got to give the talk on Lexington Green at the last No Kings day, and it was a chance to quote from the American Gospel according to old Sam Adams:

The liberties of our country, the freedoms of our civil constitution are worth defending at all hazards; it is our duty to defend them against all attacks. We have received them as a fair inheritance from our worthy ancestors. They purchased them for us with toil and danger and expense of treasure and blood. It will bring a mark of everlasting infamy on the present generation – enlightened as it is – if we should suffer them to be wrested from us by violence without a struggle, or to be cheated out of them by the artifices of designing men.

America is best defended, in other words, by reference to the best about American history, just as Christianity is best defended by reference to what makes it distinctive and beautiful, which is the example of Jesus. In neither case does it mean pretending the worst of both America and Christianity did not happen; it means both humility and belief, a combination that serious American Christians should be comfortable with.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de25cfa1856ab299c8cb4c79142d40f30ddb4ffb/0_381_2400_1920/master/2400.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=676bb50c2ca220953521ef406d5fc218",N,,2025-11-23 10:58:27.012230

Some of the claims about “Operation Charlotte’s Web” were misleading.

Other WRAL Top Stories

The Department of Homeland Security on Nov. 15 launched the operation in Charlotte and then expanded its efforts to Raleigh days later. The cities were the latest targets of the federal government’s stepped-up immigration enforcement, a campaign promise and top priority of President Donald Trump.

The operation’s stated goal: to capture immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally and have been previously arrested for criminal offenses. By Friday, Border Patrol reported that it had arrested about 370 people.

The operation is ongoing despite objections from local and state officials in Raleigh and Charlotte who worry about teams of agents disrupting their cities, which they claim are already safe. Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, criticized the operation as targeting everyday people for their skin color — a claim DHS has disputed.

""I call on federal agents to target violent criminals, not neighbors walking down the street, going to church, or putting up Christmas decorations,"" Stein said Tuesday.

Here is a roundup of claims we found to be inaccurate or disputed.

Are North Carolina jails refusing to turn over arrestees to law enforcement ‘right now’?

That’s what Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs for the Department of Homeland Security, said in an interview with Fox News. However, there’s no evidence it’s true.

“There’s about 1,400 criminal illegal aliens that, right now, are in North Carolina and Charlotte’s jails that they refuse to turn over to ICE law enforcement,” McLaughlin said in a video clip the department posted on X on Nov. 17.

It’s possible she misspoke. The department’s Nov. 15 press release about the operation says North Carolina officials ignored nearly 1,400 of the department’s requests — known as “detainers” — to hold immigrants in local jails so that federal immigration officials could pick them up. It’s unclear when those requests were made or if each one refers to a separate inmate. We asked the department about its numbers and McLaughlin’s claim. A department spokesperson said “CBP has no further information to provide.”

North Carolina sheriffs are legally required to notify ICE when they take someone into custody who they suspect is in the country illegally. They must also comply if ICE demands that the inmate be kept in custody for federal agents to pick up. North Carolina Republican lawmakers passed this law last year over the veto of then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, who said it was unconstitutional and also infringed on the rights of sheriffs to run their jails how they see fit.

Do North Carolina cities have sanctuary policies?

The department’s Nov. 15 release said “sanctuary policies” prevented local officials from honoring immigration detainers. That needs clarification.

A decade ago, some North Carolina cities banned their law enforcement agencies from cooperating with federal immigration officials. Then in 2015, former Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican, signed a law banning those types of policies. However, North Carolina sheriffs maintained the legal flexibility to ignore the detainers if they wanted.

Although most of North Carolina’s 100 sheriffs complied with detainer requests, some did not. Sheriffs in Wake and Mecklenburg counties, for instance, said honoring detainers would strain their relationships with people in their communities and potentially create legal issues. Some courts have said ICE detainers, which aren't approved by any judge, violate the Constitution.

The GOP-controlled North Carolina General Assembly last year enacted the law requiring sheriffs to honor the detainers. A spokesperson for the North Carolina Sheriffs Association, which represents the state’s sheriffs and advocates on their behalf, said he believes all sheriffs are currently complying with the law.

The Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office is not blocking immigration officials from any of the 85 people in its jail who are suspected of being in the country illegally, office spokesperson Sarah Mastouri said. The Wake County Sheriff’s Office is also complying with detainer requests, office spokesperson Rosalia Fedora said. Between Nov. 1 and Nov. 19, federal immigration officials took into custody 28 people who were in the Wake County jail, she said.

Does the uptick in ICE raids harm broader public safety?

Democratic state Supreme Court Justice Anita Earls believes so. In a lengthy statement criticizing the raids, she wrote that the large national immigration crackdown “is making the public less safe, in part because it has resulted in abandoning the effort to stop serious crimes. These agents are being pulled off cases investigating sex trafficking, child abuse and terrorism.”

Earls is correct that ICE has taken thousands of federal agents off their work on other cases to help round people up in the raids in cities across the country. But does that make the country less safe? Not everyone agrees.

Trump personally ordered thousands of federal agents reassigned to ICE on his first day in office this year, writing in an executive order that he was doing so because “many of these aliens unlawfully within the United States present significant threats to national security and public safety, committing vile and heinous acts against innocent Americans.”

According to data analysis by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, roughly one-fifth of all FBI agents, as well as half of all DEA agents, have been reassigned to working on immigration raids like the ones in North Carolina due to Trump’s executive order.

Ninety percent of the Department of Homeland Security Investigations staff has been reassigned to ICE, according to Cato. HSI is a unit of ICE but traditionally handles international criminal activity, rather than immigration enforcement. Those 6,198 HSI agents had previously been tasked with handling human trafficking, child exploitation, cybercrime, weapons export controls, intellectual property theft, drugs, and terrorism cases — the same issues Earls raised concerns over.

Trump wrote in his executive order that as long as he’s president, “the primary mission of [HSI] is the enforcement of … federal laws related to the illegal entry and unlawful presence of aliens in the United States.”

Did Charlotte traffic plummet after Border Patrol started its operation?

Some X posts claimed that traffic cleared around Charlotte after Border Patrol launched its operation. The Department of Homeland Security shared a post showing a map of Charlotte with clear roads, adding the caption: “You’re welcome.” And state data shows traffic dipped in some areas.

The state Department of Transportation monitors traffic on the major thoroughfares around Charlotte, such as Interstate 77, Interstate 85, Interstate 485, and U.S. 21. We wanted to compare traffic on Nov. 17 with traffic on Nov. 10 — the Monday after Board Patrol arrived vs. the Monday before agents arrived. The number of vehicles dipped between 1% and 7.9% depending on the road, a DOT spokesperson told us.

In the Raleigh area, Border Patrol agents ramped up their operation Tuesday and Wednesday. Traffic volumes were down 0.5% to 4.8% on Wake County thoroughfares on those days compared to the previous week, DOT said.

Are nearly 15% of Mecklenburg County’s public school students here illegally?

Stephen Miller, President Donald Trump’s deputy White House chief of staff, shared a news report on X that nearly 21,000 of the county’s students missed school on Nov. 17, adding: “So a conservative estimate is that one-seventh of a major southern public school district is here illegally.”

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg School System’s average daily membership is about 140,000 students, according to 2023-24 data collected by the state Department of Public Instruction. The number of students who missed class that day — about 21,000 — does come out to about one-seventh of the district’s student population, or 15%. But that doesn’t mean that the students who were no-shows are in the U.S. illegally.

The DPI data from 2023-24 shows that nearly 8% of Charlotte-Mecklenburg students missed class on any given day.

Students often miss school because they are sick, have an appointment, or are on vacation. It’s also possible some students skipped school because they were afraid immigration agents would target them whether or not they are citizens. It’s difficult to know how many of the district’s students entered the U.S. illegally because the state doesn’t track its students’ citizenship statuses.

Did immigration agents shoot someone in Charlotte?

That’s what a video on social media claimed, showing a man being wheeled away in a stretcher as masked, armed federal agents kept watch on the crowd gathered nearby and filming.

McLaughlin said the social media post was false. The man in the stretcher was being taken into ICE custody, she said, but hadn’t been shot. She said he “had a panic attack and was taken to the hospital, where he attempted to escape by climbing into the ceiling tiles from the hospital bathroom. He was unsuccessful and was apprehended inside the ceiling by law enforcement.”

Is Border Patrol done with North Carolina?

Democratic leaders in Charlotte on Nov. 20 celebrated what they said was the end of the operation. Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles wrote on social media: “It appears that U.S. Border Patrol has ceased its operations in Charlotte. I’m relieved for our community and the residents, businesses, and all those who were targeted and impacted by this intrusion.”

JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson. The Department of Homeland Security is conducting Operation Midway Blitz in honor of Katie Abraham, who tragically lost her life to a drunk-driving criminal illegal alien in the sanctuary state of Illinois.

Of those arrested across Chicago on Nov. 19 alone, violent criminal illegal aliens include:

Angel Gonzalez Di Luca, a 27-year-old criminal illegal alien from Venezuela who’s been convicted of domestic violence with strangulation. He attempted to flee on foot, but ICE officials caught up and arrested him. He illegally entered the country at an unknown date and location, and he was released under the Biden administration’s catch and release polices and never reported to ICE.

Juan Toledo Vasquez, a 54-year-old criminal illegal alien from Mexico who’s been arrested for aggravated criminal sexual abuse against a child and possession of a fraudulent ID card. He’s been removed from the U.S. twice — once in 2000 and once in 2007.

Jose Juarez Soto, a 31-year-old criminal illegal alien from Mexico convicted of domestic battery and criminal recklessness with a deadly weapon. He illegally entered the U.S. on an unknown date at an unknown location, and U.S. Border Patrol gave him a voluntary return to Mexico on March 4, 2010. He illegally reentered the country sometime after that date.

Hector Teja Solis, a 34-year-old criminal alien from Mexico convicted of armed robbery causing bodily injury. He illegally entered the U.S. on an unknown date at an unknown location.

Miguel Angel Portillo Pacheco, a 29-year-old criminal illegal alien from El Salvador who’s been convicted of domestic battery, assault, violating a protective order, armed robbery without a firearm and resisting a peace officer. He claims to have entered the U.S. illegally in 2009, and ICE encountered him in Illinois’ McHenry County Jail after his conviction; he served his sentence before his Nov. 19 ICE arrest.

Domingo Sanchez Hernandez, a 47-year-old criminal illegal alien from Mexico with a final order of removal who’s been convicted of DUI and arrested multiple times for domestic battery. An immigration judge ordered him removed from the U.S. on Aug. 12, 2024.

“These arrests are a drop in the bucket,” said ERO Chicago Field Office Director Sam Olson. “ICE Chicago is out doing targeted enforcement every day to protect people where their local leaders have failed, and we’ve arrested thousands of dangerous criminal aliens. Make no mistake: These are criminals, and if local officials had called ICE before releasing them, they’d be in their home countries rather than victimizing innocent people here in the United States.”

Each of these criminal illegal aliens will remain in ICE custody pending immigration proceedings or removal.

Federal immigration arrests in Colorado surged this summer under the Trump administration’s plans to mass-deport immigrants lacking permanent legal status.","Joanne Belknap bears witness.

She bears witness to the young families arriving at Denver immigration court in their Sunday best — baby girls in headbands, men in collared shirts. She notices the trembling hands accepting informational pamphlets she distributes outside the Byron Rogers Federal Building downtown. Among packed, wooden courthouse benches, Belknap absorbs the testimonies of immigrants seeking asylum in the United States who describe fleeing violence and terror in their home countries by foot, sometimes on their own and sometimes with children in tow, in pursuit of safety.

Although she spends hours at the federal courthouse each week, the 67-year-old retired professor is not a lawyer. She is a volunteer court watcher — a group of regular people who sign up for shifts observing the proceedings at Denver’s immigration court and pass out resources to the immigrants.

Volunteers walk the courthouse perimeter, eyes peeled for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement vehicles or ICE agents. If spotted, they can warn immigrants in the vicinity and alert local immigration advocacy groups to be prepared to respond. They document which federal or state agencies are parked nearby, sharing the information they gather in encrypted text messages. They hand out fliers in English and Spanish with information about how to prepare for immigration proceedings, free legal resources and what to do if detained by ICE.

The Byron Rogers Federal Building’s six immigration courtrooms and those who enter and exit their chambers have imprinted on Belknap’s conscious. Sometimes in heartening moments like flexing her Duolingo-acquired Spanish skills entertaining a small child sitting in the courthouse waiting room for hours. Other times, like the day she witnessed a man “violently” arrested by ICE in front of his young son and partner, it is emotionally taxing.

Still, the longtime activist said it is the most impactful work she has ever done — using the privilege of being a white woman to look out for the vulnerable in her community, she said.

“It’s the best I’ve felt about being white in my entire life,” Belknap said. “I don’t think I’m a wonderful person or such a badass for doing this. It is just a really good outlet to feel like I’m doing something. How do we show up for our neighbors?”

‘It’s very grassroots’

The court watch group was born out of concerns from members of the Colorado Rapid Response Network which responds to and documents ICE activity in the state. In late May, members of the network heard rumors that ICE might show up outside federal immigration court to detain people, so they pulled together volunteers from various immigration, activist and faith-based groups to go to the courthouse and observe.

“It’s very grassroots,” said Kellyn Croy, a 34-year-old stay-at-home mom in Thornton who heard about the group in June from a Reddit post.

Croy was “totally new to activism,” she said. After reading news reports about immigrant families being separated or detained in Colorado, she felt compelled to get involved in the cause.

Federal immigration arrests in Colorado surged this summer under the Trump administration’s plans to mass-deport immigrants lacking permanent legal status.

The agencies detaining immigrants in Colorado have increasingly arrested those without any prior criminal convictions or charges, according to internal data.

“I’m white and a suburban mom, so there is a certain amount of power in that — privilege,” Croy said. “Seeing all of this tears my heart up. If I can use my whiteness to do something, then please sign me up for it. That was my thought process.”

In the beginning, the court watchers would just show up and figure out how to divide themselves to best serve the people there that day. Now that they’ve been going for several months, there’s an official shift sign-up process where people schedule themselves in two-hour blocks. Those interested in signing up can learn more at colocw.org/cwint.

There’s a vetting process and a training they’ve created to show people the ropes and teach new volunteers the rules.

For example, they can’t hand people literature inside the courthouse, so they pass out their informational pamphlets outside.

“We’re on public property,” Croy said. “We’re not violent. We’re not screaming. We’re peaceful. We’re just there for members of our community.”

The newly minted activist said the work is simple but meaningful. She has made new friends among her peers and met immigrants whose lives have moved her. She doesn’t speak Spanish, but her volunteerism is still welcomed.

“These are good people who are trying to do the right thing,” Croy said. “They’re trying to go about the immigration process the right way, showing up to court and going to their appointments and they have to worry about being detained while doing so.”

Showing up for people

On an early Monday morning in November, a mother pushing a stroller flanked by two older children hustled into the courthouse. Belknap handed the family a list of immigration advocacy group resources on their way inside, and the family’s worried expressions momentarily lifted, shifting into smiles.

“I feel guilty sometimes how grateful people are just that we are there to give them their rights and try to keep them as safe as we know how to do,” Belknap said. “It’s very, very humbling.”

The pamphlet states that June 17 was the last time someone was taken from the courthouse by ICE — both a reassurance that it’s been a few months and a notice to be vigilant, Belknap said.

Belknap was on court watch when the incident happened.

Volunteers told The Denver Post when it happened that a man, his partner and young son left the courtroom after an immigration hearing when ICE agents in plain clothes and masks grabbed the man and pushed him into the women’s restroom. The man was “violently” detained in front of his young child who was crying, volunteers said. Agents took the man down the courthouse hallway and “disappeared him,” volunteers said.

A volunteer was in the bathroom during the incident telling the agents to stop and telling the couple not to give the agents any information. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, that volunteer was then detained, arrested, handcuffed and cited.

The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Denver office said in a social media post that an agent was “assaulted” that day while performing their duties. The agency did not provide additional details about the situation.

Belknap — whose university research has largely taken place in prisons and domestic violence shelters — described the event as among the most horrifying scenes she’s witnessed.

Court watchers called immigration rapid response networks, who quickly showed up. They documented the incident, alerted the media and helped spread the word about what happened to someone in their community.

Margaret Bobb, a retired Denver teacher, joined the court watch group this summer after involving herself in immigrant advocacy work the past year.

One of her children is nonbinary, she said, which compels the 62-year-old to fight hard for the rights of the vulnerable.

Bobb finds the volunteer work calming — a tangible action she can do to quell a feeling of hopelessness.

She feels fortified at the thought that “a bunch of white U.S. citizens with cameras ready to film and report on what’s going on” could prevent injustices.

While she knows it’s a drop in the bucket, she hopes that some information on the fliers they hand out might prove helpful — even life-saving, she said.

“You meet cool people and you meet nice immigrants,” Bobb said. “I drive away going,’I did something.’ It’s empowering.”

As a kid, Belknap remembers learning about Hitler and the Nazis.

“I used to always think that I hope I would have been one of the good people who tried to stand up for these horrible things going on — kidnapping and detaining people and killing them,” Belknap said. “This is it for me. I feel I am obliged to show up for people.”",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TDP-L-Belknap111825-cha-048.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-11-23 12:57:41.769478

Grissom,,,,,https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/readers-opinion/guest-commentary/article313026606.html,"At the heart of the entire lawsuit collection is the real question: CoreCivic, why not just get the permit?
While CoreCivic’s multimillion-dollar contract to house ICE detainees in Leavenworth is on hold because of the litigation, CoreCivic apparently has a larger mission: Avoid even the small, intolerable amount of oversight of a permit.
Ultimately, the entire saga could end if CoreCivic were simply to apply for a permit.
But this has clearly become about more than just Leavenworth to CoreCivic, which has clearly had enough of pesky voices concerned with human rights and local governance, in Leavenworth and beyond.
The scale and implications here for federal intrusion on local government cannot be overstated, for Leavenworth and cities across the nation.","By now, you may have heard 2025 has been quite a legal saga between private prison giant CoreCivic and the city of Leavenworth, in four separate lawsuits over the requirement of a permit to operate a currently inactive facility as a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center. At the heart of the entire lawsuit collection is the real question: CoreCivic, why not just get the permit?

While CoreCivic’s multimillion-dollar contract to house ICE detainees in Leavenworth is on hold because of the litigation, CoreCivic apparently has a larger mission: Avoid even the small, intolerable amount of oversight of a permit. No amount of flip-flopping or expensive judicial gymnastics is too much for CoreCivic’s hope of a United States where it can disregard local government’s concerns anywhere it seeks to do business.

Once upon a time, CoreCivic insisted it would be a good partner to Leavenworth, touting tax benefits and investments — but now the multibillion-dollar company has dragged both parties through multiple cycles of costly, adversarial litigation. Similarly, CoreCivic once trumpeted flexibility and work-life balance to job applicants in Leavenworth, but within a few months, new staff members found themselves in quite the bait and switch of extra shifts and long stretches without a day off as the facility grew increasingly dangerous.

CoreCivic’s “Better the Public Good” slogan and its entire website are “1984”-level corporate doublespeak, gaslighting anyone who has read or lived through its record of human rights abuses under its current name or previous identity, Corrections Corporation of America. The Leavenworth prison itself has an indelible local reputation as a violent hellhole, and CoreCivic’s brand is consistent in recent reports of horrific conditions at its facilities across the country, from Tennessee to California.

This year, the dystopian corporate mind games continue. CoreCivic applied for a permit in February, then withdrew it. In March, when Leavenworth sued CoreCivic in federal court for attempting to open in violation of local law, the company claimed this was a zoning question suited more to state court, and the litigation moved accordingly. But when CoreCivic filed its own lawsuit in August, it suddenly insisted this was very much a federal question — now that it could call in the cavalry, the U.S. Department of Justice, to weaponize the supremacy clause and national immigration politics against Leavenworth.

Ultimately, the entire saga could end if CoreCivic were simply to apply for a permit. It could end the three active lawsuits, open its Leavenworth detention center and begin fulfilling its profitable contract. But this has clearly become about more than just Leavenworth to CoreCivic, which has clearly had enough of pesky voices concerned with human rights and local governance, in Leavenworth and beyond. Thus, CoreCivic reached for the wieldy, federal hammer of allies at the DOJ in its new mission: Weaponize the courts and be able to operate completely unregulated.

The scale and implications here for federal intrusion on local government cannot be overstated, for Leavenworth and cities across the nation. Were this a developer looking to install a nuclear waste dump by a residential neighborhood, in the reality that CoreCivic and the DOJ hope to create, all it would take is a friendly political connection to Washington, D.C., to shut up a local government and override any attempts to protect residents’ health.

Every city and county in the U.S. should be alarmed by CoreCivic’s arrogance and bullying of our local government. We should not allow corporate executives to reduce all of us — staff, immigrant detainees and entire surrounding communities — to the mere collateral materials for their profiteering.",https://www.kansascity.com/public/latest-news/i7jnpr/picture313028578/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Leavenworth%20ICE%20detention%20online.jpeg,N,,2025-11-23 10:58:55.988389

Both political parties.
The only ones who can mess that up are the political parties and the people of Congress, as they add their special preferences to the bill.
But our system is broken, and it is because we put political parties before the dignity of the human being.","At a Stations of the Cross prayer gathering in Aurora, Archbishop Aquila condemns political gamesmanship and calls Catholics to defend the God-given dignity of migrants.

Denver Archbishop Samuel J. Aquila, together with Auxiliary Bishop Jorge Rodríguez, led a Stations of the Cross prayer service around the ICE Detention Facility in Aurora. Several hundred attended the peaceful procession and joined in saintly solidarity with the innumerable immigrants affected by the current immigration crisis.

In his remarks following the Stations of the Cross, printed below in full, Archbishop Aquila lambasted both U.S. political parties for failing immigrants and using them for selfish political gain. He called on those gathered, and indeed, all Catholics, Christians and people of good will to pray and act to defend the dignity of every human person — especially migrants.

“I want to thank all of you for coming today, as we have prayed and walked the Stations of the Cross. They are reminders to us of God's love for all people and for the immigrant, for the stranger, for those who are sick and suffering, and for all those who are in need of our prayer. We must remember the dignity of every human being. That dignity is not bestowed by any government. That dignity comes from God and God alone.

Both political parties have failed horribly when it comes to immigration. They have treated immigrants as pawns for their own elections, for their own desires, and they have failed every immigrant. Both political parties. Not just one, but both. And they have not served people well. Their only interest is themselves and that alone. And getting to the next election. It is important for us as Catholics and as Christians and as people of goodwill to give witness to the dignity of the human person, that every human being, whether they believe it or not, whether they be atheist, agnostic, whether they be Hindu or Muslim, whether they be Jewish or Christian, every human being is created in the image and likeness of God. It is important to always understand that.

God never, ever stops loving a human being. No matter who that human being is, no matter who that president may be, no matter who that person in Congress may be, no matter who that world leader may be. God is love, and it is impossible for God to not love. It is human beings who stop loving. It is human beings whose hearts are so hardened that they are rocks. And as God knocks on that door, they still refuse to believe. They still refuse to trust in him.

As we have walked this Way of the Cross and seeing how much God loves us, that he has died for you and your sins. Whether you believe it or not, he has. Whether you receive it or not, he offers it still to you.

What we see in the brokenness of our immigration system is horrendous, especially when it comes to human trafficking, when it comes to sex trafficking, the trafficking of children and the trafficking of drugs. That all undermines the dignity of the human person.

I just learned a couple days ago that there is finally a bill in Congress that is supported bipartisan, and it is called the Dignity Act. It is to take care of immigrants who have come to this country. They may not have come with documents, but they have been living here peacefully for 10, 20, 30 years. Many of us know them, and they need a path to citizenship.

The only ones who can mess that up are the political parties and the people of Congress, as they add their special preferences to the bill. If they just did not touch the bill the way it is today, it would be fine. But our system is broken, and it is because we put political parties before the dignity of the human being.

And so I encourage you, my sisters and brothers, and I thank you for being here today to give witness to the dignity of the human person and to the goodness of every human being from the moment of their conception through natural death. Let us continue to work for the immigrant and to proclaim Jesus Christ, no matter what the cost. May the Lord bless all of you and thank you for your witness.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/1c90d9_0474c8cb8fd04a15b33d694f1db4123c~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1000,h_667,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/1c90d9_0474c8cb8fd04a15b33d694f1db4123c~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-11-23 14:57:20.716436

Federal immigration agents equipped with tactical gear and rifles descended on downtown Los Angeles in armored trucks on June 6, arresting dozens of workers at an apparel factory. Within hours, another group of agents raided a Home Depot a few miles away, arresting day laborers who were looking for work.

Those operations quickly became a flashpoint, sparking spontaneous large-scale street protests. But President Donald Trump’s administration doubled down, and more high-profile raids followed as the White House sought to make good on the president’s promise to conduct the largest mass deportation program in the nation’s history.

Immigration agents have since conducted sweeps at construction sites, restaurants, factories, car washes and farms, upending life for undocumented workers nationwide. California estimates that nearly 1.5 million undocumented workers call the state home.

As militarized crackdowns have become more common in many parts of the country, employers and unions alike have taken new steps to protect their workers. In industries ranging from farmwork to garment production to food service, they have begun organizing defenses to make it harder for ICE to identify, detain and deport unauthorized immigrant employees who help keep their workplaces in business.

While the strategies vary, they share common goals: to find ways to inform immigrant workers about threats and, when possible, to shield them from detainment and deportation.

Adopt a corner

On Aug. 6, day laborers gathered in front of the same Home Depot in Los Angeles that had been raided two months earlier. Tensions were still high in the city with ongoing ICE and Customs and Border Patrol actions, but the workers needed some income.

Suddenly, the back door of a Penske rental truck slid open from the inside to reveal nearly a dozen CBP agents in body armor lying in wait. They surged toward unsuspecting laborers, many of whom scattered in fear.

The raid, dubbed “Operation Trojan Horse” by the Department of Homeland Security and captured on camera by a Fox News reporter embedded with the agents inside the truck, resulted in the arrests of more than a dozen immigrants.

Similar raids earlier in the year inspired the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, a labor group that advocates for improved working conditions, to create the “Adopt a Corner” campaign.

Jose Madera, the director of the NDLON-affiliated Pasadena Community Job Center, said that the campaign encourages volunteers to go to places where immigrants regularly gather in search of work, to teach people about their rights. So far, volunteers have visited more than 100 locations across the country, Madera said.

The group’s volunteers hand out “Know Your Rights” materials like red cards, which are pocket-sized cutouts that explain what anyone — regardless of immigration status — can do when confronted by an immigration officer. But since ICE officers frequently violate immigrants’ rights, Madera alleged, people who adopt a corner can help workers in a more immediate way.

The Pasadena Community Job Center also tells people in the community to record actions by authorities on cellphones so that when there is a raid, “there can be someone documenting the abuse, the violence, people’s constitutional rights being violated,” Madera said.

Organizers hope that documentation can serve both as evidence in lawsuits or in immigration courts, and as proof to show the public how the Trump administration is conducting immigration enforcement operations.

“Many Americans do not want to see this type of violence — masked men in unmarked cars, armed to the teeth, going into communities and causing this terror,” he said.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to Capital & Main’s requests for comment.

In the fields

Federal agents staged massive immigration raids on a pair of California cannabis farms in the cities of Carpinteria and Camarillo on July 10, blocking roads with armored vehicles, launching tear gas and firing crowd control munitions at protesters.

Amid the chaos, Jaime Alanis Garcia — who had worked at Glass House Farms for a decade — was fleeing from immigration officers when he fell 30 feet from the roof of a greenhouse, fracturing his neck and skull, according to NBC. Two days later, he died.

At those raids, federal agents arrested 361 people, including American citizen and U.S. Army veteran George Retes.

More than a quarter of the state’s large agricultural workforce is undocumented — and nearly two-thirds are immigrants, more generally — leaving hundreds of thousands of laborers vulnerable to immigration crackdowns at work.

Since even before the Glass House Farms raids, the United Farm Workers union has been reaching out to employers to suggest ways to protect their employees.

Elizabeth Strater, vice president of UFW, told Capital & Main that one of the simplest things farmers can do is put up gates and fences to keep intruders out. For large fields that are too difficult or costly to encircle, Strater recommends a more impromptu tactic that, ironically, is sometimes used by law enforcement.

“If you’re out in flat, open fields where you can’t put a gate, what you can do is have the foreman, or whoever, park their vehicle so that it prevents access (by) someone who may not have your workers’ best interest at heart,” Strater said.

Such physical barriers are critical, Strater said, because while workers who are in the U.S. illegally are protected by constitutional and statutory rights, federal agents have repeatedly been recorded ignoring basic protections.

Undocumented workers “have a right not to answer questions, but what happens when they assert that right is these absolutely unhinged, untrained, uncontrolled agents smash their windows and drag them out of their cars,” Strater said. “The utter lawlessness on behalf of these agencies is just extreme.”

Beyond providing employers with resources, UFW has taken legal action against the DHS, which Strater said has helped reduce the number of indiscriminate raids on farmworkers in certain areas of California.

Still, federal agencies can obtain criminal warrants to go after workers at specific sites, according to Strater.

Not all farm owners are taking action in response to workplace raids, but Strater said that most, including nonunionized operations, have been receptive to UFW’s recommendations. Some have even hosted community meetings to develop plans that could lessen the impact of immigration enforcement on workers and, by extension, the businesses that employ them, some of which have been hit by labor shortages triggered by the raids.

The factory floor

Many clothing manufacturing businesses in Los Angeles have also been open to outreach aimed at protecting employees, according to Daisy Gonzalez, campaign director at the Garment Worker Center.

“It’s a new sort of reaction to us. … Garment Worker Center is a workers’ rights organization, and often employers are not that receptive to that,” Gonzalez said. “But I think information about what to do in this moment, employers understand it’s a resource for both their workers and themselves.”

Since the high-profile raids in June, many of the Garment Worker Center’s members have been worried about being detained on the job. Some have opted to stay home from work — for months.

In response, Gonzalez said, the Garment Worker Center has significantly ramped up its mutual aid programs, providing financial assistance to affected employees and even delivering resources to home-bound workers.

One middle-aged undocumented worker in Los Angeles, who spoke to Capital & Main on the condition of anonymity for fear that immigration officials would detain him, said the garment factory where he was working closed permanently after immigration raids began. If it were not for the Garment Worker Center’s financial support, he added, he would not have been able to pay for food or rent.

“The raids have deeply affected me, both psychologically and economically,” he said in an interview in Spanish. “There’s panic in the streets. I try to leave the house as infrequently as I can. I speak for myself, but there are thousands of people just like me, many in worse situations. … This is a national emergency.”

Undocumented migrants aren’t the only ones potentially impacted by raids.

In September, the U.S. Supreme Court concluded that DHS officers could detain people based on their race, their use of Spanish or accented English, their occupation or their presence at locations such as car washes, agricultural or day labor sites.

The result is that many immigrants with residency, U.S. citizens and their American-born children can get caught up in aggressive raids. To Gonzalez, “Anyone who has a darker skin tone, or speaks a different language, or works in an industry that might be where certain people expect undocumented immigrants to work, are all targets.”

Serve and protect

On a busy street in L.A.’s Los Feliz neighborhood, customers line up to order tacos and burritos outside a small hut. Yuca’s is a modest operation with no inside seating, but it has been in business for nearly half a century, becoming a staple of the city’s Mexican-food scene and even winning a prestigious James Beard Foundation Award.

Dora Herrera, the restaurant’s co-owner, delights in being able to serve her local community, but since the Trump administration’s ramped-up immigration raids began, she has worried intensely about Yuca’s customers, vendors and workers, whom she considers “family.”

Herrera sought advice from organizations like the Latino Restaurant Association about how to protect her staff, regardless of their immigration status, as she has seen reports of federal agents arresting U.S. citizens, green-card holders and immigrants with work permits.

She has provided her employees with Know Your Rights materials like red cards and, for the first time since the restaurant opened in 1976, installed signs on the outside of the building declaring it private property. The law requires officers to produce a warrant to gain access to private property.

“We haven’t been around for 50 years for nothing. You learn something, you adapt, and you keep adapting to make it work,” Herrera said.

Such measures are far from foolproof but, according to Herrera, it is incumbent on people like her to do what they can to keep vulnerable workers as safe as possible.

“We want to make sure everybody’s taken care of, protected, educated,” Herrera said. “As an employer, I believe you have to do everything, absolutely everything you can, to protect your people, even the smallest thing.”

TRUMP'S SHIFTING UKRAINE POLICY The Trump administration paused processing applications and renewals of the Ukrainian humanitarian program in January, citing security reasons.

Ukrainian immigrants in the United States find themselves in a precarious situation. With their legal residency in limbo, they are at risk of being deported, while many grapple with job losses and a lack of medical care.

Kateryna Golizdra has survived six months in legal limbo - so far. She thinks she can hold out another six months, waiting for Donald Trump's administration to decide the fate of a humanitarian program that allowed some 260,000 people who fled the war in Ukraine to live and work in the United States.

When her legal status lapsed in May, Golizdra, 35, automatically became vulnerable to deportation. She lost her work permit and was forced to leave a job earning over $50,000 a year as a manager at the Ritz-Carlton in Fort Lauderdale. Golizdra also lost the health insurance that she used to cover check-ups for a liver condition. And she can no longer send money to her mother, who was also displaced and lives in Germany, she said.

The Trump administration's processing delays on the humanitarian program for Ukrainians launched by former Democratic President Joe Biden left nearly 200,000 people at risk of losing their legal status as of March 31, according to internal U.S. government data reviewed by Reuters. The number of Ukrainians affected by the delays has not been previously reported.

The humanitarian program, introduced in April 2022, allowed nearly 260,000 Ukrainians into the U.S. for an initial two-year period. That's a small share of the 5.9 million Ukrainian refugees worldwide, 5.3 million of whom are in Europe, according to United Nations refugee figures.

Golizdra said she has no idea when - or if - her permission to stay in the United States might be renewed, threatening her short-lived sense of security in America.

Live Events

While she waits for an update on her application, she could potentially be arrested by federal immigration authorities, three former immigration officials said.

'CONSTANT STRESS'

The last six months have felt like she is on a ""hamster wheel,"" Golizdra said.

""It's a constant stress, anxiety,"" she said. ""If I will need to leave the States, then I will have to build something again.""

Reuters spoke with two dozen Ukrainians who lost their work permits - and their jobs - due to delays in processing renewals, including tech workers, a preschool teacher, a financial planner, an interior designer and a college student. They described digging into their savings, seeking out community support and taking on debt to support themselves while they wait for a decision on their status.

Some of the people interviewed by Reuters said they were worried they could be arrested by U.S. immigration authorities. Others said they were staying indoors, or had left the U.S. for Canada, Europe and South America.

Returning to Ukraine is not an option. Golizdra's home in Bucha, a Kyiv suburb, was set ablaze in March 2022 when Russian troops stormed the city. After Ukrainian forces retook the town, they found hundreds of bodies, including of civilians who were victims of extrajudicial killings.

TRUMP'S SHIFTING UKRAINE POLICY

The Trump administration paused processing applications and renewals of the Ukrainian humanitarian program in January, citing security reasons.

After a contentious Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Trump said in March that he was weighing whether to revoke the Ukrainians' legal status entirely - a plan first reported by Reuters.

Trump ultimately did not end the program and in May, a federal judge ordered officials to resume processing renewals.

But U.S. immigration officials have processed only 1,900 renewal applications for Ukrainians and other nationalities since then, a fraction of those with expiring status, according to U.S. government data released last week as part of a lawsuit.

Meanwhile, a spending package Trump signed into law in July added a $1,000 fee to such humanitarian applications - on top of a fee of $1,325 per individual.

The White House referred questions about the Ukrainian humanitarian program to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which did not respond to requests for comment.

U.S. Representative Mike Quigley, a Democrat in the Chicago area, said his office has received requests for assistance from more than 200 Ukrainians in limbo.

""There's a fear that if they haven't completed their application, if they haven't gone through the whole process, they're vulnerable for deportation,"" Quigley said.

Anne Smith, the executive director and regulatory counsel of the Ukraine Immigration Task Force, a legal coalition formed to aid those who fled the war to the U.S., said her attorney network was receiving multiple calls per week from Ukrainians saying they have family members detained by immigration authorities. She said Ukrainians have been arrested at construction sites, while doing food delivery or working as Uber or truck drivers, as well as in broader sweeps in Chicago and greater Cleveland.

Brian Snyder, a product marketing manager in Raleigh, North Carolina , who has sponsored three Ukrainian families , said people who followed the rules are being treated unfairly.

One Ukrainian woman recently asked if he would serve as her emergency contact if she was picked up by immigration officers, he said. He knew of another family where a teenage son's parole was renewed while the parents and two younger children were left waiting, he said.

""All of this dysfunction and uncertainty is just introducing a tremendous amount of stress in these families' lives,"" he said.

SOME UKRAINIANS 'SELF DEPORT'

Six of 24 Ukrainians interviewed by Reuters have left the U.S. rather than risk ending up in immigration jail or being sent to Latin America or Africa, as the Trump administration has done with other hard-to-deport immigrants.

Yevhenii Padafa, a 31-year-old software engineer who moved to Brooklyn in September 2023, applied to renew his status in March. His application sat pending until it expired in September.

Worried that he could be barred from the U.S. in the future if he remained without legal status, he tried to ""self deport"" using a government app known as CBP One.

The Trump administration in May promised a free outbound plane ticket and $1,000 ""exit bonus"" for those using the app.

Padafa decided to go to Argentina, which has a lower cost of living than other countries and offers a humanitarian program for Ukrainians. But the app would not book him a ticket there. A U.S. border official told him the flight would need to be booked to Ukraine, he said.

He was counting on the free flight and $1,000 bonus. Arriving in Buenos Aires in mid-November with little money, he planned to sell a laptop to cover initial rent for an apartment.

""If I return to Ukraine, I'll just go to the frontline,"" he said. ""I'd rather be homeless somewhere than go to Ukraine.""

The Trump administration has until mid-January to revoke the legal protection for Somalis nationally.
But that move would affect only a tiny fraction of the tens of thousands of Somalis living in Minnesota.
“The truth is that the Somali community is beloved and long-woven into the fabric of many neighborhoods and communities in Minnesota,” said Altman.
The Trump administration has also sought to limit protections previously extended to migrants from Cuba and Syria, among other countries.","President Donald Trump’s pledge to terminate temporary legal protections for Somalis living in Minnesota is triggering fear in the state’s deeply-rooted immigrant community, along with doubts about whether the White House has the legal authority to enact the directive as described.

In a Truth Social post late Friday, Trump said he would “immediately” strip Somali residents in Minnesota of Temporary Protected Status, a legal safeguard against deportation for immigrants from certain countries.

The announcement drew immediate pushback from some state leaders and immigration experts, who characterized Trump’s declaration as a legally dubious effort to sow fear and suspicion toward Minnesota’s Somali community, the largest in the nation.

“There’s no legal mechanism that allows the president to terminate protected status for a particular community or state that he has beef with,” said Heidi Altman, policy director at the National Immigrant Justice Center.

“This is Trump doing what he always does: demagoguing immigrants without justification or evidence and using that demagoguery in an attempt to take away important life-saving protections,” she added.

The Trump administration has until mid-January to revoke the legal protection for Somalis nationally. But that move would affect only a tiny fraction of the tens of thousands of Somalis living in Minnesota. A report produced for Congress in August put the number of Somalis covered by TPS at just 705 nationwide.

“I am a citizen and so are (the) majority of Somalis in America,” Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Democrat from Somali, said in a social media post Friday. “Good luck celebrating a policy change that really doesn’t have much impact on the Somalis you love to hate.”

Still, advocates warned the move could inflame hate against a community at a time of rising Islamophobia.

“This is not just a bureaucratic change,” said Jaylani Hussein, president of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. “It is a political attack on the Somali and Muslim community driven by Islamophobic and hateful rhetoric.”

In his social media post, Trump claimed, without offering evidence, that Somali gangs had targeted Minnesota residents and referred to the state as a “hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.”

Federal prosecutors have in recent weeks brought charges against dozens of people in a social-services fraud scheme. Some of the defendants hail from Somalia. “Accountability is coming,” Minnesota Republican Rep. Tom Emmer wrote in response to that story.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, has noted that Minnesota consistently ranks among the safest states in the country.

“It’s not surprising that the President has chosen to broadly target an entire community,” Walz said Friday. “This is what he does to change the subject.”

In response to Trump’s announcement, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison his office was “exploring all of our options,” adding that Trump “cannot terminate TPS for just one state or on a bigoted whim.”

“Somali folks came to Minnesota fleeing conflict, instability and famine, and they have become an integral part of our state, our culture and our community,” he added.

The protection has been extended 27 times for Somalians since 1991, with U.S. authorities determining that it was unsafe for people already in the United States to return there.

Somalia for decades has been regarded as one of the world’s most dangerous countries. People have been fleeing ever since leader Siad Barre was removed in 1991 by clan-based militias and civil war erupted. The chaos later led to the rise of the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab militant group, which still holds parts of the country and carries out deadly attacks in the capital, Mogadishu, and elsewhere against the fragile federal government.

Community advocates note that the Somali diaspora in Minnesota has helped to revitalize downtown corridors in Minneapolis and plays a prominent role in the state’s politics.

“The truth is that the Somali community is beloved and long-woven into the fabric of many neighborhoods and communities in Minnesota,” said Altman. “Destabilizing families and communities makes all of us less safe and not more.”

As part of a broader push to adopt hardline immigration policies, the Trump administration has moved to withdraw various protections that had allowed immigrants to remain in the United States and work legally.

That included ending TPS for 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians who were granted protection under President Joe Biden. The Trump administration has also sought to limit protections previously extended to migrants from Cuba and Syria, among other countries.

Sylvester has been an active community member for many years in Rogers Park, which she refers to as “The People’s Republic of Rogers Park.” But she said it’s time for others to take the lead.","Following President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, Evelyn Rodriguez, a social worker at a K-8 school on Chicago’s North Side, received a letter from one of her students. That student no longer attends school. No one in the community has seen or heard from this student or their family since.

The letter read: “Estoy triste porque las noticias están diciendo que me van a reportar y deportar a Ecuador.” The student was saddened by news reports about Trump’s deportation threats, and thought they would soon be deported from their Rogers Park neighborhood to Ecuador.

In September, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers began Operation Midway Blitz, in which they detained children and adults presumed to be undocumented immigrants, often with force.

The ongoing detentions prompted local activists to organize to protect their neighbors. Protect Rogers Park, a community group formed in 2017, has led ICE watch training and connects impacted families with aid services.

“This is probably the first time we’ve really had to activate in such an intense way,” said Torrence Gardner, a founding member of Protect Rogers Park.

Gardner said the group has witnessed at least 10 immigrant detentions in the neighborhood since federal agents arrived in the city. Group members call them “abductions.”

Rodriguez, who has attended Protect Rogers Park events, said her school has also seen a decrease in enrollment by over 100 students. Others who remain enrolled are completing work at home on school-provided Chromebooks because they said in-person attendance no longer feels safe for them.

Rodriguez said several parents are also missing necessary meetings with school staff because they are worried about their safety while transporting themselves to the school. She says the school’s Halloween Trunk or Treat event was cancelled because federal agents were present in the school’s parking lot.

“They’re missing out on socialization. They’re missing out on peer relationships, emotional regulation. They are missing out on so much that they need in the early stages of development,” Rodriguez said. “I am upset because all I can say is ‘I am sorry.’”

These are just a few ways that families’ lives have changed because of Operation Midway Blitz.

Gardner says ICE has used a tactic known as “staging,” — prohibited by Mayor Johnson’s “ICE Free Zone” executive order — when city parking lots, vacant lots and garages are used for mobilizing or deploying immigration personnel.

Protect Rogers Park has never seen anything like it before.

“We adjusted pretty quickly, and this is the biggest turnout we’ve ever had, with thousands of volunteers,” Gardner said.

In response, Protect Rogers Park volunteers have organized school patrols to help parents and students get home safely, and they have distributed whistles to blow when agents are spotted. They also organize events, such as training sessions, educational webinars and “B*tch and Wine,” an event where community members are invited to rant about anything going on in their lives over a glass of wine.

After Operation Midway Blitz began, neighbors immediately gathered for a rally, and traffic on the group’s social media posts surged.

“We haven’t seen that level of intensity ever,” Gardner said.

Joey Sylvester, another early member of Protect Rogers Park, sees herself as a community facilitator within the group. She can often be spotted at Protect Rogers Park events, handing out the now-recognizable orange whistles, gathering contact information and answering questions about provided services and volunteer opportunities.

Sylvester, who is 79, has spent most of her adult life in volunteer work and activism. In the late 1960s, she protested the Vietnam War. She has worked to help formerly homeless women and mothers whose children have been murdered. Sylvester credits her work to how she was raised and also to her sons.

“I have two sons who are Black, and so to me, on a selfish level, part of my organizing since they’ve been with us, is also related to that struggle,” Sylvester said.

In 1982, Sylvester was part of Wellington United Church of Christ, which was one of the first public sanctuaries beyond the Mexico border to welcome migrants from Guatemala and El Salvador without documents.

When Trump was elected to his first term in office, Sylvester received a mass call to action from Protect Rogers Park co-founders Gabe González and Marissa Graciosa. She responded immediately, walking down to Living Water Church into a room of more than 300 people.

“We really got organized. We canvassed neighbors about Know Your Rights. We started to form different teams to work on different aspects of the resistance,” she said. “We had community events. We did training back then in self-defense and ICE Watch.”

There was not much ICE activity or work for the group until last December, after Trump’s reelection, when Sylvester sat with the other group founders and volunteers. They asked themselves, “What are we going to do now? Do we still have the capacity to do this work?”

The answer was yes — but at that point, they had no idea what the neighborhood would be facing.

“This context is very different because of the risks and the brutality we’re seeing now,” Sylvester said.

The group’s safety efforts meet community needs in a few ways, members say. Volunteer escorts usually don’t prevent detainment, but Gardner said they can act as a deterrent.

Volunteers film interactions between ICE and community members so Protect Rogers Park can follow up to see what can be done for detainees. They also try to notify family members and warn other neighbors and neighborhoods. Gardner and others say the school patrols provide a feeling of safety for children and families.

But feelings of safety can’t guarantee it.

On Nov. 5, ICE went into a day care in the North Center neighborhood and detained a teacher in front of children, sparking conversation between Protect Rogers Park organizers about ways to help families find safe childcare and other services.

“We need more people to keep stepping up because people are getting tired — more and more hands and eyes and ears, because this is far from over,” Gardner said.

Gardner is no stranger to activism. The grandson of a civil rights activist and Chicago Lesbian Hall of Fame inductee, Gardner’s own work began when he was 23, fresh out of college and living in St. Louis.

“I got involved in the Black Lives Matter stuff, but it wasn’t Black Lives Matter yet,” Gardner said. “It was … a kid who was killed by an officer in Ferguson, Missouri.”

Riots in Ferguson over the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown marked the start of the Black Lives Matter movement.

“And I was there,” Gardner said.

Sylvester has been an active community member for many years in Rogers Park, which she refers to as “The People’s Republic of Rogers Park.” But she said it’s time for others to take the lead.

“I’m honored I’m still able to do it … at my age,” she said. “I’m able to still physically and mentally hang together with the younger people who are part of the future. It’s up to them to carry it forward.”

But just as Rodriguez worries for her sons and her neighbors, she continues to worry about her students.

“This is what social work has come to now because our systems are broken,” she said. “Our systems are not working.”

Despite the unprecedented challenges her students are facing, she is “so proud of the families that are continuing to show up to school, that are continuing to pursue their education.”

Through it all, members of the Protect Rogers Park community have also shown up for students and their promise to continue their efforts until all can feel safe at school and in their homes is clear.

Minnesota has the nation’s largest Somali community. Many fled the long civil war in the east African country and were drawn to the state’s welcoming social programs.

But how many migrants would be affected by Trump’s announcement that he wants to end temporary protective status could be very small. A report produced for Congress in August put the number of Somalis covered by the program at just 705 nationwide.

Congress created the program granting temporary protective status (TPS) in 1990. It was meant to prevent deportations of people to countries suffering from natural disasters, civil strife or other dangerous conditions.

The designation can be granted by the homeland security secretary and is granted in 18-month increments.

The president announced his decision on his social media site, suggesting that Minnesota was “a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity”.

“Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing. Send them back to where they came from,” Trump wrote. “It’s OVER!”

The Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said Trump’s decision “will tear families apart.” The chapter’s executive director, Jaylani Hussein, said in a statement late Friday: “This is not just a bureaucratic change; it is a political attack on the Somali and Muslim community driven by Islamophobic and hateful rhetoric.”

Trump promised while campaigning to win back the White House last year that his administration would deport millions of people. As part of a broader push to adopt hardline immigration policies, the Trump administration has moved to withdraw various protections that had allowed immigrants to remain in the United States and work legally.

That included ending TPS for 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians who were granted protection under Joe Biden. The Trump administration has also sought to limit protections previously extended to migrants from Cuba and Syria, among other countries.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4f04ef5e94ee89d4dba874be8b643b5a78a12f7/494_0_2845_2277/master/2845.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3a806a115b5057d7b5c23ee857ebb911",N,,2025-11-23 02:57:23.488420

The Appellate Division, Third Department’s decision in Matter of Rorapaugh v New Penn Motor Express LLC, 2025 NY Slip Op 06370 (Nov. 20, 2025), addresses two recurrent and practically important issues in New York workers’ compensation and third-party practice:

When is a workers’ compensation carrier’s consent required for a settlement of a related third-party action under Workers’ Compensation Law (§) 29(5)?

Which forum has authority to equitably apportion litigation expenses (counsel fees and costs) between the claimant and carrier under § 29(1), the Workers’ Compensation Board or the court in which the third-party action was brought?

The case arises out of a fatal work-related motor vehicle accident. The decedent’s spouse, claimant Sally Rorapaugh, pursued two parallel avenues:

a New York workers’ compensation death benefits claim, and

a federal third-party wrongful death action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York.

After a substantial $9 million third-party settlement (with a net recovery of approximately $5.9 million to the claimant), the employer and its workers’ compensation carrier challenged both:

the validity of the settlement for lack of carrier consent, and

the Workers’ Compensation Board’s authority to calculate the carrier’s equitable share of litigation expenses and award “fresh money” to the claimant.

The Third Department:

affirmed the Board’s conclusion that the carrier’s consent to the settlement was not required, because the settlement far exceeded the total statutory workers’ compensation benefits potentially payable; but

reversed the Board’s determination that it could equitably apportion litigation costs and award the claimant $113,631.55 in “fresh money,” holding that only the court in which the third-party action was instituted has jurisdiction under § 29(1) to make that equitable apportionment.

This commentary examines the opinion’s reasoning, its grounding in prior precedents such as McComber, Kelly, Burns, and Stenson, and its likely impact on New York workers’ compensation and third-party practice. In particular, the decision crystallizes two important principles:

Consent Threshold Rule: Where a claimant’s third-party settlement substantially exceeds the full statutory value of potential workers’ compensation benefits, carrier consent under § 29(5) is not required.

Exclusive Judicial Apportionment Rule: Absent agreement, the equitable apportionment of litigation expenses under § 29(1) must be obtained by motion to the court in which the third-party action was instituted; the Workers’ Compensation Board lacks jurisdiction to make that apportionment and award “fresh money.”

II. Factual and Procedural Background

A. The Fatal Accident and Workers’ Compensation Claim

In July 2019, claimant’s spouse (the “decedent”) was killed in a motor vehicle accident while acting in the course of his employment. The claimant (his widow) filed a claim for workers’ compensation death benefits in August 2019.

B. The Third-Party Wrongful Death Action

In July 2020, claimant also commenced a third-party wrongful death action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York, naming the driver and owner of the other involved vehicle as defendants. This action was brought pursuant to Workers’ Compensation Law § 29, which preserves an injured worker’s or dependent’s right to sue a negligent third party while receiving workers’ compensation benefits.

C. Settlement, Stipulation of Dismissal, and Jurisdictional Complications

The third-party action was settled for $9 million. As the Workers’ Compensation Board later noted (fn. 2), the claimant’s net recovery after fees and costs was approximately $5.9 million.

In February 2021, the parties to the third-party action filed a stipulation of dismissal in the District Court, which the court granted. Crucially, the stipulation did not inform the court that the action had been settled.

After dismissal, claimant attempted on August 27, 2021 to obtain a compromise order from the District Court under Workers’ Compensation Law § 29(5), apparently in an effort to substitute judicial approval for the carrier’s consent. As the Appellate Division recounts in footnote 1:

Although claimant had attempted to get a compromise order from District Court in lieu of the carrier's consent on August 27, 2021 (see Workers' Compensation Law § 29 [5]), the court rejected the request based upon the fact that, in their stipulation seeking dismissal of the third-party action, the parties failed to inform the court that the action had been settled and, in light of the court's subsequent dismissal of the action, it no longer had jurisdiction to make a compromise order.

This sequence created a significant procedural trap: the third-party court had already dismissed the case without being made aware of the settlement, and later refused to issue a compromise order for lack of jurisdiction.

D. The Carrier’s Post-Settlement Objections

In August 2021, after learning that the third-party action had in fact been settled, the employer and its workers’ compensation carrier (collectively, the “carrier”) argued:

They had not consented to the settlement as required under Workers’ Compensation Law § 29(5).

Their payments on the workers’ compensation claim should therefore be discontinued.

Further benefits to claimant were barred by § 29.

E. Proceedings Before the WCLJ and the Workers' Compensation Board

Following hearings, the Workers’ Compensation Law Judge (WCLJ) determined, among other things, that:

The carrier’s consent was not necessary because the amount claimant received in the settlement exceeded the total workers’ compensation benefits to which she was entitled.

The WCLJ set payments at a temporary total disability rate, subject to the carrier’s lien and any lien reduction.

On administrative appeal, the Workers’ Compensation Board modified the WCLJ’s decision:

It affirmed that the carrier’s consent was not necessary.

It rejected the carrier’s assertion that the Board lacked jurisdiction to calculate the lien reduction.

It calculated:

the carrier’s lien on claimant’s benefits as $109,402.81, and

the carrier’s apportioned share of claimant’s third-party litigation expenses as $223,934.36.

Because the carrier’s equitable share of litigation costs exceeded its lien, the Board concluded that the carrier owed claimant an additional $113,631.55 in “fresh money.”

The Board rescinded the WCLJ’s temporary total disability classification but otherwise allowed weekly benefits to continue, subject to the carrier’s credit.

F. Appeal to the Appellate Division, Third Department

The carrier appealed to the Appellate Division, challenging:

The Board’s conclusion that the carrier’s consent under § 29(5) was not required for the third-party settlement.

The Board’s jurisdiction and method of calculating the lien reduction and the $113,631.55 “fresh money” award.

III. Summary of the Court’s Opinion

Justice Aarons, writing for a unanimous panel (Clark, J.P., Pritzker, Reynolds Fitzgerald and McShan, JJ., concurring), issued a decision that:

A. On Consent to Settlement (§ 29(5))

Reaffirmed that under Workers’ Compensation Law § 29(5), carrier consent to a third-party settlement is required “only if the settlement is for less than the statutory amount of compensation benefits.” (quoting McComber v Lehrer McGovern Bovis, Inc., 28 AD3d 402, 403 [1st Dept 2006]).

Accepted the Board’s finding that the full value of claimant’s potential death benefits over her remaining life expectancy was approximately $1.2 million.

Held that the net settlement of approximately $5.9 million so vastly exceeded this figure that, even if claimant outlived her life expectancy, consent was not required.

B. On Lien Reduction and Equitable Apportionment of Litigation Expenses (§ 29(1))

Restated that a compensation carrier has:

a lien on the third-party recovery to the extent of past benefits paid, and

a right to offset future workers’ compensation benefits by the amount of the claimant’s net recovery.

Reaffirmed that the carrier must pay its equitable share of the claimant’s litigation expenses, which is assessed based on the total benefit the carrier derives (both lien and future credit) from the claimant’s recovery (per Kelly, Brisson, and Burns).

But emphasized that under Workers’ Compensation Law § 29(1), where the parties do not agree, the equitable apportionment of legal expenses must be made by the court in which the third-party action was instituted, not by the Workers’ Compensation Board.

Held that, in light of the statute and claimant’s failure to obtain carrier consent, her “only recourse” for equitable apportionment was to move in the federal District Court for such an order.

Concluded that, under these circumstances, the Board lacked jurisdiction to determine the equitable apportionment of costs and to award the claimant $113,631.55 in fresh money.

C. Disposition

The Court ordered:

ORDERED that the decision is modified, without costs, by reversing so much thereof as held that claimant was entitled to $113,631.55; matter remitted to the Workers' Compensation Board for further proceedings not inconsistent with this Court's decision; and, as so modified, affirmed.

Thus:

The no-consent-required ruling stands.

The Board’s apportionment and fresh money award is reversed.

The matter returns to the Board to administer benefits and lien/credit issues consistent with the Appellate Division’s jurisdictional holding.

IV. Legal Framework: Workers’ Compensation Law § 29

A. Dual-Track Recovery: Workers’ Compensation and Third-Party Actions

Workers’ Compensation Law § 29 allows an injured worker or, in death cases, the decedent’s dependents to:

receive workers’ compensation benefits from the employer/carrier (a no-fault, statutory remedy), while

also suing a negligent third party for full tort damages (e.g., pain and suffering, wrongful death damages).

B. The Carrier’s Two Key Benefits Under § 29

Under New York law (as synthesized in Kelly, Brisson, Burns, and Stenson), the carrier receives two distinct statutory benefits from a claimant’s third-party recovery:

Past Benefits Lien (§ 29(1))

The carrier has a lien on the third-party recovery to the extent of compensation and medical benefits already paid. The claimant must satisfy this lien out of the gross recovery.

Future Benefits Offset (§ 29(4))

The carrier may offset (suspend or reduce) future compensation payments until the claimant’s net recovery is exhausted. In substance, the third-party tortfeasor (rather than the carrier) funds the claimant’s future stream of benefits, to the extent of the net recovery.

C. Equitable Apportionment of Litigation Expenses (§ 29(1))

Because the carrier’s lien and future offset are both benefits directly flowing from the claimant’s (and her counsel’s) efforts in the third-party litigation, the Court of Appeals in Matter of Kelly v State Ins. Fund, 60 NY2d 131 (1983), held that equity requires the carrier to bear an appropriate share of the litigation expenses proportionate to the benefit it receives.

Workers’ Compensation Law § 29(1) contains the statutory mechanism:

Should the [claimant] secure a recovery from [a third party], whether by judgment, settlement or otherwise, such [claimant] may apply on notice to such lienor to the court in which the third-party action was instituted ... for an order apportioning the reasonable and necessary expenditures, including [counsel] fees, incurred in effecting such recovery. Such expenditures shall be equitably apportioned by the court between the [claimant] and the lienor.

Thus, when the parties do not agree on how to divide litigation costs between the claimant and the carrier, the statute directs that the court where the third-party action was brought resolve the issue.

D. Consent to Settlement (§ 29(5))

Separate from cost apportionment, § 29(5) governs when a third-party settlement requires carrier consent (or a court “compromise order”) to preserve the claimant’s entitlement to ongoing workers’ compensation benefits. Courts have construed § 29(5) to require consent:

only when the settlement is for less than the total “statutory amount of compensation benefits” potentially payable under the Workers’ Compensation Law; and

no consent is required when the settlement is for more than that statutory amount.

The leading statement of this rule is McComber v Lehrer McGovern Bovis, Inc., 28 AD3d 402 (1st Dept 2006), which is central to the Rorapaugh court’s analysis.

V. Precedents Cited and Their Influence

A. McComber v Lehrer McGovern Bovis, Inc., 28 AD3d 402 (1st Dept 2006)

In McComber, the First Department held that carrier consent under § 29(5) is required “only if the settlement is for less than the statutory amount of compensation benefits.” The rationale is that if a claimant’s settlement is greater than the total workers’ compensation benefits potentially payable, the carrier suffers no prejudice from the settlement – the recovery fully covers both past and prospective compensation exposure.

In Rorapaugh, the Third Department directly quotes and applies this rule. The Board had calculated the full value of claimant’s future death benefits based on her age and life expectancy (~$1.2 million). Because the net settlement was about $5.9 million, the court saw no realistic scenario in which the carrier would be disadvantaged:

Even if, as the carrier argues, claimant lives beyond her estimated life expectancy, given the significant disparity between what she would collect in benefits in her lifetime and the $5.9 million she received in the settlement, the carrier's consent to the settlement agreement was not necessary (see Workers' Compensation Law § 29 [5]; McComber, 28 AD3d at 403).

Thus McComber provides the doctrinal backbone for the consent holding in Rorapaugh.

B. Matter of Kelly v State Ins. Fund, 60 NY2d 131 (1983)

Kelly is the foundational case on how to apportion litigation expenses between claimants and carriers. It established that:

the carrier’s lien for past benefits paid entitles it to reimbursement from the recovery; but

the carrier must pay its equitable share of litigation expenses on both:

the reimbursement (lien), and

the benefit of not having to pay future compensation (future offset).

The Court of Appeals recognized that absent such sharing, the carrier would receive a “free ride” on the claimant’s litigation efforts. Therefore, litigation costs must be apportioned based on the carrier’s total benefit from the recovery.

In Rorapaugh, Kelly is cited for two key points:

As authority that the carrier’s equitable share of expenses is proportionate to the total benefit it derives from the claimant’s recovery (60 NY2d at 135–36).

As authority that the court (not the Board) is the ultimate decision-maker on equitable apportionment under § 29(1) (60 NY2d at 138).

Thus, Kelly underpins both:

the substance of the apportionment rules, and

the jurisdictional allocation of the apportionment decision to the third-party court.

C. Matter of Brisson v County of Onondaga, 6 NY3d 273 (2006)

Brisson reiterated that the carrier’s benefit includes both:

its lien for past payments, and

its right to offset future benefits.

The decision clarified aspects of the formula for calculating the carrier’s share and reinforced that the apportionment must consider the entire economic benefit the carrier receives from the third-party recovery.

In Rorapaugh, Brisson is cited in the string of authorities supporting the standard understanding of lien and future offset under § 29, and the need to apportion litigation expenses accordingly.

D. Burns v Varriale, 9 NY3d 207 (2007)

Burns refined Kelly by addressing cases where future benefits are speculative or not fixed, such as non-schedule permanent partial disability claims. The Court of Appeals held:

The carrier’s share of litigation costs attributable to uncertain future benefits may need to be reassessed over time, rather than set once and for all at the time of settlement.

The essential principle remains: the carrier must share, proportionately, in the costs of achieving the recovery from which it benefits.

In Rorapaugh, Burns is cited:

to reaffirm that the carrier’s offset of future benefits must be taken into account in apportioning litigation expenses (9 NY3d at 215), and

as part of the authority supporting the view that equitable apportionment is a judicial, not administrative, function (9 NY3d at 214).

E. Matter of Stenson v New York State Dept. of Transp., 84 AD3d 22 (3d Dept 2011)

Stenson is a Third Department decision that elaborated on:

the dual benefits to carriers under § 29 (lien and future offset), and

the need to consider the future offset when apportioning litigation expenses.

Notably, Stenson acknowledged that § 29(1) assigns equitable apportionment of expenses to the court, but in practice the Workers’ Compensation Board has often been involved in related calculations, especially concerning:

determining the amount of the carrier’s future credit, and

implementing or adjusting the credit as benefits resume or are modified.

In Rorapaugh, Stenson is cited for:

describing the carrier’s dual benefits and the need to take the future offset into account in apportioning costs (84 AD3d at 24–25); and

the principle that “the ultimate determination of the equitable apportionment of legal expenses resides in the courts vested with the powers of fact finding and the exercise of a sound discretion” (84 AD3d at 26).

The Court adds “compare Stenson” when declaring that the Board has no jurisdiction to apportion expenses in the circumstances of Rorapaugh, signaling that Stenson should not be read as granting the Board general jurisdiction to perform Kelly/Burns apportionments absent judicial involvement.

F. Becker v Huss Co., 43 NY2d 527 (1978)

Becker is an earlier Court of Appeals decision dealing with § 29 liens and third-party recoveries. It is cited in Rorapaugh (along with Kelly and Burns) as part of the authority that apportionment of expenses is to be made by the court where the third-party action was instituted.

G. Minkowitz Practice Commentaries

The opinion references Martin Minkowitz’s Practice Commentaries to Workers’ Compensation Law § 29 for the proposition that:

An application to the court on notice to the lienor may be made to apportion such expenses if an agreement on such amount cannot be reached.

This reinforces the understanding that § 29(1) provides a judicial remedy—by motion in the third-party court—when the parties cannot agree on the carrier’s share of litigation expenses.

VI. Legal Reasoning of the Court

A. Consent to Settlement: Applying § 29(5) and McComber

1. The “Statutory Amount of Compensation Benefits”

Workers’ Compensation Law § 29(5) is intended to protect carriers from prejudice where a claimant’s settlement with a third-party tortfeasor could be inadequate to fully fund both:

the carrier’s lien for past benefits, and

the carrier’s exposure for future benefits.

Under the now-settled interpretation from McComber, carrier consent is required only when the settlement is for less than the full statutory amount of workers’ compensation benefits that might be payable over the life of the claim.

In a death case such as Rorapaugh, this involves projecting:

the weekly death benefits payable (typically two-thirds of wages, subject to statutory caps), and

the claimant’s life expectancy (or other statutory duration),

to arrive at the total expected present value of the workers’ compensation obligation.

2. Applying the Consent Threshold in Rorapaugh

The Board determined, based on “credible evidence of claimant's age and life expectancy,” that the full value of her lifetime death benefits was about $1.2 million. The Appellate Division accepted this factual finding.

The Board further found that claimant’s net third-party recovery (after fees and costs) was about $5.9 million—almost five times the projected value of her compensation benefits.

The carrier argued that claimant might live beyond her statistical life expectancy, and thus the actual benefits payable could exceed the projected $1.2 million. The Court rejected this argument as insufficient to trigger the consent requirement:

Even if, as the carrier argues, claimant lives beyond her estimated life expectancy, given the significant disparity between what she would collect in benefits in her lifetime and the $5.9 million she received in the settlement, the carrier's consent to the settlement agreement was not necessary.

The Court thus signaled that:

Speculative possibilities that the claimant might outlive life expectancy do not defeat the conclusion that a settlement many times greater than the projected benefit adequately protects the carrier’s interest.

The standard is a practical, comparative one: when the settlement far exceeds the (reasonably estimated) statutory benefit exposure, consent is not required.

B. Jurisdiction to Apportion Litigation Expenses: § 29(1) and the Board’s Role

1. The Statutory Text and Judicial Role

The Court focuses closely on the text of Workers’ Compensation Law § 29(1), which:

gives the carrier a lien on the third-party recovery for past benefits paid;

authorizes the claimant to apply “to the court in which the third-party action was instituted” for equitable apportionment of litigation expenses; and

mandates that “[s]uch expenditures shall be equitably apportioned by the court between the [claimant] and the lienor.”

The Court emphasizes earlier holdings that:

Under the statute, then, the ultimate determination of the equitable apportionment of legal expenses resides in the courts vested with the powers of fact finding and the exercise of a sound discretion.

(citing Stenson and Kelly).

2. The Board’s Lack of Jurisdiction in Rorapaugh

The Workers’ Compensation Board had taken the position that it could calculate the carrier’s equitable share of litigation expenses (and therefore determine that the carrier’s share exceeded its lien, requiring a fresh money payment of $113,631.55).

The Appellate Division disagreed, focusing on two elements:

The explicit statutory directive that apportionment be made by the court in which the third-party action was instituted (here, the District Court for the Northern District of New York); and

The claimant’s failure to obtain the carrier’s consent to the settlement agreement.

The Court concluded:

In light of the statutory language of Workers' Compensation Law § 29 (1) and the failure of claimant to obtain the carrier's consent to the settlement agreement, we conclude that her only recourse in obtaining the equitable apportionment of her legal expenses in the third-party action is to move for such an order in District Court (see Burns, 9 NY3d at 214; Kelly, 60 NY2d at 138; Becker, 43 NY2d 527, 544 [1978]); compare Stenson, 84 AD3d at 26).

From this, the Court draws the controlling jurisdictional conclusion:

Accordingly, under these circumstances, the Board does not have jurisdiction to determine the equitable apportionment of claimant's costs and expenses, and its finding that claimant be awarded $113,631.55 in fresh money must be reversed.

Thus, the Court holds that the Board cannot stand in for the third-party court in performing a Kelly/Burns apportionment when:

no carrier consent was obtained, and

no judicial apportionment order has been made by the court in which the third-party action was instituted.

3. The Role of the Pennsylvania Orphans’ Court (Footnote 3)

The record showed that claimant had also petitioned the Court of Common Pleas of York County, Pennsylvania Orphans’ Court Division for approval of the $9 million wrongful death settlement and allocation among:

claimant,

decedent’s heirs, and

claimant’s attorneys.

The Orphans’ Court granted that petition. However, the Appellate Division notes in footnote 3:

Insofar, however, as the court was not the one in which the third-party action was instituted, it does not satisfy the requirements of Workers' Compensation Law § 29 (1).

This underscores that for purposes of New York’s workers’ compensation lien and cost apportionment:

Approval by another court (even one overseeing wrongful death settlement and distribution in another state) is not a substitute for the specific § 29(1) apportionment by the court where the New York third-party action was actually brought.

4. The Jurisdictional Trap: Dismissal Before § 29(1) Motion

The procedural history reveals a practical problem:

The District Court had already dismissed the third-party action, without being told that a settlement was reached.

It later refused to issue a compromise order under § 29(5) for lack of jurisdiction (fn. 1).

Yet the Appellate Division now says claimant’s only recourse for equitable apportionment of litigation expenses is to “move for such an order in District Court.”

The opinion does not address directly how the District Court might reacquire jurisdiction over the dismissed action (e.g., via a motion to reopen, modification of the dismissal order, or reliance on ancillary jurisdiction). Nonetheless, for New York law purposes, only that court can issue the § 29(1) apportionment order; the Workers’ Compensation Board may not.

This creates a strong cautionary lesson for practitioners: do not stipulate to dismissal of the third-party action before obtaining the necessary § 29(1) and § 29(5) orders, or at least ensuring the court retains jurisdiction to enter them.

VII. Complex Concepts Simplified

A. What is a “Lien” in this Context?

When a workers’ compensation carrier pays benefits, and the claimant later recovers money from a negligent third party, the carrier has a lien on the recovery. This means:

The claimant must use part of the third-party recovery to reimburse the carrier for the benefits already paid.

The lien amount is simply: all compensation and medical payments made up to the time of the recovery.

B. What is the “Future Benefits Offset”?

After a third-party recovery, the claimant typically ends up with a “net” recovery (after fees, costs, and lien reimbursement). Under § 29(4):

The carrier can stop or reduce paying future workers’ compensation benefits until the claimant’s net recovery is used up (in theory).

During this period, the third-party settlement, not the carrier, is effectively paying the claimant’s loss of earnings and other compensable losses.

This future credit is a substantial benefit to the carrier; it is part of what must be considered in apportioning litigation costs.

C. What is “Equitable Apportionment of Litigation Expenses”?

Litigation expenses include:

attorney’s fees (often one-third or 40% contingency),

court costs, and

other necessary expenses (experts, discovery, etc.).

The principle from Kelly and § 29(1) is that when a claimant’s lawsuit benefits the carrier (through lien reimbursement and future offset), the carrier should pay a proportionate share of those expenses. This prevents the carrier from receiving a “free ride.”

“Equitable apportionment” is thus:

a fair division of litigation expenses between claimant and carrier,

based on the relative economic benefit each receives from the third-party recovery.

D. What is “Fresh Money”?

“Fresh money” is shorthand used in workers’ compensation practice for a situation where:

The carrier’s fair share of litigation expenses (based on its total benefit) is greater than its lien for past payments.

In that case, after applying the carrier’s share of expenses against the lien, there is a remainder that the carrier must pay the claimant—money the claimant would not otherwise receive from the recovery itself.

In Rorapaugh, the Board concluded that:

lien = $109,402.81; and

carrier’s share of litigation expenses = $223,934.36.

Because the latter exceeded the former by $113,631.55, the Board ordered the carrier to pay that difference as “fresh money.” The Appellate Division reversed this, not because “fresh money” is conceptually improper, but because the Board lacked jurisdiction to decide the apportionment at all.

E. What is a “Compromise Order” Under § 29(5)?

If a settlement is for less than the total statutory amount of compensation benefits, § 29(5) requires either:

the carrier’s written consent to the settlement, or

in lieu of consent, a court order approving (“compromising”) the settlement.

This order is often referred to as a “compromise order.” It is typically obtained from the court overseeing the third-party action. In Rorapaugh, the District Court refused to issue such an order because the case had already been dismissed and it deemed itself without jurisdiction (fn. 1).

VIII. Impact and Practical Implications

A. Clarifying When Carrier Consent is Unnecessary

Rorapaugh reinforces and slightly refines the consent rule under § 29(5):

Consent is not required when the third-party settlement substantially exceeds the full projected statutory benefits.

Courts are willing to rely on reasonable life expectancy projections and will not be swayed by highly speculative arguments that the claimant might dramatically outlive those projections—especially when the settlement is multiple times larger than the projected benefits.

For practitioners:

In high-value settlements (like the $9 million gross / $5.9 million net recovery here), carrier consent may not be a legal prerequisite to preserving continuing compensation rights.

However, counsel should still carefully document the calculation of the statutory benefit value and consider proactively addressing this with the carrier to avoid later disputes.

B. A Firm Line on Jurisdiction: Only the Third-Party Court Can Apportion Litigation Expenses

The decision has significant implications for the division of authority between:

the Workers’ Compensation Board, and

the courts where third-party suits are filed.

Key takeaways:

Equitable apportionment of litigation expenses under § 29(1) is a judicial function. The statute explicitly assigns it to “the court in which the third-party action was instituted.”

The Workers’ Compensation Board cannot unilaterally fill this role, at least where there is no carrier consent and no prior judicial apportionment order.

Without a court order apportioning litigation expenses, the Board must treat the lien and credit calculations accordingly—likely giving the carrier the benefit of a full lien and credit until a judicial apportionment order is entered.

Practically, this means:

When settling a third-party action, claimant’s counsel must address apportionment with the court before dismissal, either by:

obtaining a specific § 29(1) Kelly/Burns order apportioning costs, or

embedding an apportionment determination in the settlement approval order.

Relying on the Workers’ Compensation Board to later adjust for the carrier’s share of costs risks leaving the claimant without a remedy, especially if the third-party action has already been dismissed.

C. Implications for Federal Courts and Multi-Jurisdictional Settlements

The third-party action here was in federal court (NDNY), and additional approval was obtained from a Pennsylvania Orphans’ Court. The Appellate Division’s treatment has several implications:

Federal courts hearing New York-based third-party actions must be prepared to entertain § 29(1) motions for apportionment of litigation expenses.

Parties should ensure that any stipulation of dismissal expressly:

acknowledges the existence of a settlement, and

either (a) attaches the § 29(1) order, or (b) retains the court’s jurisdiction to enter such an order.

Approval orders from other courts—such as a Pennsylvania Orphans’ Court order approving a wrongful death settlement and distribution—do not satisfy § 29(1). The apportionment must come from the court “in which the third-party action was instituted.”

D. Tension With Prior Administrative Practice and Stenson

Historically, the Workers’ Compensation Board has sometimes engaged in practical, formula-based implementation of Kelly/Burns apportionments in the absence of court orders, especially where the parties acquiesced or did not raise jurisdictional objections.

Rorapaugh marks a firm doctrinal clarification:

Even if the Board can administer the consequences of a Kelly/Burns apportionment (e.g., by calculating future credits once a judicial apportionment is in place),

it cannot itself decide the equitable apportionment of litigation expenses when the parties disagree and no court order exists.

By citing Stenson and then saying “compare,” the Third Department indicates that:

Stenson should be read consistently with § 29(1)’s text and with Kelly/Burns,

rather than as granting the Board general authority to perform Kelly/Burns apportionments in disputed cases.

E. Procedural Best Practices Going Forward

For claimant’s counsel and carriers alike, Rorapaugh highlights several best practices:

Quantify the Statutory Benefit Exposure

Before settlement, calculate the projected total statutory workers’ compensation benefit exposure (using wage rate, statutory caps, and life expectancy). This is critical to:

determining whether carrier consent is legally required under § 29(5), and

negotiating with the carrier on consent issues if the settlement is near or below that threshold.

Secure § 29(1) and § 29(5) Orders Before Dismissal

Do not stipulate to dismissal of the third-party action before:

obtaining any necessary compromise order under § 29(5), and

obtaining a § 29(1) order apportioning litigation expenses (Kelly/Burns order), or ensuring the court retains jurisdiction to enter one.

Do Not Rely on the Board to Fix Apportionment Later

Given Rorapaugh, the Board cannot unilaterally determine equitable apportionment in contested cases. If no judicial apportionment order is obtained, the claimant may be left with:

a full lien,

a full future credit, and

no mechanism before the Board to compel the carrier to share litigation expenses.

Coordinate in Multi-State Situations

When wrongful death settlements require approval in another state’s court (e.g., an Orphans’ Court), ensure that this is in addition to, not in place of, a § 29(1) motion in the New York (or federal) court where the third-party action is pending.

IX. Broader Doctrinal Significance

Matter of Rorapaugh v New Penn Motor Express LLC does not radically change New York law, but it significantly clarifies and sharpens existing doctrines in two ways:

Consent Threshold in High-Value Settlements

The case reinforces that § 29(5) consent is a protective device for carriers in cases of inadequate settlements, not a veto power they can exercise over generous settlements that substantially exceed their statutory exposure. It underscores a pragmatic, comparative approach based on the magnitude of the settlement vs. projected benefits.

Exclusive Judicial Role in Kelly/Burns Apportionment

By holding that the Workers’ Compensation Board lacks jurisdiction to equitably apportion litigation expenses and award fresh money, the court:

reaffirms the centrality of § 29(1)’s directive that apportionment be performed by the court where the third-party action was instituted; and

places responsibility squarely on litigants and the third-party court to address and resolve apportionment issues at the time of settlement or shortly thereafter.

The decision thus streamlines the division of labor:

Courts (state or federal, depending on where the third-party action was filed) decide:

whether to approve compromise settlements when required, and

how to equitably apportion litigation expenses between claimant and carrier.

The Workers’ Compensation Board applies and administers:

the carrier’s lien and credit consistent with § 29 and any court orders, and

continuing benefit entitlements, classifications, and rates, subject to the carrier’s lien and offset rights.

X. Conclusion

Matter of Rorapaugh v New Penn Motor Express LLC is a significant Third Department decision that:

reaffirms that carrier consent under Workers’ Compensation Law § 29(5) is required only when a third-party settlement is less than the total statutory workers’ compensation benefits potentially payable, and

holds that the Workers’ Compensation Board lacks jurisdiction to equitably apportion litigation expenses and award fresh money under § 29(1); such apportionment must be sought by motion in the court where the third-party action was instituted.

For practitioners, the decision offers both comfort and caution:

Comfort in knowing that high-value settlements that substantially exceed projected benefit exposures will not be undone for lack of carrier consent.

Caution that failure to secure a § 29(1) apportionment order before the third-party action is dismissed may leave the claimant without any administrative forum to enforce the carrier’s obligation to share litigation costs.

In the broader legal context, Rorapaugh consolidates the Court of Appeals’ Kelly/Brisson/Burns line and aligns Third Department practice with the statutory text of § 29. It underscores that equitable sharing of litigation costs is a judicial responsibility, while the Board’s role is to administer the resulting liens, credits, and benefits within the workers’ compensation system.",https://www.casemine.com/images/casemine-share.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 11:58:30.645911

A 2-1 panel of the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit declined to put on hold the central part of a ruling by a lower-court judge who had found that the administration’s policies violated the due process rights of immigrants who could be apprehended anywhere in the US.

The US district judge Jia Cobb in an 29 August ruling sided with an immigrant rights group and blocked the US Department of Homeland Security from enforcing policies that exposed immigrants to the risk of rapid expulsion if the administration believed they had been in the country for less than two years.

The administration asked the DC circuit to stay that ruling while it appealed.

But the US circuit judges Patricia Millett and J Michelle Childs said the administration was unlikely to succeed in showing that its systems and procedures adequately protected immigrants’ due process rights under the US constitution’s fifth amendment.

The judges, both appointees of Democratic presidents, cited “serious risks of erroneous summary removal” posed by the administration’s effort to expand the fast-track deportation process away from the borders to cover the entire US.

While the court largely left Cobb’s order in place, it stayed part of it to the extent it required changes to how immigration authorities determine whether someone has a credible fear of being sent back to their country of origin.

US circuit judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, dissented and called Cobb’s ruling “impermissible judicial interference”.

The department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The administration’s appeal on the merits is scheduled to be heard on 9 December.

The Department of Homeland Security’s proposed rule on “public charge,” buried in the Federal Register, would rescind the 2022 Biden-era protections and replace them with something far more dangerous: a blank check for immigration officers to deny green cards based on virtually any government benefit use, without clear standards to guide them.​​

DHS openly acknowledged in its own analysis that “over 400,000 eligible individuals could forgo or disenroll[sic]” from these vital health programs out of fear—and the administration is counting on exactly that.​​

The mechanism is discretion without guardrails. Instead of spelling out new rules like the first Trump administration did in 2019, this proposal does something potentially worse: it eliminates the definition of “public charge” altogether and tells officers to rely on future “interpretive guidance” that won’t require public comment. That means immigration officers could consider “any means-tested public benefit” of “any duration” when deciding whether to approve or deny someone’s path to permanent residence.​​

The consequences are deliberately vague. An officer could weigh against an applicant their use of Medicaid, CHIP, food stamps, housing assistance, or even services related to communicable disease testing. DHS signals the agency may even consider family members’ use of benefits—a direct reversal of longstanding practice—and new guidance from the State Department has already expanded scrutiny to include obesity and chronic illnesses as potential factors in public charge determinations.​​

“This is designed to create confusion and uncertainty,” immigrant rights advocates warn, and they’re right. Without clear standards, immigration decisions become arbitrary and politically malleable. Two people in identical circumstances could face opposite outcomes depending on the officer reviewing their file.​

The comment period closes December 19 … just weeks away. DHS said a final rule could materialize as soon as 30 days after, meaning early 2026 could see this take effect.​

Congressional and Political Context

The proposed rule emerges during a period of unprecedented, federalized xenophobia under the second Trump administration. Immigration lawyers note that DHS used the same approach during the 2019 public charge rule—then got blocked by federal courts three times before the Supreme Court intervened. The precedent is grim.​

Yet this proposal goes even further. Where the 2019 rule at least spelled out which benefits counted and which didn’t, this one deliberately leaves that to officer discretion. This will doubtless cause a chilling effect among many who would otherwise legally receive these benefits, including U.S. citizen children in mixed-status households.

One legal analysis found that between 2.0 and 4.7 million people left Medicaid and CHIP after the Trump administration’s previous public charge rule. Research from KFF shows that immigrant families are already frightened. Between 2023 and 2025, the share of immigrant adults skipping or postponing health care jumped from 22% to 29%, with 19% citing immigration-related concerns. This proposed rule would likely turbocharge that trend.​

Public health experts paint a bleak picture. DHS’s own regulatory analysis acknowledges the rule could lead to worse health outcomes, increased emergency room use, higher prevalence of communicable diseases, increased uncompensated care, and rising poverty and housing instability. The Centers for Disease Control has flagged the danger: chilling effects on benefit use during health emergencies could spark outbreaks of preventable disease.​

On Capitol Hill, the reception has been predictably partisan. Democratic senators like Alex Padilla, ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, have made clear their opposition to benefit restrictions targeting immigrants. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has signaled opposition to expanded immigration enforcement that creates bureaucratic barriers. But with Republicans controlling Congress, legislative salvation for the current rule appears unlikely.​

The Interpretive Guidance Gambit

What makes this proposal particularly troubling is its use of “interpretive guidance” rather than formal rule-making. Once DHS rescinds the 2022 rule, it plans to issue new instructions to immigration officers through subregulatory guidance, thereby sidestepping the Administrative Procedure Act’s requirement for notice and mandatory comment period on major policy changes.​

This is deliberate. Under formal rule-making, the public gets to comment, courts can review the reasoning, and legal challenges must grapple with an agency’s statutory interpretation. Guidance can be issued quietly, with minimal process, making it harder to challenge in court.

Advocates worry that officers will eventually tell applicants that obesity, diabetes, or family members’ SNAP use counts against them—and when lawsuits follow, DHS will claim these are mere guidelines, not binding rules, and therefore not subject to the same level of judicial scrutiny.

What’s at Stake

For the migrant community and beyond, the stakes could hardly be higher. The 2022 rule—which limited public charge to consideration of cash assistance and long-term institutional care—provided clarity and protected millions. Rescinding it without a replacement creates a legal and moral vacuum.

The proposed rule signals that this administration intends to use public charge not as a narrow tool to identify truly dependent individuals, but as a broad discretionary weapon to discourage benefit use across immigrant populations. The $9 billion in projected savings tells the real story: this is about cutting government spending on vulnerable people, not about fiscal responsibility or immigration law.

""On Nov. 22, ICE conducted a targeted operation in lower Manhattan to arrest Abdou Tall, an illegal alien from Senegal and criminal with multiple arrests relating to trafficking counterfeit merchandise,"" DHS said in a statement, in part.

DHS says Tall fled from agents for several blocks before tripping, falling and continuing to resist arrest before ultimately being apprehended. The department claims the NYPD failed to turn Tall over to ICE last month when he was arrested for felony trademark counterfeiting.

""This entire incident could have been prevented had the NYPD simply honor our ICE detainer after they arrested Tall on Oct. 7 for felony trademark counterfeiting. But instead of turning him over to ICE custody, they released this criminal illegal alien back into the community where he immediately resumed his criminal activity leading to a second NYPD arrest for felony trademark counterfeiting on Oct. 11. This time he was released by NYPD before ICE could even lodge a detainer,"" the DHS statement continued.

NY1 has reached out to the NYPD for a response.

Earlier Saturday, the NYPD had said officers were on the scene conducting routine vendor enforcement near Canal Street and Broadway when ICE agents arrived around noon.

""Federal agents appeared at the location unrelated to any NYPD activity. NYPD personnel immediately left the area and did not interact with federal agents in any manner,"" the NYPD said prior to DHS's statement.

Police sources say the NYPD was not given any prior notice.

She is also pregnant and relies on her car to get to and from prenatal doctor’s appointments.","Satima Flaherty was working from her West Oakland home on Wednesday when she heard tires screeching and a loud smash outside her door.

She rushed to her front window, assuming there had been a car crash — and hoped it didn’t involve hers.

“I go outside, I look, it’s my car,” she recalled. “I was almost in tears.”

Flaherty said she saw an older man, who appeared to be limping, get out of the grey Dodge Charger that rammed into the front of her black Honda and take off down the street.

At first, she thought it had been a typical hit-and-run until neighbors informed her that the officers on scene were federal immigration officials who had been following the man.

The collision occurred after 9 a.m. Wednesday morning, shortly before reports that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents had been spotted conducting a targeted enforcement operation nearby Hoover Elementary School.

The commotion led to secure lockout procedures at Hoover and Harriet Tubman Child Development Center and standard protocol for ICE activity at other nearby Oakland Unified School District sites.

According to Councilmember Carroll Fife, the targeted man had been dropping a child off at school that morning when he was “chased by masked men,” believed to be ICE officers.

The crash came just months after Oakland loosened its vehicle chase policies for local law enforcement, reversing restrictions from 2022 intended to protect bystanders during high-speed pursuits. Oakland’s rules don’t apply to state and federal agencies, including ICE and the Department of Homeland Security. The speed at which the agents and the pursued vehicle were traveling is unknown.

Flaherty said that when she went outside to check on her car, she approached the agents, who were searching through the Dodge. They told her that Oakland Police would follow up on the incident and drove away, she said, guessing they were still in pursuit of the man they had aimed to detain.

“It left me with a huge amount of damage and no accountability,” she said.

The front bumper of Flaherty’s car was completely totaled and undrivable, she said.

She filed a police report with OPD later that day, but said she hasn’t been contacted. In a statement on Wednesday, OPD said it was investigating the collision.

“It’s kind of like I’m just left dangling here,” Flaherty told KQED. “It’s going to be a setback, especially during the holidays.”

The 38-year-old Oakland native, who lives with her nine-year-old daughter and mother, said she doesn’t have a reliable way to take her child to school or visit the clients she serves as a social worker. She is also pregnant and relies on her car to get to and from prenatal doctor’s appointments.

Her mother has a car, but it isn’t in reliable condition, she said.

Flaherty said Fife offered to help her get reimbursed for a rental car, but she doesn’t have one yet. Instead, she’s used Uber to travel to and from her daughter’s school at pick-up and drop-off and took Thursday off from work.

She has insurance and said she’s begun the claim process, but isn’t expecting to get enough compensation to replace the car. She started a fundraiser on GoFundMe asking neighbors to help her raise money to purchase a new vehicle in the meantime.

She said she wanted to be able to be independent again, but didn’t want to see the driver get in trouble.

“It caused a huge setback for me, but for me, it’s material stuff and for him, it’s his life. When he was running, he was running for his life,” she said.",https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/11/HooverElementaryGetty.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 18:57:41.255271

Two Mexican immigrants — who had long made their homes in Orange County and were sent to the Adelanto ICE Processing Center north of Hesperia — were among the deaths.

Ayala-Uribe’s relatives and members of Congress have alleged that he was denied proper medical care after being taken into ICE custody in August.
Adelanto detention staff members were aware of his medical crisis, according to internal emails obtained by The Times.","Southern California lawmakers are demanding answers from U.S. Homeland Security officials following the deaths of two Orange County residents and nearly two dozen others while in federal immigration custody.

In a letter Friday to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, U.S. Reps. Dave Min (D-Irvine) and Judy Chu (D-Pasadena) pointed to the deaths of 25 people so far this year while being held by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The number of in-custody deaths has reached an annual record since the agency began keeping track in 2018.

Two Mexican immigrants — who had long made their homes in Orange County and were sent to the Adelanto ICE Processing Center north of Hesperia — were among the deaths.

“These are not just numbers on a website, but real people — with families, jobs, and hopes and dreams — each of whom died in ICE custody,” the lawmakers wrote. “The following cases illustrate systemic patterns of delayed treatment, neglect, and failure to properly notify families.”

Ismael Ayala-Uribe, 39, died Sept. 22 about a month after being apprehended while working at the Fountain Valley Auto Wash, where he had worked for 15 years, according to a GoFundMe post by his family.

He had lived in Westminster since he was 4 years old, and had previously been protected from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. The Times previously reported that his application for continued protection was not renewed in 2016.

Ayala-Uribe’s relatives and members of Congress have alleged that he was denied proper medical care after being taken into ICE custody in August. Adelanto detention staff members were aware of his medical crisis, according to internal emails obtained by The Times. But Ayala-Uribe initially was taken back to his Adelanto dorm room, where he waited for another three days before being moved to Victor Valley Global Medical Center in Victorville.

ICE officials acknowledged that Ayala-Uribe died at the Victorville hospital while waiting for surgery for an abscess on his buttock. The suspected cause of the sore was not disclosed.

Ayala-Uribe’s cause of death is under investigation, ICE has previously said.

A second man — Gabriel Garcia-Aviles, 56, who lived near Costa Mesa — died Oct. 23, about a week after being detained.

ICE said Garcia-Aviles was arrested Oct. 14 in Santa Ana by the U.S. Border Patrol for an outstanding warrant, and eventually sent to the Adelanto center. ICE said in a previous statement that he was only at the Adelanto facility for a few hours before he was taken to the Victorville hospital for “suspected alcohol withdrawal symptoms.”

His condition rapidly worsened.

The deaths have focused attention on the treatment of detained immigrants as well as long-standing concerns about medical care inside Adelanto, one of the largest federal immigration detention centers in California. The situation raises broader concerns about whether immigration detention centers throughout the country are equipped to care for the deluge of people rounded up since President Trump prioritized mass deportations as part of his second-term agenda.

“These deaths raise serious questions about ICE’s ability to comply with basic detention standards, medical care protocols, and notification requirements, and underscore a pattern of gross negligence that demands immediate accountability,” Min and Chu wrote in the letter to Noem and Todd M. Lyons, the acting director of ICE.

The letter was signed by 43 other lawmakers, including Reps. Robert Garcia (D-Long Beach), J. Luis Correa (D-Santa Ana), John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove) and Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles).

An ICE representative did not immediately respond to an email Saturday seeking comment.

The lawmakers stressed the need to treat the immigrants with humanity.

The lawmakers said Garcia-Aviles had lived in the U.S. for three decades. His family did not learn of his dire medical condition until “he was on his deathbed.” Family members drove to the hospital to find him “unconscious, intubated, and . . . [with] dried blood on his forehead” as well as “a cut on his tongue ... broken teeth and bruising on his body.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/140a9fc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+213/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8a%2F61%2Ffa79dd494d88b87d72c8fccc9807%2F1510618-me-adelanto-ice-detention-center-06-mjc.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 18:57:14.880483

On Tuesday, White House border czar Tom Homan announced the plans for operations during an interview with Fox News. Homan said he previously had an agreement with Mayor Eric Adams to use Rikers Island as part of the operations, but that those plans were halted by the city council.

“So, we’re going to be coming to New York City,” he said. “We’re already there now. I mean, teams are there now.”

Homan added that New York City is a self-described “sanctuary city” and that it has had an “issue there with public safety threats in the streets every day.”

One area of the city that is expected to see a surge in federal agents is Canal Street, which has previously been the site of immigration operations. The street has been linked to vendors selling knockoff handbags, designer clothing or bags that folks like to pick up on the cheap. In October, ICE announced it had made nine arrests during a Canal Street operation, and a majority of those individuals were from West Africa.

Meanwhile, the New York Immigration Coalition released footage this week of an ICE raid on a home in Queens that happened on November 13. The organization claims the agents did not identify themselves or provide a warrant, and then pointed guns at a mom and her four children. The coalition also notes that ICE was looking for a person who did not live at that address. DHS denies that it did anything wrong. 911 calls were made because neighbors thought this was a home invasion, which led to confusion, where two NYPD officers suffered minor injuries in that scuffle.

On Friday, President Trump and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani met for what they later called a “productive” meeting at the White House. Following the meeting, Trump and Mamdani told reporters that they both wish to address crime.

In the past, the president has threatened to withhold funding from the city if Mamdani were elected. Meanwhile, Mamdani has been a vocal critic of ICE’s expanded raids in the city, as well as the Trump administration’s surge in deportations.

“The concerns that many New Yorkers have are around the enforcement of immigration laws on New Yorkers across the five boroughs, and most recently, we’re talking about a mother and her two children, how this has very little to do with what that is,” Mamdani said.

Trump followed this comment with a statement of his own.

“What we did is we discussed crime more than ICE, per se, we discussed crime, and he doesn’t want to see crime, and I don’t want to see crime, and I have very little doubt that we’re not going to get along on that issue,” Trump said.",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/11/immigration_ice_12062025_AP25157540699407_04dfc5-e1755451111380_f4d7f4.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-22 21:56:35.519964

Why did Marjorie Taylor Greene resign?","Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene said Nov. 21 she will resign from her post in January, an announcement that is shocking supporters in her district.

Her decision comes after she publicly opposed policies of President Donald Trump, whom she has often supported, and Trump withdrew his endorsement of her.

""My self-worth is not defined by a man but instead by God, who created everything in existence,"" Greene said.

Here are a few things to know about Greene.

Who is Marjorie Taylor Greene?

Greene, 51, grew up outside of Atlanta. She attended the University of Georgia and went on to be part-owner in her father's construction company and then co-owner of a CrossFit gym. She has three grown children.

Loyalists who know her describe her as kind, intelligent, and maternal. Her constituents say she fights for them. But she also earned a firebrand reputation for heckling President Joe Biden and otherwise sparring with her liberal colleagues.

What state is Marjorie Taylor Greene from?

Greene is from Georgia. She represents the 14th Congressional District, which is in the northwest area of the state and mostly includes rural areas. It is a heavily Republican district whose elections are usually decided in the primary.

What are Marjorie Taylor Greene's politics?

Greene is considered far-right. She subscribes to a mantle called America First that supports isolationist foreign policy and promotes a focus on domestic issues. The philosophy goes hand in hand with Make America Great Again, or MAGA.

Greene has voted against funding foreign wars in Ukraine and Gaza. She opposes transgender women playing in girls' sports, supports hardline immigration policies and supports policies that help working-class Americans.

What happened with Marjorie Taylor Greene and Donald Trump?

Greene spent more than a month doing television interviews in which she publicly disagreed with the president, despite her longtime support of him. She also vocally and forcefully advocated for a bill Trump opposed to force the release of law enforcement files on sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

On Nov. 14, Trump withdrew his endorsement of her and encouraged people in her district to challenge her in the 2026 Republican primary. Greene said this lead to threats against her, and that she feared for her safety. She also responded to the nickname ""traitor"" by saying a traitor is someone who prioritizes foreign countries.

Why did Marjorie Taylor Greene resign?

In a social media video, Greene described how frustrated she was with trying to get things done in Washington for ordinary people. She said she did not want to put her constituents through a bruising primary battle against a Trump-supported candidate. But she also said she was leaving to spend time with her family.

“I missed precious time with my family that I can never get back,” Greene said. She said she had to leave her mother's side while her father was having brain surgery to remove a cancer in order to go to Congress and vote against Trump's impeachment.

What did Donald Trump say about Marjorie Taylor Greene's resignation?

Trump told ABC News that Americans should be happy Greene is resigning. ""I think it's great news for the country,"" he said ""It's great.""

While two have had a close relationship in the past, including phone conversations, Trump told ABC News that Greene did not tell him before making her announcement. ""Nah, it doesn't matter, you know, but I think it's great,"" Trump said. ""I think she should be happy.""","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/22/USAT/87408118007-20251122-t-014957-z-336255528-rc-2-d-1-iawl-7-ae-rtrmadp-3-usatrumpgreene.JPG?crop=3016,1696,x7,y0&width=3016&height=1696&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-22 18:57:18.761707

US President Donald Trump on Friday said he was immediately terminating temporary deportation protections for Somalis living in Minnesota, accelerating the end of a program that began in 1991 under another Republican president.

""Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing,"" Trump said in a late-night post on Truth Social, without providing any further explanation or evidence.

""I am, as President of the United States, hereby terminating, effective immediately, the Temporary Protected Status (TPS Program) for Somalis in Minnesota,"" he said.

Trump clashes with Governor Tim Walz

Trump called Minnesota a ""hub of fraudulent money laundering activity"" under Democratic Governor Tim Walz, an apparent response to unverified media reports, shared by several Republican lawmakers, that the Al-Shabaab militant group in Somalia had benefited from fraud committed in Minnesota.

Walz responded on X, saying, ""It’s not surprising that the President has chosen to broadly target an entire community. This is what he does to change the subject.""

The TPS program for Somalis was launched by then-President George H.W. Bush in September 1991. It grants government protection to eligible foreign-born individuals who cannot return home safely due to civil war or natural disasters.

Seventeen countries are eligible, but the Trump administration has announced it is terminating TPS designations for several, including Venezuela and Nicaragua.

The administration of Trump's Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, extended the eligibility for Somalis through March 17, 2026. Most of the Somalis in Minnesota are US citizens, and there are only 705 Somali-born individuals nationwide who have TPS status, according to a report by the non-partisan Congressional Research Service.

By comparison, over 330,000 Haitians have TPS status, along with over 170,000 people from El Salvador.

Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Minnesota, said Trump's decision was disappointing given that the Somalis in question were legal migrants, adding that Trump's move could tear families apart.

""These are legal immigrants, and they should not suffer as a consequence of a political football that's being played against the Muslim community. These individuals have been following the law,"" he said.

Abshir Omar, a political strategist who endorsed Trump in the 2024 presidential election, said he expected the decision to be challenged in court. He said it could harm the long-term economic and strategic relationship with Somalia, which in March offered the US exclusive control of air bases and ports, and has expressed interest in partnerships with US firms to explore its large oil reserves.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/jerusalem_post_articles_818/16e25a38d057edc64786b205e3a11eac,N,,2025-11-23 02:57:42.209233

The fight over the Texas map is also the latest in a string of voting and elections-related challenges facing the justices.
In October, they heard a challenge to Louisiana’s congressional voting map.","The Supreme Court on Friday evening temporarily allowed Texas to use its newly redrawn, Republican-friendly congressional voting map for the 2026 midterm elections.

The decision blocked, for now, a lower-court ruling that had said Texas could not use the map. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., who is assigned to handle emergency applications from that region of the country, issued the administrative stay, a temporary ruling meant to give the full court time to consider the issue.

The Texas attorney general earlier in the evening had filed an emergency application with the justices, asking them to allow the state to use the new map.

Justice Alito requested that the civil rights groups that had challenged the map respond to the attorney general’s request by Monday at 5 p.m., signaling the court would likely consider the issue speedily.

Texas sought the justices’ intervention after a panel of federal judges in El Paso on Tuesday blocked the map from going into effect in time for the elections, a setback for an aggressive push by Texas Republicans and President Trump to flip Democratic seats in the state.

By a vote of 2 to 1, the divided panel had sided with the civil rights organizations, arguing it was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. In the court’s ruling, Judge Jeffrey V. Brown of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, a Trump appointee, wrote that “substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 map.”

In the 160-page ruling, the judges blocked the use of the new map while litigation continues over its legality. In the meantime, they ordered the state to use a map enacted by the Texas Legislature in 2021 for the November 2026 elections.

Texas’ Republican-controlled State Legislature redrew its map this summer, creating five new Republican-favored seats as part of a strategy by Mr. Trump to block Democrats from taking control of the House of Representatives.

After the court ruling, Texas’ attorney general, Ken Paxton, announced that the state would appeal to the Supreme Court. In a statement, Mr. Paxton said he fully expected “the court to uphold Texas’ sovereign right to engage in partisan redistricting.”

The Texas legal loss was the latest challenge for the president’s effort to redraw state congressional maps to favor Republicans in the lead-up to the midterms. Last week, Indiana Republicans rejected the president’s request that they redraw congressional districts.

The fight over the Texas map is also the latest in a string of voting and elections-related challenges facing the justices. In October, they heard a challenge to Louisiana’s congressional voting map. In that case, a group of white voters argued that the state’s new map, redrawn after the latest census to include a second majority-Black district, was an illegal racial gerrymander that violated the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection.

A decision in the case is expected by the end of June or early July, and it could shape how the court views the Texas challenge. In Texas, challengers have argued that even as lawmakers sought to create new districts to achieve a partisan advantage, they in fact gerrymandered based on race.

The nationwide push to redraw congressional maps ahead of the midterms is highly unusual, breaking from decades of settled norms around the process for carving up legislative districts. The drive by the president has set off a race in states throughout the country. This month, California voters approved an aggressive plan to redraw the state’s congressional districts, potentially flipping five Republican seats, a major victory for Democrats. That map has also been challenged in court.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/19/multimedia/00dc-scotus-texasvote-bctf/00dc-scotus-texasvote-bctf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 16:57:15.812978

“If not for the intervention of a Superior Court judge, who insisted that ICE had wrongfully identified his intern as their target, this young person would have been taken into ICE custody,” the judiciary said.

Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos, Gov. Dan McKee, U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, the Rhode Island Bar Association and more have spoken out against the tactics ICE used when detaining the student, and some have said that the incident shows the need for virtual court hearings.

Here's what we know about the incident:

ICE agents were seen inside the courthouse and approached by court security

The Rhode Island Judiciary confirmed that ICE agents were seen inside the courthouse taking pictures of the 16-year-old intern. They were approached by court security and were directed to follow the court rules.

Agents threatened to break judge's car windows to apprehend teen

Judge McBurney took the intern into his car while asserting to ICE that they had the wrong person, a Judiciary spokesperson confirmed. They then surrounded McBurney's car with the teenager inside and threatened to break the windows.

At McBurney's insistence that they were making a mistake, ICE agents checked their information. The intern was released after officers confirmed they had misidentified the teen, according to the account.

A spokesman for ICE did not respond to a Journal inquiry.

ICE has frequently been seen outside RI courthouses

Deportation Defense Network of Rhode Island’s College Hill group has been patrolling outside courthouses for the presence of ICE and warning court users accordingly.

The Deportation Defense Network estimates that more than 20 people have been taken into custody by ICE outside state courthouses in Providence, Newport and at the Rhode Island Traffic Tribunal in Cranston since July – and ICE has been recently spotted outside the Garrahy Judicial Complex on Dorrance Street.

The Providence City Council and advocacy groups have also urged the judiciary to provide virtual court hearings in the city due to the increased presence of immigration officers around courthouses.

McBurney was praised for his actions

Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos offered praise for McBurney's actions in a statement:

""This high school student was spared being wrongfully taken into custody only because of the intervention of Superior Court Judge Joseph McBurney. To Judge McBurney, I offer sincere thanks on my own behalf and on behalf of our immigrant communities for using your position of power to prevent this,"" she said.

RI Supreme Court justice speaks out

“This egregious incident underscores both the community’s and the Judiciary’s concerns about how ICE is conducting its operations in Rhode Island,” state Supreme Court Chief Justice Paul A. Suttell said in a statement. “Given this climate, the Judiciary understands the call to implement remote hearings in Providence County, and beyond. The need to balance constitutional considerations, the public’s right of access, and the integrity of testimonial and evidentiary processes do not allow for a fully virtual court system.”

“What occurred today, however, reinforces the Judiciary’s need to focus on ways to enhance access to virtual hearings and to educate the public as to how to request such hearings,” Suttell continued. “The courts are here to serve the people and the Judiciary remains steadfast in preserving and augmenting access to justice for all persons.”

Other RI officials condemn ICE tactics

Gov. Dan McKee's office on Thursday also issued a statement condemning the intern's detention:

“Today, ICE agents wrongfully detained a high school intern outside the Superior Court – an outrageous and indefensible act that could have completely upended a young person’s life. Rhode Islanders should not have to fear federal agents operating with such reckless disregard for the law and human dignity. This was not a harmless mistake. It was the direct result of callous and chaotic policies by the Trump Administration. Moreover, ICE’s failure to exercise even a shred of due diligence is shameful and underscores just how broken and dangerous these federal policies are.

“I fully support the Judiciary’s commitment to enhance access to virtual hearings and promote safe access to the courts.”

Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos also responded.

""Yesterday's attempted abduction of a Rhode Island Superior Court intern by ICE drives home the danger of flooding our streets with masked thugs who can't tell the difference between a hardened criminal and a high school student. We must cease these rogue operations and allow law enforcement to be led by the local officers who actually know their community,"" Matos said in a statement.

And U.S. Rep. Seth Magaziner, ranking member of the Counterterrorism and Intelligence Subcommittee on the House Homeland Security Committee, called the incident ""yet another example of the disregard for civil liberties by immigration enforcement under the Trump Administration,"" and said he would ""continue to call out the Administration’s reckless actions, in Rhode Island and across the county.”

U.S. Sen. Jack Reed also issued a statement:

“The Trump administration refuses to accept we’re a nation of laws with a constitution that provide all of us with rights. Trump and his team’s tactics are jeopardizing public trust and public safety. Innocent people are being wrongfully targeted,"" Reed's office said in an emailed statement. ""We should not accept a bunch of masked armed individuals running rampant, ignoring the rules, and threatening innocent students and judges as routine law enforcement. Every day law enforcement across our state don their uniforms and display their badges proudly. The leadership of ICE and any unprofessional field agents must be held accountable for this type of outrageous incident. The pattern of too many ICE agents committing civil rights abuses and disregarding the law is very disturbing. We have to protect everyone’s rights and legal obligations. Failing to speak out against escalating authoritarian immigration enforcement tactics only invites the further use of these tactics against more Americans and the erosion of due process.”

And the Rhode Island Bar Association weighed in:

""Courthouses must remain spaces where the rule of law is respected, and where judges, court personnel, interns, lawyers, and members of the public can carry out their duties without fear of improper detention or intimidation,"" RIBA President Patrick A. Guida said in a statement. ""We commend Rhode Island Supreme Court Chief Justice Paul A. Suttell and the Rhode Island Judiciary for their measured response to this incident, including their ongoing efforts to maintain safe access to court proceedings and their careful expansion of virtual hearing options where appropriate.""

“If you are a legal professional, the Trump Administration is calling on YOU to join @TheJusticeDept as a Deportation Judge to restore integrity and honor to our Nation’s Immigration Court system,” said Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, on Thursday in a post on X.

The Department of Justice (DoJ), which oversees the nation’s immigration court system, also posted a recruitment ad, where prospective applicants can “become a deportation judge” and “define America for generations”.

While these advertisements use the phrase “deportation judge”, the government application portal still lists the official job title as “immigration judge”.

The justice department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.

Immigrants and asylum seekers appear before an immigration judge for several reasons, including to make their case for protection, attain lawful permanent residence or halt their proceedings while they pursue other immigration relief. But generally, people are before a judge because they are fighting their removal to their home country.

This year, the Trump administration has been purging immigration judges whose judicial philosophies do not align with the administration’s priorities. Some have also chosen to leave since Trump took office. Because of this, and an already backlogged court system, the government started recruiting hundreds of military lawyers to serve as immigration judges.

The recruitment of military lawyers came after the DoJ’s executive office for immigration review (EOIR) relaxed rules in August so that any lawyer could serve as a temporary immigration judge.

Two judges in New York, for example, were laid off after one of them had the highest rate in the city for granting asylum, and the other had been an outspoken critic of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). More terminations took place in San Francisco, Chicago and Boston, suggesting the Trump administration is targeting sanctuary cities.

The latest recruitment effort this week tells applicants that, if hired, they will have the power to “determine whether an alien has to leave the United States or gets to stay” and to “ensure that only aliens with legally meritorious claims are allowed to remain”.

The pay range is $159,951 to $207,500, Noem said on Thursday. A cash incentive is also provided for those in cities such as New York, Boston and San Francisco, according to the ad.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2014448158e21512132e60abe9501adcdbfbdf1e/292_0_2917_2334/master/2917.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8f2e5c30ae4c9dae99c10bb5339c3771",N,,2025-11-22 17:57:19.506396

In addition to challenging the state’s in-state tuition policy, the lawsuit argues that California unlawfully extends eligibility for scholarships and subsidized loans to undocumented students.
Among the defendants are the state, top California officials, and the state’s two public university systems: the University of California and California State University.
“Federal law prohibits aliens illegally present in the United States from receiving in-state tuition benefits that are denied to out-of-state US citizens,” reads the complaint.
The California State University system is the nation’s largest and among its most diverse, with more than 460,000 students.","The justice department sued California on Thursday for allowing undocumented college students to pay in-state tuition for public universities, alleging the policy harms US citizens.

The lawsuit, filed in the US district court for the eastern district of California, marks the third time this week that the Trump administration has sued California. In addition to challenging the state’s in-state tuition policy, the lawsuit argues that California unlawfully extends eligibility for scholarships and subsidized loans to undocumented students.

Among the defendants are the state, top California officials, and the state’s two public university systems: the University of California and California State University.

“Federal law prohibits aliens illegally present in the United States from receiving in-state tuition benefits that are denied to out-of-state US citizens,” reads the complaint. “There are no exceptions.”

California law does allow some students to qualify for in-state tuition rates, which are lower than out-of-state tuition, even if they technically qualify as non-residents. This includes students who have had “three full-time years or the equivalent at any combination” of California high school, California adult high school, or California community college.

The California Dream Act, two bills passed in 2011, permits undocumented students to apply for, and obtain, state-based financial assistance, according to San Francisco State University. Undocumented students cannot receive federal financial aid for college.

The justice department’s civil complaint alleges that California policy on undocumented student tuition is “unconstitutional” and wants a judge to “declare it illegal and permanently enjoin its enforcement”.

“California is illegally discriminating against American students and families by offering exclusive tuition benefits for non-citizens,” said Pamela Bondi, the US attorney general. “This marks our third lawsuit against California in one week – we will continue bringing litigation against California until the state ceases its flagrant disregard for federal law.”

The Trump administration has filed similar lawsuits against policies in other states, including Illinois, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Kentucky and Texas. Half the country now has similar laws to California’s.

In June, after the administration sued, Texas ended its decades-old law. And Florida last year scrapped its law that allowed in-state tuition for high school graduates who weren’t in the country legally.

Supporters of the state tuition breaks argue that they don’t violate federal law if they provide the same rates to US citizens in the same circumstances – meaning they are residents of the state and graduates of one of its high schools. The California Dream Act also allows such students to apply for state-funded financial aid.

Many of the students were brought to the US by their parents when they were children, and supporters of the laws say they are as much a part of their communities as US citizens.

The complaint cites an executive order signed in February that directs federal departments and agencies to block undocumented people from receiving public benefits. Another executive order signed in April directs officials to stop enforcing laws and practices that favor undocumented people over US citizens. The lawsuit argues that the Republican president’s orders enforce federal immigration laws.

The University of California defended its decades-old in-state tuition policy.

“While we will, of course, comply with the law as determined by the courts, we believe our policies and practices are consistent with current legal standards,” it said in a statement.

The lawsuit comes weeks after the California supreme xourt let stand a lower-court ruling that the University of California’s policy barring students without legal status in the US from campus jobs is discriminatory and must be reconsidered.

University system officials had warned that the decision would put them in a precarious position as they negotiate with the Trump administration after the withdrawal of federal research funds.

The UC is dealing with federal grant suspensions and a White House demand that it pay a $1bn fine over allegations, including antisemitism and the illegal consideration of race in admitting students to its Los Angeles campus.

The California State University system is the nation’s largest and among its most diverse, with more than 460,000 students. More than a quarter of undergraduates are first-generation college students, according to the university system.

The University of California serves about 300,000 students.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5d6638950468ed3692a9a8c7a21a9a6ea7ee5f8/827_0_5417_4335/master/5417.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4b3740b4291fc14d3f91ab2a2b0384ca",N,,2025-11-22 15:57:28.036389

Garcia, a 31-year-old father of four, was in ICE custody after being arrested for a DWI in Tarrant County.

The shooting has raised questions about controversial 287(g) agreements that allow local police to hand over undocumented immigrants to federal agents.

DALLAS ― Stephany Gauffeny hovered over her comatose husband as he lay in bed at Parkland Medical Center, pleading with him to wake up but facing a yawning dread that he may never do so.

Staples closed a scar across his head, tubes snaked down his throat and his face was swollen nearly beyond recognition. Each arm was attached to the bed railing with soft restraints and his ankles were shackled together. Nearby, a life support machine whooshed and beeped steadily.

Just a few weeks earlier, Miguel Angel Garcia Medina, 31, had been cavorting with his four children at their Arlington, Texas, home, meeting his 8-year-old daughter for lunch at school and giddily planning the arrival of their fifth child.

Now, on Sept. 24, he was in a hospital bed in a coma, his body ripped apart by rounds from a bolt-action rifle.

In a corner of the room, two agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement observed Gauffeny’s every move – a pair of constant reminders of how Garcia, who had crossed into the U.S. as an unaccompanied minor two decades earlier and had grown into a house painter, husband and father, had ended up near death in a hospital.

Under the close watch of the agents, she sat and talked to him and urged him to wake up.

“I would tell him, ‘Take your time. I’m going to wait for you as long as it takes,’” Gauffeny, 32, told USA TODAY. “’I’m going to be here every day taking care of you.’”

Garcia was one of several detainees ICE picked up for deportation under agreements with local police and held inside transport vans parked outside a Dallas ICE facility on the morning of Sept. 24 when a gunman opened fire, unleashing rounds from an 8mm bolt-action rifle. Authorities said the shooter, 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, was targeting ICE agents. He was found dead at the scene of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Norland Guzman Fuentes, 37, of El Salvador, was killed in the attack and Venezuelan detainee Jose Andres Bordones-Molina was also injured in the shooting, treated for his injuries and later transferred to a detention center. No federal agents were hurt in the attack.

In a series of press conferences following the shooting, federal officials detailed how Jahn allegedly had left a series of handwritten notes denouncing ICE. They also heralded agents from ICE and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives who reportedly tried to save the detainees during the barrage of gunfire.

But family members of the detainees and immigrant advocates bristled at how little detail was released about the shooting itself or the injured detainees and the circumstances that put them inside the transport van and in the crosshairs of a determined gunman.

In response to USA TODAY's request for comment, DHS sent an email that said: “Like other law enforcement agencies, it is standard procedure for detainees in ICE custody to have guards at the hospital.”

The agency did not respond to questions about the ongoing investigation.

The shooting also raised questions over controversial pacts between local law enforcement agencies and ICE – known as 287(g) agreements – where undocumented immigrants are handed over to federal agents, even if charged with non-violent offenses or whether or not they’ve applied for legal status. The detainees involved in the attack had been transferred from Tarrant County Jail to ICE custody just prior to the shooting.

Devan Allen, a former Tarrant County commissioner who opposed 287(g) agreements, said she was told the agreement was only supposed to target violent crime offenders. Suspects like Garcia should not have been ensnared in the program, she said.

“That breaks my heart,” Allen said. “That does not feel like justice for anybody.”

Immigrant advocates and families of the detainees said not enough has been said about those injured or killed in the attack.

“We do feel bad for [ICE agents]” who are targeted, said Rocio Martinez, a Fort Worth immigration attorney who represented Gauffeny and Garcia. “But they weren’t the people who were shot. The people who were shot deserve to be remembered for who they were and not just for the fact that they were here unlawfully or in ICE custody. They’re more than that.”

‘Just the best dad’

Garcia arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2007 as a 13-year-old unaccompanied minor, entering without a visa. He had fled violence in his hometown of San Luis Potosi, Mexico, and went to live with his mother, Maria Garcia, who had migrated to Arlington a few years earlier.

He met Gauffeny while the two attended Sam Houston High School, reconnected after high school and got married on his birthday: January 5, 2016.

Gauffeny had two daughters, Barbie and Kendra, from a previous relationship, and Garcia coddled and raised them as if they were his own, she said. They also had two kids of their own: Makayla and Miguel Angel, Jr., whom he nicknamed “Cricket,” after the mischievous character from the animated series, Big City Greens.

Last year, Gauffeny found out she was pregnant with a fifth child: Another boy, whom they planned to name Miles. In May, they moved into a three-bedroom, one-bathroom home in Arlington to accommodate their growing family.

“It wasn't the biggest house, but we were really happy for that accomplishment,” Gauffeny said. “We worked hard for it.”

Garcia, who worked as a house painter, would get home exhausted and paint-splattered but always made time to tuck the little ones in, Gauffeny said. In the morning, he was the one driving everyone to school. Anytime the paletero would push his cart filled with popsicles past the home, she said, Garcia would get all the kids treats.

Makayla, 8, was the first one squealing, “Papi!” when Garcia walked through the door and solicited a few extra hugs from her father.

“He was always hugging, very affectionate,” Gauffeny said. “Just the best dad.”

But Garcia’s undocumented status hung over them like a cloud. Gauffeny, who is a U.S. citizen, applied for an I-130 visa a few years ago, the first step in getting Garcia legal residency. It was preliminarily approved, but Garcia still needed permission to leave the country and finalize the visa at the U.S. consulate in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.

He planned to travel there later this year.

Then, on Aug. 8, Garcia was FaceTiming with his mom, brother and stepfather who had been swept up on ICE raids a few weeks earlier and deported to Mexico. He grew sullen, Gauffeny said, playing bachata music and telling his mom he missed her. He drank a beer. Then another one.

Gauffeny fell asleep and awoke at 2 a.m. to a phone call from another one of Garcia’s brothers who lived 10 minutes away. He told her Arlington Police pulled Garcia over as he drove to the brother’s home and arrested him for driving while intoxicated and evading arrest. He hadn’t crashed into anything and no one was hurt, his brother told Gauffeny. Garcia was later transferred to Tarrant County Jail.

“His whole family – his mom, his stepdad, his brother – getting deported really affected him,” she said. “He was depressed. I just didn’t know how to help him.”

Gauffeny said she realized Garcia was in trouble and at risk of being deported, even though it was his first DWI offense. She had heard of other migrants arrested in Tarrant County who were handed over to ICE and deported. Under President Donald Trump, that cooperation – known as a 287(g) agreement – had flourished.

Controversial pacts spread across USA

Named for Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the statute empowers local law enforcement agencies to perform certain federal immigration functions, including holding individuals in local jails until ICE takes custody.

In December 2024, there were 135 such agreements in 16 states across the USA. By mid-November, that number had soared to 1,154 agreements across 40 states, even with college police on campuses like Florida International University and Florida Atlantic University, as the Trump administration used it as a tool to crackdown on undocumented immigrants.

Though designed to target immigrants who had committed violent crimes or pose a national security threat, today the agreements are used to sweep up anyone not in the country legally, said Lena Graber, managing attorney at the Immigrant Legal Resource Center.

“It's part of the mass detention and mass deportation machine,” she said. “And [DHS] conscripts more agencies to do that for them.”

Sheriffs and police chiefs across the country herald the agreements as ways to clear their streets of dangerous migrants who shouldn’t be in the U.S. in the first place.

But enlisting local law enforcement agents to identify undocumented immigrants has, in the past, led to racial profiling and the removal of suspects who were charged with – but not convicted of – crimes, Graber said.

“There are a lot of people who are charged with crimes and might be worth a chance at redemption,” she said, “and instead they are hurled out of the country and their family is left to fend for itself.”

When Tarrant County Sheriff Bill Waybourn introduced a 287(g) agreement to his county in 2017, it uncorked a wave of controversy, with residents split on how they felt about the agreements.

Measure to hand over immigrants roil Tarrant County

In June 2020, the four county commissioners met to decide whether to allow the agreement to continue without an annual review, essentially making it permanent. Dozens of residents – many opposing the measure – packed the small Tarrant County chambers in Fort Worth. Extra security lined inside and outside the chambers. Demonstrators rallied outside. Inside, several people opposing it were forcibly removed when they got too rowdy.

Waybourn didn’t answer several requests for comment. Current county judge Tim O’Hare declined interview requests.

“The tension was palpable,” Allen, the county commissioner, said of the June 2020 meeting. “My concern was racial profiling. My concern was about its efficacy. My concern was about its implementation. My concern was about the lack of accountability by the sheriff's department.”

Commissioners deadlocked on the issue, 2-2. The deciding vote came down to then-County Judge Glen Whitley, who said he supported getting criminal migrants off Tarrant County streets but also felt lawful migrants should have a clearer path to citizenship.

Assured the agreements would go after the “worst of the worst,” he supported the measure and 287(g) agreements became entrenched in the county by a final vote of 3-2.

Whitley said he has since grown disillusioned with how the agreements are being used, particularly during Trump’s second term, when federal enforcement agents use every tool to detain and remove as many undocumented immigrants as possible.

“President Trump indicated that he was only going to take the worst of the worst,” Whitley told USA TODAY. “But in an effort to get to his numbers, he's taking anybody he can find, and I think, in many instances, picking up people who have tried to be good community representatives, who tried to work hard to take care of their family.”

He added: “To that end, I'm very disappointed.”

‘We had a plan’

Gauffeny was keenly aware that Tarrant County Jail officials would hand over her husband to ICE agents as soon as he stepped out of jail. Together with attorney Raul Natera, they decided not to bond him out until all of his local charges had been resolved, giving an immigration judge less reason to deport him.

Garcia had two other items on his record – he had been cited in 2011 and again in 2017 for “failure to identify/giving false/fictitious information,” both misdemeanors – but this was his first DWI, a Class B misdemeanor. The evading arrest charge was dismissed.

Garcia would stay at the Tarrant County Jail until the DWI was taken care of for time served, then they’d try to release him from ICE detention by showing he had diligently applied for an I-130 visa. If that failed, they’d request a “cancellation of removal,” showing he was married to a U.S. citizen, had been in the country for more than 10 years and was the main provider to his four – almost five – children.

Even if he was deported, he could make his way to Ciudad Juarez and apply for the I-130 visa from there, Gauffeny said.

“We had a plan,” she said. “Eventually, either way, he would be able to be here legally.”

Garcia spent day after day in Tarrant County Jail. He would call Gauffeny several times a day, every day. At night, he’d talk to his kids, telling the younger ones he was away on work.

Garcia told Gauffeny he was sorry for driving that night, that he knew he had jeopardized everything they’d worked for, and reminded her to lock all the doors at night. Gauffeny assured him he’d be home soon.

‘He was just so happy’

His court date arrived on Sept. 23, 46 days after his initial arrest. Gauffeny sat in the visitor’s gallery and watched how defendant after defendant, accused of crimes she considered worse than her husband’s – burglary, assault, drug possession – were allowed to walk free.

A judge told Garcia that the evading arrest charge had been dismissed and he had served enough time to satisfy the DWI charge, but that he was being kept in custody to hand him over to ICE. Garcia said he understood.

After the hearing, Gauffeny was allowed a few minutes to briefly chat with her husband. Garcia smiled and teased her about her growing belly, the pregnancy now in its final month. Gauffeny told him he looked skinnier. Overall, they were glad he was leaving county jail.

“He was just so happy,” Gauffeny said. “He was ready to get out of there.”

Later that night, Garcia called again, at around 9 p.m. He told Gauffeny it was nice seeing her that day and that he would call her the next morning. If she hadn’t heard from him by 11 a.m., he said, it meant he’d been transferred to ICE detention and he’d try to call her when he could.

Before he hung up, 3-year-old Miguel Angel, Jr., jumped on the line.

“Hi Papi! What are you doing?”

Garcia said he was at work but he missed him and would see him soon.

‘Yelling, screaming for help’

The next morning, as she readied to shuttle kids to school, Gauffeny noticed alarming alerts pop up on her Facebook feed: A gunman had shot up the ICE processing facility in Dallas earlier that morning and three detainees had been injured, including one who had died.

Authorities allege that Jahn, of Fairview, Texas, climbed onto the roof of a nearby office building and, at around 6:30 a.m., opened fire on the federal facility, spraying the building and hitting several transport vans filled with detainees parked outside.

An 18-year-old detainee who sat next to Garcia on the bus later told Gauffeny that her husband had been talking about her and the children that morning as they waited in the van.

Then, shots.

Guzman, sitting nearby, was shot and killed instantly, he told Gauffeny. Garcia, riddled with bullets, draped over the detainee to prevent him from getting shot, he said. As they huddled down, shots still pinging the bus, a number of other detainees tried to escape out the van’s back door but it was locked, he told Gauffeny. Others yelled at the driver to drive away, but the bus remained stationary as rounds rained down on them.

“They were yelling, screaming for help,” Gauffeny recalled the detainee telling her. “They were just panicking in there and yelling the whole time they were being shot at.”

Some did escape the bus. In a surveillance video of the facility released to local media, detainees could be seen shackled and scampering into a building. A uniformed man who appears to be an employee points them to safety.

Federal officials have said ICE agents rushed in to help the shooting victims, but the detainee who spoke with Guzman said they were left alone during the fusillade. Gauffeny and her attorney, Martinez, would not identify the detainee or his family for fear they’d be targeted and deported.

ICE officials did not respond to a list of detailed questions attempting to verify the detainee’s account.

Gauffeny followed news of the shooting on the TV news but federal officials weren’t releasing names of the detainees.

At 11 a.m., as her phone remained silent, Gauffeny’s concern began to fester.

Two and a half hours later, just past 1:30 p.m., an ICE official called: Garcia had been injured in the shooting and was taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital. Gauffeny, her mom and sister rushed to the hospital.

The official told Gauffeny that Garcia had to be revived with CPR and needed emergency surgery. But nothing prepared her for what she saw in the room on the hospital’s 15th floor: Her husband was scarred, stapled and intubated. His face was so swollen she could barely make out his features. Dried blood splattered his neck. And his arms and legs were restrained. She broke into sobs.

“It was just awful to see him like that,” she said. “It was traumatic.”

‘Eyes on you at all times’

Doctors initially told Gauffeny they were hopeful. When they gave him a pharyngeal reflex, where doctors stimulate the back of his throat, Garcia gagged, a positive sign. At times his shoulders would twitch and the swelling in his brain, caused by the wound to his neck, seemed to be lessening, they told her, according to Gauffeny.

Gauffeny was there every day, whispering to her husband about the media coverage he had drawn and the outpouring of support from family and strangers.

“Everyone's rooting for you,” she told him. “There's so many people that don't even know us that are praying for you.”

There was something else Gauffeny needed to contend with: ICE. Technically, Garcia was still in ICE custody. Each day, two ICE agents sat in his hospital room, observing them, she said.

Only Gauffeny, her mother and her sister were allowed inside the room and visiting hours were limited to three hours in the morning and three hours in the afternoon, even though the hospital allowed for longer visits, Gauffeny said.

Two new agents arrived each day.

“It felt weird because there are just eyes on you at all times,” Gauffeny recalled. “We didn’t have a lot of privacy.”

An ICE spokesperson said it is ""standard procedure for detainees in ICE custody to have guards at the hospital.”

By the third day, Garcia’s condition spiraled. The swelling in his brain had resumed and his blood pressure plummeted. On the night of Sept. 27, he had to be revived after his heart nearly stopped. Doctors told Gauffeny that Garcia’s heart could give out at any moment. He wasn’t going to make it. They should make plans to say final goodbyes.

Garcia’s mom and brother got special permission to return to the U.S. to see her dying son. Gauffeny also needed ICE approval to bring everyone into the room. After a few phone calls, the agency approved.

Just past 10 p.m. on Sept. 29, Garcia’s wife, two stepdaughters, mom, mother-in-law and brother crowded into the room to say their final goodbyes. As the life support machine beeped steadily, his mother, Maria Garcia, prayed over her son and told him she loved him.

“Go in peace,” she told him. “If you have to go, go in peace.”

His two stepdaughters, Barbie and Kendra, thanked him for taking care of them all these years and promised to take care of Makayla and Miguel Angel, Jr.

“We’re going to look after them for you,” they told him. “Don’t worry about them.”

After a while, a nurse came into the room and disconnected Garcia from the life support machine. Gauffeny held her husband’s hand as he breathed on his own for a few more minutes, then stopped.

He was pronounced dead at 10:48 p.m.

Having a baby while planning a funeral

Three days later, on Oct. 2, Gauffeny was at Arlington Memorial Hospital giving birth to Miles. As she cradled her newborn in her arm, she took calls from the funeral home, picking out casket colors and flower arrangements for her husband’s funeral.

Again, she had to call ICE to confirm she could retrieve her husband’s body. An ICE official explained that she was now in full custody of her husband – a stark reversal from the layers of bureaucracy and rules they faced when he was alive.

“That made me upset,” she said. “I don't get him until he passes away, then they’re like, ‘Here you go, here’s his body.’”

Garcia was buried on Oct. 9, in Arlington. The ceremony was well attended by family members and friends who knew him from Arlington.

Gauffeny struggled with how to relay the news to Miguel Angel, Jr.

“You know how Jesus is in the sky?” she asked him one day shortly after Garcia’s death. “Well, Papi’s in the sky, too.”

“No!” he answered. “I don’t want Papi to be in the sky!”

Makayla also struggled with the news. She would clamp up and squeeze her eyes against tears that nonetheless streamed down her face, Gauffeny said.

Gauffeny wrestled with her own gnawing questions: Should she have bailed him out of Tarrant County Jail sooner, saving him from being in the transport van that morning? If she had stayed awake the night of his arrest, could she have kept him from leaving the house?

She also had questions about the shooting: How many total shots were fired? What were Garcia’s final words? How long was he injured on the bus before help arrived? ICE officials had been frustratingly quiet on details of the incident, she said.

“I wonder if he was aware of what was happening,” Gauffeny said. “I wonder if he had any last words. I wonder if he was in pain and I wonder what his last moments were like.”

Gauffeny said she now worries how to support five children with the family’s main breadwinner gone. A GoFundMe page started by her sister has helped offset some of the hospital bills and funeral costs. But mortgage and other bills loom and she suspects they'll need to see a therapist soon.

More painful are the constant reminders scattered throughout the home: Garcia’s tools in the garage, his clothes hanging in the closet, his toothbrush still in a cup by the bathroom sink.

“My brain knows he's gone,” Gauffeny said. “But I sometimes feel like he's just in the other room or laying down or somewhere at work and he'll be back later.”

A Dia de los Muertos offering

On Nov. 2, Gauffeny decided to take her children to Garcia’s grave for Dia de los Muertos, a holiday observed in Mexico and some parts of Latin America. The day is dedicated to paying respects to loved ones who have died. The family hadn’t ever celebrated but Gauffeny thought it might help bring closure.

They brought fresh flowers, brushed off weeds and debris from his site and laid down a framed picture of a smiling Garcia. Miguel Angel, Jr., saw it and asked his mom, “Is Papi dead?” He asked matter-of-factly; Gauffeny, caught off guard, changed the subject.

They prayed, lit a few candles and gathered to leave.

As they were walking away, Makayla jogged back to her father’s grave and placed a single Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup, still in its wrapper from her Halloween collection, next to Garcia’s framed photo.

“Bye, Papi,” she said. “I love you.”

She ran to catch up to her family.

The TOI correspondent from from Washington:

The United States on Friday extended its campaign against mass migration to cover its European allies, warning that such inflow poses an “existential threat to Western civilization” and undermines its stability. In a series of posts, the State Department sought to expand the Trump administration’s anti-migration outlook beyond US borders, instructing American embassies in western nations to report on the human rights implications and public safety impacts of mass migration. “Western nations have endured crime waves, terror attacks, sexual assaults, and the displacement of communities. US officials will urge governments to take bold action and defend citizens against the threats posed by mass migration,” the State Department said characterising mass migration as “a human rights concern” affecting the population of its allies, rather than a concern relating to the migrants themselves as has been viewed traditionally. Asserting that issues stemming from mass migration have plagued citizens of Western nations for years, it said US officials will urge governments to “take bold action and defend citizens against the threats posed by mass migration.” Officials will also report policies that punish citizens who object to continued mass migration and document crimes and human rights abuses committed by people of a migration background, it added. The State Department cited examples of grooming gangs of migrant men victimising girls in the U.K – a decades old problem involving British-Pakistani criminals – and more recent stray incidents in Sweden and Germany to make the case against mass migration. It said US officials will now scrutinize policies in Western nations that give leniency to migrant crime and human rights abuses or that create two-tiered systems that prioritize migrants at the expense of their own citizens, citing the example of a German woman who it claimed was given a harsher sentence than rape perpetrators for insulting one of them online. Effectively, the State Department warning suggests the Trump administration not only wants to end migration into the US but also to stir up opposition in its western allies some of whom have been flooded with refugees and asylum seekers from Africa and Asia. Some analysts are concerned that the campaign against mass migration is a cover to end all immigration, including legal immigration, as demanded by MAGA nativists and isolationists. A few US allies, notably Canada and Australia, actively solicit qualified immigrants to replenish their vast land mass, stagnant or depleting population, and their coffers, without the wealthy and healthy conditionalities that Washington now insists on. While MAGA sentiment is firmly against all immigration, including legal immigration and even temporary foreign skilled workers, Canada aims to attract 500,000 immigrants annually and Germany's Skilled Immigration Act eases entry for non-EU workers. Even China, with 1.4 billion people, is opening its doors to foreign workers that the MAGA is happy to reject or dispense with. The new US anti-migration policy rolled out by Washington came on the heels of a series of posts by senior Trump officials blaming unchecked immigration for the economic decline of allies and celebrating US success in staunching migration. Responding to a chart shared by an economist that showed Canada's GDP per capita growth lagging behind other G7 nations since around 2015, US vice President J.D Vance suggested that immigration, not US policies, was the problem. ""While I'm sure the causes are complicated, no nation has leaned more into 'diversity is our strength, we don't need a melting pot we have a salad bowl' immigration insanity than Canada. It has the highest foreign-born share of the population in the entire G7 and its living standards have stagnated,” he gibed. US officials also shared and celebrated a report in MAGA outlet Breitbart News about the US Foreign-Born Population declining by 2.3 Million under Trump, heralding what it called the “Golden Age” of America. “We are seeing a massive decrease in net migration in our country. What we're doing is working!” Vance exulted, while immigration advocates mused about the long-term effect of negative migration on the US economy. The official White House handle itself celebrated a report showing more than 2.5 million native-born Americans gaining employment, while 670,000 foreign-born workers lost jobs under President Trump.

Minnesota has the nation’s largest Somali community. Many fled the long civil war in their east African country and were drawn to the state’s welcoming social programs.

But how many migrants would be affected by Trump’s announcement that he wants to end temporary protective status could be very small. A report produced for Congress in August put the number of Somalis covered by the program at just 705 nationwide.

Congress created the program granting Temporary Protective Status in 1990. It was meant to prevent deportations of people to countries suffering from natural disasters, civil strife or other dangerous conditions.

The designation can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary and is granted in 18-month increments.

The president announced his decision on his social media site, saying that Minnesota was “a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.”

“Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing. Send them back to where they came from,” Trump wrote. “It’s OVER!”

The Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said Trump’s decision “will tear families apart.” Executive Director Jaylani Hussein said in a statement late Friday, ”This is not just a bureaucratic change; it is a political attack on the Somali and Muslim community driven by Islamophobic and hateful rhetoric.”

Trump promised while campaigning to win back the White House last year that his administration would deport millions of people. As part of a broader push to adopt hardline immigration policies, the Trump administration has moved to withdraw various protections that had allowed immigrants to remain in the United States and work legally.

This July, a man in Utah set his home on fire, killing himself, his 33-year-old partner, Jaimar Bravo Gil, and their children, police say. The family had moved to the U.S. from Venezuela, and Bravo Gil’s relatives said her partner had a history of violence but she had kept silent about most of the abuse for fear of being deported. She was not alone. At least two other women killed by their intimate partners this summer reportedly did not seek police help because they also feared deportation.

A growing chorus of attorneys, advocates and members of law enforcement are warning that the terror that has taken hold in immigrant communities is causing some people to remain in abusive relationships rather than risk deportation and separation from their families. While undocumented victims have always faced barriers in escaping abuse, experts say Trump administration policies have left them much more vulnerable.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.

Here are six changes impacting immigrant victims of domestic violence:

In January, DHS rolled back protections that kept immigration agents from entering “sensitive locations,” including domestic violence shelters and hospitals. DHS also began allowing enforcement at courthouses.

These changes have caused some domestic violence victims to think twice before seeking medical help, moving into a shelter, or seeking an order of protection, experts say.

There have been reports from across the country of immigration officers arresting people at courthouses, sometimes violently. A recent survey of more than 170 attorneys and advocates for immigrant survivors of domestic and sexual violence found that 70% said their clients had concerns about going to court for a matter related to their abuser.

Some jurisdictions are pushing back. In October, the top judge in Cook County, Illinois, which includes Chicago, issued a local order barring civil ICE arrests in and around courthouses. Weeks later, Illinois lawmakers passed legislation barring civil ICE arrests in all state courthouses.

ICE raids have also had an impact on domestic violence shelters in Los Angeles and elsewhere. One advocate shared a story of a client who waited two days after an assault to go to the hospital. She only went after her attorney told her it was safe, and was found to have a broken nose and eye socket, according to a press release from the Alliance for Immigrant Survivors.

The Laken Riley Act requires detaining undocumented immigrants accused of certain crimes, even petty ones. Advocates say this will wrongfully ensnare domestic violence victims.

It is common for the victim to be arrested along with the abuser, or for abusers to call the police on undocumented victims as a form of control, experts say. And sometimes, victims commit crimes to survive, like shoplifting diapers or food for their children.

Under prior laws, an immigrant could discuss their abuse with a criminal court judge and argue for bond while the case is pending. Under the Laken Riley Act, passed by Congress in January, survivors have to make their case from inside the immigration detention system, and could be kept in custody throughout their case, even if the criminal allegations against them are later dropped.

Local police are often cooperating with ICE, and new funding incentivizes such partnerships.

Under the Trump administration, DHS has been aggressively pushing local police to make immigration arrests and share information on possible targets through a program known as 287(g). The federal government is now offering to reimburse the pay of local officers. The federal government lists over 1,000 agreements with law enforcement across 40 states.

“For survivors, this raises a critical question,” said Cecelia Levin, advocacy coordinator for the Alliance for Immigrant Survivors. “If an officer arrives at the door, what are they there to do? Are [officers] there to offer protection and help, or are they there to conduct an enforcement action?”

In Houston, the police department’s calls to ICE have increased more than 1,000% this year, the Houston Chronicle recently reported. Most referrals were related to traffic stops. This June, a Houston officer warned a woman reporting her abuser that the police contacted ICE and advised her not to file a report in person or risk being deported, she told the newspaper.

Domestic violence organizations, including shelters and legal aid, are facing financial turbulence as conditions for federal grants change repeatedly.

The Trump administration has issued a dizzying array of new policies that specifically impact immigrant victims of domestic violence. The federal Office on Violence Against Women set new conditions for its funding, requiring applicants to certify that they are not promoting gender ideology, DEI, or prioritizing “illegal aliens” over citizens. A group of state-level coalitions for survivors sued, and a federal judge temporarily blocked the new funding restrictions.

The administration also tried to use Victims of Crime Act grants — which fund compensation and assistance programs — to compel states to comply with federal immigration demands. The administration later backed off of this threat.

Then, in August, the administration said it would bar states from providing services to crime victims who “cannot immediately prove their immigration status” — a move being challenged in federal court by more than 20 state attorneys general.

While the lawsuits against these policies have had some wins, cuts are already happening. In Tennessee, for example, the state’s office that decides how to spend federal crime victim dollars ended immigrant legal aid grants this past June.

Safety nets for immigrants have been cut, making people more vulnerable.

This summer, the Trump administration announced that unauthorized immigrants would be barred from receiving certain social services, including Head Start, which has long supported families with education and health care for children. In September a federal judge blocked the policy change.

Cuts to assistance were also part of the Big Beautiful Bill, which made certain lawful immigrants, including survivors of domestic violence and human trafficking, ineligible for SNAP food aid, Medicaid, and health care tax subsidies. As a result, an estimated 90,000 people will lose SNAP benefits in a typical month, according to the Congressional Budget Office. These benefits have never been available to people who are undocumented.

Nearly 80% of advocates polled in a 2017 survey by the National Resource Center on Domestic Violence reported that “most domestic violence victims rely on SNAP to help address their basic needs and to establish safety and stability.”

Losing food benefits, together with potential cuts to other support services, creates a heightened level of vulnerability for immigrants, making them more susceptible to ongoing abuse, experts say.

Some worry that the administration’s next target is protective visas.

Abusers can exploit people’s immigration fears, and the vulnerability of undocumented women is part of why Congress passed the Violence Against Women Act in 1994. The law allows survivors to apply for permanent residence without the abuser’s involvement. The visas, U visas for victims of domestic violence and other serious crimes, and T visas for victims of human trafficking, require that they cooperate in the arrest and prosecutions of those who harmed them.

Police often embraced the tool, said Zain Lakhani, migrant rights and justice director at the Women’s Refugee Commission. “It enables law enforcement to be able to conduct investigations. It keeps the witnesses around, and it makes it safe for people to report crime.”

The special visa process has, for years, been plagued by lengthy wait times, which have grown to over a decade, according to The 19th. Applicants are supposed to receive protection from deportation while their application is awaiting a final decision, yet over the past year, women have been forced out of the country while waiting on pending T or U visas. A lawsuit seeking to halt those deportations is pending, and legislation to do the same has been introduced in Congress.

Project 2025 called for the total elimination of both visas, concluding that “victimization should not be a basis for an immigration benefit.” The 19th reported that access to these visas is already being restricted. About 3 in 5 applicants for these visas are immigrant women.

So what safe avenues still exist for immigrants who need to escape from abuse?

Advocates for survivors told The Marshall Project there is still help available. Local and national domestic violence hotlines are confidential, and they can help people understand what their options are and how to make a safety plan. Shelters take the privacy and safety of people in their care seriously and immigration agents would need a warrant signed by a judge to enter without permission and cannot rely on abuser-provided information to find people. The rules surrounding certain protections, like special visas, are still the law. Legal aid for immigrants is still available in many places, and attorney client privilege is legally protected regardless of immigration status.

“No matter which way the political pendulum swings, Republican or Democrat, nothing ever gets better for the common American man or woman,” Greene said.
In a phone conversation with an ABC News reporter, Trump was quoted as saying Greene’s resignation was “great news”.
He added that Greene hadn’t given him notice but “it doesn’t matter, you know but I think it’s great.
Greene did not give House Speaker Mike Johnson advance notice of her resignation, according to NBC News.","Marjorie Taylor Greene announced on Friday evening she will be resigning from office effective 5 January 2026, in the wake of souring relations with President Donald Trump, mostly recently over a vote to force the release of files related to the late Jeffrey Epstein.

In a four-page statement, the Georgia congresswoman said the legislative branch had been “sidelined” and accused Republican leaders of refusing to advance conservative priorities such as border security or “America First” policies.

Until recently, Greene had been one of the most vocal and visible supporters of Trump’s Make America Great Again movement, crediting him with inspiring her to run for Congress in 2020. But in recent months, the congresswoman had become a surprising critic of the Trump administration – taking on the president not just over the release of the Epstein files, but also his administration’s support for Israel, and extending expiring Obamacare subsidies. She began questioning whether Trump was truly an “America first” president.

“No matter which way the political pendulum swings, Republican or Democrat, nothing ever gets better for the common American man or woman,” Greene said.

“When the common American people finally realize and understand that the political industrial complex of both parties is ripping this country apart, that not one elected leader like me is able to stop Washington’s machine from gradually destroying our country, and instead the reality is that they, common Americans, the people, possess the real power over Washington, then I’ll be here by their side to rebuild it.

“Until then I’m going back to the people I love, to live life to the fullest as I always have, and look forward to a new path ahead,” Greene added.

In a phone conversation with an ABC News reporter, Trump was quoted as saying Greene’s resignation was “great news”. He added that Greene hadn’t given him notice but “it doesn’t matter, you know but I think it’s great. I think she should be happy.”

Previously, Trump has called Greene a “traitor” and “wacky” and said he would endorse a challenger against her when she ran for re-election next year. In a social media post last week, Trump speculated that Greene had turned against him because he advised her not to run for Senate and claimed she was “upset that I don’t return her phone calls”. In response, Greene accused Trump of lying and said she believed it was her persistent calls for his administration to release the Epstein files that “sent him over the edge”.

Greene did not give House Speaker Mike Johnson advance notice of her resignation, according to NBC News. Her departure in January will narrow Johnson’s already razor-thin majority, leaving him less room to maneuver.

Greene explained her decision in a 10-minute social media video posted on X on Friday night.

In her resignation statement, she said: “I have fought harder than almost any other elected Republican to elect Donald Trump and Republicans to power … Through it all I have never changed or went back on my campaign promises … America First should mean America First and only Americans First, with no other foreign country ever being attached to America First in our halls of government.”

Last week, Greene said she had been contacted by private security firms “with warnings for my safety” after Trump announced he was withdrawing his support for and endorsement of her.

In a post on X, Greene said that “a hotbed of threats against me are being fueled and egged on by the most powerful man in the world”, without referring to Trump by name, adding it was “the man I supported and helped get elected”.

Greene reiterated these threats in her statement, saying that she has faced “never ending personal attacks, death threats, lawfare, ridiculous slander and lies about me, that most people could never withstand even for a day”.

Her resignation comes after months of opinions that go against those of the White House and some of her Republican colleagues. Earlier this month, Trump pushed back against criticism from Greene, saying she had “lost her way” after she accused him of paying too much attention to foreign affairs and not enough to the rising cost of living in the US – points she also addressed in her Friday statement.

Greene said she had broken with the US president over several issues, including the issuing of H-1B visas to skilled foreign workers, a ban on AI regulation, “50-year mortgage scams”, involvement in foreign wars, and the release of files related to the crimes of Epstein, the late pedophile Trump socialized with for more than 15 years.

“Standing up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the president of the United States, whom I fought for,” Greene said.

Greene has been an outspoken opponent of Israel’s war on Gaza, with US support, calling it “a genocide”.

“If I am cast aside by Maga Inc and replaced by Neocons, Big Pharma, Big Tech, Military Industrial War Complex, foreign leaders, and the elite donor class that can’t even relate to real Americans, then many common Americans have been cast aside and replaced as well,” Greene said.

Her resignation comes halfway through her third term in the US House of Representatives. In her resignation speech, she did not say what she would do next but hinted at a future in politics, saying: “When the common American people finally realize and understand that the Political Industrial Complex of both parties is ripping this country apart … [and] that they, common Americans, The People, possess the real power over Washington, then I’ll be here by their side to rebuild it.”

Political strategist Shermichael Singleton said Greene might be “looking at future plan”.

“If I were advising her, hey, you might be able to get through this brief moment in time,” Singleton told CNN. “But perhaps she thought otherwise. Maybe she’s looking at future plans. But this is a big shocker.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f77e660498bd99368208387da77d4cfeede17fd5/522_0_3184_2547/master/3184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=911e6e1369270e80ade731f6be50205c",N,,2025-11-22 11:57:52.239898

Thomas McCarthy said his wife Jessica's interview with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services was almost over when ICE agents entered the room and detained her for overstaying her visa.

""We heard a knock on the door. She stepped out, and then they came in and said, 'Yeah, two ICE agents want to ask us questions,'"" McCarthy said.

The couple has been together for two years and married for a year and a half. They celebrated their marriage in the Catholic Church about a month ago.

""I'm just kind of in disbelief about it because we were doing the right thing,"" McCarthy said.

Jessica is one of several people detained over the last week at USCIS offices for visa overstays. Immigration attorneys say they have never seen anything like this before.

""It's just like a punch in the face, like my world's been turned upside down,"" McCarthy said.

McCarthy said his wife was worried this could happen after seeing previous ABC 10News coverage about the USCIS detentions, but he reassured her everything would be fine.

""I think she saw your article specifically in San Diego of that happening recently,"" McCarthy said.

Immigration attorney Jacob Sapochnick, who McCarthy has hired, said he received a frantic call about the detention. Sapochnick is one of several attorneys who told ABC 10News that people are now being detained at their green card interviews.

Sapochnick said the law allows people to adjust their status from a visa overstay to a green card and argues this new tactic is a waste of resources.

""The thing is we will be able to release them. It's just, it's a waste of resources for them. It's anxiety for the spouses, it's trauma that's gonna last for a long time,"" Sapochnick said.

ICE referred ABC 10News to a statement sent earlier in the week about the USCIS detentions, saying they are committed to enforcing federal immigration laws and that people unlawfully present in the U.S., including at places like USCIS offices, may face arrest, detention, and removal.

""She didn't do anything wrong. We went in there with good faith, you know, doing everything the legal way, paid our dues,"" McCarthy said.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies “executed a federal search warrant” at Bro-Tex at the intersection of Hampden Avenue and Territorial Road.

DHS claimed one person detained on Tuesday had a domestic abuse charge and another had illegally re-entered the country, a federal criminal offense.

The DHS spokesperson did not provide the names of the two people with alleged criminal records, nor did they acknowledge federal agents’ documented use of pepper spray and other chemical irritants against protesters who gathered at the scene.

Immigration rights groups and elected officials decried the operation as an attack on St. Paul’s immigrant community and accused ICE of being dishonest about its actions.

The Immigrant Defense Network, a coalition of more than 100 organizations across Minnesota, issued a statement calling ICE’s action on Tuesday “a violent operation that left families terrified, workers missing, and community observers shoved, assaulted with pepper spray and chemical agents.”

“The federal narrative being circulated is misleading, harmful, and designed to obscure what truly happened: fourteen Minnesotans were violently taken from their workplace in broad daylight. Torn from their jobs, separated from their families, and disappeared from their community without warning,” the Immigrant Defense Network said.

A protest has been held outside an Oxfordshire immigration removal centre that is set to reopen under government plans.

Campsfield House Immigration Removal Centre is due to reopen later this year, after closing in 2018 following riots, escapes and complaints about conditions.

Along with protesters, the plans have been opposed by MPs, residents and charities, as well as Oxford City Council.

A Home Office spokesperson said the centre, near Oxford Airport, will boost ""our immigration detention capacity to support a higher pace of removals"".

Emma Jones, speaking on behalf of the protest group Coalition to Keep Campsfield Closed, said the centre was an ""appalling"" place, and that the plans were ""devastating to so many people in Oxfordshire"".

""We are here in solidarity with people who are detained simply because of their immigration status, not because of any crime they've committed,"" she said.

The plans to reopen Campsfield, she said, are ""a huge worry"" to people who care about human rights.

Ms Jones said: ""The people of Oxfordshire have made their voices clear, and will continue to do so, that refugees are welcome here. This is meant to be a city of sanctuary. Campsfield is the opposite of sanctuary.""

The government has said the centre will initially provide 160 beds and then up to 400 following a £70m expansion, and will be used to accommodate ""a mixture of time-served foreign national offenders and immigration offenders while we prepare to remove them from the UK"".

A Home Office spokesperson said: ""Opening Campsfield Immigration Removal Centre will boost our immigration detention capacity to support a higher pace of removals.

“School leaders will continue to increase visibility during arrival and dismissal today, and district-level administrators will be assigned across campuses to support students and staff,” Ferrua said.

The district further reiterated its commitment to state and federal laws, including not releasing personally identifying information about students unless there’s a judicial order reviewed by district leaders. The district also said they will continue to follow Oregon Sanctuary Promise laws, prohibiting district staff from sharing information for immigrant enforcement purposes, unless there’s a court order. In addition, immigration officials will continue to not be permitted to access non-public areas of the school buildings or contact students at school without judicial authority, the superintendent said.

“This is happening as we are going into a weekend with the holiday ahead. It is important that our entire community wrap around our children to help them feel a sense of safety and belonging,” Ferrura said. “I encourage you to join me in talking to your own children about this and other challenging topics. As parents, it can be hard to know what to say, and I encourage you to lean into these conversations as our trusting relationships with kids matter.”",https://www.koin.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/10/generic-mcminnville-high-school-b-10102017_31745593_ver1.0.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-22 12:57:27.021116

Law enforcement officers said that the aide had actually paid a body artist $500 to give her scars on her arms, chest, neck and face, for which the officers obtained a receipt and a consent form with a copy of her driver’s license.

The woman, Natalie Greene, 26, of Ocean City, N.J., told law enforcement officers that she had been bound at gunpoint at a nature reserve on the night of July 23 by three men, who had written the words “TRUMP WHORE” onto her stomach with a black marker during the slashing, the authorities said.

She also claimed that her attackers had also scrawled the name of her boss in marker on her back with the word “RACIST,” according to a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey.

The complaint did not name the congressman, but a legislative database indicated that Ms. Greene had been working at the time as a constituent advocate director for Representative Jeff Van Drew, who represents South Jersey.

Ms. Greene was arrested on Wednesday and charged with conspiracy to convey false information and hoaxes, and making false statements, court records showed.

The charges against Ms. Greene carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. She was released on $200,000 bond.

Louis M. Barbone, a lawyer for Ms. Greene, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday but told The Associated Press that his client was presumed innocent under the law.

“At the age of 26, my client served her community working full time to serve the constituents of the congressman with loyalty and fidelity,” he said in statement. “She did that while being a full-time student.”

A spokeswoman for Mr. Van Drew did not immediately answer questions on Friday about Ms. Greene’s arrest.

In a statement, the congressman’s office said that those in the office were “deeply saddened” by the episode.

“While Natalie is no longer associated with the congressman’s government office, our thoughts and prayers are with her and hope she’s getting the care she needs,” the statement read.

On the night of July 23, the authorities received a 911 from a person who claimed that she and Ms. Greene had been attacked by three unknown men at Egg Harbor Township Nature Reserve, the criminal complaint said.

The caller, whom investigators did not name but said was a co-conspirator, told the operator that Ms. Greene had been targeted because of her job.

“They were talking about politics,” the complaint quoted the co-conspirator as saying in the 911 call about the supposed attackers. “They were like calling her like racist, calling her a whore.”

When the police arrived at the nature reserve, officers found Ms. Greene on the ground, with her feet and hands bound with black zip ties, the authorities said.

Investigators said that Ms. Greene’s co-conspirator had become agitated when they asked for the keys to Ms. Greene’s Maserati but that she had ultimately consented.

Inside the vehicle, officers discovered the same type of zip ties and a roll of duct tape, according to the complaint.

While combing through the co-conspirator’s phone browsing history, officers learned that the co-conspirator had searched where to buy zip ties, the authorities said.

It was not immediately clear whether the co-conspirator faced any charges.

Two days after Ms. Greene claimed she had been attacked, she told an agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation that the office where she worked had frequently received threatening mail, the complaint said.

“There’s so many,” the complaint quoted Ms. Greene as telling the agent. “Windmills belong on your grave. We keep all of our hate mail. We recently got like, a letter with like powder in it and stuff.”

Minnesota has the nation’s largest Somali community. Many fled the long civil war in their east African country and were drawn to the state’s welcoming social programs.

But how many migrants would be affected by Trump’s announcement that he wants to end temporary protective status could be very small. A report produced for Congress in August put the number of Somalis covered by the program at just 705 nationwide.

Congress created the program granting Temporary Protective Status in 1990. It was meant to prevent deportations of people to countries suffering from natural disasters, civil strife or other dangerous conditions.

The designation can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary and is granted in 18-month increments.

The president announced his decision on his social media site, suggesting that Minnesota was “a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.”

“Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing. Send them back to where they came from,” Trump wrote. “It’s OVER!”

The Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said Trump’s decision “will tear families apart.” Executive Director Jaylani Hussein said in a statement late Friday, ”This is not just a bureaucratic change; it is a political attack on the Somali and Muslim community driven by Islamophobic and hateful rhetoric.”

Trump promised while campaigning to win back the White House last year that his administration would deport millions of people. As part of a broader push to adopt hardline immigration policies, the Trump administration has moved to withdraw various protections that had allowed immigrants to remain in the United States and work legally.

That included ending TPS for 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians who were granted protection under President Joe Biden. The Trump administration has also sought to limit protections previously extended to migrants from Cuba and Syria, among other countries.

Salvador spent much of his first two weeks at the ICE detention center in El Paso, Texas, worrying that he’d be sent back to Mexico, a country he hadn’t lived in for decades. The rest of the time, the expired food, overcrowded quarters, unsanitary conditions, and separation from his family, particularly his toddler, left him hopeless and depressed. When his wife sent a photo of the boy, guards wouldn’t allow him to see it.

In his decades living undocumented in the U.S., Salvador has never been charged with a crime beyond a traffic infraction. He had steady work in construction and paid his income taxes. But masked, unidentified Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers detained him the morning of Aug. 18 outside his house in Rohnert Park.

Now he was stuck in Texas, while his wife and six children anxiously waited for him back home in California.

On Sept. 3, a judge at the El Paso detention center granted him the $8,000 bond that, if paid, would allow Salvador to return home. The judge said he had considered the importance of Salvador’s relationship with his 2-year-old son, who has Down syndrome.

Salvador felt a deep sense of relief — but it wouldn’t last.

Two days later, the judge rescinded his own order, denying the bond. The Board of Immigration Appeals, a body at the Department of Justice empowered to set precedent for immigration courts across the country, had just decided that immigration judges could no longer grant bonds. It was a policy shift that went against decades of precedent. Salvador, along with thousands of other people in ICE facilities across the U.S., was stuck in detention with no clear way out.

The BIA’s decision, a controversial and underreported ruling by an obscure appellate body that accepts no public input, is a dramatic change from how the immigration system has worked for decades. Legal experts say it is the latest instance of the Trump administration flouting the law in order to speed up immigration enforcement by any means, and doing so in little known corners of government, away from public scrutiny.

Salvador’s case is one of tens of thousands, as immigrants find themselves stranded in detention for lengthy periods — to the point that some choose to be deported over remaining locked up. The ruling leaves immigrants with fewer options to find freedom.

“The immigration court system, as most anyone who’s been through it knows, is extremely imperfect,” said Heidi Altman, vice president of policy at the National Immigration Law Center. “ICE [is] taking this wrong approach to what the law says, and then the Board of Immigration Appeals [is] rubber-stamping it.”

Salvador immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico in 1997, moving close to relatives in Sonoma County. While working at a Wendy’s in Petaluma, he started dating a coworker, Alondra, another recent Mexican arrival. They married and had five kids. Along with Alondra’s son from a previous relationship, the family settled in Rohnert Park. (Given their tenuous immigration status, they declined to share their last names.)

“Everyone here knows my family,” Alondra said in Spanish. “We’re part of the community. This place makes me feel peaceful.”

In 2024, Salvador and Alondra’s oldest child turned 21 and, as a U.S. citizen, had the right to petition for his parents to gain residency. Undergoing this process would be risky. Salvador and Alondra had crossed the border decades before without being detained by Customs and Border Patrol and had lived ever since without much interaction with the federal government. Applying for residency would put them on the feds’ radar. It was a calculated risk ahead of the 2024 presidential election.

“We thought that if [Donald Trump] wins, applying for residency might be a bigger risk, but we had to take that risk,” Salvador said. “Unfortunately, he won.”

When ICE began large raids in Los Angeles in June, Alondra was afraid to leave the house. She stopped shopping at the local Walmart. But Salvador was less worried.

“They said ICE was at the CVS, at the Mexican restaurant,” he said. “I didn’t believe it. Until they showed up at my home.”

On the morning of Aug. 18, moments after Salvador had driven away from his house en route to his construction job, an unmarked car with a flashing red light pulled him over. Masked, uniformed men emerged, instructed Salvador to exit his vehicle, and handcuffed him. He had no idea who they were. A couple of hours later, Salvador sat in ICE’s holding facility in San Francisco.

“I asked them to let me call my boss so that I could tell him I would be missing work that day,” Salvador said. “I thought I’d be back on the job the next day.”

Instead, he was held in San Francisco for four days, in a facility not built for overnight stays. He slept under a thin foil blanket, his work boots serving as a pillow.

Nicole Gorney, a lawyer with Vital Immigrant Defense Advocacy and Services, the legal aid group working on Salvador’s residency application, went to see him three days after he was detained. But when she arrived at ICE headquarters in San Francisco, a receptionist said Salvador was no longer there.

“She said he’d been transferred,” Gorney said, “and couldn’t tell me where.”

From Salvador’s charging documents, Gorney learned that he’d been taken to El Paso Service Processing Center, an ICE detention facility that is often a final stop before deportation.

As soon as she learned where he was, Gorney filed a request for a bond hearing. Since Salvador had no criminal record and several young children, she figured she had a good chance of getting him out.

On Sept. 3, two weeks into Salvador’s detention in El Paso, Gorney, Alondra and their teenage son appeared by videoconference at the bond hearing. The judge at the detention center listened to Gorney plead on behalf of her client and reviewed letters of support from his longtime employer and other community members. At the end of the hearing, the judge decided Salvador wasn’t a danger or flight risk and granted him bond.

On Sept. 4, the Department of Homeland Security’s lawyer appealed. Gorney said the lawyer explained that the DHS instructed him to appeal every successful bond request now.

The following day, the Board of Immigration Appeals issued the Matter of Yajure Hurtado. The ruling over one Venezuelan man’s ability to seek asylum resulted in stripping any immigration judge of the ability to grant bond. Salvador’s bond was rescinded.

“I was sure they were going to deport me,” Salvador said. “I was going to be away from my family, everything I own, and be in Mexico. What was I going to do there all by myself?”

It was unclear when Salvador would see his family again, and if the next time he would see them would be in the United States.

At the heart of the BIA’s decision in the Matter of Yajure Hurtado is a reinterpretation of what it means to be “seeking admission” to the U.S. While Salvador wanted to return to the life he’d spent decades building in Sonoma County, the DHS contended that, legally speaking, he’d never entered the United States at all.

Historically, the government has treated immigrants at the border who are trying to come into the U.S. and those already inside the country differently. Newcomers are legally much easier to expel. The law looks more compassionately on undocumented people who have strong community ties or people in the U.S. who depend on them — especially young children, as in Salvador’s case.

But the Hurtado decision contends that undocumented people, even after decades of living, working, and paying taxes in the U.S., are still “seeking admission” to the country. By classifying immigrants as newcomers, the Trump administration moved them into a legal category in which a separate set of laws apply. The newcomer rules do not offer immigration judges the right to grant bond.

“What ICE is attempting to do here is to say every immigrant in the United States, unless they came with a visa, is essentially still asking for that first permission to enter the United States,” Altman said. “Even if they’ve been living in their community and working and supporting U.S.-citizen children for 15 years, they are the legal equivalent of knocking at the door asking for admission.” As unwanted guests, they can’t be eligible for bonds to return to their U.S. homes — because the government essentially says they never had a home in the U.S.

When immigrants have appealed these rulings, moving their cases from immigration to federal courts which operate with greater judicial independence, more than 100 (opens in new tab) federal judges have rebuked the Hurtado interpretation, finding that longtime undocumented residents should not be classified as newcomers. But the DHS has continued to argue on behalf of the new interpretation, compelling immigration judges to deny bond.

“ You see how baffling and clearly contrary to the law it is in the ways in which the government just keeps losing and losing and losing when they try to defend it in court,” Altman said. “ We see it across the board when it comes to immigration law and policy, and civil rights generally: a willingness to sort of brazenly adopt an unreasonable and illegal interpretation of federal law in order to impose cruelty and terror on immigrant communities.”

With Salvador’s bond swiftly revoked, Gorney waited for the habeas corpus petition she filed on his behalf to work its way through the federal court system, which in recent months has tended to judge more liberally in favor of immigrants. Increasingly, the only way to leave ICE detention is with a federal habeas corpus ruling, a centuries-old protection against unlawful incarceration.

Week after week, Salvador waited.

At the ICE facility, he met detainees from all walks of life. “There were Chinese, Mexicans, Russians, 70-year-olds, even 80-year-olds,” Salvador said. Some had been detained by ICE for years.

The whole time he was in El Paso, he saw one detainee released back into the U.S. He saw several others deported to their homelands. So in mid-October, when guards told him he’d won his case, he knew how lucky he was.

Salvador bought soda and chips from the commissary for his friends in detention. “They all hugged me,” he said.

Salvador’s situation was more rare than they knew. The share of ICE detainees who were released on bond or under parole or supervision following the Hurtado decision in September 2025 was 3%, versus 26% in October 2024, before the ruling, according to a recent study by the Migration Policy Institute.

Salvador was unusually fortunate in that he had a lawyer who filed his habeas petition in a federal court that is known to be sympathetic to detained migrants. The vast majority of ICE detainees do not have lawyers to file a petition on their behalf.

“So for most people, you have to kind of figure out on your own, in a language that is probably not your first language, how to access the federal court system, how to file this petition, what it looks like,” Altman said. “And for most people, that is extraordinarily difficult, if not impossible, to do.”

Salvador was released from ICE detention Oct. 15, nearly two months after ICE detained him. He boarded a bus in El Paso and 16 hours later was greeted by Alondra and his children in Bakersfield, where they’d driven down to meet him. It was a bittersweet reunion. “The baby forgot who I was,” Salvador said.

While he’s happy to be home, he’s out of work after his employer of 16 years refused to give him back his job.

“We’re running out of money, paying rent and bills,” Alondra said. She’s taken an extra job to keep the family afloat. “At the same time, we’re not getting down. We have to believe things are going to turn out OK.”

Salvador’s petition for residency has been moved from USCIS to immigration court, where he’s scheduled to see a judge in 2027. Alondra has a December appointment at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in San Francisco to determine whether she can become a permanent resident.

“I know that sometimes they detain people at those appointments,” she said. “So I’m a little afraid.”

Because of her immigration status, Sara is not eligible for Pell Grants and other federal student aid. Under a 2001 state law and the California Dream Act — Sara pays lower in-state tuition and receives state financial aid for college — she has been able to afford her education. When she receives her associate’s degree, she intends to transfer to a Cal State or UC campus and major in business administration.

But Friday her dreams felt more out of reach, after the Trump administration sued California, alleging the state’s laws granting in-state tuition rates and financial aid to undocumented students are illegal. The suit threatens the higher education goals of about 80,000 undocumented college students, many who arrived in the state as children.

“After I get my degree, I want to use it to work in California and contribute to my community,” said Sara, who requested to withhold her last name because she is fearful of federal immigration enforcement action. “How does that hurt anyone?”

Trump seeks to overturn California law

The Department of Justice on Thursday sued California and its three public higher education systems, seeking to overturn a decades-old state law that provides lower in-state tuition to undocumented students who have attended the state’s high schools. The Trump administration also sued to put an end to the California Dream Act, which it alleges gives illegal preference for financial aid to people who are not citizens.

The moves are the latest in a series of similar legal actions the federal government has taken this year against states including Texas, Kentucky, Illinois, Oklahoma and Minnesota.

U.S. Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi said the government took the action because California has a “flagrant disregard for federal law.”

State leaders disagreed, saying they will defend the laws.

“The DOJ has now filed three meritless, politically motivated lawsuits against California in a single week. Good luck, Trump. We’ll see you in court,” said Izzy Gardon, a spokesperson for Gov. Gavin Newsom. The other suits are against the Proposition 50 redistricting effort and a state law banning federal immigration agents from hiding their identities with masks.

Though other states have faced similar suits, California — with the largest number of undocumented students in the nation — stands as the biggest such test case of Trump’s second term. California has prided itself on its expansive public higher education system and its pioneering support of immigrant communities.

“It’s another attack on immigrants. So not a surprise at all,” said Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta, who said he would “review the case and identify any appropriate responses to it.” Bonta noted that with tuition and aid policies, California is “making its own decision. We have 10th Amendment state sovereignty.” He said the state is “using our own funds and following all the laws, and that Trump “really wants to micromanage the policy of cities and of states.”

In 2001, lawmakers passed AB 540, which gives in-state tuition rates to all students who graduated from California high schools after attending for at least three years. The California Dream Act passed a decade later and opened up state aid, including Cal Grants, to undocumented students. It was later expanded to include students who were citizens but had an undocumented parent.

The Trump administration’s challenge to California’s tuition and aid statutes focuses on a 1996 federal law that says people in the U.S. without legal permission should “not be eligible on the basis of residence within a state ... for any post-secondary education benefit unless a citizen or national of the United States is eligible for such a benefit ... without regard to whether the citizen or national is such a resident.”

Legal scholars have debated whether the federal law affects California tuition and aid laws because the price tags apply to citizens and non-citizens alike.

Critics of Trump’s actions also say the law does not speak specifically to tuition rates. Some courts have interpreted the word “benefit” to include cheaper tuition.

Higher education institutions maintain that their tuition practices abide by the law.

“California Community Colleges are open-access institutions dedicated to serving all students. The California Community Colleges will follow all legal obligations and fully participate in the judicial process alongside our state partners,” said Chancellor Sonya Christian.

Community colleges enroll the vast majority of undocumented immigrant students in the state. Between 12,000 and 14,000 of such students attend CSUs and UCs.

“Although we cannot comment on ongoing litigation, our commitment remains unchanged: We will continue to ensure that all students who qualify under state law have access to an affordable, high-quality education,” Christian said. “We will also continue to comply fully with all current federal and state requirements.”

How students are responding

For students like Sara, the lawsuit stirs more uncertainty in a year she said has “shaken” immigrant communities, including her relatives who are citizens and permanent legal residents.

“We have ICE raids, we have people picked up off the street and in their homes. Now they don’t even want us to educate ourselves?” she said. “This is my home, not a place I can’t remember where I was born.”

Juan, an undocumented student at Cal State Northridge, shared similar sentiments. He also traveled as a toddler with his parents from Mexico to the U.S. and pays in-state education fees.

“Even with that, it is expensive — you pay for gas, books, computers,” said Juan, who requested that his last name not be used.

Juan has an older sibling who was approved for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which provides work authorization to people who moved to the U.S. as children and lack legal status. The program has largely been closed to new applications for years, so his options to earn money are limited.

“I help my parents, siblings and friends with odd jobs — running social media accounts, housework, pet-sitting,” he said. “That money can help pay for the lower tuition rates. It cannot cover out-of-state rates.”

At CSU Northridge, the in-state rate per semester is $3,925, compared with $10,585 for non-California residents.

Ju Hong, who attended UC Berkeley as an undocumented student and directs the UCLA Dream Resource Center, said he was “devastated” by the suit.

“I think we are going backwards,” said Hong, who was born in South Korea. “Immigrant youth and students and organizers won major victories with AB 540 though ground-up organizing for decades. This is not just about a legal action. It’s an attack on immigrant students and youth who have grown up, have studied here and contributed to California.”

Jack Feng, a graduate student at UCLA and immigrant rights advocate, said the moment calls for broader support for undocumented students across UC.

He said UC “should join the state of California in aggressively litigating against this attack.”

“UC should expand immigration legal services, mental health resources, and emergency financial aid for undocumented students,” said Feng, who is the external vice president of the UCLA Graduate Students Assn.

Legal questions loom

Ahilan Arulanantham, co-director of the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at UCLA Law School, said California’s tuition law does not appear to violate the federal law the Trump administration is using in its challenge.

“Federal law prohibits certain benefits to undocumented students based on residency in the state. But AB 540 does not make people eligible based on residency,” he said. “Instead it ties eligibility to whether students have graduated high school and attended three years of high school in the state.”

He said the difference between residency and high school graduation is a key legal point.

Arulanantham explained that in-state tuition is open to all students, regardless of legal status. But all students must meet the California high school attendance and graduation criteria — even if they now live in another state.

“There are lots of citizens who would not qualify for in-state tuition under a residence-based rule — but who do qualify based on the graduation criteria,” he said.

Arulanantham said California’s tuition law has at times helped more students who have legal documentation than those who do not.

A 2012 report from the University of California that tallied AB 540 recipients from 2002 to 2011 showed that, in those years, U.S. citizens and people with legal authorization were frequently more likely to make use of the law than undocumented immigrants.

In the 2010-2011 academic year, the report said, 1,260 documented UC students received California resident tuition rates compared with 620 “potentially undocumented” people.

UC said it has not compiled a public report of more recent data.

The California law has withstood earlier challenges. The state Supreme Court upheld it in 2010 after out-of-state students sued. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of the case.

In those cases, judges said undocumented immigrants were not receiving preferential treatment because of their immigration status but because they attended and graduated from California schools. They said U.S. citizens who graduated from the state’s schools had the same opportunity.

Thursday’s complaint was filed in the Eastern District of California. In June, after the Trump administration sued over the law in Texas, the state agreed to stop giving in-state tuition to undocumented immigrant students. Kentucky and Oklahoma also said they would not defend their tuition laws.

Undocumented students have joined the Kentucky case to fight to keep the law there in place and are attempting to do the same in Oklahoma. Illinois and Minnesota said they would challenge the Trump lawsuits against their states.
