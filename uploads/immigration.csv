Spain is among few EU countries touting economic benefits of migration

Migrant irregular arrivals to Spain fell by 42% last year

Rights groups criticise Spain's deals with West Africa

MADRID, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Spain opposes a push by some European Union countries to control migration by opening camps for asylum-seekers outside the bloc, calling instead to focus on curbing irregular migration at the source, its interior minister said.

Fernando Grande-Marlaska told Reuters external processing centres, such as Italy’s plan to detain migrants in Albania, were ""no magic solution"" as they posed significant legal challenges and could strain relationships with third countries.

Meanwhile, Spain's strategy of working with transit nations before arrivals occur was proving effective, he said.

In contrast to many EU states tightening their immigration policies amid the rise of the far right, Spain's leftist government has been an outlier by treating migration as an economic asset, promoting legal immigration pathways, while simultaneously reducing irregular migration.

Irregular arrivals to Spain fell 42% last year - to around 36,000 compared to Italy’s little-changed 66,000.

""I believe that our figures and migration policy overall doubtlessly ... greatly strengthen Spain's role in defining migratory policy within the European Union,"" Grande-Marlaska said.

Denmark said last month that a majority of EU countries supported the processing of asylum requests ""in safe third countries"" to deter arrivals. The European Parliament is expected to restrict migration rules this year.

To bolster its strategy, Spain has increased its presence in West African nations Mauritania, Senegal and the Gambia— deploying nearly 100 police officers and various surveillance assets.

Rights groups, however, have said Spain's and the EU's support to West African countries to prevent migrants from boarding precarious boats to Spain's Canary Islands has led to abuses, notably in Mauritania where Spanish police were allegedly present during abusive detention of migrants, according to Human Rights Watch.

Grande-Marlaska said Spain had ""not seen any illegal action or action against refugees' fundamental rights"" and said Spain was working on beefing up its teams in Mauritania and Senegal and delivering more drones and vehicles to local forces.

Migrant arrivals to the Canaries fell 62% last year from record-breaking 2024 levels, Spanish data shows.

The next closest peak was 20 deaths in 2020, when COVID-19 raced through tightly packed detention centers.
By comparison, ICE reported 26 deaths during all four years of former President Biden's term.
Flashback: Deaths similarly jumped during President George W. Bush's immigration crackdown in 2004, resulting in 32 deaths.
Detained people also have access access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care.","At least 31 people died in ICE custody last year, a two-decade high, as President Trump's mass-detention surge strains a system already under fire for dangerous conditions.

Why it matters: Immigrants rights groups warn deaths will keep rising as the administration floods ICE with more cash — and that the agency's facilities may not be equipped to handle the influx of detained people.

The Trump administration's policy of limiting congressional oversight visits to ICE facilities has exacerbated those fears, fueling an impeachment push against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

By the numbers: The 2025 death toll nearly tripled from the 11 deaths in 2024, according to an Axios review of ICE news releases.

The next closest peak was 20 deaths in 2020, when COVID-19 raced through tightly packed detention centers.

By comparison, ICE reported 26 deaths during all four years of former President Biden's term.

Flashback: Deaths similarly jumped during President George W. Bush's immigration crackdown in 2004, resulting in 32 deaths.

The big picture: Outrage at ICE hit a new peak after an agent shot and killed a 37-year-old mother in Minneapolis earlier this month, intensifying alarm among lawmakers and protesters who were already demanding answers about deteriorating conditions inside detention centers.

""We've been warning about this for over a year, that conditions have been deteriorating, that deaths are climbing, and now we're seeing that,"" Setareh Ghandehari, a spokesperson for the Detention Watch Network tells Axios.

""We will likely see many more deaths if things continue as they have.""

Zoom in: Amnesty International reported in December that people held at one center described ""poor quality food, extreme temperatures, permanent lighting, and limited access to clean water.""

At another facility, the ACLU says people reported being denied insulin and disability accommodations, blocked from seeing lawyers and forced to use bathrooms with sewage bubbling up from drains.

What they're saying: A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security told Axios that there was ""no spike in deaths"" in ICE custody in 2025, arguing the death rate per person has remained stable.

""Every detainee receives food, water, medical care, bedding and clean clothing. All detainees are receiving three meals a day that are certified by dietitians,"" they said.

DHS says it screens everyone for medical, dental and mental health needs within 12 hours of arrival, and conducts a full health assessment within two weeks. Detained people also have access access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care.

What we're watching: Congress requires ICE to publish death reports within 90 days, but ICE has not published one since the end of September, according to an Axios review of agency press releases.

DHS did not answer Axios' questions about when it would update the tracker.

In one of his last acts as New Jersey’s governor, Phil Murphy on Monday signed one of three bills designed to protect immigrants from federal immigration raids. Murphy declined to sign two other measures, including one that would codify the Immigrant Trust Directive, first implemented by then-Attorney General Gurbir Grewal in 2018.

Murphy declines to codify Immigrant Trust Directive and sign Privacy Protection Act

Murphy said he was concerned that codifying the Immigrant Trust Directive would open up the Garden State to a new court challenge that would go before judges who may not render the same decision as when Grewal’s original directive survived court challenges.

“Renewed litigation would also put our time-tested Immigrant Trust Directive at risk, endangering hundreds of thousands of immigrants in New Jersey in one fell swoop,” he said in a statement. “Re-opening the door to judiciary scrutiny of our State’s immigration policies, combined with the Trump Administration’s increasingly targeted actions against states and cities, is a recipe for disaster for our immigrant brothers and sisters and puts them in greater danger.”

Murphy said his administration found “a drafting oversight” on the Privacy Protection Act that “could create significant complications when it comes to advancing our shared goal of protecting New Jersey’s immigrant communities.”

“I deeply wish there was sufficient time left to correct this issue, but it is not possible due to the expiration of the legislative session,” he said in a statement. Murphy is leaving the Legislature with recommended amendments to the bill, hoping that the measures would be reintroduced in the new session.

Murphy did not veto the two bills outright. He declined to sign them into law, allowing them to expire because they were passed within the last 10 days of the legislative session, known as a “pocket veto.”

Immigrant advocates say they are disappointed

The New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice said in a statement Tuesday that Murphy “walked away from his promise to protect immigrant families across the state.”

“He does so amid an intensification of immigration enforcement and detention in New Jersey,” the group said.

There have been reports of ICE raids taking place in Atlantic City and Camden within the last month.

“At a moment that demanded courage, Gov. Murphy chose caution,” said Viri Martinez, deputy director of strategy at the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice.

She added that “fear of the Trump administration” is the only way to describe why Murphy declined to sign the legislation.

“This decision reflects how Trump’s authoritarian playbook has seeped into our state, paralyzing decisive leadership and allowing fear, rather than values, to dictate who is protected and who is left behind,” Martinez said.

Amol Sinha, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, said the pocket vetoes have left New Jersey “without critical protections at a moment when ICE is brutalizing our communities.”

“These bills were legally sound, politically viable, and commonsense policy,” he said, in a statement. “We call on Gov.-elect Sherrill, her administration and the Legislature to establish data privacy protections and ensure state and local resources are not commandeered for federal immigration enforcement.”

Murphy signs Safe Communities Act

The governor said the state was reaffirming “our longstanding commitment to ensuring the people of New Jersey — particularly our immigrant families — are safe, secure, and supported in navigating their daily lives easily and confidently.”

“Public spaces such as houses of worship, schools, hospitals, and courthouses are places of trust that should welcome and safeguard every member of society,” he said in a statement. “Whether you’re praying in a church, studying in school, receiving medical care at a hospital, or seeking legal relief, no one should live in fear or uncertainty or be deterred from seeking essential services due to their immigration status.”

The Safe Communities Act, which takes effect immediately, requires the attorney general to propose policies on how to interact with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers when they visit sensitive locations such as schools, hospitals and places of worship.

The law also requires certain government departments and agencies to adopt the policies within 180 days of being issued. Policies must be equal to the attorney general’s model or provide greater protections.",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gov-murphy-ap-2026-01-08.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 14:58:33.795449

Data on Medicaid enrollees is routinely exchanged between states and the feds, including to verify eligibility to receive federal funding.
The ruling says that if that basic data can’t be separated from data that’s still protected, Medicaid can’t share it with ICE.
California’s Department of Health Care Services, which administers the state’s Medicaid program, emphasized that concern in a statement updated earlier this month.
Meanwhile, some states are looking at their options for protecting their Medicaid data.","In a win for President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, a recent court ruling has cleared the way for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to resume using states’ Medicaid data to find people who are in the country illegally.

The case is ongoing. But for now, immigrants — including those who are in the country legally — will have to weigh the benefits of gaining health coverage against the risk that enrolling in Medicaid could make them or their family members easier for ICE to find.

Last summer, 22 states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration to block information sharing between ICE and Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program that primarily covers people with low incomes. But at the end of December, a federal judge ruled that ICE can pull some basic Medicaid data to use in its deportation proceedings, including addresses, phone numbers, birth dates and citizenship or immigration status.

The court ruled that in the states that sued, ICE is not allowed to collect information about lawful permanent residents or citizens, nor records about sensitive health information. In the 28 states that didn’t sue, however, the court did not place any limits on the Medicaid information ICE can access.

The U.S. District Court in San Francisco essentially said that government agencies can share some data, including basic identifying information. “That kind of data sharing is clearly authorized by statute,” the decision states.

But the court also ruled that agencies can’t share more sensitive data without adequately explaining why they need it. In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria wrote that ICE and federal Medicaid information-sharing policies were “totally unclear and do not appear to be the product of a coherent decisionmaking process.” He said the states had shown they would “suffer irreparable harm from these vague and likely overbroad” policies.

Worried about surveillance, states enact privacy laws and restrict license plate readers

By law, federal Medicaid money cannot be used to cover people who are in the country illegally.

But in recent years, nearly half of states, including some led by Republicans, have chosen to use their own Medicaid money to extend coverage to certain groups of people, such as children and pregnant women, regardless of immigration status.

Advocates for immigrants and some state officials worry that ICE’s use of Medicaid data will cause widespread fear among immigrant families, keeping them from seeking the health care that states have said they’re eligible to receive. California’s health department recently called the administration’s actions “a grave breach of public trust.”

“States have constantly reassured people that their health care information won’t be used against them, and that’s changed,” said Tanya Broder, senior counsel for health and economic justice policy at the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy organization focused on immigrant rights.

Court filings in the lawsuit illustrate the potential impact of the ruling.

In Chicago, for example, a patient at an Esperanza Health Center delayed her first prenatal visit until her third trimester because she worried enrolling in Medicaid could put her husband at risk of deportation, the clinic reported in a December court filing. By the time she received care, she had complications that could have been addressed with earlier health visits. Another patient refused to apply for Medicaid for her child, a U.S. citizen, because she worried that seeking benefits would allow ICE to locate her.

“The expectation of privacy that we all have when we seek to enroll in a health care program has been compromised,” said Broder.

“Not only undocumented immigrants but people who live in families with immigrants and the broader community are going to feel less comfortable in applying for these health programs, over concerns their information is going to be weaponized against them or their family members.”

An about-face

Several months into Trump’s second term, ICE gained access to the personal data of 79 million Medicaid enrollees as part of its efforts to find people who may be living illegally in the United States.

Data on Medicaid enrollees is routinely exchanged between states and the feds, including to verify eligibility to receive federal funding. But the new agreement marked an about-face from past federal policies of not using such information for immigration enforcement.

The effort is unprecedented at the national level, said Medha Makhlouf, a law professor at Penn State Dickinson Law who specializes in health and immigration.

“Previously the federal government has balanced immigration enforcement interests with the protection of health-related interests,” she said. “Now they’re weighing much more heavily the interests of immigration enforcement.”

That puts the federal government at odds with states that have expanded health coverage as a matter of public health and economic policy, she said. Many states have extended coverage to a wider swath of people on the premise that broader coverage helps prevent the spread of disease, prioritizes preventive care over more costly emergency treatment and reduces economic losses when employees miss work because of illness.

The judge’s order will stand until the case is resolved, as the judge considers what kinds of data can be released for use in immigration enforcement.

ICE courthouse arrests meet resistance from Democratic states

California Attorney General Rob Bonta, a Democrat, said in a July statement that the Trump administration’s data-sharing move was illegal and “created a culture of fear that will lead to fewer people seeking vital emergency medical care.”

Federal officials say they’re allowed to use lawfully collected information for immigration enforcement purposes.

The Department of Homeland Security and ICE did not respond to requests for comment.

Broder, of the National Immigration Law Center, said it isn’t clear whether the limited information the court has allowed the Department of Homeland Security to use can be cleanly separated from data belonging to citizens and lawful permanent residents. The ruling says that if that basic data can’t be separated from data that’s still protected, Medicaid can’t share it with ICE.

California’s Department of Health Care Services, which administers the state’s Medicaid program, emphasized that concern in a statement updated earlier this month. The department said the feds haven’t provided any information about how they plan to implement the court’s order.

Meanwhile, some states are looking at their options for protecting their Medicaid data. Oregon Health Authority Director Dr. Sejal Hathi called the move to use Medicaid data for immigration enforcement “disappointing, to say the least” in a public board meeting earlier this month.

She said her agency is “committed to doing all that we can within our authority to protect the health privacy of our members” and is working with health providers to “ensure that Oregonians, no matter their background, can continue to seek and receive quick and responsive health care without worrying about the safety of their health information.”

States step up

In recent years, an increasing number of states have used their own money to extend health insurance coverage under their Medicaid programs to some noncitizens, such as people with green cards, refugees and those with temporary protected status.

For example, 14 states and the District of Columbia cover income-eligible children regardless of immigration status, while seven states and the district offer state-funded coverage to some adults with low incomes, regardless of immigration status. Nearly half of states — including a handful of red states — cover income-eligible pregnant women, regardless of their immigration status.

Makhlouf, of Penn State, directs a legal clinic at her law school where law students assist people who face legal barriers to getting health care and other public benefits. The students have fielded questions from parents — even those who are in the country legally — who have asked if applying for Medicaid for their children, who are U.S. citizens, jeopardizes their own legal status or exposes household members to scrutiny from ICE.

“We see the chilling effects directly,” Makhlouf said. “Folks have many more questions about the risks versus the benefits of applying for government programs. It should be an easy decision for families to accept help, but it’s not easy anymore.”

In the past year, the Trump administration also has ordered states to hand over personal data from sources including voter rolls and food stamps, even as it consolidates information held across federal agencies into a trove of information on people who live in the United States.

In November, a federal judge blocked the IRS from sharing taxpayer information for immigration purposes.

“We call on everyone, including powerful institutions who have stayed on the sidelines, to commit to promoting democracy and resisting autocracy.","Washington, D.C. – One year into the second administration of Donald Trump, the courts have served as a critical guardrail against the harmful excesses of the Trump-Vance administration according to a new analysis released by leading pro-democracy legal organization Democracy Forward today.

The Trump-Vance administration has faced more than 600 lawsuits from people and communities across the nation and has lost in court more than 70% of the time. The administration has faced losses in front of courts with judges appointed by Republican presidents, Democratic presidents, and President Trump himself, with less than 5% of these cases going to the U.S. Supreme Court.

“Over the past year, the nation has been reminded of the resilience and determination of the American people. As powerful institutions have stayed silent or, worse, collaborated in what is an autocratic power grab unfolding in our nation, the people have stepped forward, including in the courts where the people have filed–and won–hundreds of legal cases. At Democracy Forward, we are proud to be shoulder to shoulder with people and communities across the country, as well as with the nation’s legal community, in defending people and the rule of law against what are existential threats to the wellbeing of people and our nation’s present and future,” said Skye Perryman, President and CEO of Democracy Forward. “While the devastation and pain that the Trump-Vance administration continues to cause is immoral and unjustifiable, we find hope in the people’s determination to resist this autocratic powergrab.”

Critical pro-democracy court victories that have been achieved by public interest organizations, civil rights and civil liberties advocates, state attorneys general, private practice lawyers, and cities and counties over the past year – and that remain in place – include:

Blocking the administration’s nationwide freeze on federal funding and essential services;

Blocking the administration’s deployment of the National Guard in states and cities across the nation;

Blocking the administration’s retaliation against law firms, civic institutions, associations, and non-profit organizations;

Blocking the administration’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to deprive people of due process;

Blocking the administration’s attempt to defund educational institutions that do not align with the White House’s views;

Blocking a number of the administration’s anti-Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility initiatives;

Blocking the administration’s efforts to reverse the Constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship;

Blocking key provisions of the administration’s so-called “election integrity” Executive Order;

Blocking the administration’s efforts to deprive 42 million Americans of supplemental nutritional assistance (SNAP);

Blocking the administration’s attempts to deprive 2.2 million people of health care, raise costs for working families, and undermine the Affordable Care Act’s core protections; and

Blocking attempts to undermine the free press –whether through court orders that blocked attempts to decimate the Voice of America or blocking the administration’s attempts to deprive press of access to public spaces.

Many of these victories have been achieved through a broad coalition of public interest organizations and pro-democracy state attorneys general. Democracy 2025, the strategic legal network of 675+ organizations housed at Democracy Forward, has been credited with coordinating the largest and most effective legal strategy against unlawful administrative action in modern history. Democracy 2025 is the strategic hub to protect people and their rights against the Trump-Vance administration’s efforts to unlawfully strip away freedoms and prosperity. The effort has been credited with filling the gap that was left when a number of large elite law firms pulled back from their pro-bono work and/or capitulated to the White House’s demands.

Democracy Forward in the past year alone has taken more than 400 legal actions to stop executive branch excesses, including through filing more than 150 lawsuits, initiating more than 250 public records investigations, and filing numerous supportive friend-of-the court briefs. Democracy Forward has also submitted more than 1,700 Freedom of Information Act requests and other demands since January 2025.

In addition to Democracy 2025, Democracy Forward has launched a number of additional collaborative projects to build further support for the pro-democracy movement – both inside and outside of the courts. Those include:

Civil Service Strong, a collaborative effort by civil society, non-partisan good government and watchdog organizations, lawyers, and unions to ensure our nation’s civil service is able to continue to serve the American people and our Constitution, deliver for our nation, and support our communities.

Democracy Works 250, an innovative and collaborative effort to reimagine and build foundations for a people-centered government and democracy, including through a nationwide listening project to catalogue the expectations and experiences of the American people and through optimizing the expertise of former civil servants and fired federal workers to contribute to plans to rebuild government.

We Hold These Truths, a nationwide campaign dedicated to promoting unity and cross-ideological support for the five non-negotiables of American Democracy: voting and elections, personal freedom, equality, due process, and the rule of law.

Together for Democracy, an initiative to build community and encourage courageous action across the nation.

“As the threats from the Trump-Vance regime continue to accelerate, we are continuing to expand our efforts to protect people, the Constitution, and our nation. We are proud of the historic, peaceful, and direct actions that people and communities have taken over the last year to protect themselves, their neighbors, and our democracy – both inside the courts and outside of the courtroom. Courage is the new currency. Whether it’s Day 1, Day 365, or Day 1,000, we will continue to meet this administration in court to protect our communities and our democracy,” Perryman added. “We call on everyone, including powerful institutions who have stayed on the sidelines, to commit to promoting democracy and resisting autocracy. It is not too late to choose the right side of history.”",https://democracyforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/og-image.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 13:58:56.276148

Judiciary Appointments In his first term, Trump filled one-third of the Supreme Court, nearly 30% of the appeals court seats and nearly 26% of District Court seats.
So far in his second term, the judiciary confirmation numbers lag a bit behind those in Biden’s first year.","Summary

Since President Donald Trump returned to the White House:

Job growth slowed, and the unemployment rate crept upward. Job-seekers now outnumber job openings.

Price increases slowed according to the most commonly watched number. But they worsened according to the measure preferred by the Federal Reserve.

Paychecks grew faster than inflation. Real weekly earnings of private-sector workers rose 1.4%.

Economists estimate the economy grew 1.8%.

Consumer sentiment declined.

The number of apprehensions at the U.S. border with Mexico decreased 91.4%, while refugee admissions declined 98%.

The international trade deficit decreased only slightly, by 0.9%.

The stock market continued to set new records.

The number of people receiving federal food assistance went down by about 1.2 million.

Oil production went up 2.5%, while oil imports dropped 6.9%. Carbon emissions increased slightly.

The number of murders nationwide continued to decline, a trend that began in 2022.

The federal debt held by the public rose about 6.7%.

Analysis

Now that Trump has been back in office for one year, we’re publishing our first “Trump’s Numbers” article of his second term. That’s the schedule we have followed for these reports, which we launched in 2012. We wait a year when a new president is inaugurated to allow for the accumulation of some data on most of these metrics.

Going forward, we’ll provide quarterly updates throughout Trump’s term, as we did for his predecessors, and we’ll be able to include statistics that are missing from this report — household income, poverty and health insurance — once the data are released.

In a Jan. 13 speech, Trump himself cited “the numbers” for his economic record, making a healthy, and incorrect, use of superlatives. “By almost every metric, we have quickly gone from the worst numbers on record to the best and strongest numbers,” he said. “Just based on the numbers.”

While that’s clearly not accurate for “almost every metric,” the idea behind these articles isn’t to fact-check specific claims; rather, we simply provide the numbers. They may be expected or surprising, good or bad, depending on one’s point of view. We leave those opinions to readers, and we make no judgments as to how much credit or blame a president deserves for these measures.

Jobs and Unemployment

Job growth slowed and unemployment crept up during Trump’s second term. The number of unemployed now exceeds the number of job openings.

Employment — Employment continued growing during Trump’s first 11 months in office, but much more slowly than it had in the previous 11 months.

The most recent figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics show an increase of 473,000 in total nonfarm employment between January and December 2025. That’s barely more than one-quarter of the 1,782,000 jobs added between February 2024 and January 2025, when Trump began his current term.

(A note of caution: BLS has announced it will revise its monthly job figures substantially downward for March because its annual “benchmarking” study indicated its monthly survey had overcounted the number of jobs that month by 911,000. Updated figures going back to March 2024 are scheduled to be released in February along with the regular monthly employment report.)

Much of the sluggishness under Trump is due to the president’s deliberate slashing of the federal workforce. Federal government employment has fallen by 277,000, or 9.2%, since he took office.

Looking only at the private sector — excluding federal, state and local government workers — 654,000 jobs were added during Trump’s term so far. But that’s still less than half the 1,414,000 added in the preceding 11 months.

Back in August, Trump reacted to disappointing job-growth figures by calling them “rigged” and “phony” even though we found no evidence of that and the White House offered none. Trump fired BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer and nominated as her replacement E.J. Antoni, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Trump withdrew that nomination amid much criticism at the end of September and has yet to name a permanent replacement.

Meanwhile BLS reported a gain of only 50,000 jobs in the month of December. That’s even lower than the initial report of a 73,000 gain in July that prompted Trump to fire the BLS chief. The July gain has since been revised downward to 72,000.

Manufacturing Jobs — The economy continued to lose manufacturing jobs. During Trump’s first 11 months the loss was 63,000. That followed a loss of 98,000 in the preceding 11 months.

Labor Force Participation — The labor force participation rate declined a bit in Trump’s second term, dropping from 62.6% to 62.4%.

The rate is the portion of the population over age 16 that is working or seeking work. It generally has been in a long decline as the population ages and people retire.

Unemployment — The unemployment rate has remained well below the historical norm under Trump, but has gone up slightly since he took office. It was 4.0% in January 2025, and most recently was 4.4% in December.

The median rate for all months since 1948 is 5.5%.

Job Openings — The number of people officially listed as unemployed rose by 638,000 during Trump’s first 11 months, while the number of job openings declined by 616,000. There are now 7.5 million unemployed and seeking work, but only 7.1 million openings. When Trump took office, job opportunities outnumbered job-seekers.

Wages and Inflation

CPI — Trump campaigned on a promise to reduce inflation, and since he took office it has slowed little. Or maybe not. By one important measure it has worsened.

In the 12 months before Trump took office the Consumer Price Index, the most commonly cited measure of inflation, rose 3.0%. And in the most recent BLS report, the 12-month increase was 2.7%.

Over Trump’s first 11 months in office, the CPI went up 2.18%.

One particularly bright spot: The often volatile price of gasoline has eased. The national average price for regular gasoline at the pump was $3.11 the week Trump was sworn in for the second time, and had dropped to $2.78 by the week ending Jan. 12, according to the Energy Information Administration.

Inflation was much worse in 2022, when the 12-month CPI increase spiked at 9.1% in June. That was the largest 12-month increase in over 40 years. But inflation had slowed markedly by the time Trump came in.

Still, inflation remains higher than the Federal Reserve would like, and it’s going in the wrong direction as measured by the Fed’s preferred metric, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index, compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

The central bank’s target is a 2% annual increase in the PCE. When Trump took office, the 12-month increase in the PCE was 2.5%. But the most recent report put the 12-month increase at 2.8%.

That was for the period ending in September. Not only do the PCE figures take longer to gather than the CPI, they have been delayed by the recent government shutdown. The next PCE release is now scheduled for Jan. 22 and will cover both October and November.

Wages — Wage increases accelerated under Trump, even adjusted for inflation.

The average weekly earnings of all private-sector workers, adjusted for inflation, rose 1.4% during Trump’s first 11 months. They were rising when he took office, but had only gone up 0.5% in the preceding 11 months.

Those figures include professionals, executives and supervisory employees, whose pay is normally higher. But rank-and-file wage earners are seeing gains just as rapid as those of their bosses. For private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees, real average earnings also rose 1.4% under Trump, after a 1.0% rise in the preceding period.

Economic Growth

After a weak first quarter, the economy showed surprising resilience in Trump’s first year back in office – largely on the strength of substantial artificial intelligence investments and household spending.

Although the first official annual estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis isn’t due to be released until Feb. 20, BEA data available so far show that real gross domestic product declined at an annual rate of 0.6% in the first three months of 2025 but then grew by 3.8% in the second quarter and 4.3% in the third quarter.

The reported third-quarter growth was the largest in two years, when the economy expanded at an annual rate of 4.7%. Fourth quarter growth, which also won’t be released until Feb. 20, may be even higher. As of Jan. 14, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDPNow model was projecting growth of 5.3%.

“This strong growth came despite the adverse trade and immigration shocks the economy has absorbed over the past year,” resulting in a “soft labor market,” Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, wrote in December after the third-quarter figures were released. “That interplay — a surging economy and a soft labor market — is likely to be the major economic narrative next year.”

Brusuelas described the economy as a “resilient beast.” He attributed the third-quarter growth to “[h]ousehold consumption driven by higher-income consumers and AI-related investment,” which he wrote “accounted for just under 70% of total growth during the [third] quarter.”

For the full year, Federal Reserve Board members and bank presidents expect growth to come in at between 1.5% and 2%, according to estimates released Dec. 10. Their median projection was 1.7%. Similarly, economists surveyed in October by the National Association for Business Economics estimated 1.8% growth in 2025.

Consumer Sentiment

When Trump took office, consumers surveyed by the University of Michigan expressed concern about unemployment and inflation and uncertainty about the potential impact of Trump’s economic agenda.

“Concerns over the future trajectory of inflation were visible throughout the interviews and were tied to beliefs about anticipated policies like tariffs,” Joanne W. Hsu, director of the Surveys of Consumers, said in a press release last January, adding that “consumers of all political leanings will continue to refine their views as Trump’s policies are clarified and implemented.”

A year ago, the university’s survey showed that the consumer sentiment was 71.7. Since then, consumer confidence has precipitously declined in subsequent surveys and remains stubbornly low.

The university’s preliminary Index of Consumer Sentiment for January was 54 – 17.7 points lower than it was when Trump took office. By contrast, consumer sentiment never dropped below 71.8 in Trump’s first term, despite the economic turmoil caused by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020.

Although those surveyed perceived some “modest improvement” in the economy in the last two months, consumer sentiment “remains nearly 25% below last January’s reading,” Hsu said. Consumers “continue to be focused primarily on kitchen table issues, like high prices and softening labor markets.”

In its most recent Consumer Confidence Survey, the Conference Board — a research organization with more than 2,000 member companies — also reported that consumer confidence declined for the fifth straight month in December.

“Despite an upward revision in November related to the end of the [government] shutdown, consumer confidence fell again in December and remained well below this year’s January peak,” Dana M. Peterson, chief economist of the Conference Board, said in a Dec. 23 press release.

Home Prices & Homeownership

Homeownership — Homeownership rates have declined slightly since Trump became president.

The homeownership rate, which the Census Bureau measures as the percentage of “occupied housing units that are owner-occupied,” was 65.3% in the third quarter of 2025 — 0.4 points below the 65.7% rate during Biden’s last quarter in office.

Although mortgage rates eased in 2025, the homeownership rate in the third quarter “remained below last year’s pace because of ongoing affordability pressures,” according to Realtor.com.

“Persistent affordability challenges and a shortage of reasonably priced homes have kept the rate from rising more meaningfully, though recent inventory gains, softer prices, and easing mortgage rates appear to be helping some previously sidelined households enter the market,” Realtor.com Senior Economic Research Analyst Hannah Jones said in a Dec. 12 article on the company’s website.

The highest homeownership rate on record was 69.2% in 2004, when George W. Bush was president. But millions of Americans lost their homes during the Great Recession, a financial crisis triggered by a housing market crash.

“Following record-high homeownership rates before the 2008 housing and financial crisis, homeownership rates have remained relatively static at the current rate of 65 percent,” HUD’s policy and research arm wrote in a July report on the history of homeownership in the U.S.

Home Prices — Home prices, which soared to new highs under Biden, slowed in Trump’s first year, as mortgage rates continued to fall.

The national median price of an existing, single-family home sold in December was $409,500, according to the National Association of Realtors. That was 2.9% higher than it was in January, when Biden left office.

Looked at another way: The median sales price in December was only 0.24% higher year-over-year.

“2025 was another tough year for homebuyers, marked by record-high home prices and historically low home sales,” NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said in a press release. “However, in the fourth quarter, conditions began improving, with lower mortgage rates and slower home price growth.”

The Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest rates three times in 2024. After a pause, the Fed cut rates three more times in 2025 – lowering rates last year by a full percentage point since September. While that’s not directly tied to mortgage rates, it can affect how banks set their loan rates.

As of Jan. 8, the average mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage was 6.16% — down from 6.96% for the week ending Jan. 23, 2025, according to Freddie Mac. Trump took office on Jan. 20, 2025.

Immigration

In his first year in office, Trump has followed through on his signature campaign promise to — as he puts it — “close the border,” with numerous executive actions that have dramatically reshaped immigration policy and enforcement.

“The border is totally secure,” Trump told reporters on Jan. 11.

The number of apprehensions at the U.S. border with Mexico decreased 91.4% during Trump’s first full 11 months in office, compared with the same period in 2024, according to the most recent figures released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The monthly average (7,255) was at a low not seen since the early 1960s.

Calculating the change in border apprehensions is the method we’ve used as a proxy to measure illegal border crossings for our Numbers stories going back to President Barack Obama. But in Trump’s case, that dramatic drop tells only part of the story of the sweeping immigration policy changes that the Migration Policy Institute describes as “unprecedented in their breadth and reach.”

“While some efforts have stalled or not yet met the White House’s lofty goals, the administration has dramatically reshaped the machinery of government to target unauthorized immigrants in the country, deter unauthorized border arrivals, make the status of many legally resident immigrants more tenuous, and impose obstacles for lawful entry of large swaths of international travelers and would-be immigrants,” MPI’s Muzaffar Chishti, Kathleen Bush-Joseph and Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh wrote in their Jan. 13 article, “Unleashing Power in New Ways: Immigration in the First Year of Trump 2.0.” The “net change,” the authors wrote, “has been dizzying in its scope and speed.”

The Trump administration has “dismantled longstanding norms,” the authors wrote, invoking “archaic statutes,” enlisting “support from state and local law enforcement as well as federal agencies that historically had no immigration enforcement role,” and pressuring “foreign governments to receive deportees,” the MPI report stated. “Perhaps most visibly, it militarized immigration enforcement.”

Trump has achieved his policy mostly through executive actions, rather than with legislative help, something he has boasted about repeatedly.

“Remember Biden, he said I have to get approval from Congress,” Trump said in a speech in Detroit on Jan. 13. “Had nothing to do with Congress, had to do with respect.”

In one of his first actions upon taking office in January 2025, Trump issued a proclamation that “the current situation at the southern border qualifies as an invasion under Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitution of the United States.” He mostly blocked migrants’ ability to request asylum. He canceled humanitarian parole programs that the Biden administration extended to Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. And he reinstated the “Remain in Mexico” policy, so that asylum seekers were sent to Mexico to await their court appearances in the U.S.

In December, Trump paused all asylum decisions at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. And on Jan. 14, the president indefinitely paused the processing of immigrant visas for 75 nations, including Afghanistan, Brazil, Egypt, Iran, Nigeria, Russia, Thailand, Somalia and Yemen. He had previously issued a full or partial ban on travel from 39 countries.

MPI estimated that in the first year of his second term, Trump has taken more than 500 actions on immigration including 38 executive orders and “hundreds of other actions via presidential proclamations and policy guidance.” That’s more actions than in all four years of Trump’s first term, MPI said.

But Congress has provided some help. In July, Republicans passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which included more than $170 billion to ramp up immigration enforcement, detention and deportation.

Increasingly, the administration has turned its attention to interior enforcement. According to MPI, “U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests have more than quadrupled since Trump took office, while average daily detention has doubled.”

In December, the Department of Homeland Security reported that its enforcement operations have resulted in more than 622,000 deportations since January 2025 (short of the stated goal of at least 1 million per year). And, DHS said, another “1.9 million illegal aliens have voluntarily self-deported,” some of whom were lured by government incentives — a free flight home and $1,000. MPI said the Trump administration hasn’t provided any data to back up that self-deportation claim.

A New York Times analysis of federal data disputed the administration’s figures, with its Jan. 17 analysis, covering Trump’s first year, estimating the number of deportations at 540,000, including 230,000 people who were detained inside the country, 270,000 deported at the border and 40,000 who signed up for the government incentives to self-deport. The Times speculated that the administration’s 622,000 figure “likely includes all repatriations carried out by various homeland security subagencies,” such as ship crews that are barred from disembarking.

Both the Times and MPI noted that DHS hasn’t released detailed, public reports on these statistics, as it has in the past.

In any case, the Times noted the number of deportations lagged the number in Biden’s last two years in office: 590,000 total deportations in 2023 and 650,000 in 2024, when border apprehensions were much higher than they are now. The number of people Trump has deported from inside the country, 230,000, is far higher than the 50,000 deported from inside the country in 2024.

Refugees

In his first term, Trump sharply reduced refugee admissions. But now they have nearly stopped entirely.

As we wrote last year, Trump signed an executive order on his first day back in office that called for a “realignment” of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, including an indefinite suspension of all admissions until the program “aligns with the interests of the United States.”

There have been few exceptions to the new refugee policy – notably for refugees from South Africa’s white minority Afrikaner ethnic group. In making an exception for Afrikaners, Trump claimed there was “a genocide that’s taking place” against white farmers in the country – which, as we wrote, distorts the facts.

Beginning in February, the U.S. has admitted only 1,226 refugees in Trump’s first full 11 months in office – including 1,059 refugees from South Africa, according to State Department data.

By contrast, the U.S. admitted 70,033 during the same 11-month period, from February 2024 through December 2024, under Biden. That’s a staggering 98% decline.

For fiscal year 2026, which began Oct. 1, 2025, Trump placed a cap of 7,500 on refugee admissions – which is far fewer than the 125,000 cap Biden instituted for fiscal year 2025. It’s also much less than the 45,000 cap that Trump placed on refugees in fiscal year 2018, which was his first full fiscal year as president during his first term.

Other than refugees from South Africa, Trump was forced by a court ruling to admit some refugees who had plans to resettle in the U.S. when he suspended the program.

As we wrote, an appeals court ruled (in a clarifying opinion issued April 21) that refugees who had an “approved refugee application” and “had arranged and confirmable travel plans” on or before Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order can enter the country. About 160 refugees were affected by that decision, a spokesman for the International Refugee Assistance Project told us for an article in September.

Most of the non-South Africans admitted last year came from Afghanistan. The U.S. admitted 100 Afghan refugees in the past 11 months, the State Department data show.

In addition to suspending the refugee program, Trump more recently has threatened to deport refugees who settled in Minnesota, citing an ongoing fraud investigation in that city.

In a Jan. 9 statement, the Department of Homeland Security said it is “reexamining thousands of refugee cases through new background checks and intensive verification of refugee claims,” beginning with “Minnesota’s 5,600 refugees who have not yet been given lawful permanent resident status (Green Cards).”

Trade

The international trade deficit, which Trump criticized for reaching record levels under Biden, decreased only slightly in the months since Trump took office for his second term.

Through his first full nine months in office, the U.S. imported $654 billion more in goods and services than it exported, according to the most recent data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That’s about 0.9% less than the $659.7 billion gap between U.S. imports and exports during the same period in 2024.

The full impact of Trump’s new tariff policies on the trade imbalance is still to be determined. The New York Times noted that “because of a surge in imports earlier this year,” to avoid import tariffs that later went into effect, “the overall trade deficit from January to October was still up 7.7 percent from the previous year.”

Also, when the goods and services trade deficit for the month of October went down 60% year-over-year to $29.4 billion, the lowest monthly total since June 2009, the Times said that some economists attributed the decrease to “temporary fluctuations in trade in certain products, like gold and pharmaceuticals.”

Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, told the newspaper: “Cutting through the noise and getting to the underlying signal in the data, it suggests to me that the deficit is as large as its ever been.”

Corporate Profits

Corporate profits set records each year under Biden, but dipped in the first quarter under Trump before rebounding slightly in the second quarter and recovering fully in the third quarter.

The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that after-tax corporate profits at an annual rate were $3.59 trillion in the third quarter of 2025 – about $91 billion, or 2.6%, higher than the full-year figure for 2024.

The fourth quarter and annual figures for last year won’t be released until March, so it is still unclear if after-tax corporate profits for the full year will be up or down.

Under Biden, the annual average growth was 31% in 2021, 3.8% in 2022, 7.8% in 2023 and 7.9% in 2024, according to BEA data.

Stock Market

The stock market, which set records during Biden’s presidency, reached new heights again under Trump.

The S&P 500, which is made up of 500 large-cap companies, closed at 15.7% higher on Jan. 16 than it was three days before Trump’s inauguration in January 2025.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, made up of 30 large corporations, was up 13.5% over that same period.

And the Nasdaq composite index, comprising more than 3,000 companies, many in the technology sector, surged by almost 19.8% in that time frame.

These gains followed ample market increases during the Biden administration, when the S&P rose 57.8%, the Dow Jones went up 40.6%, and the Nasdaq increased by almost half.

Food Stamps

After a slight increase in enrollment during Biden’s presidency, the latest data from the Department of Agriculture show that under Trump fewer people are accessing benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps.

About 41.6 million people were receiving federal food assistance in September, according to preliminary USDA figures published last month. The number has gone down by about 1.2 million participants, or 2.8%, since Trump took office.

The number of individuals benefiting from SNAP is expected to decline further because of the Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which changed eligibility requirements for SNAP and is estimated to reduce federal spending on the program. For example, the law extends work requirements to include “able-bodied adults without dependents” aged 55 to 64, who were previously exempt.

In August, the Congressional Budget Office said that provisions in the law “will reduce participation in SNAP by roughly 2.4 million people in an average month over the 2025-2034 period.”

Crime

We won’t have annual 2025 crime data from the FBI until the fall. But other reports on part of the year show violent crime has continued to drop, a trend that began in 2022 after a spike in crime, particularly murders, in 2020.

AH Datalytics, an independent criminal justice data analysis group, produces a Real-Time Crime Index, an aggregation of crime data collected from 570 law enforcement agencies. That index shows a 19.8% decline in the number of murders for January to October 2025 compared with the same period in 2024. Longer term, the index shows the number of murders jumped in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, then leveled off and has been dropping since 2022.

The latest report from the Major Cities Chiefs Association, which compares Jan. 1 to Sept. 30, 2025, to the same period in the prior year, similarly found a 19.1% decline in the number of murders for 67 law enforcement agencies. The number of rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults also went down, with the latter decreasing by 10%.

A midyear 2025 report by the Council on Criminal Justice on 42 cities, which consistently published data since 2019, found the same trend, with crime levels now mostly below pre-pandemic levels. “Examining trends over a longer timeframe, violent crimes are below levels seen in the first half of 2019, the year prior to the onset of the COVID pandemic and racial justice protests of 2020,” the CCJ report said. It noted, though, that the drop in murders has been concentrated in a few cities.

“Much of the decline in the national homicide rate, which began in late 2022, has been driven by large drops in a few sample cities with high homicide levels, such as Baltimore and St. Louis,” CCJ said in a press release about its findings. “The most recent data show that all of the sample cities are now below the general peak of 2020 to 2021, but more than 60% continue to experience homicide levels above pre-2020 rates.”

Gun Sales

After reaching a record high in 2020, estimated gun sales declined every year that Biden was president. That downward trend continued during Trump’s first year back in office.

The government doesn’t collect data on gun sales. But the National Shooting Sports Foundation — the gun industry’s trade group — estimates gun sales by tracking the number of background checks for firearm sales based on the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The NSSF-adjusted figures exclude background checks unrelated to sales, such as those required for concealed-carry permits.

According to NSSF, the number of background checks for gun purchases in 2025 was roughly 14.6 million – down 4.1% from about 15.2 million in 2024. But the 2025 total was still higher than the almost 13.2 million estimated sales in 2019, before the pandemic.

Meanwhile, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has yet to publish its annual manufacturing figures, so we don’t know whether firearm production, specifically of handguns, increased or decreased in 2025.

Debt and Deficits

Trump’s campaign pledge that “we’re going to actually start paying off debt” hasn’t happened yet. The publicly held debt increased by about one-third on Biden’s watch and continued to rise during the first year of Trump’s second term.

As of Jan. 14, the debt held by the public, which excludes money the federal government owes to itself, was almost $30.8 trillion – up about 6.7% from more than $28.8 trillion on Jan. 17, 2025, three days before he took office.

Another annual deficit – close to $1.8 trillion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 – was a key factor. It was the fourth highest fiscal deficit of all time (behind FY 2020, FY 2021 and FY 2024) and the sixth consecutive budget gap of more than $1 trillion.

Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency had promised to cut federal spending by at least $1 trillion, a goal it did not achieve. Instead, federal spending went up a bit in fiscal 2025.

And, so far, the U.S. appears headed for another debt-increasing deficit in FY 2026 – although perhaps a smaller one. From October through December, the first quarter of the current fiscal cycle, the CBO said that federal outlays exceeded revenues by $601 billion. That’s about $110 billion less than the deficit in the same quarter of fiscal 2025.

Oil Production and Imports

Trump campaigned on a promise that the U.S. would “drill, baby, drill” during a second Trump term, and on his first day back in office, he signed an executive order with a stated goal of “unleashing American energy.”

As of October, U.S. crude oil production had increased to an average of 13.6 million barrels per day in Trump’s first full nine months in the White House, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That’s up almost 2.5% from the same nine-month period in 2024.

Before Trump was inaugurated, and before any of his policies were in place, the EIA had already projected in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook that average daily production would increase to a record 13.5 million barrels a day in 2025.

U.S. crude oil imports are trending in the opposite direction.

Imports were down to an average of about 6.1 million barrels per day during Trump’s first full nine months — a decrease of 6.9% from nearly 6.6 million barrels per day during the comparable period a year earlier. During the Biden years, average imports increased annually.

Carbon Emissions

EIA data also show a small increase in U.S. carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption under Trump

There were approaching 3.2 billion metric tons of emissions from the consumption of coal, natural gas and various petroleum products in his first full eight months in office. That was roughly 1.4% more than the over 3.1 billion metric tons that were emitted from consuming those energy sources during the same stretch in 2024.

In early January 2025, the EIA projected that CO2 emissions would increase slightly in 2025, but remain in the ballpark of 4.8 billion metric tons emitted in 2024. The agency said it expected emissions growth due to the increased consumption of petroleum products across multiple sectors, particularly the use of diesel fuel and jet fuel.

Emissions had declined in 2023 and 2024 after increasing in Biden’s first two years as president.

Health Insurance

We don’t yet have data on how health insurance coverage has changed so far under Trump’s second term. Typically, the National Health Interview Survey has released quarterly preliminary reports on the insurance status of Americans. But the NHIS’ website now says that as of 2025, the data will only be released biannually.

The latest report, posted in June 2025, covers calendar year 2024. The NHIS is a project of the National Center for Health Statistics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

A report on estimates from the survey for January to June 2025 is scheduled to be released on Jan. 30.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Trump signed into law in July, is expected to prompt a rise in the number of people who lack health insurance, starting next year. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the uninsured would increase by 10 million people over 10 years, with most of the increase due to the law’s changes to Medicaid. For 2026, the rise was estimated at 1.3 million people. (See the link to estimated changes in people without health insurance.)

In 2024, the last year of Biden’s term, 8.2% of the population, or 27.2 million people, were uninsured, according to the NHIS’ estimates, which measure those uninsured at the time they were interviewed. A Census Bureau report, released in September and measuring those who were uninsured for the entire calendar year, similarly put the uninsured rate at 8%.

Under Biden’s full term, the percentage and number of Americans who are uninsured declined, as we explained in our “Biden’s Final Numbers” report.

Judiciary Appointments

In his first term, Trump filled one-third of the Supreme Court, nearly 30% of the appeals court seats and nearly 26% of District Court seats. So far in his second term, the judiciary confirmation numbers lag a bit behind those in Biden’s first year.

Supreme Court — There hasn’t been a vacancy on the Supreme Court during the first year of Trump’s second term, just as there wasn’t a vacancy in Biden’s first year.

Court of Appeals — As of Jan. 16, Trump has won confirmation for six U.S. Court of Appeals judges. At the same point in his term, Biden had won confirmation for 12.

District Court — Twenty-one Trump nominees to be District Court judges have been confirmed, while 29 were confirmed at the same point in Biden’s first year.

Two U.S. Court of Federal Claims judges also were confirmed in Biden’s first year. None have been confirmed so far under Trump, and there are no vacancies for such positions.

As of Jan. 16, there were no vacancies for Court of Appeals judges, 39 for District Court judges with five nominees pending, and one vacancy for the international trade court.

If you have questions about the implications of this decision or the emerging standards governing AI use in litigation, our team is available to assist.","In Deutsche Bank National Trust Company v. LeTennier, the Appellate Division, Third Department issued a significant published decision that not only affirms the challenged orders, leaving the foreclosure judgment in favor of the lender in place, but also constitutes the first appellate‑level case in New York to address sanctions arising from the misuse of generative AI in legal submissions.

Hinshaw partners Ellis Oster and Robert Bailey represented the lender in this appeal.

Background

The underlying foreclosure action had already been the subject of extensive motion practice, including numerous post‑judgment attempts by the borrower to vacate or relitigate issues that had long been resolved.

The borrower continued to challenge the lender’s standing despite the Appellate Division’s prior ruling in 2020 affirming summary judgment in the lender’s favor.

When the borrower later appealed several subsequent orders—including the denial of his motion to vacate the judgment—the Appellate Division held that these challenges were either meritless or abandoned.

The Court Identifies Extensive Use of Fabricated, AI‑Generated Case Law

What distinguishes this decision is the court’s detailed examination of the borrower’s and his counsel’s reliance on fabricated legal authorities. Across multiple appellate filings, counsel submitted more than 20 non‑existent case citations generated by AI, as well as misstatements of law drawn from real cases. The court found that this conduct was frivolous under 22 NYCRR 130‑1.1.

Although the decision acknowledges that generative AI tools can have legitimate uses in legal practice, it warns that attorneys remain responsible for verifying the accuracy of any material included in court submissions. The court emphasized that reliance on generative AI does not relieve counsel of their professional and ethical duties, particularly the obligation to ensure that all authorities cited actually exist and accurately reflect the law.

Sanctions Imposed

Given the seriousness and persistence of the misconduct, the court imposed:

$7,500 sanction on the borrower’s counsel, and

$2,500 sanction on the borrower himself.

Notably, the court observed that counsel increased his use of fake, AI-generated legal authorities even after being placed on notice about the problem, which the court found particularly concerning.

Why This Decision Matters

This opinion places New York squarely within the growing national dialogue on the responsible use of generative AI in litigation. As the first appellate‑level decision in the state to address sanctions for misuse of AI‑generated content, it provides important guidance to litigants and practitioners.

The ruling aligns with the emerging expectation across jurisdictions that generative AI may be used by litigants, but only with appropriate human oversight, verification, and accountability.

For lenders, servicers, and financial institutions, the decision also reaffirms the stability of prior standing determinations, prevents continued re-litigation of settled issues, and reinforces courts’ willingness to sanction frivolous foreclosure‑related tactics.

Conclusion

Deutsche Bank National Trust Company v. LeTennier establishes a meaningful precedent in New York’s appellate jurisprudence, both in the foreclosure context and in the rapidly evolving area of AI‑related legal ethics. Hinshaw attorneys Ellis Oster and Robert Bailey were pleased to secure this result on behalf of their lender client.

(WPRI) — In his first executive order of the year, Mayor Brett Smiley has unveiled an executive order aimed at making it more difficult for federal immigration authorities to conduct enforcement operations in Providence.

The move comes on the one year anniversary of President Donald Trump’s inauguration, and just months after Smiley signed an executive order reaffirming that Providence police are not allowed to assist federal immigration authorities.

The executive order titled, “Prohibiting the Use of City Property for Civil Immigration Enforcement Activities,” states that city-owned parking lots, garages, parks, or buildings can’t be used as a “staging area, processing location, operations base, or other support for civil immigration enforcement,” unless authorities are executing “lawful judicial warrants.”

“The federal actions we are seeing across the nation are threatening immigrant communities and causing fear and uncertainty for all of our neighbors,” Smiley said Monday. “Providence’s strength comes from our diverse immigrant communities, and we will continue to do everything we can to protect families and maintain trust across our neighborhoods.”

The order also stated that city property can’t be used to assemble, mobilize or deploy vehicles, equipment, materials or personnel for the purpose of carrying out civil immigration enforcement operations.

The city will also install signage on properties that would fall under the executive order, stating that they may not be used for civil immigration enforcement.

The directive also says the city will also provide “standardized signage templates” to private landowners and leaseholders, “if they choose, for display to identify the nonpublic areas of the property in which the landowner or lease holder wishes to restrict activities related to civil immigration enforcement.”

Private landowners and leaseholders can use signs “at their own discretion and assume any legal risk associated therewith,” according to the executive order.

In his last executive order, Smiley reaffirmed that the city is meant to be a “safe and welcoming place for all,” and that Providence police are not allowed to assist federal immigration authorities.

Less than a week ago, President Trump announced his administration will strip federal funding from sanctuary cities and states.

“EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY FIRST, NO MORE PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO STATES FOR THEIR CORRUPT CRIMINAL PROTECTION CENTERS KNOWN AS SANCTUARY CITIES,” the president wrote in a post on Truth Social.

In August, Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to 32 sanctuary jurisdictions, including Rhode Island, that were deemed noncompliant with federal immigration laws.

""Any injunction here would unduly interfere with federal immigration enforcement,"" lawyers for the Trump administration said in a court filing, adding that such relief would ""effectively give Minnesota state and local officials veto power over federal immigration enforcement within the borders of Minnesota.""

The Justice Department said on Jan. 18 that it would appeal the injunction.","The Department of Justice asked a federal judge in Minnesota to allow the Trump administration's immigration operations to continue as tensions simmer over the tactics used by federal officers throughout the state.

The Jan. 19 filing was in response to a lawsuit filed last week by Minnesota and the Twin Cities, which sought to stop the deployment of immigration agents, saying the intervention violated the state's constitutional rights. U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez declined to issue an immediate restraining order expelling some 3,000 federal agents from Minnesota.

""Any injunction here would unduly interfere with federal immigration enforcement,"" lawyers for the Trump administration said in a court filing, adding that such relief would ""effectively give Minnesota state and local officials veto power over federal immigration enforcement within the borders of Minnesota.""

The back and forth comes after nearly two weeks of protests in the state following the killing of Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer. The fatal shooting sparked demonstrations nationwide and has deepened fissures between federal and state officials.

Menendez, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden in 2021, is also presiding over a case brought in December on behalf of six Minnesota activists who said federal agents violated their constitutional rights and used excessive force against demonstrators.

In that case, Menendez barred agents from using tactics such as pepper spray and arrest against peaceful protesters in Minnesota. In her order, Menendez said the record indicates that agents engaged in ""chilling conduct,"" including the ""drawing and pointing of weapons; the use of pepper spray and other non-lethal munitions; actual and threatened arrest and detainment of protesters and observers; and other intimidation tactics.""

The Justice Department said on Jan. 18 that it would appeal the injunction.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, speaking on CBS News' ""Face the Nation,"" called Menendez's order ""a little ridiculous"" and said it didn't ""change anything for how we're operating on the ground.""

In Minneapolis, skirmishes have increasingly broken out between protesters and federal officers across the city. Over the weekend, demonstrators interrupted a church service, claiming that one of the church's pastors is an ICE agent.

The Justice Department, which has said there is no basis to investigate the officer who fatally shot Good, launched a probe into the protest, citing potential civil rights violations. President Donald Trump, who has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act and deploy troops to Minnesota, on Jan. 20 called for the arrests and potential deportation of those involved in the demonstration.

Hicks said neither city nor state officials were informed before plans were already well underway.

The facility would be operated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement as part of what the Trump administration describes as a ramped-up enforcement effort targeting people living in the country illegally.

According to reporting from The Oklahoman, the plan involves converting an empty warehouse near Interstate 40 and Council Road into a detention and processing center, and federal officials did not notify city or state leaders beforehand because federal law does not require it.

State Sen. Carri Hicks, whose district includes parts of Oklahoma City, said the lack of notice immediately raised concerns.

“It really caused me a lot of concern,” Hicks said.

Hicks said neither city nor state officials were informed before plans were already well underway.

“I’m an elected official and lots of people have questions and are justly concerned that this could be already developed and in plans for implementation,” Hicks said.

Discussion of a possible detention center at the warehouse began last month after The Washington Post reported ICE planned to purchase warehouses nationwide to detain as many as 80,000 people.

On Sunday, The Oklahoman reported the U.S. Department of Homeland Security sent a letter to city officials outlining plans for a small-scale processing center that could hold up to 1,500 detainees arrested by ICE.

Within a day of that report, anti-ICE signs appeared outside the building.

“Folks weren’t notified. Community didn’t even have awareness that this was undergoing plans,” Hicks said. “It’s not a rumor. We’ve seen the developed plans and we know that this is coming to that particular location.”

Hicks said her concerns center on what she describes as a lack of accountability and due process in ICE’s recent enforcement actions.

“At the heart of it, we have a federal immigration policy—and what we’re currently seeing is not an extension of what we know to be the processes in which folks can come here legally and receive their immigration status and become citizens of the United States of America,” Hicks said.

News 4 previously reported on an ICE raid in Oklahoma City last April in which agents searched a home public records showed their suspect had already sold and moved out of, leaving the new family living there traumatized.

“There are some terrible and very troubling stories that continue to occur,” Hicks said, “Particularly in the south side.”

The proposed detention center would sit in a commercial district along a busy roadway and was not originally designed to house detainees.

“It’s less than two miles from Western Heights School District, where about 50% of the students are Hispanic,” Hicks said. “So as I’m thinking about those students and I’m thinking about the parents and I’m thinking about the impact to that local community, it is appalling.”

Hicks said she wants federal officials to abandon the plan altogether.

“We don’t want your detention facility,” Hicks said. “If there are specific individuals that have warrants who absolutely need to be apprehended to protect public safety, then continue to do things through our normal way of operations, continue to make sure that these are targeted operations and not community-wide sweeps that throw everything into turmoil, because when the federal government leaves, our city will be left holding the price tag of diverting public services or public safety resources, and the fallout will be immense, and we, as the local residents, will be left with that fallout.”

Because of the federal holiday, News 4 has been unable to reach anyone with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for comment.

Agents eventually realized that he was a U.S. citizen with no criminal record, Thao said, and an hour or two later, they brought him back to his house.
There they made him show his ID and then left without apologizing for detaining him or breaking his door, Thao said.
“The US citizen lives with these two convicted sex offenders at the site of the operation,” DHS said.
Thao's son, Chris Thao, said ICE agents stopped him while he was driving to work before they went to detain his father.","Federal immigration agents forced open a door and detained a U.S. citizen in his Minnesota home at gunpoint without a warrant, then led him out onto the streets in his underwear in subfreezing conditions, according to his family and videos reviewed by The Associated Press.

ChongLy “Scott” Thao told the AP that his daughter-in-law woke him up from a nap Sunday afternoon and said that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were banging at the door of his residence in St. Paul. He told her not to open it. Masked agents then forced their way in and pointed guns at the family, yelling at them, Thao recalled.

“I was shaking,"" he said. “They didn't show any warrant; they just broke down the door.""

Amid a massive surge of federal agents into the Twin Cities, immigration authorities are facing backlash from residents and the local leaders for warrantless arrests, aggressive clashes with protestors and the fatal shooting of mother of three Renee Good.

“ICE is not doing what they say they’re doing,” St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, a Hmong American, said in a statement about Thao's arrest. “They’re not going after hardened criminals. They’re going after anyone and everyone in their path. It is unacceptable and un-American.”

Encounter caught on video

Thao, who has been a U.S. citizen for decades, said that as he was being detained he asked his daughter-in-law to find his identification but the agents told him they didn’t want to see it.

Instead, as his 4-year-old grandson watched and cried, Thao was led out in handcuffs wearing only sandals and underwear with just a blanket wrapped around his shoulders.

Videos captured the scene, which included people blowing whistles and horns and neighbors screaming at the more than a dozen gun-toting agents to leave Thao's family alone.

Thao said agents drove him “to the middle of nowhere"" and made him get out of the car in the frigid weather so they could photograph him. He said he feared they would beat him. He was asked for his ID, which agents earlier prevented him from retrieving.

Agents eventually realized that he was a U.S. citizen with no criminal record, Thao said, and an hour or two later, they brought him back to his house. There they made him show his ID and then left without apologizing for detaining him or breaking his door, Thao said.

DHS defends operation

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security described the ICE operation at Thao's home as a “targeted operation"" seeking two convicted sex offenders.

“The US citizen lives with these two convicted sex offenders at the site of the operation,” DHS said. “The individual refused to be fingerprinted or facially ID’d. He matched the description of the targets.”

Thao's family said in a statement that it “categorically disputes” the DHS account and “strongly objects to DHS’s attempt to publicly justify this conduct with false and misleading claims.”

Thao told the AP that only he, his son and daughter-in-law and his grandson live at the rental home. Neither they nor the property's owner are listed in the Minnesota sex offender registry. The nearest sex offender listed as living in the zip code is more than two blocks away.

DHS did not respond to a request from The Associated Press seeking the identities of the “two convicted sex offenders” or why the agency believed they were present in Thao's home.

Thao's son, Chris Thao, said ICE agents stopped him while he was driving to work before they went to detain his father. He said he was driving a car he borrowed from his cousin's boyfriend. Court records show that the boyfriend shares the first name of another Asian man who has been convicted of a sex offense. Chris Thao said the two people are not the same.

Family fled Laos after helping US

The family said they are particularly upset by ChongLy Thao’s treatment at the hands of the U.S. government because his mother had to flee to the U.S. from Laos when communists took over in the 1970s since she had supported American covert operations in the country and her life was in danger.

Thao's adopted mother, Choua Thao, was a nurse who treated CIA-backed Hmong soldiers in the U.S. government's “Secret War” from 1961 to 1975 against the communists, according to the Hmong Nurses Association website.

Choua Thao, who passed away in late December, ""treated countless civilians and American soldiers, working closely with U.S. personnel,"" her daughter-in-law Louansee Moua wrote on a GoFundMe page for the family.

ChongLy Thao says he's planning to file a civil rights lawsuit against DHS and no longer feels secure to sleep in his home.

“I don't feel safe at all,” Thao said. “What did I do wrong? I didn't do anything.”

Republicans control the House and Senate, albeit by slim margins, and not all Democrats are aligned on impeachment strategies.
So far in this Congress, a handful of Democratic House members have filed impeachment resolutions.
“There’s only one person responsible for the impeachment of Donald Trump, and that’s Donald Trump,” Pelosi said.
Other Democrats, meanwhile, are convinced that now is the time to look into impeachment — whether it’s destined to fail or not.","As outrage grew over the Trump administration’s immigration raids and the shooting death of a Minnesota woman at the hands of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, Rep. Robin Kelly, D-Ill., had had enough.

After consulting with key Democratic colleagues, she began pushing for impeachment proceedings against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in early January.

The decision drew mixed reactions. Two sources familiar with the response among Democratic lawmakers told MS NOW that, in a private meeting of top Democrats in early January, Rep. Susie Lee, D-Nev., blasted the move, saying it poses a problem for “frontliners” — members in swing seats — who must appeal to more than just Democratic voters.

As battleground leadership, Lee is responsible for voicing the perspective of the party’s most politically vulnerable members.

“It got really intense,” one of the sources said, speaking anonymously with MS NOW to discuss the sensitive moment. “People are trying to figure out how to handle it right now.”

The private moment is emblematic of a larger public problem vexing Democrats: Their base wants action amid a deluge of controversial actions from President Donald Trump and his administration, and Democratic leaders in Washington — charged with winning elections and appealing to as many Americans as possible — are trying not to alienate potential swing voters by being anti-Trump or pro-impeachment.

Not that Democrats could impeach anyone on their own right now, anyway.

Republicans control the House and Senate, albeit by slim margins, and not all Democrats are aligned on impeachment strategies. Even now, multiple Democratic members — including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who quipped that he was “no mathematician” but knew the numbers — told MS NOW the votes aren’t there to move on impeachment against any Trump officials.

But Jeffries also told reporters last week that Democrats “haven’t ruled anything in and … haven’t ruled anything out.”

“Everything is on the table from the standpoint of complete and total accountability,” he said.

As Democratic leaders consider their stance, they’ve asked members to coordinate with ranking members of key committees on any potential pushes against administration officials, both to avoid surprising colleagues and to work to build consensus.

So far in this Congress, a handful of Democratic House members have filed impeachment resolutions. There’s one against Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., on top of the new effort against Noem. Two members also tried to launch proceedings against Trump, who was impeached by the House twice in his first term — once for an alleged quid pro quo with Ukraine and then for his actions to foment an insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021. Republicans in the Senate acquitted him on both charges. And the latest resolutions died on the legislative vine last year.

Still, the threat against the president looms — including in Trump’s mind ahead of the midterms.

In remarks to House Republicans during their policy retreat earlier this month, Trump implored them to stay focused on winning the November midterm elections, because if they lose control of Congress, “they’ll find a reason to impeach me.”

But the question of accountability — how to do it and what it means — is central in this Trump era, forced into greater focus given that Democrats are in the minority with few levers of power to pull.

Do they shut down the government to oppose the “most lawless Department of Homeland Security,” as Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., has left open as a possibility? Do they offer articles of impeachment against Cabinet members? Would war powers resolutions, meant to restrain what the administration can do militarily, halt a march toward wars in Venezuela, Cuba and Greenland — even if Democrats could get Republicans on board to pass them?

At each new inflection point, there’s a dissonant response among Democrats.

Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told MS NOW in December that Trump “crossed the line” for impeachment in his first term, but suggested the actions of his second term so far don’t warrant the same reaction.

“There’s only one person responsible for the impeachment of Donald Trump, and that’s Donald Trump,” Pelosi said. “He gave us no choice, he crossed the line here and there.”

“The fact is,” she continued, “what we’re here to do is meet the needs of the American people. If he goes to a place, that’s a different story, but it isn’t something you go looking for.”

Recommended

Asked for his view on the same question a few weeks later, Murphy declined to advocate for the House starting an impeachment inquiry on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” But he said he has “common sense.”

“I know this president has committed 10 times more impeachable offenses in his second term as he did in his first term,” Murphy said.

On Capitol Hill, after Kelly’s impeachment resolution was announced, he dismissed questions from MS NOW about whether he supported the tactic.

Other Democrats, meanwhile, are convinced that now is the time to look into impeachment — whether it’s destined to fail or not.

“These individual actions are impeachable offenses in their own right, but their ever-mounting cumulative impact on our country’s stability and health puts everything in a new light,” Rep. April Delaney, D-Md., said in a statement after the U.S.’ military operation in Venezuela.

“I now believe that our Democratic caucus must imminently consider impeachment proceedings,” she added.

Beyond discussing whether impeachment would be an effort worth their time, some lawmakers also worry such a push — even a merited one — could backfire politically.

One House Democrat, granted anonymity to discuss the sensitive topic, said an impeachment push could be a “political distraction” from the top issues during this election cycle, including affordability and the cost of living.

“There are just some exuberant Democrats that are anxious to pull the trigger on impeachment, and there are many more of us who agree that a lot of impeachable stuff is happening on a weekly basis around here,” this Democratic lawmaker told MS NOW. “But it is futile to pretend that you’re actually going to do an impeachment in this Congress, and it could actually be counterproductive because it raises expectations among Democratic base voters that this is something we can actually deliver.”

“Two things can be true at the same time,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., told MS NOW last week.

She said Trump had “absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt” committed impeachable offenses. And she said “accountability needs to be a core part of our governance.”

But she also noted that she personally doesn’t run campaigns as “purely anti-Trump.”

“I’ve personally never run to represent my district on grounds of impeachment or not,” she said.

“I run for health care. My community wants to hear about raising the minimum wage, expanding unions, health, strengthening health care, and I think it’s important that we have an affirmative, positive vision for the country. But that doesn’t mean that we shy away from what needs to be done in terms of having accountability.”",https://www.ms.now/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/260119_Trump-Year-One-Impeachment-bk.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2026-01-20 13:58:24.307937

Three cardinals in the US Catholic church have criticized the Trump administration’s foreign policy, saying its push to obtain or otherwise seize Greenland, recent military action in Venezuela, and cuts to humanitarian aid risk “destroying international relations and plunging the world into incalculable suffering”.

“Our country’s moral role in confronting evil around the world, sustaining the right to life and human dignity, and supporting religious liberty are all under examination,” said a joint statement from Blase Cupich, Robert McElroy and Joseph Tobin, respectively the archbishops of Chicago, Washington DC, and Newark, New Jersey.

“And the building of just and sustainable peace, so crucial to humanity’s wellbeing now and in the future, is being reduced to partisan categories that encourage polarization and destructive policies,” it added.

Without naming Donald Trump, the statement on Monday continued: “We seek a foreign policy that respects and advances the right to human life, religious liberty, and the enhancement of human dignity throughout the world, especially through economic assistance.”

As we wait on today’s opinions from the supreme court, it’s worth remembering that justices on the bench appeared skeptical of the administration’s arguments justifying the use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to slap duties on dozens of countries, citing a national emergency. A reminder that the ability to institute taxes is a power normally only afforded to Congress.

In a spree of Truth Social posts overnight, Donald Trump posted an altered image of himself, planting a US flag in Greenland, alongside JD Vance and secretary of state Marco Rubio.

In another post, also featuring a doctored photo, it shows Trump behind the resolute desk speaking to European leaders while he shows off a map that shows an American flag covering the US, Canada and Greenland.

Trump’s campaign to acquire the autonomous territory, that remains part of the Kingdom of Denmark, has reached fever pitch in recent days after he threatened tariffs against allied countries who have spoken out against his moves on Greenland. We can expect more friction as the president heads to Davos today.

Earlier, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen repeatedly criticized Trump for his levy threats, saying they would be “a mistake” and could send the relations into “a downward spiral” that benefits geopolitical rivals. She also pledged her solidarity and support with Denmark and Greenland.

Second man dies at Texas ICE detention facility in two weeks

Victoria Bekiempis

A second man being held at a US immigration detention facility in Texas has died in two weeks, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said on Monday.

Victor Manuel Diaz, 36, originally from Nicaragua, was found “unconscious and unresponsive in his room” on 14 January at the Camp East Montana detention facility in El Paso, ICE said in a press release.

“They immediately notified contract medical staff on site to conduct life saving measures,” it said, adding that emergency medical technicians arrived to the facility but could not revive Diaz, who was pronounced dead just after 4pm. ICE asserted that Diaz “died of a presumed suicide” but that the “official cause of his death remains under investigation”.

Diaz was detained on 6 January during the Trump administration’s controversial deportation blitz in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He initially entered the US through the Mexican border in March of 2024, when border patrol agents picked him up and he was given a court date with an immigration judge, then released on parole.

On 26 August of last year an immigration judge ordered Diaz’s removal “in absentia”. ICE detained him on 12 January in order to deport him. The extensive tent facility is located on the Fort Bliss military base in El Paso …

Another man, Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, who immigrated to the US from Cuba, died in the same detention camp on 3 January. ICE said Campos was “experiencing medical distress” and that staff provided emergency treatment in the hopes of saving him. His death is potentially being investigated as a homicide.

Judge refuses to block new DHS policy limiting Congress members’ access to ICE facilities

Yohannes Lowe

In other news, a federal judge has refused to temporarily block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring a week’s notice before members of Congress can visit – and thereby inspect – immigration detention facilities.

Judge Jia M. Cobb of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia concluded that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) didn’t violate an earlier court order when it reimposed a seven-day notice requirement for congressional oversight visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities (you can read her judgment here).

Judge Cobb, an appointee of Democratic former president Joe Biden, had blocked a virtually identical policy by the DHS last month, citing a clause in the appropriations law that funds the department and requires facilities to be open to congressional scrutiny.

However, ICE reestablished the visitation policy on 8 January 2026, with the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, ordering the DHS to re-impose the seven-day notice requirement – but “exclusively with money appropriated by the (One Big Beautiful Bill Act),” not regular appropriations, effectively bypassing the previous court order.

The background to this is that last June, a dozen House Democrats who were blocked from visiting immigration detention facilities sued the Trump administration, accusing it of unlawfully obstructing their efforts to visit federal immigration detention centers.

Members of Congress had tried to visit the facilities amid reports of inhumane and unsanitary conditions. Thirty-two people died in ICE custody last year, the highest number of fatalities in two decades. At least five people have reportedly died in ICE custody so far this year.

In her ruling on Monday, Judge Cobb said the plaintiffs’ attorneys representing Democratic members of Congress used the wrong “procedural vehicle” to challenge the new policy and said the lawmakers would need to revise their complaint. She did not rule on the legality of the policy.

US supreme court to hear challenge to Hawaii’s strict gun law

Hawaii, which has some of the strictest gun laws in the United States, will see its regulations challenged before the supreme court on Tuesday.

The court will consider the legality of the state’s law that bans people from bringing firearms on private property open to the public unless they have permission from the property owner.

The case, Wolford v Lopez, was brought by three Maui residents with concealed-carry permits and a local gun group.

US supreme court ruling on Trump's tariffs could come as early as Tuesday

Yohannes Lowe

Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of US politics. The much-anticipated US supreme court ruling on the legality of Donald Trump’s tariffs is expected in the coming weeks, and possibly as early as Tuesday, according to the Reuters news agency.

Those challenging the tariffs, which include some small businesses and US states, argue the president exceeded his authority when imposing the sweeping levies last year.

Two lower courts have already found that the president did not have the authority to impose global tariffs, which were brought in using emergency powers allowing the president to issue immediate orders and bypass Congress.

The supreme court, which is dominated by conservative justices, could throw out the tariffs – the cornerstone of Trump’s economic agenda – and force the president to send refunds to the US importers that paid them.

But if the supreme court does rule Trump overstepped his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose the tariffs, the White House has other ways it can bring in import taxes.

In a 15 January interview with the NY Times published on Monday, the US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, said the administration would “start the next day” to replace the tariffs with other levies if the ruling went against Trump.

“The reality is the president is going to have tariffs as part of his trade policy going forward,” Greer said. Last week, Trump said it would be “a complete mess” if the court were to strike down his trade tariffs, which he said would be difficult to reverse because businesses and countries could claim refunds.

Hiring bonuses of $50,000. Swelling ranks of ICE officers, to 22,000, in an expanding national force bigger than most police departments in America.

President Donald Trump promised the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history, but achieving his goal wouldn't have been possible without funding from the big tax and spending cuts bill passed by Republicans in Congress, and it's fueling unprecedented immigration enforcement actions in cities like Minneapolis and beyond.

The GOP's big bill is ""supercharging ICE,"" one budget expert said, in ways that Americans may not fully realize — and that have only just begun.

""I just don't think people have a sense of the scale,"" said Bobby Kogan, senior director of federal budget policy at the Center for American Progress and a former adviser to the Biden administration's Office of Management and Budget.

""We're looking at ICE in a way we've never seen before,"" he said.

Trump's big bill creates massive law enforcement force

As the Republican president marks the first year of his second term, the immigration enforcement and removal operation that has been a cornerstone of his domestic and foreign policy agenda is rapidly transforming into something else — a national law enforcement presence with billions upon billions of dollars in new spending from U.S. taxpayers.

The shooting death of Renee Good in Minneapolis showed the alarming reach of the new federalized force, sparking unrelenting protests against the military-styled officers seen going door to door to find and detain immigrants. Amid the outpouring of opposition, Trump revived threats to invoke the Insurrection Act to quell the demonstrations and the U.S. Army has 1,500 soldiers ready to deploy.

But Trump's own public approval rating on immigration, one of his signature issues, has slipped since he took office, according to an AP-NORC poll.

""Public sentiment is everything,"" said Rep. Nydia M. Velázquez, D-N.Y., at a press conference at the Capitol with lawmakers supporting legislation to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

Americans, she said, are upset at what they are seeing. ""They didn't sign on for this,"" she said.

Border crossings down, but Americans confront new ICE enforcements

To be sure, illegal crossings into the U.S. at the Mexico border have fallen to historic lows under Trump, a remarkable shift from just a few years ago when President Joe Biden's Democratic administration allowed millions of people to temporarily enter the U.S. as they adjudicated their claims to stay.

Yet as enforcement moves away from the border, the newly hired army of immigration officers swarming city streets with aggressive tactics — in Los Angeles, Chicago and elsewhere — is something not normally seen in the U.S.

Armed and masked law enforcement officers are being witnessed smashing car windows, yanking people from vehicles and chasing and wrestling others to the ground and hauling them away — images playing out in endless loops on TVs and other screens.

And it's not just ICE. A long list of supporting agencies, including federal, state and local police and sheriff's offices, are entering into contract partnerships with Homeland Security to conduct immigration enforcement operations in communities around the nation.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has warned Democrats that this is ""no time to be playing games"" by stirring up the opposition to immigration enforcement officers in Minneapolis and other places.

""They need to get out of the way and allow federal law enforcement to do its duty,"" Johnson said at the Capitol.

Noem has said the immigration enforcement officers are acting lawfully. The department insists it's targeting criminals in the actions, what officials call the worst of the worst immigrants.

However, reports show that non-criminals and U.S. citizens are also being forcibly detained by immigration officers. The Supreme Court last year lifted a ban on using race alone in the immigration stops.

Trump last month called Somali immigrants ""garbage,"" comments that echoed his past objections to immigrants from certain countries.

The Trump administration has set a goal of 100,000 detentions a day, about three times what's typical, with 1 million deportations a year.

Money from the big bill flows with few restraints

With Republican control of Congress, the impeachment of Noem or any other Trump official is not a viable political option for Democrats, who would not appear to have the vote tally even among their own ranks.

In fact, even if Congress wanted to curtail Trump's immigration operations — by threatening to shut down the government, for example — it would be difficult to stop the spend.

What Trump called the ""big, beautiful bill"" is essentially on autopilot through 2029, the year he's scheduled to finish his term and leave office.

The legislation essentially doubled annual Homeland Security funding, adding $170 billion to be used over four years. Of that, ICE, which typically receives about $10 billion a year, was provided $30 billion for operations and $45 billion for detention facilities.

""The first thing that comes to mind is spending on this level is typically done on the military,"" said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. ""Trump is militarizing immigration enforcement.""

Ahead, Congress will need to consider routine funding for Homeland Security by Jan. 30 or risk a partial shutdown in some operations. The GOP's version of the annual bill would provide about $92 billion for the agency, including $10 billion for ICE. A growing group of Democratic senators and the Congressional Progressive Caucus have had enough. They say they won't support additional funds without significant changes.

Lawmakers are considering various restrictions on ICE operations, including limiting arrests around hospitals, courthouses, churches and other sensitive locations and ensuring that officers display proper identification and refrain from wearing face masks.

""I think ICE needs to be totally torn down,"" said Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., on CNN over the weekend.

""People want immigration enforcement that goes after criminals,"" he said. And not what he called this ""goon squad.""

Big spending underway, but Trump falls short of goals

Meanwhile, Homeland Security has begun tapping the new money at its disposal. The department informed Congress it has obligated roughly $58 billion — most of that, some $37 billion, for border wall construction, according to a person familiar with the private assessment but unauthorized to discuss it.

The Department of Homeland Security said its massive recruitment campaign blew past its 10,000-person target to bring in 12,000 new hires, more than doubling the force to 22,000 officers, in a matter of months.

""The good news is that thanks to the Big Beautiful Bill that President Trump signed, we have an additional 12,000 ICE officers and agents on the ground across the country,"" Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a December statement.

The department also announced it had arrested and deported about 600,000 people. It also said 1.9 million other people had ""voluntarily self-deported"" since January 2025, when Trump took office.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260120-minneapolis-immigration-mn-0945-00ab0e.jpg",N,,2026-01-20 11:01:13.387295

Yet he’s been speaking out against the administration’s immigration enforcement methods, particularly to fellow conservatives and others who voted for Trump.
But this wasn’t the kind of immigration enforcement the campaign had promised, he said.","Frustrated with the way the country was headed, Pablo Payan cast a ballot for Donald Trump in 2024, mainly drawn to the Republican presidential candidate’s pledge to bring economic strength to the nation as well as an America First mindset.

The father of four from Merrillville usually favored Democrats in the past but was hoping for a nationwide change of direction. Less foreign aid. More border security. Lower inflation. Greater economic growth.

Yet roughly a year into Trump’s second presidency, Payan has buyer’s remorse.

“I did vote for Trump. But now I regret it,” Payan said. “He’s contradicting everything he said he would do. And now it’s extremism. And immigration. And racial profiling. And sending money to foreign countries.”

As the one-year milestone of the second Trump administration approaches, various polls indicate waning approval for the president compared with the higher ratings he had at the start of his second term.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll earlier this month showed 42% of Americans approved of Trump’s job overall. This was up slightly from lower percentages throughout most of the fall and winter but still down from the 47% approval rating around the time Trump took office in January 2025.

While the president has kept his MAGA base largely intact, the Tribune interviewed several Trump voters who have expressed dissatisfaction with aspects of his leadership during the first year of his second term.

Although they favored the president over Democrat Kamala Harris during the campaign, they now share grave concerns over the Trump administration’s handling of everything from economic strategies to foreign policy to domestic problems.

Aggressive immigration enforcement was a repeated complaint from those who backed the president during the election but now have doubts about his leadership. Chicago was the epicenter of Trump’s mass deportation policy this fall, an effort that relied heavily upon racial profiling and largely failed to target the “worst of the worst” criminals as promised.

One man from Skokie grew incensed after witnessing Border Patrol agents question U.S. citizens who were working on his property during an immigration enforcement onslaught across the Chicago area on Halloween.

A Navy combat veteran was angered after immigration officials detained his wife — a foreign-born green card holder — at O’Hare International Airport over the summer.

Payan, a 41-year-old general contractor whose parents were born in Mexico, said he believed campaign rhetoric that the administration would target felons and violent criminals who were here without legal permission, a mission he supported.

But the reality of immigration enforcement — which has included turbulent protests, detained U.S. citizens and the violent arrests of both residents who are legally in the U.S. and those without legal permission — has been a stark contrast to those promises.

“Going door to door, just asking people at the gas stations or at Home Depot, ‘Hey, what’s your status?’ That’s racial profiling at its best,” Payan said.

While there isn’t evidence of a mass exodus of Trump supporters, there are signs of weakening favor among those who cast a ballot for the president, said Alexander Theodoridis, associate professor and co-director of the UMass Poll at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Of Trump voters polled in July, 69% expressed confidence in their choice and only 1% said they regretted their vote; 2% said they had some regrets and might make a different choice if they could go back, according to the UMass Poll.

Another 3% said they wished they hadn’t voted at all and 6% had mixed feelings, the survey found.

But 19% responded that they had some concerns about his presidency — a contingent the Trump administration and other Republicans might find troubling later this year in the midterm elections, which can reshape control of Congress, Theodoridis said.

Historically, the midterms often go against the incumbent party, he noted.

“We’re very likely to see it this time around too,” he said. “It doesn’t necessarily mean lots of people are regretful of their Trump vote in an open or even self-aware way. But they might just not be enthusiastic enough to turn out and vote for … the Republican running for Congress in their district.”

The dip in support comes as some high-profile cracks are emerging among Trump’s often-lockstep base.

Once a loyal champion of the president, former U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia has severely criticized Trump over his handling of files related to financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as well as foreign policy and health care issues.

The feud intensified with Trump calling Greene a “traitor” and “wacky,” while pledging to endorse a challenger if she sought reelection. Amid the public fallout, Greene announced her resignation in November and stepped down earlier this month.

Elon Musk, a top donor during the 2024 election and former leader of Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, has posted a flurry of attacks on his X social media platform targeting the president’s handling of the Epstein files as well as spending and tariffs. He and the president seem to be on better terms now, as Musk recently shared a picture of them dining at Mar-a-Lago on social media.

And despite intense pressure from the White House, a group of Republican state senators from Indiana helped defeat a Trump-backed redistricting plan that would have favored their party.

Among them was northwest Indiana Republican state Sen. Michael Bohacek, 8th District, who threatened to vote against the redrawn congressional map after Trump used a slur for people with intellectual abilities in reference to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

Bohacek, whose daughter has Down syndrome, rebuked the president’s offensive language and encouraged him to “use the next 10 months to convince voters that his policies and behavior deserve a congressional majority.”

As for Payan, he’s worried about the nation’s increasingly hawkish foreign policy, climaxing earlier this month with the U.S. capture of then-Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and Trump’s increasing desire to control Greenland.

“It’s the dictator blueprint,” he said.

Payan said he’s faced backlash from Democrats because he voted for Trump. He’s also been castigated by Republicans for opposing the president.

But he believes it’s everyone’s civic duty to criticize leaders when they’re wrong, even if it’s a candidate they supported during the election.

“Be vocal and express your voice,” he said. “A lot of people are scared to talk because they might get fired from work or their friends might unfriend them. And I think, what’s more important? Your voice or your relationship with your co-worker or friend?”

‘Poor choices’

While voting in person on Election Day in November 2020, Morgan Krupinski spent about five minutes holding his pen and grappling with the final decision at the top of his nearly completed ballot: The options for president, as Trump faced Democrat Joe Biden.

“I couldn’t do it,” he recalled. “I voted. But I abstained from the presidential choice. It’s kind of a reflection of where our leaders are. We have a lot of poor choices, many times.”

The 30-year-old who works in technology had voted for Trump in 2016 but grew disappointed by the end of his first term, as unrest gripped the country amid the COVID pandemic and protests following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. Neither Trump nor Biden seemed equipped to lead at the time, he recounted.

Afterward, the Jan. 6, 2020, insurrection in the U.S. Capitol deeply upset Krupinski.

As the 2024 election approached, he highly favored another Republican candidate, U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley.

He saw her as a strong leader who could help quell two major wars plaguing the globe — the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war — while uniting a largely fragmented United States.

But Haley, the last significant Republican challenger to Trump, withdrew her longshot candidacy in March 2024.

Then the July assassination attempt on Trump marked a turning point for Krupinski, who was moved by the candidate’s speech a few days later at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.

“Together, we will launch a new era of safety, prosperity and freedom for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed,” Trump told the crowd. “The discord and division in our society must be healed.”

That moment held echoes of President George W. Bush’s address following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and President Barack Obama’s words after the death of terrorist Osama bin Laden, two historical messages that had seemed to bring the nation together, Krupinski recalled.

So in 2024, he returned to his polling place and cast a hopeful vote for Trump.

Krupinski was gratified by some of the president’s international accomplishments, including a Trump-led plan for peace in Gaza in early October and release of the Israeli hostages by Hamas.

There were also concerns. Krupiniski criticized the administration’s steep tariffs, which “are not really a traditional Republican free-market issue.”

The self-described Reagan-style conservative grew troubled by “hyper-nationalistic rhetoric” among some in the MAGA contingent, which he believes Trump has an obligation to condemn.

But his worries for the new administration culminated on Halloween, when Trump’s often-combative immigration crackdown touched Krupinski’s home in Skokie.

While working inside his house, several Border Patrol vehicles suddenly pulled up on his quiet north suburban street.

Led by Border Patrol Cmdr. Greg Bovino, a swarm of armed immigration agents filled the scene, demanding documents from two workers from an American company who were providing flood control on Krupinski’s front lawn.

They were able to provide proof that they were U.S. citizens. But the encounter disturbed Krupinski.

“I believe we need to have a strong border and we need to get rid of people who are committing crimes and who are doing the wrong thing,” he said. “But for that to happen in such a way that’s so indiscriminate: Going down residential streets and stopping people based on their appearance and what they’re doing, without a true, reasonable cause?”

Immigration officials had no reason to stop and question those workers, Krupinski added.

“If you’re going to do immigration enforcement you have to do it legally and constitutionally,” Krupinski said. “Now what I think is going on is a very strained and expansive view of the authority that they have. And it’s very unsettling.”

Many Chicago residents agree with him in the wake of the Trump administration’s local ramped-up immigration enforcement, dubbed Operation Midway Blitz. Asked if immigration enforcement has gone too far, 65% of Chicagoans said it has, according to a recent survey conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago. Almost 13% of those polled supported enforcement activities and more than 8% said they have not gone far enough; 14% of those surveyed were unsure.

Krupinski believes he made the best decision he could on Election Day in November.

Yet he’s been speaking out against the administration’s immigration enforcement methods, particularly to fellow conservatives and others who voted for Trump.

Amid a highly polarized and divided political climate, they might be more inclined to listen to him than a staunch Democrat or more liberal voice, Krupinski reasoned.

“So I feel like I have a unique opportunity to speak to the people on my side of things,” he added. “I hope I can change people’s minds to say no one is above criticism and no one is above being called out when they do something bad, particularly in the government. This is the right we have as citizens.”

Partisan strife

The Missouri couple were returning home from a trip to Ireland for a family memorial when they were stopped by federal authorities at O’Hare International Airport in July.

Donna Hughes-Brown, an Irish citizen and legal permanent resident of the United States, was detained by immigration authorities.

Although she’s been a green card holder for decades, Hughes-Brown said the officials cited two misdemeanor offenses against her for writing bad checks in 2012 and 2015.

The 58-year-old grandmother was held at O’Hare for several days and then transferred to a facility in Campbell County, Kentucky, where she was detained for more than four months.

Her husband, Jim Brown, a Navy veteran who fought in Operation Desert Storm, had cast a ballot for Trump in 2024. But this wasn’t the kind of immigration enforcement the campaign had promised, he said.

“What they were doing to my wife was wrong,” said Brown. They live in northeastern Missouri about 20 miles from the Illinois border.

Homeland Security officials did not respond to Tribune requests for comment.

The case made international headlines and a contingent of Democratic lawmakers, including Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, advocated for Hughes-Brown’s release.

During a U.S. House Homeland Security Committee hearing in December, U.S. Rep. Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island grilled Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on the matter.

Brown attended the hearing as well.

“She did not come here illegally and she has never committed any crime other than writing two bad checks, totaling $80, 10 years ago. She is currently in prison and facing deportation,” Magaziner said during the hearing. “Ms. Noem, will you thank Mr. Brown for his service to our country?”

“Thank you, Mr. Brown, for your service to our country,” Noem responded.

The Homeland Security secretary added that it’s not her job to pick and choose which laws get enforced, though Noem did pledge to review the case.

In mid-December, Hughes-Brown was released and returned to her Missouri home. The couple are now working on the process for her to become a naturalized citizen.

“I’m relieved that Donna is finally back home with her family and look forward to supporting her in her naturalization journey, but she never should have been detained in the first place,” Duckworth said in a written statement.

During a recent interview with the Tribune, Brown had harsh words for the Trump administration.

“They sold a whole different idea than what’s actually happening. The cruelty and the nonsense that’s going on right now is just wrong,” he said. “If you watched between the first Trump presidency and now, it’s completely different. We’re trying to bully other countries and do things we shouldn’t be doing.”

Yet he stressed several times that he didn’t want to “get partisan,” noting that some immigration laws the administration’s enforcing have been on the books for years. Former President Obama, a Democrat, had been dubbed “the deporter-in-chief,” by immigration advocates, Brown correctly noted.

Since his wife’s story went viral, Brown said he’s been lambasted by liberals for voting for Trump and admonished by conservatives for criticizing the administration.

The only way to improve the country is “to stop being partisan,” Brown said, adding that he blames much of the nation’s strife on the two-party political system.

“It’s the fomentation,” he said. “When you fight with each other instead of coming up with a solution.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CTC-L-trump-voters-year10.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2026-01-20 11:01:17.343274

Some possibility remains that the Supreme Court may ultimately retain an exception from the president’s removal power for principal officers within adjudicatory agencies.
With the expansion of the removal power, the MSPB’s quorum requirement—designed as a safeguard for deliberation and impartiality—has become a point of leverage to assert presidential control.
In short, the MSPB’s quorum requirement—once a structural feature meant to safeguard neutral, bipartisan adjudication—has become another point of presidential control.
In establishing the MSPB, the Senate Committee Report framed this independence as a “cornerstone” of civil service reform responsible for safeguarding the merit system.","Since the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), Congress has assigned primary responsibility for adjudicating federal employment disputes to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). The board consists of three members appointed by the president, removable “only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” To promote impartiality, no more than two members may belong to the same political party, and the board may act only with a two-member quorum.

Because the CSRA provides a comprehensive adjudicatory regime for employment disputes, employees generally must exhaust their claims before the MSPB prior to seeking judicial review in federal court. Claims submitted to the MSPB are adjudicated initially by an administrative judge. Either the government or the employee may appeal the administrative judge’s decision to the board. Then, only after the board issues a final decision may a federal employee seek judicial review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

The MSPB is a shell of its former self. Since President Trump’s inauguration, three developments have eroded any confidence that federal employees may have had in the MSPB’s independence and impartiality. First, in Harris v. Bessent, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that Congress may not prohibit the president from removing the MSPB’s board members, thereby upholding Trump’s removal of Chair Cathy Harris. Second, the MSPB lacked a quorum to review appeals from March to October 2025, leaving employees in procedural limbo and foreclosing the possibility of judicial review. Third, and finally, the Justice Department has argued that the MSPB is legally obligated to follow interpretations of the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC). If accepted, that position would permit the OLC to exert control over the MSPB’s interpretations of civil service law.

On Jan. 9, the full D.C. Circuit declined to rehear Harris v. Bessent. The decision may represent the final nail in the coffin for the MSPB’s independence. Courts should no longer pretend that the MSPB operates as Congress intended. If Congress wishes to preserve independence in the adjudication of federal employment disputes, it must act legislatively—either by creating a court dedicated to civil service law or by permitting existing courts to hear such claims.

The President’s Removal Power

At the core of the MSPB’s unraveling lies a more fundamental shift in constitutional law: the steady expansion of the presidential power over administrative agencies. For much of the modern administrative state, Congress relied on for-cause removal protections to insulate adjudicatory agencies from direct presidential control. That settlement has been under pressure for more than a decade, as the Supreme Court cast increasing doubts on Congress’s authority to limit the president’s ability to remove principal officers.

Article II of the Constitution provides that “the executive power shall be vested in a President.” In Seila Law v. CFPB, the Supreme Court held that the president must have authority to remove principal officers who wield significant executive power, so that those officers “remain accountable to the President, whose authority they wield.” At the same time, the Supreme Court preserved a limited exception for officers serving on multimember commissions that exercise quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial power, consistent with its earlier decision in Humphrey’s Executor v. United States. Oral arguments in Trump v. Slaughter, however, indicated that the Court is poised to overturn—or at least substantially limit—Humphrey’s Executor.

The respective removals of Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger and MSPB Chair Harris have brought these issues squarely to the forefront for agencies that govern the civil service. Following the D.C. Circuit’s decision to stay an injunction restoring Dellinger’s position, Dellinger ended his lawsuit because he believed that his “odds of ultimately prevailing before the Supreme Court are long.” Meanwhile, in Trump v. Wilcox¸ the Supreme Court stayed an order enjoining Harris’s removal, concluding that the government was likely to show that the MSPB “exercise[s] considerable executive power.” The Court declined, however, to address whether the MSPB falls within the exception for multimember commissions.

Following the Supreme Court’s order, a divided panel of the D.C. Circuit held in Harris v. Bessent that removal protections for MSPB members violate Article II. Writing for the majority, Judge Gregory Katsas held that the MSPB exercises “substantial powers that are both executive in nature and different from the powers that Humphrey’s Executor deemed to be merely quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial.” The panel stitched together several different precedents to narrow sharply—if not effectively hollow out—Humphrey’s Executor. In its view, Congress may delegate neither judicial nor legislative power, and, therefore, any power exercised by agencies within the executive branch must be executive in nature. Even so-called quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial powers, the court reasoned, are executive in nature. Accordingly, the president must have the authority to remove any principal officer exercising significant quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial power because these powers are executive in nature. On this logic, the majority speculated that “Humphrey’s Executor thus governs only agencies with purely advisory functions—like, say, the United States Commission on Civil Rights.” At the same time, the majority acknowledged that—unless and until the Supreme Court finally overturns it—Humphrey’s Executor still supports Congress’s power to impose removal protections on agencies that exercise the narrowest forms of quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial power.

The panel adopted an exceptionally narrow understanding of quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial powers. Under its reasoning, only the limited and historically contingent functions expressly identified in Humphrey’s Executor—such as advising Congress or acting as a judge-like adjudicator without policymaking authority—can fall within those categories. Modern forms of administrative adjudication and rule implementation, even when long understood as quasi-judicial or quasi-legislative, are recharacterized as exercises of executive power simply because they occur within the executive branch.

Applying that framework, the D.C. Circuit panel concluded that the MSPB’s authority could not be described as plausibly quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial. Emphasizing the board’s power to regulate the removal of its administrative law judges, issue final decisions, award reinstatement and back pay, and to represent itself in litigation, the court reasoned that the MSPB exercises significant executive power that places it squarely outside the Humphrey’s Executor exception. On this view, the board’s adjudicatory function is not analogous to the restrained model contemplated in 1935 but instead reflects modern administrative governance in which adjudication is inseparable from policymaking and enforcement.

The D.C. Circuit panel’s myopic conception of quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial power dramatically constrains Congress’s ability to insulate agencies from presidential control. By anchoring the constitutional analysis to a limited account of the Federal Trade Commission’s power in 1935, the decision ignores that the categories of quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial power predated Humphrey’s Executor and were understood more broadly at the time. Although the D.C. Circuit declined to “decide whether Congress may restrict the President’s ability to remove officers with solely adjudicatory functions,” its cramped understanding of what qualifies as quasi-judicial effectively resolves the question. Modern administrative adjudication—because it involves finality, remedial discretion, and the application of broad statutory standards—will almost always be reclassified as executive power, leaving Congress with little practical ability to design independent adjudicatory bodies within the administrative state. The decision by the full D.C. Circuit not to rehear Trump v. Bessent means that any effort to restore removal protections for the MSPB must come from the Supreme Court.

Some possibility remains that the Supreme Court may ultimately retain an exception from the president’s removal power for principal officers within adjudicatory agencies. During oral arguments in Trump v. Slaughter, several justices pressed the government on whether Congress retains authority to structure agencies that primarily adjudicate disputes, invoking historical examples of claims courts and other adjudicatory institutions designed to operate with independence. Those exchanges point toward a narrower—and more historically grounded—path: The Court could reject the D.C. Circuit’s efforts to collapse quasi-judicial power into the executive power, reaffirm that adjudication has long occupied a distinct constitutional space, and preserve Congress’s authority to protect principal officers who perform predominantly adjudicatory functions. Whether the Court is willing to take that path remains uncertain. But if it does not, the MSPB’s fate will stand as a warning that adjudication of federal employment disputes within the executive branch may no longer be constitutionally sustainable.

The OLC’s Efforts to Control MSPB Interpretations

The erosion of the MSPB’s independence has not occurred solely through structural attacks on removal protections for the board. It has also unfolded through a subtle campaign to subordinate the board’s legal interpretations to the Department of Justice, and ultimately to the president.

The Trump administration has advanced an expansive conception of the attorney general’s authority over legal interpretation. Although OLC opinions are binding on Cabinet departments, the OLC would not issue decisions binding independent agencies without their consent. President Trump, however, has ordered that “[t]he President and the Attorney General’s opinions of questions of law are controlling on all employees in the conduct of their official duties,” including employees within independent agencies.

In recent filings, the Department of Justice has argued that the MSPB must obey the OLC’s precedents. In Jackler v. Department of Justice, the Justice Department argued that an OLC opinion issued in September 2025 “provides binding legal advice within the Executive Branch” and therefore must control the MSPB’s handling of constitutional questions in removal cases. The OLC’s opinion purports to overturn the MSPB’s decision in Davis-Clewis v. Department of Veterans Affairs. By the department’s account, because the OLC speaks for the executive branch, any MSPB decision inconsistent with the OLC’s interpretation “does not represent the legal position of the Executive Branch” and must be vacated or remanded. This is a striking claim. The MSPB is not a litigating component of the Justice Department, nor is it an executive department subject to the attorney general’s supervisory authority. Congress instead designed the board as an adjudicatory body meant to resolve disputes between agencies and employees—including the Justice Department itself—according to law. Treating the OLC’s views as binding on the MSPB collapses that adjudicatory function into the very chain of command whose actions the board is supposed to review.

If accepted, this model fundamentally alters the nature of MSPB adjudication. The CSRA presupposes that the MSPB will apply statutes and precedent neutrally, subject to judicial review—not that it will take direction from the OLC when the executive branch dislikes the board’s answers. Allowing the OLC to dictate legal interpretation of civil service laws deprives the MSPB of its independence and enables the OLC to construct precedents that are more favorable to agency employers. Structural removal protections matter little if the board’s legal reasoning is overridden through the Justice Department’s “guidance.” In that sense, the OLC’s asserted authority over MSPB interpretation completes the transformation already begun by attacks on removal protections: the conversion of an adjudicatory body into an instrument of presidential control.

The MSPB’s Quorum Problems

The removal power and the asserted authority to control the MSPB’s legal interpretations matter only if the board is permitted to function at all. With the expansion of the removal power, the MSPB’s quorum requirement—designed as a safeguard for deliberation and impartiality—has become a point of leverage to assert presidential control.

The MSPB can act only with a quorum of two members. When the president possesses at-will removal authority, that quorum requirement becomes fragile. By removing at least two members from the board, the president can break the agency’s quorum and halt its ability to issue decisions. As recent events illustrate, the president need not remove the entire board to paralyze it; selective removals or the refusal to fill vacancies can suffice. This dynamic converts the quorum rule from a protection of collective decision-making into a tool for preventing adjudication altogether.

The consequences for federal employees are severe. During periods without a quorum, employees can receive initial decisions from administrative judges, but if either party seeks board review, those cases stall indefinitely. In Rodriguez v. Department of Veterans Affairs, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit treated the absence of a quorum as a temporary procedural defect rather than a structural denial of adjudication, leaving employees trapped in limbo.

This problem is not hypothetical. The MSPB has a long and troubling history of lacking a quorum. From January 2017 until March 2022, the board lacked a quorum for more than five years. During that period, the MSPB was unable to issue final decisions on petitions for review, producing a roughly 3,800 case backlog and leaving thousands of employees without timely resolution of claims involving removals, suspensions, and whistleblower retaliation. Although the MSPB adopted rules in 2024 to allow limited internal actions to proceed without a quorum, those measures did not—and could not—solve the core problem. The board still may not issue final, precedential decisions on petitions for review without two members and thus cannot perform its central function during quorum lapses.

The Senate confirmed a new MSPB member in October 2025, restoring its quorum. The relatively quick restoration prevented a similar backlog that resulted from 2017 to 2022, but the quorum’s restoration underscores a deeper structural vulnerability rather than resolving it. Because the president can now remove board members at will, party-balancing requirements offer little protection. A president might remove members of the opposing party, replace them with loyalists, or leave seats vacant long enough to prevent the board from acting. Even when a quorum technically exists, the threat of removal hangs over members, and the ease with which quorums are broken ensures that the MSPB’s capacity to function depends on presidential forbearance rather than statutory design.

In short, the MSPB’s quorum requirement—once a structural feature meant to safeguard neutral, bipartisan adjudication—has become another point of presidential control. Removal authority means quorums can be destroyed at will; the exhaustion doctrine prevents employees from escaping to federal court; and repeated historical failures show that these are not isolated or accidental breakdowns. Even when quorums are restored, the combination of removal power and partisan manipulation means that the MSPB’s ability to act remains contingent and fragile. Congress designed the MSPB to be an independent adjudicator. In practice, quorum fragility has converted it into an agency that can be silenced whenever its decisions become inconvenient.

The MSPB No Longer Functions as Congress Intended

The CSRA’s channeling and exhaustion regime rests on a specific legislative bargain: Congress would strip district courts of jurisdiction over most federal employment disputes and, instead, create a separate, independent adjudicator to decide those disputes before judicial review. Congress did not simply assign cases to “an agency.” It deliberately split the original agency tasked with personnel management—the Civil Service Commission—to separate the task of managing personnel from the task of adjudicating employment disputes. It created the independent MSPB precisely to eliminate the inherent conflict of having the government’s chief personnel office also serve as the appellate review in adverse actions.

In establishing the MSPB, the Senate Committee Report framed this independence as a “cornerstone” of civil service reform responsible for safeguarding the merit system. Independence was necessary to ensure that “the Board should be insulated from the kinds of political pressures that have led to violations of merit principles in the past.” Indeed, “[a]bsent the mandate for independence of the Merit Systems Protection Board, it is unlikely that the committee would have granted the Office of Personnel Management the power it has or the latitude to delegate personnel authority to the agencies.” In other words, without the MSPB’s independence, Congress would not have created the civil service system that we have today.

Those design choices are now eviscerated. If the president can remove MSPB members at will, then the statutory features Congress had treated as safeguards—partisan balancing, staggered terms, and decisional independence—become discretionary norms that survive only as long as the White House tolerates them. The same is true of the CSRA’s broader architecture.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit recently underscored that Congress’s decision to channel claims away from district courts was “predicated on the existence of a functioning and independent MSPB and Special Counsel,” and remanded for fact finding on whether that premise has been undermined. Contrary to the Federal Circuit’s decision in Rodriguez, the Fourth Circuit suggested that the MSPB no longer functioned as intended because it lacked a quorum and that the government had argued that the board’s removal protections violated the separation of powers. The Fourth Circuit explained that Congress’s jurisdiction-stripping design presupposes not just a process, but one capable of “adequate and independent review,” such that if key Senate-confirmed positions “go unfilled” or if the MSPB and special counsel cannot perform their duties, “the framework of the CSRA would be thwarted” and congressional intent “defeat[ed].” In other words, exhaustion and channeling make sense only if the adjudicatory institutions Congress created actually exist as Congress designed them.

If the MSPB is no longer structurally independent—or can be disabled through at-will removals and partisan restructuring—then the CSRA’s exhaustion regime risks becoming a one-way ratchet: Employees are barred from federal court on the theory that Congress provided an adequate substitute, even when that substitute no longer provides the neutral, functioning review Congress intended. At that point, Congress faces an unavoidable choice. One option is to take adjudication out of the executive branch entirely by creating an Article I court for civil service disputes. The other is more modest but immediate: Amend the CSRA to permit covered employees to proceed directly to federal district court (or to a specialized appellate path) when the MSPB lacks a quorum, cannot act in a timely fashion, or otherwise fails to provide the independent adjudication Congress designed. This all assumes that the civil service avoids the darkest possibility: a decision from the Supreme Court that the CSRA is wholly unconstitutional. Provided the administrative state weathers that possibility, Congress will need to restore the basic bargain that animated the CSRA.",https://lawfare-assets-new.azureedge.net/assets/images/default-source/article-images/united-states-court-of-appeals-for-the-federal-circuit-washington-dc.jpg?sfvrsn=a99fcf49_5,N,,2026-01-20 12:00:13.728713

President Trump is taking a broad view of executive authority and showing no signs of slowing down on testing his own power as he enters his second year back in office.

Trump has faced off with Congress, the courts and various states as he pushes for a stronger presidential hand in his second term. He’s also increasingly focused on exerting his influence on the world stage.

The president will mark Tuesday’s anniversary of returning to office with an interview with NewsNation’s Katie Pavlich on “Katie Pavlich Tonight” airing at 10 p.m. EST, before jetting to Davos, Switzerland, to meet with world leaders and press his foreign agenda at the World Economic Forum.

Greenland and blowback to Trump’s campaign to secure the Danish territory will be top of mind for leaders at the forum, along with the president’s push to have countries join his “Board of Peace” to implement the U.S.-brokered peace plan between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

▪ The Hill: Trump starts year with Greenland tumult.

Trump’s foreign policy moves have captured much of the attention heading into the second year of his term, with the stunning U.S. operation to capture former Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro jumpstarting 2026 and surprising many people, including congressional leaders.

Democrats and some Republicans pushed back against the administration’s unilateral action and Trump’s initial suggestions the U.S. would take over Venezuela with Maduro ousted. Trump has seemingly backed off on the idea the U.S. would directly control Caracas, instead focusing more on ensuring a strong U.S.-Venezuelan relationship to gain access to the country’s large oil reserves.

But an effort for Congress to reassert its authority failed in the Senate after the White House pressured enough Republicans to back off a war powers resolution that aimed to prevent the administration from taking further military action in Venezuela. Even if it passed the Senate, it was likely dead on arrival in the House, making the resolution only symbolic.

And its failure raised more doubts about the potential for success of other war powers resolutions concerning Greenland, Colombia and Iran that some Democrats have floated.

At home, immigration enforcement is a priority for the president, and the most recent front in that battle has been Minnesota, particularly after the killing of a woman earlier this month by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer.

Trump has in recent days threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to send the military to respond to ongoing protests following the killing, just the latest time he’s threatened to use the centuries-old law. And multiple reports indicate the Pentagon has ordered 1,500 active-duty troops to be ready for deployment in Minnesota.

If Trump goes through with invoking the law, it would almost certainly face legal challenges questioning his authority.

The Hill’s Rebecca Beitsch reports Trump has completely shifted the U.S. approach to immigration with the most visible enforcement effort seen in the country’s history.

The administration has also targeted many who have legal status in the country, seeking to curtail ways to lawfully enter the U.S. Democrats have argued many of these actions have been unlawful, including the administration’s deportation of some migrants without allowing them an opportunity to defend themselves against allegations of gang ties.

But Beitsch notes much of the administration’s immigration push is just beginning, as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act gave ICE a major boost in funding to expand detention capacity.

▪ The Hill: Immigration crackdown gets poor marks from voters.

▪ The Hill: Trump’s suspension of naturalization ceremonies leaves citizens in limbo.

The Department of Justice’s (DOJ) investigations into high-profile figures are also further fueling allegations Trump is pushing his administration to go after his opponents for political reasons.

The DOJ has historically had independence and a certain amount of distance from the White House to ensure legal integrity, but Trump has at times sidelined that to specifically call for certain political opponents to face charges.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell became the latest figure to be under investigation from the DOJ, apparently concerning his congressional testimony about the cost of renovations to the Fed’s headquarters.

The DOJ is meanwhile still pursuing a case against former national security adviser John Bolton and challenging the dismissal of its cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James (D). Other top Democrats such as Sen. Adam Schiff (Calif.) and Rep. Eric Swalwell (Calif.) have been referred to the DOJ for prosecution.

Trump has sought to distance himself from these probes while continuing to attack the subjects of them. But the announcement of an investigation into Powell adds to the trend of another high-profile Trump critic facing possible legal action.

The administration has also battled Democratic lawmakers with military or intelligence backgrounds over a video they made last year in which they urged U.S. service members to disobey unlawful orders. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), a former CIA officer, said last week she’s under federal investigation while Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) has vowed to fight the Pentagon’s efforts to demote his military rank over the video.

Smart Take with Blake Burman

Trump has threatened to use the Insurrection Act to send the U.S. military to Minnesota. Ronald Vitiello, a senior adviser to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told me Monday night any action would be “conditions based.” I also asked about how long ICE could be on the ground in Minnesota. Vitiello said it could be months.

“It could be a long time. Look, this could get better immediately, if the state and local officials put their hand out and ask ICE to come into these institutions to help identify the criminal element that’s also in the country illegally and work directly with ICE to get them removed,” he said.

What’s clear is the focus on Minnesota isn’t going away anytime soon. ICE could be on the ground in a large capacity for a while, and Trump is calling for a renewed focus on the fraud in the state.

Leading the Day

GREENLAND BLOWBACK: International leaders, Democrats and some Republicans are slamming the president’s letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre tying the Nobel committee’s decision not to award him the 2025 peace prize to his ongoing push for the U.S. to acquire Greenland.

Trump in the letter questioned why Denmark has a “right of ownership” over the mineral-rich island territory. The letter was shared with multiple European ambassadors.

“Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America,” Trump said, according to NewsNation, The Hill’s partner outlet.

Democrats denounced Trump’s comments. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) called the letter the “ramblings of a man who has lost touch with reality” and Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) said the U.S. is becoming the “enemy of the free world because a pathetic man got his feelings hurt.”

Some Republicans who are more willing to criticize Trump also chimed in.

Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) called the letter “very embarrassing conduct.”

Former Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger (Ill.), a sharp critic of Trump, said on the social platform X that the time has come to “move Gramps into a home” and let the “adults govern again.”

The physician to the late former Vice President Dick Cheney called for a congressional inquiry into Trump’s fitness for office in light of the letter.

Trump openly campaigned to receive the peace prize throughout last year, but the Nobel committee awarded it to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado instead.

Machado gave her prize to Trump when the two met at the White House last week, though the Nobel committee has said the award can’t be formally transferred.

Støre clarified in a statement to Bloomberg that the Norwegian government doesn’t award the Nobel Prizes.

Trump told reporters late Monday that he doesn’t care about the prize but rejected the idea that Norway doesn’t control the board.

“A very fine woman felt that I deserved it and really wanted me to have the Nobel Prize,” he said. “If anybody doesn’t think that Norway doesn’t control the Nobel Prize, they’re just getting — they have a board, but it’s controlled by Norway.”

Trump also said he doesn’t expect pushback over Greenland from European leaders heading into the World Economic Forum this week in Switzerland.

“We have to have it. They have to have this done. They can’t protect it,” he said.

Trump was active on Truth Social overnight, posting multiple notes from foreign leaders, including NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and French President Emmanuel Macron.

Macron said he and Trump are in line on Syria and can “do great things” in Iran but questioned his intentions in Greenland, according to the Trump-posted message. He offered to meet with Trump in Davos and for the two to have dinner in Paris before Trump returns to the U.S.

Rutte, meanwhile, said he would use his media engagements to highlight Trump’s work in Syria, Gaza and Ukraine and is committed to “finding a way forward” on Greenland, according to the message posted overnight.

The president also posted a mock image showing Canada, Venezuela and Greenland as part of the U.S.

Trump has ramped up his rhetoric about the U.S. acquiring Greenland in recent weeks, refusing to rule out taking it by force. He threatened several European countries, including Denmark and Norway, with a 10 percent tariff beginning Feb. 1 if Greenland isn’t ceded to the U.S.

Those tariffs would rise to 25 percent if a deal still hasn’t happened by June 1.

International officials have taken Trump’s threats seriously and have rejected the idea of the U.S. taking Greenland.

The NATO secretary-general met with Danish and Greenlandic officials Monday to discuss “collective security,” while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen met with members of Congress to discuss various issues, including Trump’s rhetoric on the subject.

On Monday, amid rising tensions in the region, the Colorado-based North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) clarified that activities it is conducting at Pituffik Space Base in Greenland have been long-planned and coordinated with Denmark. NORAD noted that the government of Greenland was also aware of the activities.

SHUTDOWN WATCH: Lawmakers have two weeks left to avoid a partial government shutdown but face a contentious battle over funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Congress has passed six of the 12 appropriations bills needed to fund the government before funding runs out Jan. 30. The House has approved an additional two-bill package to fund the State and Treasury departments, which the Senate will take up when it returns next week.

But that leaves four bills for the House to clear, and the one for DHS is expected to be heated as critics push back over ICE’s tactics. Some Democrats have signaled they wouldn’t support a bill to fund the department without reforms requiring tougher oversight of ICE.

Lawmakers could pass another continuing resolution to fund the government until they can reach a deal and stave off the second shutdown in just a few months. But timing is tight, as the Senate is out of town this week and the House will be out next week, The Hill’s Sudiksha Kochi reports.

CASSIDY PLOWS ON: Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy (R) is vowing to continue with his reelection bid but is facing the toughest challenge to his political career after Trump weighed in to encourage a primary opponent to run against him.

Trump backed Rep. Julia Letlow (R-La.) for the seat in a post on Truth Social over the weekend, calling her a “total winner” and saying she would continue to deliver for Louisiana in the Senate as she has in the House. Letlow hasn’t announced a Senate candidacy but signaled after the endorsement that she may jump in the race.

“I’m honored to have President Trump’s endorsement and trust. My mission is clear: to ensure the nation our children inherit is safer and stronger,” she wrote in a post on X. “This United States Senate seat belongs to the people of Louisiana, because we deserve conservative leadership that will not waver.”

The endorsement comes years after Cassidy was one of a handful of Republicans who broke with their party to vote to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial for his conduct leading up to and during the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Since then, Cassidy has toed a line between criticizing and defending Trump and his administration.

Despite having cast a key vote to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of Health and Human Services last year, Cassidy has become increasingly vocal criticizing Kennedy’s decisions in the role.

Cassidy already had picked up a few primary challengers, including state Treasurer John Fleming and state Sen. Blake Miguez. But Trump’s endorsement would be a critical boost for Letlow if she runs and would present an even larger obstacle for Cassidy, whose reelection chances already seemed in doubt.

Still, Cassidy expressed confidence in his ability to win.

“I’m proudly running for re-election as a principled conservative who gets things done for the people of Louisiana. If Congresswoman Letlow decides to run I am confident I will win,” he wrote on X.

Letlow has until Feb. 13 to file her candidacy if she wants to run.

DOJ WEIGHS GUN POLICY SHIFT: The DOJ is considering loosening gun regulations as it tries to boost support from Second Amendment advocates, The Washington Post reports.

Some of the changes include easing restrictions on the private sale of guns and loosening regulations around shipping firearms, people familiar with the changes told the Post. Other changes could affect the types of firearms that can be imported and making licensing fees refundable.

The exact changes and the timing of the announcement are still being finalized, according to the report.

The Post reported the back-and-forth emphasizes the DOJ’s challenges as it tries to satisfy members of Trump’s base who believe the administration hasn’t been strong enough in rolling back gun restrictions while also protecting the law enforcement abilities of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

TILLIS ‘UNTETHERED’: Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) has increasingly become a leading voice within the GOP opposing Trump’s actions after having announced he won’t run for reelection this year.

Tillis announced last summer, amid the battle over the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, that he wouldn’t run for another term. The announcement came as Trump repeatedly attacked Tillis’s opposition to the legislation, which the senator ultimately voted against.

But the past few weeks have given Tillis several opportunities to speak his mind, including on Trump’s rhetoric on Greenland, the DOJ investigation into Powell and how White House aides are advising Trump, The Hill’s Alexander Bolton reports.

Tillis told Bolton in an interview that his outspokenness isn’t a conscious choice but is a result of the administration’s actions.

“The sheer volume of things that are on the threat matrix,” Tillis said. “It sort of ramped up, but you’ve got to respond when the opportunities come up.”

But Tillis’s decision has given him an amount of freedom that few others can have.

“He’s untethered,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said.

PUTIN INVITED: Russian President Vladimir Putin is among the world leaders invited to join the “Board of Peace” led by Trump to oversee the next phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal.

The Kremlin confirmed Monday that Putin received an invitation to join the board, and officials are studying the details of the proposal. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia hopes to contact the U.S. to clarify “all the nuances,” according to the state-run news outlet RIA Novosti.

Other countries invited to join the board include the United Kingdom, Canada, Egypt, Turkey, Brazil, Argentina and India. France was invited, but French President Emmanuel Macron rejected Trump’s offer to join over the charter’s language.

The invitation for Putin comes nearly four years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. While Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have been trying to reach a peace agreement to propose to Putin, a deal has remained elusive.

The Trump administration signaled last week that it is launching the second phase of the Gaza peace deal after the near-completion of the first phase. The second phase includes Hamas giving up power in Gaza and agreeing to disarm, though the militant group has given mixed messages as to whether it will follow through.

The White House announced the founding members of the board Friday. They include Secretary of State Marco Rubio, envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, World Bank President Ajay Banga, billionaire investor Marc Rowan and U.S. deputy national security adviser Robert Gabriel.

The board will become official after three member states approve the charter.

And finally … Sen. Ashley Moody (R-Fla.) is set to provide Sen. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) with cafecitos after the Indiana Hoosiers defeated the University of Miami Hurricanes in the College Football Playoff National Championship on Monday.

Ahead of the game, Moody posted a video saying she would wager her congressional team showing up to Banks’s office with cafecitos, a Cuban espresso beverage and South Florida staple, if her Hurricanes lost. Banks responded that he would provide Moody’s office with gummy bears if the Hoosiers lost.

The bet is far from the first time members of Congress engaged in friendly wagers over their sports teams. Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) wore a Philadelphia Eagles jersey on the Senate floor last year, in a bet with the two Pennsylvania senators, after his Kansas City Chiefs lost the Super Bowl.

Trump attended the game along with a few members of the administration and his family.

Phil Murphy, who made protecting immigrants a pillar of his first campaign for governor, used some of his final hours in office Tuesday to veto two sweeping bills designed to expand migrant rights.

The bills left unsigned would have written the attorney general’s 2018 Immigrant Trust Directive into law — the order restricts when local, county, and state police can aid federal immigration agents — and created new safeguards for sensitive personal data provided by New Jerseyans to hospitals, schools, and libraries can be shared.

Murphy, a Democrat who is leaving office at noon Tuesday after two terms as governor, said the codification bill had significant differences from the directive that made him fear it would attract renewed judicial scrutiny. The directive has stood up in court, including at the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, he noted.

“I am extremely concerned that signing this bill, which differs from the Immigrant Trust Directive, would open New Jersey up to a new court challenge and renewed judicial scrutiny from judges who may not render the same decision upholding these critical protections,” Murphy said. “Renewed litigation would also put our time-tested Immigrant Trust Directive at risk, endangering hundreds of thousands of immigrants in New Jersey in one fell swoop. I cannot in good conscience allow that to happen.”

Murphy added that while he supported the data privacy protection bill — he conditionally vetoed the measure after a voting session last week and sent it back to the Legislature for amendments that lawmakers then hastily agreed to — his team “discovered a drafting oversight that could create significant complications.” Because a new legislative session has started since the bill passed the Legislature, it’s too late to seek new changes to the measure.

“The bill as written could be construed to conflict with federal law and, if signed, could jeopardize billions of dollars in federal funding for critical programs that serve the people of New Jersey,” said Murphy. “I deeply wish there was sufficient time left to correct this issue, but it is not possible due to the expiration of the legislative session. Therefore, the only responsible option is to decline to act on the bill at this time.”

Immigrant advocates blasted Murphy for vetoing bills they said would provide vital protections for migrants amid a time of aggressive enforcement by the Trump administration. They have warned that a future attorney general could withdraw the directive at any moment.

The vetoes are known as pocket vetoes, meaning they aren’t being sent to the Legislature for a potential override because they were passed in the final days of a legislative session.

Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill (D), who becomes governor at noon, declined to say on the campaign trail whether she would support legislation codifying the policy, but she did express fear, like Murphy did Tuesday, that codifying the 2018 directive would open the state up to new lawsuits.

Amol Sinha, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, which supported the bills, said he is “deeply disappointed” with Murphy declining to sign two of them.

“In failing to sign these bills, Governor Murphy has left New Jersey without critical protections at a moment when ICE is brutalizing our communities. These bills were legally sound, politically viable, and commonsense policy. We call on Governor-elect Sherrill, her administration, and the Legislature to establish data privacy protections and ensure state and local resources are not commandeered for federal immigration enforcement – we have no time to waste,” Sinha said in a statement.

In his two terms at the helm of the state, Murphy was lauded as an ally to immigrants in New Jersey and worked closely with immigrant-focused organizations. He signed landmark bills greenlighting driver’s licenses for undocumented immigrants, offering pandemic relief dollars to migrants who weren’t eligible for federal aid, and expanding in-state tuition to include undocumented college students.

In New Jersey, 1 in 4 residents is an immigrant, and more than 500,000 residents are estimated to be undocumented.

The two bills Murphy declined to sign were part of a three-bill package introduced earlier this month. Murphy signed the third, which requires the Attorney General’s Office to designate specific locations where immigration enforcement will be barred.

Murphy said he’s hopeful the Legislature will reintroduce the data privacy bill and pass an amended version“so it can be signed into law at the soonest opportunity.”

The three bills were introduced, advanced in committee, and approved by the Legislature in the final weeks of its last legislative session. They faced staunch Republican opposition.

Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex) told reporters last week that he believed the governor would sign the bills, “and that’ll be the law.”

“Too many people are living in fear” of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement, he said.

We don’t need to go through the entire history of every law-enforcement agency.","The United States Postal Inspection Service sometimes claims to be the oldest federal law-enforcement agency, arguing that its origin dates to 1775 when Benjamin Franklin, in his capacity as colonial postmaster general, first appointed a surveyor to audit the mail. Then in 1789, the country established both the U.S. Marshals as part of the original Judiciary Act and also a U.S. Customs Service to enforce the tariff laws that, at the time, provided the bulk of revenue.

Then in 1791, George Washington created the Park Watchmen to provide security for the under-construction capital of Washington, D.C.

The watchmen evolved into what is today the U.S. Park Police, who do not police America’s national parks (that would be the National Park Service Law Enforcement Rangers) but rather urban parks that are under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior. That means the National Mall and a bunch of other parks in D.C., but also some facilities in New York and San Francisco.

After the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln created the U.S. Secret Service to combat the rising problem of counterfeiting. After William McKinley was assassinated in 1901, Congress decided that presidents needed protection, and they assigned that duty to the Secret Service.

Because the original mission of the Secret Service was to combat counterfeiting, it was housed in the Treasury Department. The Customs Service was also in the Treasury Department because its core mission was collecting taxes. And when the Justice Department decided in the early 20th century to beef up federal investigative capabilities, they chose not to expand existing federal law-enforcement agencies and instead spun up their own Bureau of Investigation, which evolved into today’s F.B.I.

We don’t need to go through the entire history of every law-enforcement agency. The point is that it is a tangled web. The different agencies have narrow scopes and are also gerrymandered in weird ways. Bank robbery is handled by the same agency as counterterrorism but a different agency from counterfeiting, which is the same agency that does presidential protection, which is a different agency from protecting federal buildings.

I don’t think this makes a ton of sense compared to the setup they have in, say, Germany where the Bundeskriminalamt does detective-type stuff and the Bundespolizei does “guys in uniforms”-type stuff and that’s it.

And I’ve always felt it would make a lot of sense to reorganize the entire federal law-enforcement apparatus into either a single U.S. Police Service or else a dual structure with a German-style split. I first wrote about this back in 2012, prompted by an unrelated federal-government-reorganization proposal.

A federal judge refused to block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring members of Congress to give a week’s notice before visiting immigration detention facilities.

The ruling from U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C., comes after Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., said she and other Minnesota lawmakers were kicked out of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Minneapolis on Saturday, Jan. 10. They were asked to leave the facility after being informed about the Trump administration rule governing lawmaker visits.

Plaintiffs' attorneys representing several Democratic members of Congress asked Cobb to intervene, but the judge ruled Monday that they used the wrong ""procedural vehicle"" to challenge it. The judge also concluded that the Jan. 8 policy is a new Department of Homeland Security action that isn't subject to her prior order in the plaintiffs' favor.

""The Court emphasizes that it denies Plaintiffs’ motion only because it is not the proper avenue to challenge Defendants’ January 8, 2026, memorandum and the policy stated therein, rather than based on any kind of finding that the policy is lawful,"" Cobb wrote.

HOUSE DEMOCRATS ASK JUDGE TO BLOCK NOEM'S REVIVED ICE VISIT RULE, SAY DHS DEFIED COURT ORDER

Last month, Cobb temporarily blocked an administration oversight visit policy. She ruled on Dec. 17 that it is likely illegal for ICE to demand a week’s notice from members of Congress seeking to visit and observe conditions in ICE facilities.

A day after Renee Nicole Good’s death in Minneapolis, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem quietly signed a new memorandum reinstating another seven-day notice requirement, according to The Associated Press.

Plaintiffs’ lawyers from the Democracy Forward legal advocacy group said DHS didn't disclose the latest policy until after Reps. Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig were turned away from an ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building.

Democracy Forward spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz said they were reviewing the judge's latest order.

""We will continue to use every legal tool available to stop the administration’s efforts to hide from congressional oversight,"" she said in a statement to the AP.

ILHAN OMAR KICKED OUT OF ICE FACILITY AFTER DHS REQUIRES WEEK'S ADVANCE NOTICE

House Democrats asked the judge earlier this month to block the new directive from Noem requiring advance notice for congressional oversight visits to ICE detention facilities, arguing in a court filing that the policy is politically motivated and violates federal spending law and a prior court stay.

Last year, Democrats had sued to block the seven-day notice requirement, arguing that the restrictions on ICE detention centers violate Section 527, a federal spending law provision that prohibits DHS from using appropriated funds to prevent congressional access to these facilities.

In December, Cobb temporarily stayed the DHS restrictions from taking force ""[u]nless and until Defendants show that no Section 527 funds are being used for these purposes.""

Plaintiffs’ attorneys from the Democracy Forward Foundation said the administration hasn’t shown that none of those funds are being used to implement the latest notice policy.

He told her not to open it. Masked agents then forced their way in and pointed guns at the family, yelling at them, Thao recalled.

""I was shaking,"" he said. ""They didn't show any warrant; they just broke down the door.""

Amid a massive surge of federal agents into the Twin Cities, immigration authorities are facing backlash from residents and the local leaders for warrantless arrests, aggressive clashes with protestors and the fatal shooting of mother of three Renee Good.

""ICE is not doing what they say they're doing,"" St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, a Hmong American, said in a statement about Thao's arrest. ""They're not going after hardened criminals. They're going after anyone and everyone in their path. It is unacceptable and un-American.""

Encounter caught on video

Thao, who has been a U.S. citizen for decades, said that as he was being detained he asked his daughter-in-law to find his identification but the agents told him they didn't want to see it.

Instead, as his 4-year-old grandson watched and cried, Thao was led out in handcuffs wearing only sandals and underwear with just a blanket wrapped around his shoulders.

Videos captured the scene, which included people blowing whistles and horns and neighbors screaming at the more than a dozen gun-toting agents to leave Thao's family alone.

Thao said agents drove him ""to the middle of nowhere"" and made him get out of the car in the frigid weather so they could photograph him. He said he feared they would beat him. He was asked for his ID, which agents earlier prevented him from retrieving.

Agents eventually realized that he was a U.S. citizen with no criminal record, Thao said, and an hour or two later, they brought him back to his house. There they made him show his ID and then left without apologizing for detaining him or breaking his door, Thao said.

DHS defends operation

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security described the ICE operation at Thao's home as a ""targeted operation"" seeking two convicted sex offenders.

""The US citizen lives with these two convicted sex offenders at the site of the operation,"" DHS said. ""The individual refused to be fingerprinted or facially ID'd. He matched the description of the targets.""

WATCH: Twin Cities on edge as ICE raids ignite fear and protests

Thao's family said in a statement that it ""categorically disputes"" the DHS account and ""strongly objects to DHS's attempt to publicly justify this conduct with false and misleading claims.""

Thao told the AP that only he, his son and daughter-in-law and his grandson live at the rental home. Neither they nor the property's owner are listed in the Minnesota sex offender registry. The nearest sex offender listed as living in the zip code is more than two blocks away.

DHS did not respond to a request from The Associated Press seeking the identities of the ""two convicted sex offenders"" or why the agency believed they were present in Thao's home.

Thao's son, Chris Thao, said ICE agents stopped him while he was driving to work before they went to detain his father. He said he was driving a car he borrowed from his cousin's boyfriend. Court records show that the boyfriend shares the first name of another Asian man who has been convicted of a sex offense. Chris Thao said the two people are not the same.

Family fled Laos after helping U.S.

The family said they are particularly upset by ChongLy Thao's treatment at the hands of the U.S. government because his mother had to flee to the U.S. from Laos when communists took over in the 1970s since she had supported American covert operations in the country and her life was in danger.

Thao's adopted mother, Choua Thao, was a nurse who treated CIA-backed Hmong soldiers in the U.S. government's ""Secret War"" from 1961 to 1975 against the communists, according to the Hmong Nurses Association website.

Choua Thao, who passed away in late December, ""treated countless civilians and American soldiers, working closely with U.S. personnel,"" her daughter-in-law Louansee Moua wrote on a GoFundMe page for the family.

ChongLy Thao says he's planning to file a civil rights lawsuit against DHS and no longer feels secure to sleep in his home.

""I don't feel safe at all,"" Thao said. ""What did I do wrong? I didn't do anything.""

Here are the themes that have shaped his first 365 days in office.

Slashing the federal workforce and agencies

Elon Musk was initially the face of the president's vow to cut waste, fraud and abuse in government. He and the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, took a chainsaw to the federal workforce through buyouts, reductions in force and shuttering offices. Those efforts resulted in the loss of more than 317,000 federal employees by November, although that was offset by 68,000 hires, according to the Office of Personnel Management. Some jobs were reinstated after court challenges.

DOGE also claimed to have cut billions in federal spending, although CBS News' analysis found the savings were a fraction of what was claimed.

Agencies that didn't align with Mr. Trump's mission were targeted for cuts or elimination, including the U.S. Agency for International Development. The president is also trying to fire nearly every employee of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, arguing it has overstepped its mission. ""RIP CFPB,"" Musk posted on X in February. In December, a judge blocked the White House from defunding the agency.

The Trump administration is currently trying to dismantle the Education Department and transfer many of its programs to other departments, arguing that doing so will help return education decisions to states.

The attorney general has also gutted the Justice Department office that prosecuted public corruption cases.

The Trump administration announced it would eliminate 20,000 jobs from the Health and Human Services Department, about a quarter of its workforce. The cuts included 1,300 who were fired from the National Institutes of Health, as well as $2 billion in funding. Public health agencies have also slashed funding for vaccine development and mental health and addiction programs, although some cuts were reversed. The president also withdrew the U.S. from the World Health Organization.

Nonetheless, overall federal spending has not decreased under Mr. Trump. According to federal data analyzed by the Peterson Foundation, outlays in December 2025 were $5 billion higher than in December 2024. The national debt continues to climb.

Settling scores with political foes, targeting rivals — and rewarding allies

The Trump-era Justice Department has targeted the president's political enemies, including former FBI Director James Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James and John Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser. Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff and Rep. Eric Swalwell, who helped lead the impeachment charge against him during his first time in office, have also been the targets of investigations.

Mr. Trump has denied involvement in the prosecutions, but has publicly encouraged the Justice Department to look into some of his political opponents.

The administration has also targeted six Democratic members of Congress who appeared in a video in November urging members of the military to refuse to follow ""illegal orders."" Five of the lawmakers said they had received inquiries from the Justice Department, the Pentagon has moved to demote and cut the pension of Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, who is a retired Navy captain.

The Federal Reserve has also fallen into the administration's crosshairs, after the president has repeatedly called on the central bank to lower interest rates. Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman, said the Federal Reserve was recently served subpoenas over his testimony about renovations at the central bank's headquarters, and said the move was part of a pressure campaign. The president has also sought to fire Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook, alleging she committed mortgage fraud. Cook is challenging her ouster, and the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments in the case this week. Powell is expected to attend.

Over the summer, the Justice Department fired dozens of employees who worked on special counsel Jack Smith's dual investigations into Mr. Trump.

The White House also revoked the security clearances of many officials, including former President Joe Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris, members of Biden's national security team, Bolton and other current and former national security figures.

Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has used his pardoning power to wipe away criminal charges from allies and political figures of his choosing.. He pardoned nearly everybody charged or convicted in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot on his first day in office, and he granted clemency to Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar, former GOP Rep. George Santos, former Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vazquez, former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojavich and former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez.

Carrying out mass deportations and immigration enforcement

Mr. Trump campaigned on a promise to carry out the largest deportation operation in history. In mid-December, the Department of Homeland Security said there had been an estimated 1.9 million self-deportations and more than 622,000 deportations up to that point. As of last week, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement held 73,000 detainees in custody, the most ever recorded. The administration aims to be able to hold upwards of 100,000 immigration detainees at any given time, as part of its effort to carry out a deportation crackdown of unprecedented proportions.

The Trump administration has signed agreements with countries to accept immigrants who are not their citizens. In addition to several Latin American countries, some that are half a world away have also agreed to accept deportees, like Eswatini,Uganda, South Sudan, Laos, Myanmar, Kosovo and Rwanda.

Apprehensions at the Southwest border are at record lows. In December, U.S. Customs and Border Protection apprehended 6,478, 96% lower than the prior year.

In March, Mr. Trump invoked wartime authority to send hundreds of mostly Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison. According to a Human Rights Watch report, half had no criminal history and just eight had been convicted of violent or potentially violent crimes. One Salvadoran man who was deported and held in CECOT in error, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was returned to the U.S.; officials then filed criminal charges against him and are also trying to deport him to another country. All of the Venezuelan men sent to CECOT were later flown to Venezuela as part of a prisoner swap.

Under Mr. Trump, DHS has launched an immigration enforcement campaign in cities across the country, sending federal law enforcement to Charlotte, Chicago, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York City and Portland. Immigration raids have often been met with protests.

Clashes between authorities and civilians have turned up the temperature, most recently with an ICE officer's fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis this month.

The president deployed National Guard troops to assist and protect federal law enforcement, drawing lawsuits. California, Illinois and Oregon sued, arguing the president was reaching beyond his authority, and judges often sided with the states. The National Guard will remain in Washington, D.C., this year, but Mr. Trump sent guard members home from other jurisdictions at the end of 2025.

Despite the extensive resources being devoted to deportations, the president told ""60 Minutes"" in November the immigration raids ""haven't gone far enough.""

Flexing American power overseas, realigning U.S. foreign policy

Some of the most consequential moves of the president's term so far have involved his willingness to exert American military power overseas and upend relations with longstanding U.S. allies.

In June, the U.S. carried out major strikes against three Iranian nuclear facilities in an operation called ""Operation Midnight Hammer."" Mr. Trump has recently threatened to strike the Iranian regime again over its crackdown and killing of protesters.

Amid a military buildup in Latin America, the U.S. has carried out at least 34 known strikes on boats the administration claimed were ferrying drugs in the Caribbean and Pacific Oceans. The strikes have killed more than 120 people.

In an extraordinary and controversial military feat, U.S. forces infiltrated Venezuela and captured then-President Nicolás Maduro on Jan. 3. Mr. Trump soon announced the U.S. would be running the country and taking control of Venezuela's oil infrastructure. The U.S., the White House says, will sell the oil for the benefit of Venezuelans, Americans and U.S. oil companies.

Asserting power over Venezuela is one part of the president's ""Donroe Doctrine,"" which holds that the U.S. should wield influence over the Western Hemisphere and play less of a role in Europe's affairs.

But the president's audacious campaign to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, has sparked intense concern among NATO allies, flying in the face of modern Western democracies' rejection of imperial expansion. The president has refused to rule out the use of military force to acquire the territory, and says he'll impose tariffs on European countries objecting to his efforts — telling several countries he no longer feels ""an obligation to think purely of Peace"" because he wasn't awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

The president has pushed for a resolution to the war in Ukraine, but peace efforts stalled after a high-level summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska in August.

The Trump administration, with the help of partners in the Middle East, brokered a long-sought ceasefire and peace deal between Israel and Hamas in October. The implementation of the agreement is still underway, but all living hostages have been returned, and the tenuous peace appears to be holding.

Reshaping economic policy, focusing on trade and a love for tariffs

Mr. Trump calls himself ""the tariff king,"" and his love for tariffs — what he's called his ""favorite word"" — has reshaped international trade and international relations. Mr. Trump insists tariffs are bringing in billions of dollars for the country, although economists say U.S. consumers will ultimately pay higher prices. Studies show that U.S. importers generally pay the tariffs, not the foreign countries.

The stock market has continued to climb under Mr. Trump, although inflation, unemployment, hiring and layoff data are a mixed bag. Nearly three in four Americans say the president isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, and just over three in four Americans say their income isn't keeping up with inflation, according to the latest CBS/YouGov poll.

New U.S tariffs on Chinese goods set the stage for a trade war between the world's largest economies over everything from computer chips and rare earth metals to soybeans and TikTok, briefly sending both countries' tariffs on each other to over 100%. Mr. Trump met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in October and struck a deal that partially defused tensions.

The president's signature economic legislation, which he calls the ""big, beautiful bill,"" extended a set of tax cuts passed in Mr. Trump's first term, partially paid for through restrictions on Medicaid and food stamps.

Pushing the limits of presidential power

Despite Republican control of both chambers of Congress, Washington has passed few pieces of major legislation, with Mr. Trump relying heavily on executive actions to accomplish his objectives. He signed 228 executive orders — not including other types of executive actions — in 2025 and the first weeks of 2026, according to the Federal Register, easily outpacing all other presidents in their first year in office.

The president's use of emergency powers to levy tariffs without approval from Congress has been challenged all the way to the Supreme Court. The justices are expected to rule soon on whether the president had the constitutional right to impose the tariffs. If the court rules he did not, the U.S. government may have to find a way to repay the levies.

The president's uses of military force without congressional approval in Syria, Iran and Venezuela — and his deployments of National Guard forces to U.S. cities — have also raised questions about constitutionality and the limits of executive power. The Supreme Court blocked a Guard deployment to Chicago last month.

After an impasse in Congress led to the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, the White House tested the limits of its power to unilaterally move money around. It kept sending out paychecks to members of the military and FBI agents, sought to lay off thousands of idled government workers and threatened to pause food stamp payments, drawing legal challenges.

Bending institutions to his will

Another theme of Mr. Trump's presidency continues to be pushing institutions to bend to his will. The president has terminated government contracts and revoked security clearances with major law firms that represented political opponents. The American Bar Association sued over the approach, calling it a ""law firm intimidation policy."" Some firms, under pressure, reached agreements with the administration to spend millions of dollars on pro bono work.

Mr. Trump has pressed both federal agencies and private employers to end diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs, and his administration has targeted what it views as ""woke"" initiatives in the military, business, education and other aspects of American society.

The Trump administration threatened to sue or otherwise pressured universities over their diversity and inclusion practices, pro-Palestinian campus protests or granting of in-state tuition to undocumented immigrants, cutting off funding to some schools. Columbia University settled with the administration to avoid further investigations, and Brown University, Cornell University, Northwestern University and UPenn all reached some type of agreement with the administration.

The president has also personally sued multiple news organizations over their coverage. Ahead of the inauguration, ABC News parent Disney agreed to pay $16 million to settle a defamation suit Mr. Trump brought. CBS News was also among those the president sued, and then Paramount, CBS News' parent company, agreed to pay $16 million to settle a suit over a 2024 ""60 Minutes"" interview with Kamala Harris. Neither company admitted wrongdoing.

Dealmaking with companies and countries

Rather than imposing uniform policy through legislation, the president prides himself on making deals — the more deals the better — with individual companies and nations. The tariff negotiations with different rates for various countries are a prime example of that.

The president has sought to broker individual deals with pharmaceutical companies to bring down the prices of drugs for Americans. Among the medications that could be sold direct-to-consumer at lower costs are GLP-1 weight loss drugs Ozempic, Wegovy and Zepbound.

The president has also unveiled deals to invest in U.S. manufacturing and infrastructure with tech giants like Apple, Meta and OpenAI as well as trading partners like South Korea and Japan — though some of the corporate investments predated Mr. Trump.

The administration sought to broker a deal for TikTok's China-based parent company to sell its American operations to U.S. investors, avoiding a legally mandated nationwide ban on the social network. It's not yet clear if the deal will be approved by Chinese officials.

Mr. Trump let Japan-based Nippon Steel buy U.S. Steel, but with a ""golden share"" that allows the president to review some major corporate decisions.

Putting his stamp on the White House and Washington, D.C.

The president has moved to make his imprint on the White House itself and Washington, D.C., as a whole, forging ahead with plans to build a large ballroom on the grounds of the executive mansion and construct a new triumphal arch to match other major monuments.

Mr. Trump demolished the East Wing of the White House in October with little warning, paving the way for his ballroom project. Architects working on the ballroom presented plans to a board that oversees construction on federal land earlier this month. The president has said the cost of the project, which has ballooned to roughly $400 million, will be covered by private donations. Some of those donations have come from firms and individuals with extensive business before the federal government.

Mr. Trump has renovated other parts of the White House, including by building a patio in the Rose Garden, installing massive new flagpoles on the grounds, redecorating the Oval Office with gold-colored furnishings and installing a ""Presidential Walk of Fame"" with photos of his predecessors — except former President Joe Biden, who is represented by an image of an autopen.

Mr. Trump has also touted plans for the construction of a triumphal arch across the Potomac River in Virginia. Mockups of the arch the president showcased in October bore the title ""Independence Arch.""

The president has also worked to affix his name to institutions around the capital. Mr. Trump's handpicked board of the Kennedy Center, Washington's premier arts venue, voted to rename the institution the Trump-Kennedy Center, a change that would require Congress to become official.

The administration also added Mr. Trump's name to the U.S. Institute of Peace in December. The State Department said the change was meant to ""reflect the greatest dealmaker in our nation's history.""",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/19/68da839b-011c-4506-8f0b-d4d737921bad/thumbnail/1200x630/0255f385cde8db0f2e3a9132d7381bc4/ap26016654582380.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 11:01:45.573183

Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress have wanted to limit the Trump administration’s ability to shift DHS funding between accounts.
Under the package, the Education Department would receive $79 billion, a slight increase of $217 million above current funding.
A cut is in store for the Department of Transportation, which would be funded at $25.1 billion, a $111 million reduction.
Then last week the Senate cleared a package funding the departments of Justice, Interior, Commerce, and Energy, as well as the EPA, water programs and federal science initiatives.","After the fatal shooting by an ICE agent in Minneapolis this month, congressional Democrats have demanded that any new DHS funding come with conditions to crack down on the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement tactics, even as many Democratic voters call for defunding the agency.

The final compromise would keep ICE funded at $10 billion for the fiscal year that ends in September, while reducing the agency’s budget for enforcement and removal efforts. It would mandate that DHS use $20 million to outfit immigration enforcement agents with body cameras, direct the department to give officers more training on diffusing conflict while interacting with the public and provide $20 million for independent oversight of DHS detention facilities.

Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the House’s top Democratic appropriator, acknowledged that the legislation does not include some of the “broader reforms Democrats proposed,” such as preventing DHS from detaining and deporting U.S. citizens or blocking the department from using other agencies’ personnel for immigration enforcement.

“I understand that many of my Democratic colleagues may be dissatisfied with any bill that funds ICE,” DeLauro said in a statement, adding that House Republicans have committed to holding a separate vote on DHS funding in the package. “I share their frustration with the out-of-control agency.”

Democrats note that federal cash would stop flowing to other agencies, including TSA and FEMA, if Congress allows DHS funding to lapse, while the Trump administration could continue funding ICE with the pot of $75 billion Republicans enacted for immigration enforcement through the party-line tax and spending package they enacted last summer. The other alternative — running DHS on a stopgap funding patch — would maintain the status quo for money and policy while giving the Trump administration more discretion in how to use DHS cash.

Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress have wanted to limit the Trump administration’s ability to shift DHS funding between accounts. To accomplish that, the bill reduces the amount of money the department can transfer and suspends DHS power to shift money if the department doesn’t comply with transparency requirements.

The legislation rejects many of the funding cuts the Trump administration sought but does not substantially increase the budgets of major domestic agencies besides the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

The bill includes $84.3 billion for HUD, a $7.2 billion boost that amounts to about 9 percent over the department’s current budget.

Under the package, the Education Department would receive $79 billion, a slight increase of $217 million above current funding. The Department of Health and Human Services would be funded at nearly $117 billion, a $210 million increase, while the Department of Labor would get $13.7 billion, a $65 million hike.

A cut is in store for the Department of Transportation, which would be funded at $25.1 billion, a $111 million reduction.

Tacked on to the funding package is bipartisan health care legislation that includes a crackdown on drug intermediaries known as pharmacy benefit managers, renewals of several public health programs and $4.6 billion in fiscal 2026 funding for community health centers.

The deal does not address the Obamacare subsidies that lapsed on Jan. 1, nor does it address most of the proposals in a White House health framework released last week. Most parts of the deal had a shot at becoming law in December 2024 but were torpedoed by Elon Musk and President Donald Trump.

Congress has 10 days to clear the package for Trump’s signature before federal funding is set to lapse for the programs it covers, which account for more than 70 percent of the cash lawmakers approve each year to keep federal agencies running.

Because the Senate is in recess this week, the chamber will need to pass the legislation when senators return the last week of January if Congress is going to head off another funding lapse.

Within the stopgap funding patch enacted in November, lawmakers approved a full year of funding for the departments of Agriculture and Veterans Affairs, as well as the operations of Congress and the FDA. Then last week the Senate cleared a package funding the departments of Justice, Interior, Commerce, and Energy, as well as the EPA, water programs and federal science initiatives.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F5a%2Fc2%2F1ab7a3074a46b263b0fbfd2c0be7%2Fu-s-congress-28265.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 11:01:49.418115

An Open Letter to Tech Companies

To the executives and board members of United States tech companies,

We have seen how the current administration is pressuring tech companies to limit efforts to fight the spread of mis- and disinformation, to forgo critical AI safeguards in favor of moving quickly, and to ignore the potential negative impacts your products, tools and services may have on the civil rights of your users. On behalf of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition of more than 240 organizations dedicated to protecting the rights of all people in the United States, and our Center for Civil Rights and Technology we implore you: do not capitulate to this pressure, and stay true to the values that your customers and users count on.

People are looking to you for leadership. We call on you to take this opportunity to be on the right side of history and to do what is best for not only your users, but also for the business interests that drive innovation and result in products and services that we all can trust.

Our recommendations:

As leaders shaping the future of technology, you are facing a defining moment: the rise of AI is an opportunity for the industry to flex its muscle and build new, innovative products that work for everyone. Proactively promoting principles around equity, fairness, and efficiency will help guarantee success:

Prioritize user experience: Engage in content moderation. Content moderation allows you to improve user experiences and retain advertisers. If your technology enables violence, threats, harassment, defamation, doxxing, and toxicity, your users can and will seek out alternatives to your product, and advertiser spending will follow. Likewise, if your technology empowers disinformation, deepfakes, voter suppression, and other anti-democratic and unpatriotic efforts, your users will cease to trust you and your product.

In order to be trustworthy, content moderation needs to be transparent: moderated content should always be coupled with a specific rationale. It needs to be responsive to reality, which requires an understanding of context beyond the current capabilities of AI. In order to be trustworthy, it must be done with human oversight. These humans should be employees, not contractors, and should be granted all of the respect and protections awarded to any other employee. Outsourcing content moderation to your users through crowdsourced models like Community Notes is not enough. As private companies, you have a legal right and a responsibility to your users to decide what is published on your platforms.

Prioritize user safety: Implement AI with care. Developing and deploying AI should be done thoughtfully, safely, transparently, and equitably. Adhering to these principles means monitoring AI for bias, making AI tools accessible to researchers, disclosing training data, and other reasonable efforts to minimize the black box effect. Our recently published Innovation Framework: A Civil Rights Approach to AI offers a step-by-step guide for implementing these values throughout the AI development and deployment lifecycle.

There are already countless instances of AI causing harm: biased AI systems in essential sectors – like banking, healthcare, housing, education, and justice – have resulted in people being denied mortgages, being pushed out of housing, being passed over for educational opportunities, and being wrongfully arrested. You have the power to say “no more.”

Prioritize user civil rights: Show us with actions, not words.

It may feel expedient to cooperate with the current administration to avoid retribution, but our communities have long memories, and we will remember what you do right now. Your employees will remember. Consumers will remember. Making the right decisions today will build lasting trust with your users.

Show us you’re with us with your actions, not only your words. One clear action you can take is this: Do not give this administration, or any future administration, technology or consumer data that can be weaponized against our communities. Nowhere is this clearer than with immigration enforcement, where the administration is relying on surveillance technology and consolidation of our most personal data to target and disappear our family members, friends, and neighbors. This is only possible with the proactive collaboration of companies like yours.

We also urge you to be true partners in supporting comprehensive data privacy measures that protect consumers from unwarranted intrusion and harms from companies and government alike. These actions are not only the right things to do; they are the best long-term business decisions.

Civil rights are not a constraint; they are a catalyst for sustainable growth, innovation, and widespread beneficial impact. As leaders of major tech companies, you have the power – and the opportunity – to make products that change the world for the better.

Our rationale:

The Trump administration’s push to centralize authority under the banner of “efficiency” raises serious questions about its long term intentions. With significant influence now exerted over regulatory bodies, including previously independent agencies, Congress, and the judiciary, it is not surprising that it has now turned its attention to the private sector – particularly the tech industry, which holds immense sway over public discourse, innovation, and our daily activities.

The administration’s attempts to exert authority over the tech industry is a significant development, especially since it is leveraging federal agencies like the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Federal Communications Commission to attempt to shape industry behavior in ways that harm people.

However, regulatory pressure appears to be only part of the strategy. Another dynamic is emerging, one in which companies are encouraged to seek approval or favor from the administration to avoid potential consequences and obtain federal contracts. This creates a climate of uncertainty, where alignment with political interests is becoming a prerequisite for stability. Some companies have capitulated to this pressure – not necessarily out of agreement, but out of caution. This dynamic has not been lost on the public.

It is vital that companies recognize this pattern and consider its implications in both the short and long terms. Your choices today about how your products adhere to civil rights will affect not only your users’ trust in technology, but the long-term viability of your businesses and the technology industry as a whole. You must consider the consequences, not just for your business and your autonomy, but for the broader health of the societal norms that allow your business to thrive.

For these reasons, civil rights must be a strategic priority:

Trust is the foundation of user engagement. Technology is facing heightened scrutiny as users want more transparency, fairness, and respect. The Leadership Conference’s Civil Rights Monitor and a recent Pew survey found that people are increasingly worried about AI. Safeguards around privacy, speech, and equity show users that your company is taking their concerns seriously, which builds loyalty, reduces churn, and strengthens brand reputation across diverse US communities.

Innovation depends on inclusion. Practices like minimizing risks, making equitable platforms, considering AI’s impact on marginalized communities, building representative workforces, and ensuring the technology works for all do not hinder innovation; they unlock it. Inclusion and diversity foster creative and safe environments, help to identify and mitigate harmful risks, and simply put, enable companies to build better products.

Proactive leadership drives business success. Building products that respect the rights of individuals, families, and society is not only the right thing – it is the smart thing. By embedding safeguards now, your companies will stay ahead of governments around the world that are shifting compliance standards to protect their citizens. You will avoid costly litigation and position yourselves and the United States as global leaders who set standards for others to follow. By making careful decisions on who you do business with now – and who you prioritize in divisive times – you will show your users where you stand and foster long-term success.

Let us ensure that your technologies and the way we use them reflect the values we all stand for. A better world is possible, and it is your responsibility to help humanity get there. We would welcome further discussion: please email techcenter@civilrights.org.

Monica Hopkins, Executive Director of the ACLU of the District of Columbia, said:

“The people of D.C. have faced historic onslaughts on our civil rights and liberties under the second Trump administration. Our neighborhoods have been flooded with military troops and federal agents. Exemplary federal employees have lost their jobs in a political purge. And our local democracy has been undermined by the power-grabbing president and his allies in Congress.

But We the People of D.C. will not be intimidated into silence and inaction. Since day one, people and organizations across the District have answered the call to defend democracy in our nation’s capital. Because despite the Trump administration’s attempts at fear and intimidation, every one of us in the District has rights, regardless of who we are, where we come from, or what we believe.

In this first year, the ACLU-D.C. along with our partners and brave clients, filed twelve lawsuits to defend our rights and liberties from the Trump administration. We’ve sued to stop unlawful immigration arrests because no one should live in fear of being targeted and abducted every time they walk their kids to school, head to work, or go see a doctor. We've filed lawsuits to stop other egregious abuses of power against immigrants’ rights as well. We sued to stop the administration from detaining people in inhumane conditions at the notorious Guantanamo Bay prison and deporting people without a fair process – and even with no process, as was the case for hundreds of people shipped off to a Salvadoran torture prison. We've also sued to protect the right to free speech, the right to vote, and the right to be free from discrimination.

And we are just getting started. We’re meeting year two of this administration with the full force of our organization’s 65 years of experience defending fundamental rights and liberties in our nation’s capital.

We will continue educating our communities and mounting this resistance because it’s up to all of us to defend simple and foundational principles of our democracy.”",https://www.acludc.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Press-Releases.png,N,,2026-01-20 11:01:54.248345

We don’t want to create warfare in the street.” A blackout by workers can send a message, Knutson said.

Organizers are urging Minnesotans not to work, shop or go to school. The Trump administration has dispatched some 3,000 federal agents to the state, in what it claims amounts to its largest enforcement operation thus far, amid a broader crackdown on immigration.

More than 2,400 people in Minnesota have been arrested in recent weeks. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer fatally shot Good, 37, in Minneapolis earlier this month.

“There is an unprecedented and outrageous attack being waged against the people of Minnesota. I have never seen anything like it in my life,” said Kieran Knutson, the president of Communications Workers of America (CWA) Local 7250 in Minneapolis. “This is just an outrageous acceleration and escalation of violence toward working-class people.”

The CWA, which represents workers in the state at companies including AT&T, Activision and DirecTV, is one of several local unions organizing and supporting the planned economic blackout.

Others include Unite Here Local 17, Saint Paul Federation of Educators and Minneapolis Federation of Educators Local 59.

Chelsie Glaubitz Gabiou, the president of the Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation, AFL-CIO, said: “Working people, our schools and our communities are under attack. Union members are being detained commuting to and from work, tearing apart families. Parents are being forced to stay home, students held out of school, fearing for their lives, all while the employer class remains silent.”

“I think what generated the idea for this action comes out of the need to figure out what we can meaningfully do to stop it,” said Knutson. “The government in the state of Minnesota has not offered any path towards stopping these attacks, this violence.”

Knutson expressed hope that “the CEOs of all these corporations that are based in Minnesota take notice”.

Large US corporations headquartered in Minnesota include Target, Best Buy, United Healthcare and General Mills. None immediately returned requests for comment.

As the administration continues to send ICE agents to the Minnesota region, Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey has complained in recent days that the city’s police are outmanned and outgunned.

“Can our cops arrest them? From a legal perspective, yes,” he said during an interview on the Bulwark podcast. “From a practical perspective, to state the reality, it does get kind of hard when they drastically outnumber us, and they have bigger guns than we do. We don’t want to create warfare in the street.”

A blackout by workers can send a message, Knutson said. “Those of us in the trade union movement understand the leverage and power that our labor has, and we are going to try and use that, because really there’s nothing else left,” he told the Guardian. “The idea is that we use our collective power to show those that rule this country and those that profit off of our labor that there’s a cost to attacking our communities this way.”

Organizers held a press conference last Tuesday, outside of the Hennepin county government center in Minneapolis, to announce that the event, which will also include a march and rally in the city’s downtown at 2pm local time.

“On Friday, January 23, we are calling for a day of truth and freedom,” said JaNaé Bates Imari, a minister and co-executive director of the multi-faith non-profit Isaiah. “It is a day where every single Minnesotan who loves this state and this notion of truth and freedom will refuse to work, to shop, and to go to school. What we have experienced and are experiencing in the state of Minnesota is not normal.”

The White House did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the planned economic blackout.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said: “The fact that those groups want to shut down Minnesota’s economy, which provides law-abiding American citizens an honest living, to fight for illegal alien murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, drug dealers, and terrorists says everything you need to know.”

The spokesperson reiterated the administration’s claim that Good “weaponized” her car before the shooting. This account of the incident has been disputed by local and state leaders in Minnesota, as well as by eyewitnesses. Video footage of the shooting appears to show Good’s vehicle turning away from the officer as he opened fire.

The DHS spokesperson added that “if these community and faith leaders wanted to take a stand for the vulnerable”, they would stand with federal law enforcement officers, whom the spokesperson claimed have faced a sharp increase in assaults and vehicle attacks. They did not provide evidence for this allegation.

“These men and women are moms and dads who risk their lives on a daily basis to protect innocent, law-abiding Americans from the dangerous criminal illegal aliens in their communities,” the spokesperson added.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0a5229a0c721430b47dc7f4031d75e65e30aabd/244_0_5200_4160/master/5200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=945ba541da6da6c21d4b97d27780a047",N,,2026-01-20 12:00:01.274990

A YEAR OF ATTACKS AND RESILIENCE

(New York, NY) – Today marks one year since the second inauguration of President Trump, a year defined by the dramatic escalation of abusive attacks on immigrants and the rule of law. Civil society organizations like the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) have been at the forefront of the pushback to protect immigrant communities in the United States, recognizing that attacks on immigrants are attacks on all of us and indeed on democracy itself.

This year, IRAP has challenged in court the unlawful suspension of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP), the transfer to and detention of immigrants at Guantánamo Bay, the total abandonment of Afghan allies, and the attempted termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Syria and Burma. IRAP’s advocacy prevented thousands of TPS holders from being stripped of their ability to live and work legally in the United States, and secured the entry and resettlement of many already-approved refugees left in limbo by the suspension of USRAP.

The following is a statement from Sharif Aly, President of IRAP:

“A year ago today, President Trump signed an Executive Order indefinitely suspending the United States refugee program. While we have been in court ever since fighting to restore this critical lifeline for refugees fleeing violence and persecution, the government has only intensified its brutal assault on immigrants and those who support them.

The Trump administration is now subjecting refugees and immigrants living in the United States and their communities to the same kind of abuses many refugees once fled. Guided by xenophobia and racism, the Trump administration is targeting all immigrants, regardless of their legal status, deep community connections, or criminal record. This is not just an attack on immigrants; it is an attack on American communities and ideals that makes everyone less safe.

In just the last two weeks, we have been horrified to see armed ICE agents arrest and detain refugees with absolutely no claim that they have broken any law. These are dangerous times full of immense challenges, but we will not back down. IRAP will continue to fight every day for the right of every person to live in peace, safety, and dignity. Increasingly, our democracy depends on it.”

Zohran Mamdani, the newly installed New York City mayor, framed inequality as an economic issue at the Brooklyn Academy of Music’s annual MLK Day celebration.
But some typical MLK Day events were cancelled, including a dinner at Indiana University in Indianapolis.
A church in Westbrook, Maine, cancelled an MLK Day service due to “unforeseen circumstances”, according to the parish website.
At Ebenezer Baptist church in Atlanta, where Dr King preached, there were calls on Monday to unite against injustice.","Martin Luther King Jr Day was marked with parades and services across the US on Monday. But the celebration for the achievements of the slain 60s civil rights leader was tempered by contemporary anxieties over racial and social equality and Trump administration’s crackdown in Minneapolis.

At a rally in Harlem, the Rev Al Sharpton referred to Renee Good, the 37-year-old mother of three who was killed by an immigration officer in Minneapolis earlier this month.

“If she cursed them out does that give them the right to shoot her?” he asked. “Now they’re talking about sending in the national guards, sending in more ICE agents. We are in a state that Dr King would have been fighting against this country going this far.”

Sharpton called for a broad sense of unity, saying that “if people are on our side, we can disagree without being disagreeable because we have folks that are adversarial to the interests of our community.

“We need to make a pledge on King Day that we gonna fight and make what should happen to preserve the dream of Dr King,” he added.

Zohran Mamdani, the newly installed New York City mayor, framed inequality as an economic issue at the Brooklyn Academy of Music’s annual MLK Day celebration.

“While the city is wealthy beyond measure, it is also deeply unequal,” he said. “Some New Yorkers sleep in penthouses. Others sleep on the sidewalk below.

“We cannot only speak of Dr King’s legacy as if it is a legacy of rights that can be given to people,” he said. “It must also be a legacy of rights that those people can exercise themselves.”

In Washington, hundreds of people marched along Martin Luther King Jr Avenue to honor the civil rights leader.

“We got to continue to do this because not just of Dr King, but of what he stood for,” said Sam Ford, a retired broadcaster and member of the Martin Luther King Jr Day Parade Committee. “The struggle continues.”

Parade participant Harold Hunter echoed that sentiment. “It’s not just a white thing or Black thing. This is a people thing,” he said.

Wisdom Cole, NAACP senior national director of advocacy, said elevated fears within racially diverse and immigrant communities meant that King Day observances were forced to take a more urgent tone. “We are faced with increased police and state violence inflicted by the government,” he said.

The Movement for Black Lives said it had planned events in Atlanta, Chicago, Oakland and other cities under the banner “Reclaim MLK Day of Action”.

“This year it is more important than ever to reclaim MLK’s radical legacy, letting his wisdom and fierce commitment to freedom move us into the action necessary to take care of one another, fight back, and free ourselves from this fascist regime,” Devonte Jackson, a national organizing director for the coalition, said in a statement.

At the National Civil Rights museum in Memphis, Tennessee, located on the site of the former Lorraine Motel, where King was shot on 4 April 1968, was opened and offering free admission, an annual tradition.

“This milestone year is not only about looking back at what Dr King stood for, but also recognizing the people who continue to make his ideals real today,” the museum president, Russell Wigginton, told the Associated Press.

But some typical MLK Day events were cancelled, including a dinner at Indiana University in Indianapolis. In a social media post, the school’s Black Student Union said the event was officially cancelled because of “budget constraints”, but the group expressed concern that the cancellation was “connected to broader political pressures”.

A church in Westbrook, Maine, cancelled an MLK Day service due to “unforeseen circumstances”, according to the parish website. A member of the congregation’s “social justice and peace committee” told the local news site NewsCenterMaine.com that the service was cancelled because agents from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) were in the area.

This year’s Dr King celebration comes a year since Donald Trump was inaugurated for his second term.

Trump’s inauguration ushered in an administration opposed to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, whether in government agencies, schools, universities or cultural institutions.

The justice department’s civil rights division, which under previous administrations has been charged with rooting out discrimination against minority groups, has shifted focus.

In comments to the New York Times this month, Trump said civil rights protections and affirmative action programs had hurt white people. “White people were very badly treated, where they did extremely well and they were not invited to go into a university or a college,” he said.

Meanwhile, the administration has launched aggressive anti-immigration operations in several Democratic-led cities.

Maya Wiley, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, one of the nation’s oldest and largest civil rights coalitions, told the Associated Press that the Trump administration’s priorities made clear it is actively trying to erase the movement for social justice.

Citing healthcare access, affordable housing, good-paying jobs and union representation, Wiley said, “things Dr King made part of his clarion call for a beloved community are still at stake and is even more so because (the administration) has dismantled the very terms of government and the norms of our culture”.

Last month, the National Park Service said it would no longer offer free admission to parks on King Day and Juneteenth, but would instead offer free admission on Flag Day – 14 June. That day is also Trump’s birthday.

At Ebenezer Baptist church in Atlanta, where Dr King preached, there were calls on Monday to unite against injustice. Senator Raphael Warnock, a Georgia Democrat and Ebenezer’s senior pastor, said the administration was “trying to weaponize despair and convince us that we are at war with one another”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8b3c03f813d72e3416f8b7c33bd615ad0ca7fd8/0_0_4167_3335/master/4167.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=72ef2ffbcef3243e228749ea953b3a28",N,,2026-01-20 11:59:09.291631

A curated guide to major news and developments over the weekend. Here’s today’s news:

GREENLAND

In a late-night flurry of posts to his Truth Social account, President Donald Trump doubled down on his threats to take Greenland and said he would meet with European leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland to talk about the spiraling crisis. He is expected to arrive at the Forum on Wednesday. In one of his posts, he said he’d told NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, “Greenland is imperative for National and World security. There can be no going back.” Trump also posted at 12:58 a.m. an AI-generated image of himself in the Oval Office with European leaders and displaying a map where the United States, Canada, and Greenland are covered in the American flag. The Financial Times reports; Michel Rose and Stine Jacobsen report for Reuters.

During his social media spree, Trump also posted screenshots of private messages he’d received from world leaders over Greenland, including one from French President Emmanuel Macron that read, “I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland.” CNN reports.

Trump also criticized the United Kingdom’s decision to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, a deal his administration previously supported, calling it an act of “great stupidity.” He said it was another reason the United States needed to acquire Greenland. Haley Ott for ABC News.

Over the weekend, Trump continued to push for American control of Greenland, risking damaging relations with Europe beyond the point of repair. Following Trump’s threats of economic coercion and military invasion of a NATO ally, “Veteran observers of European politics said the alliance between Europe and the United States that formed in the aftermath of World War II had already been fundamentally altered,” Michael D. Shear reports for the New York Times.

On Saturday, Trump posted on Truth Social that if the United States did not get a deal to buy Greenland, he would first impose a 10 percent tariff “on any and all goods sent to the United States of America,” from a certain group of European countries in February. He threatened to raise the rate to 25 percent in June. The threats upended months of trade negotiations between the United States and Europe. Adam Gabbatt, Robert Mackey, and Callum Jones for The Guardian.

In response, European capitals are considering hitting the United States with €93 billion in tariffs. “The retaliation measures are being drawn up to give European leaders leverage in pivotal meetings with the US president at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, officials involved in the preparations said.” Henry Foy and Mercedes Ruehl report for the Financial Times.

In a text message to Norway’s prime minister Trump said that because he was not awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, he no longer felt “an obligation to think purely of Peace,” and therefore was pursuing the “Complete and Total Control of Greenland” in the interests of the United States. The text was forwarded by the White House to multiple European ambassadors in Washington. Geir Moulson and Jill Lawless report for the Associated Press.

Following a weekend of escalating U.S. threats, Denmark deployed additional troops to Greenland on Monday. Richard Milne, Henry Foy, Barbara Moens, and George Parker report for the Financial Times.

Over the weekend, thousands of people marched in Copenhagen to protest Trump’s escalating threats. “The crowd, waving Greenlandic flags, chanted ‘Greenland is not for sale.’ Many demonstrators wore red hats in Trump’s own ‘Make America great again’ fashion that read, ‘Make America go away.’” Barbara Sprunt for NPR.

A small European troop deployment to Greenland last week for an Arctic security exercise was viewed by some European officials as having been misread in Washington and as helping spur Trump’s retaliatory rhetoric and tariff threats, the Financial Times reported, citing officials and diplomats. The move was framed as a show of solidarity with Denmark and an “Arctic security” signal, but some diplomats said the messaging was too subtle or too easily misconstrued, while others doubted any reframing would have changed Trump’s response. Charles Clover, Richard Milne, and Amy Kazmin report.

TRUMP’S “BOARD OF PEACE”

When it brokered a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, the Trump administration announced that a “Board of Peace” would oversee the rebuilding of the Gaza Strip, but it became clear over the weekend that Trump intends it to have a more ambitious mandate, “potentially rivaling the United Nations in what would be a major upheaval to the post-World War II international order,” reports Matthew Lee for the Associated Press.

The Times of Israel published the full text of the board’s charter, which it says “was attached to the invitations sent out to dozens of world leaders who were asked to join Trump on the panel tasked with overseeing the postwar management of Gaza.”

Trump has named himself chair of the international organization and given himself veto power. He has invited world leaders to join the board, telling them if they pay $1 billion, they can secure a permanent seat while those countries that do not pay will have a three-year membership. “On Friday, Trump announced seven members on a founding executive board, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and former British prime minister Tony Blair. Three others include World Bank President Ajay Banga, deputy national security adviser Robert Gabriel and billionaire private equity chief Marc Rowan.” Lauren Kaori Gurley and Michael Birnbaum report for the Washington Post.

France rejected Trump’s offer to join the “Board of Peace” and Trump responded on Monday by threatening a 200 percent tariff on French wine. The statement from the office of French President Emmanuel Macron said the board’s charter “goes beyond the framework of Gaza and raises serious questions, in particular with respect to the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question.” Clea Caulcutt for POLITICO.

Trump invited Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping to join the Board of Peace. “Later on Monday, the Belarusian Foreign Ministry said President Alexander Lukashenko also received an invitation to join the board.” Ivana Kottasová and Anna Chernova for CNN; Bloomberg reports.

Israel has also been invited, two sources briefed on the matter told Reuters, though it was not immediately clear whether Israel has accepted. Reuters reports.

Trump wants to hold a signing ceremony for the Board of Peace this week at Davos, which, along with the crisis over Greenland, is “transforming this week’s annual gathering of the global elite into an emergency diplomatic summit.” Cat Zakrzewski and Emily Davies report for the Washington Post.

MINNESOTA

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz mobilized the state’s National Guard on Saturday to support local law enforcement and emergency agencies as protests continue in Minneapolis over federal immigration enforcement, though troops have not been deployed to city streets and remain “staged and ready to respond.” Guard units have been pictured preparing equipment and are expected to assist with public safety and protection of peaceful assembly should conditions deteriorate. Holly Yan, Hanna Park, Sydney Bishop, Zoe Sottile report for CNN.

Up to 1,500 active-duty U.S. soldiers, primarily from two infantry battalions of the Alaska-based 11th Airborne Division, have been placed on prepare-to-deploy orders for a possible mission to Minnesota, the Pentagon confirmed to reporters, though no decision has been made on whether the troops will actually be sent. Konstantin Toropin reports for the Associated Press.

The Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey over whether their public statements unlawfully impeded federal immigration enforcement, with grand jury subpoenas issued as part of the probe but not yet received by either office, according to people familiar with the matter. Officials said the investigation is proceeding under a rarely used Civil War–era obstruction statute, based on a theory that state and local leaders conspired to interfere with federal agents. NBC News reported the statute was highlighted in a recent memo from Attorney General Pam Bondi that outlined legal tools prosecutors could use to pursue cases against individuals the administration has described as domestic extremists. Ryan J. Reilly and Peter Alexander report for NBC News.

On Friday, a federal judge in Minneapolis ordered ICE agents and other immigration officials to stop using excessive force against protesters while conducting their operations in the city. The judge’s order included detailed accounts of how ICE agents are treating people in the city: “A protester detained, her bra removed and wedding ring cut off, and some of her clothes never returned. The ‘gratuitous deployment’ of pepper spray. A couple’s car surrounded by agents, who pointed semiautomatic weapons at them at close range.” Stephanie Saul reports for the New York Times.

On Monday, the Trump administration said it was appealing the judge’s preliminary injunction. Mitch Smith for the New York Times.

The Justice Department is also asking the court to allow its surge of ICE agents in Minnesota to continue after a lawsuit was filed last week by state and local officials claiming that the deployment was unconstitutional. Minnesota had pushed for the federal judge to immediately block the deployment of 3,000 federal agents but she made no rulings last week. Mitch Smith reports for the New York Times.

Multiple attorneys say people being detained during ICE operations in Minnesota are being denied the constitutional right to see an attorney by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). “Four attorneys told ABC News they have been denied access to their clients at the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis, where they are being held,” Matt Rivers, Janice McDonald, and Armando Garcia report.

The FBI determined shortly after Renée Good’s killing that “sufficient grounds existed to open a civil rights probe into the actions of Jonathan Ross, the officer who shot Good.” The Justice Department says no such investigation exists. Perry Stein reports for the Washington Post.

Protesters interrupted a church service in St. Paul, MN, on Sunday. Protesters chanted outside a church where one of its pastors appears to also be the acting director of ICE’s field office for enforcement and removal operations in St. Paul, Lauren McCarthy, Maia Coleman, and Emily Cochrane report for the New York Times.

The Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division will investigate Sunday’s church protest, officials said. Assistant U.S. Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon cited violations of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. Andy Rose and Elise Hammond report for CNN.

IRAN

Iran’s judiciary signaled Sunday that some people involved in the recent unrest could still face execution, despite Trump’s suggestion otherwise. Judiciary spokesperson Asghar Jahangir said certain protest-linked conduct is being treated as “moharebeh,” or “waging war against God,” an offense that can carry the death penalty, and warned the cases would be “quickly prosecuted and punished.” He also said anyone who “collaborates with the enemy” during unrest would be punished under “clear” legal provisions. Billy Stockwell reports for CNN.

Iranian protester Erfan Soltani remains alive and in good physical health after fears he would be executed on Wednesday, a relative and a human rights group said. CNN.

A senior Iranian official confirmed the death toll from last week’s protests has topped 5,000, including about 500 members of the security forces, with some of the deadliest unrest in Iran’s Kurdish northwest. Reuters reports.

SYRIA

After several days of clashes, Syria’s government and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) reached a ceasefire agreement on Sunday, with President Ahmed al-Sharaa and SDF commander Mazloum Abdi agreeing that the SDF would pull back from key Arab-majority areas including Raqqa and Deir al-Zor. The deal also contemplates the SDF’s integration into Syria’s armed forces and the handover to Damascus of oil and gas sites, border crossings, and detention facilities holding Islamic State suspects. The Associated Press reports.

Turkish officials said Monday that the agreement’s terms to cede territory to Damascus could clear Ankara’s main impediment to restarting Turkey’s stalled peace process with the PKK, the Kurdish separatist group. Reuters.

An unknown number of Islamic State (IS) detainees escaped from Shaddadi prison in Syria’s Hasaka region amid renewed fighting around the detention facilities in the northeast and a security breakdown that left control of the site contested, with Damascus and the SDF trading blame over how control was lost. The SDF said the prison—one of three the SDF controls in the Hasakah region—came under repeated assault by “Damascus factions” and that its forces repelled the attackers several times before temporarily losing control, adding that several of its fighters were killed and more than a dozen others wounded. Ghaith Alsayed for the Associated Press.

Syrian authorities said around 120 IS detainees escaped from Shaddadi prison, adding that government forces moved into the area after the breakout and had recaptured 81 during sweep operations, with searches ongoing. Kurdish outlet Rudaw, citing an SDF spokesperson, put the number far higher—around 1,500 escapees. Reuters.

The SDF said it made repeated appeals to a nearby U.S.-led coalition base for assistance during the assault on Shaddadi prison by “Damascus factions,” but that the coalition did not intervene. The SDF added that dozens of its fighters were killed or wounded while defending the facility. Reuters.

U.S. Central Command said a U.S. strike in northwest Syria on Friday killed an Al Qaeda affiliate leader, Bilal Hasan al-Jasim, whom it described as “an experienced terrorist leader.” CENTCOM said al-Jasim helped plan attacks and was directly linked to the ISIS gunman who carried out the Dec. 13 ambush near Palmyra that killed two U.S. service members and an American interpreter and wounded other U.S. and Syrian personnel. ​​Marlene Lenthang reports for NBC News.

TARIFFS AND OTHER U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

If the Supreme Court rejects the legal foundation for Trump’s tariff program, the administration would move “the next day” to reimpose similar levies under other authorities, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said. In a Jan. 15 interview, Greer said the White House has “a lot of different options.” Ana Swanson for the New York Times.

U.S. consumers and importers paid about 96 per cent of the cost of last year’s U.S. tariff increases, with foreign exporters absorbing only about 4 per cent through lower prices, new research from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy found—cutting against Trump’s repeated claim that foreigners are footing the bill. Using roughly $4 trillion in shipment data from between Jan. 2024 and Nov. 2025, the researchers also found that after surprise tariff hikes on Brazil and India in August 2025, exporters largely did not cut unit prices to offset the tariffs, instead shipping less to the United States, pointing to higher U.S. prices over time and reduced export volumes rather than “foreign-paid” tariffs. Tom Fairless reports for the Wall Street Journal.

The National Guard will remain deployed in Washington, D.C., through 2026. About 2,400 troops are currently stationed in the city and they are mostly from Republican-controlled states. Steven Beynon reports for ABC News.

The three highest-ranking U.S. Catholic archbishops said Monday that recent U.S. actions on Venezuela, Ukraine, and Greenland raise “basic questions about the use of military force” and have put America’s moral role “under examination.” Michelle Boorstein and Anthony Faiola report for the Washington Post.

Chief Immigration Judge Teresa Riley emailed immigration judges instructing them that they are not bound by federal court rulings requiring bond-hearing eligibility for many detainees, according to documents the ACLU of Massachusetts filed with a Boston federal court Friday. The ACLU said the directive shows a deliberate effort to disregard those rulings, with a hearing scheduled for today. Reuters reports.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

A D.C. federal judge declined to pause the administration’s new seven-day notice requirement for congressional visits to ICE detention facilities, explaining in a Monday order that the policy constitutes a new agency action not covered by her prior ruling and that the lawmakers raised the challenge through the wrong procedural mechanism. Michael Kunzelman reports for the Associated Press.

According to an international coalition of lawyers’ groups, it is now dangerous to be a lawyer in the United States. “The Day of the Endangered Lawyer, an annual event to raise awareness of risks to members of the profession, has in recent years picked Belarus, Iran and Afghanistan as its subject. For 2026, it has chosen the US.” Kaye Wiggins for the Financial Times.

And people at every level, from parents without legal status to the governors of states, can keep bringing the Administration into court.","Paper and clocks are associated with first wedding anniversaries, or so the gift guides say. As the United States reaches the one-year mark in its increasingly dysfunctional and abuse-laden political marriage with Donald J. Trump, though, the President has made it clear that he will take almost any sort of gift—even, and maybe especially, someone else’s Nobel Peace Prize medal. The Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado offered hers up to him last week, in a large gold-colored frame, ready for hanging. Although something of a pathetic gesture, given that the Trump Administration seems to have cut a deal with the remnants of Nicolás Maduro’s government (while Maduro himself is in a Brooklyn jail), it did earn her an upgrade. After Maduro’s arrest, Trump said that Machado was “a very nice woman, but she doesn’t have the respect”; post-medal bestowal, she was “a wonderful woman” and her gift “a wonderful gesture of mutual respect.” Those words might even get her somewhere, if only she had control over a lot of oil reserves. But clocks can make good gifts, too. After a group of Swiss businessmen arrived at the White House in November, bearing a desk clock in the form of an oversized Rolex, the country got a break on tariffs.

Those who aren’t trying to please the President might still keep clocks in mind this January 20th, because the country is in a countdown. Three hundred and sixty-five days of Trump means a thousand and ninety-six to go, including a leap year. (That’s not counting all the Trump first-term days, of course; this is a tragedy of remarriage.) We have aged so much in Trump years that the Biden Administration can feel much longer ago than it was. The brief era of Elon Musk running around the White House may now seem like a fever dream—he and Trump seem to have an off-and-on thing—but hundreds of thousands of people lost their jobs in his wake or otherwise had their lives changed irrevocably, including recipients of U.S. aid around the world. On January 1st, millions of Americans lost their health-care subsidies. Immigrants, even legal ones, live with a new level of fear. So, too, do many academics, scientists, and even lawyers. There’s an undercurrent of political violence that wasn’t present in the same way a year ago.

Crucially, there are now only two hundred and eighty-seven days until the midterm elections, which have at least the potential to significantly change the balance of power in Washington. Republicans control both houses of Congress, but the margins are slim: 218–213 in the House of Representatives, giving the G.O.P. a hold so tenuous that the Majority Whip, Tom Emmer, has reportedly indicated that he won’t excuse absences for matters other than “life or death”; the margin in the Senate is 53–47. The entire House is up for reëlection, and it is more than plausible that the Democrats will prevail there; taking the Senate, where thirty-five seats will be contested, will be much tougher, though not impossible. Even before November, there will be special elections for four vacant House seats, including the one held, until recently, by the Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene. Her spinning away from the Trump majority—spurred by, of all things, the Jeffery Epstein case—may be an indication that this Administration is decaying more quickly than the calendar alone would indicate.

For at least some other Republicans, at this one-year juncture, the breaking point may be Trump’s uncannily serious talk of buying or seizing Greenland, a territory of our NATO ally Denmark. Some MAGA types love the idea, but, as Politico reported, the Senate Majority Leader, John Thune, said last week that there was “certainly not an appetite for some of the options that have been talked about or considered.” That statement came before Trump’s announcement, this past Saturday, that he will be imposing tariffs on Denmark and seven other European countries “until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland.” Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, has raised the possibility of invoking the War Powers Act, a tool that Congress has for reining in the President. Not incidentally, Tillis has said that he will not seek reëlection this year. His seat is open, and one of the top targets for Democrats, who have a strong candidate in former Governor Roy Cooper.

North Carolina matters a great deal, because fewer than a dozen Senate seats are in contention at all, and only a handful are close calls; the others are in states that are solidly red or blue. One is in Minnesota, where Senator Tina Smith, a Democrat, has decided not to run again. That race, in that state, is a reminder that, though calendars are crucial, any calculation can be upset in the seconds it takes, for example, for an ICE agent to open fire into an S.U.V. The situation in Minneapolis is precarious, with Trump threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act and put troops on the streets. “If I needed it, I’d use it,” he told reporters on Friday, on his way to Mar-a-Lago. “It’s very powerful.” His Justice Department is reportedly investigating Mayor Jacob Frey and Governor Tim Walz for impeding immigration enforcement, both of whom have described the move as an attempt to intimidate them. (This past year has certainly been very different for Walz, who was Kamala Harris’s running mate, than it would have been.)

Depending on what Trump does next, Minneapolis may become the scene not only of passing chaos but of a breakdown in the relationship between Americans and their government. Precisely because of those stakes, it is worrisome that two of the leading Democratic contenders for Smith’s seat—Representative Angie Craig, who has a reputation as a centrist, and Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan, who is more aligned with the Party’s progressive wing—have been quarrelling, in personal terms, about whose response to the ICE actions and to a social-service-fraud scandal involving the Somali community is better. The intraparty divisions that the two women represent are profound and will play out in primary races at every level. One question is which kind of Democrat has the best chance in November. The answer may differ state to state; one of the more endangered Democratic seats is that of Senator Jon Ossoff, in Georgia.

A judicial clock is running down alongside the electoral one. Trump has issued two hundred and twenty-eight executive orders—eight more than in his entire first term and sixty-six more than Joe Biden did in his four years—along with other dubious actions and pronouncements. These orders have been met by a stream of lawsuits—hundreds of them, by the A.P.’s count—which should keep coming. (Paper is a traditional first-anniversary gift, after all.) The A.P. even brought its own case, Associated Press v. Budowich, after it was barred from the White House press room for refusing to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. It’s hard, with Trump, to separate the absurd from the catastrophic. Between now and July, the Supreme Court will hear arguments or issue rulings on a number of the most significant cases occasioned by Trump’s actions, including his attempt to do away with birthright citizenship. On Wednesday, the day after Trump’s Inaugural anniversary, the Court will hear arguments in a case over his attempt to fire a member of the Federal Reserve’s board of governors; Jerome Powell, the chair of the Fed, recently released a video statement saying that he was being criminally investigated in retaliation for not setting interest rates where the President wanted them.

When Trump was inaugurated, there were fears that he might get three or even four more chances to name a Justice to the Supreme Court. It’s a small blessing that, with a year down, he hasn’t had any yet. Still, one Justice, Clarence Thomas, may be counting days for his own reasons. Thomas is currently the fifth-longest-serving Justice ever, having taken his seat on October 23, 1991. By mid-May, he will have moved up three spots, to be the second-longest-serving. Will that be enough for him to decide to retire while Trump can still appoint his successor? (It would take until April, 2028, for him to pass William O. Douglas for the No. 1 spot. Trump, depending on the makeup of the Senate, may have fewer options to get a nominee confirmed by then.) And Thomas, who is seventy-seven years old, is one of four septuagenarians on the Court. The others are Samuel Alito, seventy-five; Sonia Sotomayor, seventy-one; and John Roberts, seventy.

There are other countdowns. On February 3rd, about three hundred and fifty thousand Haitians are due to lose their Temporary Protected Status, though some may be able to find a different route to stay in the U.S. legally. The Administration has also cancelled, or is trying to cancel, T.P.S. for hundreds of thousands of people from other countries, including Venezuela, Somalia, Nepal, and Nicaragua. There is ongoing litigation, but people with T.P.S., which is meant for migrants from countries in crisis, and a related immigration status, called humanitarian parole, are especially vulnerable, because both Biden and his predecessors relied on the discretion of the executive branch to extend them that relief in the first place. Trump is, in effect, attempting to make use of the same discretion, in reverse, but without regard to the fact that many of these migrants are well settled in their communities, with jobs, neighbors, and children who are citizens, or to the conditions in their home countries. One question is whether he’s done so in an illegitimately arbitrary way, but a majority of the Justices may back him up; they have already stayed certain lower-court attempts to put some of these cancellations on hold. Cruelty, sadly, is not necessarily unconstitutional, at least not in the eyes of the Court.

Indeed, if we’ve learned anything about our constitutional structure in the past year, it’s that the Presidency has, over time, been given too much power. The abdication of the other branches, particularly Congress, to the executive, on matters ranging from military action and surveillance to the economy and immigration, did not begin with Trump. The corollary is that, while Trump can break many things—he can seize a foreign leader, he can scuttle alliances, he can derail lives, and he can make Americans even angrier at one another—whoever comes next will have a lot of power to undo his damage and rebuild. Even he doesn’t have enough control over his party or the courts to keep the next elections from happening, even if having a fair election in every district will require vigilance. (It always does, to some degree.) By that same measure, a President J. D. Vance or Marco Rubio could make the hole we are in much deeper. The Democrats have only so much time to figure out who their own standard-bearer will be. That said, the Party should not move so quickly as to foreclose a truly contested primary, which would have been valuable in 2024.

But that election will be in 2028, and here we are, still in 2026, still with Trump—and still with time to mobilize for the midterms. What Congress has given to Presidents it can also begin to take away. It will take years and a galvanized counter-majority to truly restore the balance, but even just winning one of the chambers back would provide a significant brake on the MAGA vision of executive power. And people at every level, from parents without legal status to the governors of states, can keep bringing the Administration into court. 2026 will be the year for pushing back against Trump with a ballot in one hand and a lawsuit in the other. There is no going back to how things were before January 20, 2025, but there may yet be a better way forward. ♦","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/696e90abdc919c8e5d3aa225/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Sorkin_SecondFirstYear_AP26012069870543.jpg",N,,2026-01-20 11:02:52.964286

WASHINGTON — A federal judge refused Monday to temporarily block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring a week’s notice before members of Congress can visit immigration detention facilities.

U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C., concluded that the Department of Homeland Security didn’t violate an earlier court order when it reimposed a seven-day notice requirement for congressional oversight visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.

Cobb said she wasn’t ruling on whether the new policy passes legal muster. Rather, she said, plaintiffs’ attorneys representing several Democratic members of Congress used the wrong “procedural vehicle” to challenge it. The judge also concluded that the Jan. 8 policy is a new agency action that isn’t subject to her prior order in the plaintiffs’ favor.

Plaintiffs’ lawyers asked Cobb to intervene after three Democratic members of Congress from Minnesota were blocked from visiting an ICE facility near Minneapolis earlier this month — three days after an ICE officer shot and killed U.S. citizen Renee Good in Minneapolis.

Last month, Cobb temporarily blocked an administration oversight visit policy. She ruled Dec. 17 that it is likely illegal for ICE to demand a week’s notice from members of Congress seeking to visit and observe conditions in ICE facilities.

A day after Good’s death, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem secretly signed a new memorandum reinstating another seven-day notice requirement. Plaintiffs’ lawyers said DHS didn’t disclose the latest policy until after U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig initially were turned away from an ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building.

On Monday, Cobb ruled that the new policy is similar but different than the one announced in June 2025.

“The Court emphasizes that it denies Plaintiffs’ motion only because it is not the proper avenue to challenge Defendants’ January 8, 2026 memorandum and the policy stated therein, rather than based on any kind of finding that the policy is lawful,” she wrote.

Twelve other Democratic members of Congress sued in Washington to challenge ICE’s amended visitor policies after they were denied entry to detention facilities. Their lawsuit accused Republican President Donald Trump’s administration of obstructing congressional oversight of the centers during its nationwide surge in immigration enforcement operations.

A law bars DHS from using appropriated general funds to prevent members of Congress from entering DHS facilities for oversight purposes. Plaintiffs’ attorneys from the Democracy Forward Foundation said the administration hasn’t shown that none of those funds are being used to implement the latest notice policy.

“Appropriations are not a game. They are a law,” plaintiffs’ attorney Christine Coogle said during a hearing Wednesday.

Justice Department attorney Amber Richer said the Jan. 8 policy signed by Noem is distinct from the policies that Cobb suspended last month.

“This is really a challenge to a new policy,” Richer said.

Plaintiffs’ attorneys said the matter is urgent because members of Congress are negotiating funding for DHS and ICE for the next fiscal year with DHS’s annual appropriations due to expire Jan. 30.

“This is a critical moment for oversight, and members of Congress must be able to conduct oversight at ICE detention facilities, without notice, to obtain urgent and essential information for ongoing funding negotiations,” the lawyers wrote.

Government attorneys have said it’s merely speculative for the legislators to be concerned that conditions in ICE facilities change over the course of a week. But the judge rejected those arguments last month.

“The changing conditions within ICE facilities means that it is likely impossible for a Member of Congress to reconstruct the conditions at a facility on the day that they initially sought to enter,” wrote Cobb, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden.",https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/APTOPIX_Immigration_Enforcement_Minnesota_28866_17980f.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2026-01-20 11:59:05.447326

Grand Rapids Mayor David LaGrand attended Monday’s meeting, and he said he’s been trying to confirm some of the online reports himself.","A priest, a rabbi, and ministers from a wide range of faith groups walked into Madison Place in Grand Rapids Monday, and called for more humane treatment of immigrants.

“We will not be judged by what we claim that we believe,” said the Rev. Karen Fitz La Barge with the group West Michigan Clergy Action. “We will be judged by what we are willing to risk, by whom we are willing to stand beside.”

The faith leaders gathered on a snowy Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, sharing stories of local immigrant families who they say have been detained by federal immigration officials in recent months.

The Rev. Reggie Smith, with the Christian Reformed Church in North America, said his neighbors on the southwest side of Grand Rapids are too afraid to shop at the local grocery store because of reports of arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“Something has changed about us,” Smith said. “And maybe on Martin Luther King’s Day — he taught us that we should recognize our own humanity — maybe our immigrant neighbors aren’t the one that need to be saved. Maybe it’s us.”

Father Mike Cruickshank, a catholic priest with Cathedral of Saint Andrew, told the story of a man who he said was arrested at a routine office visit as part of his asylum case. The arrest, Cruickshank said, came as the man’s wife was seven months pregnant. The family has been separated since, according to Cruickshank.

He cited a recent “Special Message” from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops on immigration, which noted the government’s role in regulating immigration, but spoke out against conditions in detention centers.

“Today we commemorate of course the legacy of Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King Jr., a courageous defender of human dignity and civil rights,” Cruikshank said. “And his witness reminds us that silence in the face of injustice is not an option for people of faith.”

Rabbi Javier Cattapan of Temple Emanuel in Grand Rapids, himself an immigrant and naturalized citizen, called for elected officials to do more.

“We are calling for transparency, accountability, and due process,"" Cattapan said. ""We are calling on institutions and leaders to refuse policies that dehumanize and divide us.”

The meeting came as protests continued in Minnesota after an immigration enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Good, an American citizen. Grand Rapidians organized protests in the wake of the killing. And since then, rumors of immigration enforcement actions have swirled on social media in West Michigan.

Grand Rapids Mayor David LaGrand attended Monday’s meeting, and he said he’s been trying to confirm some of the online reports himself.

“It’s not as if I’m getting a daily report from ICE on what they’re doing anywhere,” LaGrand said. “Last week, I spent a chunk of my morning simply driving around a part of our town where I’d heard that ICE was out doing door-to-door encounters. And I didn’t see anything.” The mayor said he’s not sure which online reports are true, and which are not.

“We’re sort of operating in the dark,” LaGrand said. “We’re at a point where I think everyone has to be vigilant, but we don’t want to overreact.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/714cf24/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2016x1058+0+227/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Fd2%2F4cac221a4af0b554a1db1850f2ee%2Fimg-8719.jpeg,N,,2026-01-20 08:00:32.803909

In Minnesota, residents of Minneapolis and St. Paul remain on edge, as clashes between protesters and federal immigration officers continue into a third week.

It comes as the Department of Justice announced its plan to pursue charges against protesters in Minneapolis, while confirming it does not plan to investigate the circumstances surrounding the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent.

Special correspondent Fred de Sam Lazaro has the latest.

Fred de Sam Lazaro:

Another weekend and another intense wave of immigration enforcement in the Twin Cities, as more than 2,000 federal officers continue a crackdown characterized by aggressive force and unyielding protests.

It comes as weary residents brace for the potential deployment of active duty troops after President Trump threatened late last week to invoke the Insurrection Act, something Mayor Jacob Frey said Sunday would be -- quote -- ""shocking.

Jacob Frey:

You got to understand how wild this is right now. In Minneapolis, crime is dramatically down. We don't need more federal agents to keep people safe. We are safe.

Fred de Sam Lazaro:

Frey himself, along with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, are now reportedly under investigation by the Department of Justice for allegedly impeding federal law enforcement officers.

Yesterday, the Justice Department announced a separate investigation into protesters who disrupted a church service where they believed a local pastor was also an ICE official from the St. Paul office. That same day, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche again confirmed there would be no investigation into the altercation that has most roiled the city, the fatal shooting of Renee Good, killed by an ICE agent in her car on January 7.

Todd Blanche, U.S. Deputy Attorney General:

We investigate when it's appropriate to investigate. And that is not the case here, it wasn't the case when it happened and it's not the case today.

Fred de Sam Lazaro:

The Department of Homeland Security said its agents are facing -- quote -- ""rampant violence"" and have made 3,000 arrests in the last six weeks. The ""News Hour"" could not independently verify that number.

It all comes after a federal judge in Minnesota ruled agents could not arrest or pepper spray peaceful demonstrators, including those monitoring ICE operations.

Kristi Noem, DHS secretary, said on CBS' Face the Nation yesterday that the judge's ruling -- quote -- ""didn't change anything.""

Kristi Noem, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary:

That federal order was a little ridiculous, because that federal judge came down and told us we couldn't do what we already aren't doing.

We -- we are -- have not engaged in...

Margaret Brennan, Host, ""Face the Nation"": Well, we just saw video of chemical agents being used.

Kristi Noem:

... any -- we only use those chemical agents when there's violence happening and perpetuating and you need to be able to establish law in order to keep people safe.

Fred de Sam Lazaro:

Nonetheless, the Justice Department said today it would appeal the court ruling. This weekend, a planned anti-Islam pro-ICE rally, which was set to feature a Koran burning, drew few supporters.

But its organizer, far right activist Jake Lang, had to be escorted from the scene, ironically by counterprotesters themselves, after he was swarmed and pelted with water balloons. Lang could be seen bleeding from his head and later claimed he had been stabbed, but Minneapolis police said no report had been filed.

Even for Minnesota, weather here in recent days has been unusually cold, about the only indication that temperatures are turning down here.

“The third death at Camp East Montana is a tragedy that serves as an urgent warning to us all.
As KTSM previously reported, human rights groups sent a letter to ICE officials back in December, demanding an end to the immigration detention center at Camp East Montana.","EL PASO, Texas (KTSM) — A coalition of Texas and New Mexico immigrant rights, legal advocacy, and faith-based organizations is demanding the immediate closure of Camp East Montana following the third in-custody death at the detention center, it was announced in a news release.

3rd detainee dies at Camp East Montana

The coalition said it condemns the death of Victor Manuel Diaz — a 36-year-old undocumented migrant from Nicaragua — as it’s the third death connected to this detention center, “underscoring a deadly pattern of abuse, neglect, and impunity that has defined the facility since its opening.”

Diaz died on Wednesday, Jan. 14, at Camp East Montana. He was pronounced deceased at 4:09 p.m., and his death was a presumed suicide, according to ICE. However, the official cause of his death remains under investigation.

The announcement of Diaz’s death comes just days after The Washington Post reported last week that 55-year-old Geraldo Lunas Campos’ death — the second detainee who died at the detention center — could be ruled as a homicide.

Report: Death at Camp East Montana could be ruled a homicide

The coalition said that Lunas Campos “died from asphyxiation after guards choked him to death, and that federal authorities subsequently are threatening to deport key witnesses to the incident, raising grave concerns about accountability and efforts to suppress evidence of abuse at the facility.”

Additionally, Francisco Gaspar Cristobal Andres was the first detainee held at the Fort Bliss immigration facility to die. The 48-year-old man from Guatemala was taken to the hospital on Nov. 16 and died on Dec. 3 of “suspected natural causes.”

Camp East Montana detainee dies from ‘suspected natural causes’

The coalition is now calling on the Trump Administration to “immediately reverse course and demand that Congress act to end this cycle of abuse and impunity.”

“Camp East Montana must be closed without delay, and a full, independent investigation into all detention facilities must begin now. Failure to act will continue to cost lives,” read the news release.

Statements from representatives of these organizations read as follows:

Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center

“Camp East Montana was built to make people disappear, strip them of their rights, and warehouse human beings out of public view here in our border community. This is the third death at this facility, and each one shows the deadly cost of using detention as the default response to migration,” Marisa Limón Garza, executive director of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, said. “No one should die for seeking safety, dignity, or a future for their family. Camp East Montana is killing people, and it must be shut down immediately.”

Estrella del Paso

“We are outraged and heartbroken by the death of a third migrant at Camp East Montana. The three individuals who have died since August while detained were preventable deaths and reflect the dangerous and inhumane conditions migrants are being forced to endure. No one seeking safety, dignity, and opportunity should lose their life in government custody. Estrella del Paso calls for immediate accountability and transparency to ensure human rights violations and deaths at Camp East Montana cease immediately. Fort Bliss has a long and painful history of being used to carry out human rights atrocities – Japanese internment camps, the detention of unaccompanied children, and now immigrants. The Administration cannot continue to act with impunity and reckless disregard while people suffer and die behind locked gates. Every day that Camp East Montana remains open, thousands of parents, children, and individuals fleeing violence and poverty are placed at risk of losing their lives for seeking survival. We grieve the lives lost and stand in solidarity with their loved ones. Migrants are not disposable. They are human beings deserving of care, dignity, and protection. Camp East Montana should be shut down immediately. Anything less is a moral failure,” Melissa M. Lopez, executive director of Estrella del Paso, said

Border Network for Human Rights (BNHR)

“From the moment this makeshift mass detention camp opened, we warned that it would lead to grave abuse, neglect, and the systematic violation of fundamental human and civil rights. In recent weeks, our deepest fears have been realized through the unnecessary and preventable loss of human life,” Fernando García, executive director of the Border Network for Human Rights (BNHR), said. “The deaths of Víctor Manuel Díaz, Geraldo Díaz Campos, and Francisco Gaspar Cristóbal Andrés are not isolated incidents, they are the predictable outcome of a system that treats human beings as disposable in the name of an unaccountable and irrational enforcement strategy. This is a moral failure. We call on Congress to act with conscience, decency and humanity by fully investigating the conditions people are being forced to endure and by immediately shutting down Camp East Montana.”

Texas Civil Rights Project

“Three lives have now been lost at Camp East Montana in Fort Bliss due to irresponsible detention practices this year. They were sons, brothers, and fathers whose loved ones are never going to see them again. The federal government must be held accountable for these actions. As we see increased ICE and CBP enforcement continue to result in tragedy, the Texas Civil Rights Project calls on Congress to investigate the deaths of these men and immediately shut down Camp East Montana for the safety of all,” Rochelle M. Garza, president of the Texas Civil Rights Project, said.

ACLU of Texas

“We grieve the three lives already lost at this ICE detention center located on a U.S. military base,” said Savannah Kumar, ACLU of Texas staff attorney. “For months, we have interviewed people detained at Camp East Montana, who bravely spoke on the dangers they have experienced: beatings by officials, the denial of medical care, housing areas flooded with excrement, and inedible food that caused illness. Our letter alerted the government to conditions at a breaking point. We continue to demand, urgently, that ICE and the Department of Defense stop this cruelty by ending the detention of immigrants at Fort Bliss before additional lives are lost.”

Contigo Immigrant Justice

“It is clear that Fort Bliss Camp East Montana is not a place of safety, justice, or due process. We mourn the lives lost in detention and hold their families and loved ones in our hearts, knowing these deaths were preventable. Instead of cages and deaths, we need community-based alternatives that honor human dignity, provide access to legal counsel, and keep families together. We call for the immediate closure of Fort Bliss Camp East Montana and an end to the expansion of punitive detention that endangers lives,” Miles Tokunow, executive director of Contigo Immigrant Justice, said.

New Mexico Immigrant Law Center

“Camp East Montana needs to be closed immediately, and the community members detained there given urgent medical and legal access,” Teague Gonzalez, co-executive director at the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, said. “The human rights abuses taking place in this center are widespread. We cannot continue to allow our neighbors to be treated inhumanely. How many of our brothers and sisters need to die?”

“The third death at Camp East Montana is a tragedy that serves as an urgent warning to us all. When the government can haul anyone off the streets, anywhere in the country, and place them in a deadly detention camp, no one is safe. This should outrage anyone who values life, liberty, and human dignity and calls for immediate independent review, oversight and accountability,” Kristin Etter, director of policy and legal services of Texas Immigration Law Council, said.

As KTSM previously reported, human rights groups sent a letter to ICE officials back in December, demanding an end to the immigration detention center at Camp East Montana.

The groups summarized in the letter account of horrific conditions, including beatings and sexual abuse by officers against detained immigrants, the groups said in a news release.

However, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin responded to the accusations of inhumane conditions at Camp East Montana, saying they were “fearmongering clickbait.”

“Minnesota wants a veto over federal law enforcement,” the new filing by the Trump administration said, describing the lawsuit brought by state and local officials as an “absurdity” that “would render the supremacy of federal law an afterthought to local preferences.”

Officials in Minnesota filed the lawsuit last week in an effort to curb the administration’s ongoing crackdown in their state, equating the surge of federal immigration agents to the state to “a federal invasion” and citing violations of the 10th Amendment.

Reiner, a CNN medical analyst, cited Trump’s recent letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, in which he appeared to link his threats to acquire Greenland to his having not been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

“This letter, and the fact that the president directed that it be distributed to other European countries, should trigger a bipartisan congressional inquiry into presidential fitness,” Reiner wrote on the social platform X.

Trump’s message, which was shared with multiple European ambassadors, questioned why Denmark has a “right of ownership” over Greenland, a semiautonomous Arctic territory rich in minerals and seen as key to security in the region.

Trump’s continued efforts to acquire Greenland despite pushback from European allies has raised alarm in and out of the country.

ChongLy Thao, 56, a naturalized U.S. citizen who goes by the name Scott, was returned some time later Sunday without explanation or apology, he said.

“They just took me out there with no clothes on and then just covered with my grandson’s blanket. Yeah, they just took me out there, and I was like, ‘Man, this is, this is embarrassing,” Thao, a Hmong man born in Laos, said from the home Monday while neighbors were at work fixing the broken door.

Videos of the incident showing Thao barely clothed and covered in a blanket spread on social media, further fueling public outrage from some about the tactics being used in President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown in the Minneapolis area, where 3,000 agents have been deployed.

Louansee Moua, Thao’s sister-in-law, said it was frigid and snowing when Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers took him from the house. “It was so heartbreaking seeing him in that image,” Moua said. “You can’t get it out of your head. He has no clothes, and it’s, like, 12 degrees and it’s snowing.”

Moua said her brother-in-law went willingly with the officers without knowing why he was being detained. “He went willingly because he was afraid,” she said, adding that Thao’s demeanor is very generous and laid-back.

The Department of Homeland Security said that officers were investigating two convicted sex offenders at the address and that a U.S. citizen living there refused to be fingerprinted or facially identified, so he was detained.

“He matched the description of the targets. As with any law enforcement agency, it is standard protocol to hold all individuals in a house of an operation for safety of the public and law enforcement,” DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

In a statement Monday, Thao's family said the agency's account did not reflect their firsthand knowledge of the events or the living situation at the residence.

""The only individuals residing at the home are Mr. Thao, his adult son, his daughter-in-law, and his young grandson. The family does not know the individuals referenced in DHS’s statement,"" the family said.

Thao's family said officials did not present a warrant or request ID before he was detained.

""Mr. Thao did not resist and went with agents voluntarily, despite the absence of an explanation for his detention at the time,"" the family said in its statement.

A U.S. district Judge in Minnesota issued an injunction Friday blocking the Trump administration from some aggressive tactics that she said would “chill” an ordinary citizen from engaging in constitutionally protected protest. The Trump administration is appealing her injunction.

Thao said that his parents brought him from Laos to the United States in 1974 when he was 4 and that he became a U.S. citizen in 1991. During Sunday’s ordeal, he said, he feared being sent back to Laos, where he has no relatives.

He said he was singing karaoke when there was a loud noise at the door. He and his family hid in a bedroom, where the federal officers found him. Thao said he was trying to find his ID as officers escorted him out of the house.

Thao was wearing only boxer shorts and Crocs on his feet when officers denied him the chance to put on more clothes, he said. He used a blanket that his 4-year-old grandson had been sleeping with on the couch to cover his torso.

After they took his fingerprints and a photograph of him in the car, officers returned him to his home, Thao said.

Chris Thao, his son, said: “We came here for a purpose, right? ... To have a bright future. To have to have a safe place to live. If this is going to turn out to be America, what are we doing here?

Their removal proceedings are being held before the Detroit Immigration Court.
Instead, they have lived in the United States for many, many years and were apprehended during traffic or controlled stops.
Finally, the Court holds that by denying Petitioners bond hearings, Respondents have violated the INA.
“Accordingly, “IT IS ORDERED that Petitioners’ habeas corpus petition is GRANTED.","Where petitioners have requested habeas corpus relief, their petition should be granted because the respondents have violated the Immigration and Nationality Act by denying the petitioners bond hearings.

“Petitioners, although having no lawful immigration status, have resided in the United States for at least a decade, and for many of them, several decades. …

“Between August 9 and November 4, 2025, Petitioners were taken into immigration custody following routine traffic stops or targeted investigations. They have been detained ever since without a bond hearing pending removal proceedings. Petitioners are held at different facilities throughout Michigan. Their removal proceedings are being held before the Detroit Immigration Court.

“On November 10, 2025, Petitioners filed a Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §2241, claiming that their detention without a bond hearing violates the Immigration and Nationality Act (‘INA’) and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. …

“The key issue here is which provision of the INA applies to the detention of individuals like Petitioners—i.e., non-U.S. citizens facing removal proceedings who were not taken into custody at the border or a port of entry but after living in the United States for some period of time. The choice is between the discretionary detention framework of §1226(a), as Petitioners argue, or the mandatory detention requirement in §1225(b)(2), as Respondents argue. …

“Numerous courts throughout the country have been presented with the issue since July of this year, when ICE issued its mandatory-detention directive, thereby departing from the government’s longstanding interpretation of the INA as providing for the discretionary detention of individuals like Petitioners. An overwhelming majority of those courts have concluded that §1226(a) is the appropriate statutory framework. … This Court is persuaded by these decisions. …

“According to the plain language of the statute, §1225(b)(2)(A) applies only when an alien is ‘seeking admission’ and the ‘examining immigration officer’ concludes that the alien ‘is not clearly and beyond doubt entitled to be admitted.’ Petitioners were not in the process of seeking admission when they encountered federal officials who deemed them not entitled to be admitted. They were going about their everyday lives when they were stopped, arrested, and placed in ICE custody. The plain language of §1226, including the title of this section and its subsections, apply to their situation. …

“In short, §1226 provides the general rule for detention of noncitizens, while §1225 specifically covers noncitizens detained at a border or port of entry. Petitioners were not apprehended upon their arrival to the United States at a border or port of entry. Instead, they have lived in the United States for many, many years and were apprehended during traffic or controlled stops. Section 1226, therefore, governs their detention and each of them are entitled to a bond hearing under the statute’s discretionary framework. …

“The Court concludes that, with the exception of EOIR, the named individuals and agencies are proper Respondents in this case. The Court further concludes that Petitioners need not exhaust their administrative remedies to proceed with their request for habeas relief under §2241. Finally, the Court holds that by denying Petitioners bond hearings, Respondents have violated the INA. The Court therefore finds it unnecessary to address Petitioners’ due process claim at this time.

“Accordingly,

“IT IS ORDERED that Petitioners’ habeas corpus petition is GRANTED.

“IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that each Petitioner shall be afforded a bond hearing under §1226(a) before an immigration judge on or before 5:00 p.m. on December 10, 2025, or be released.”",https://milawyersweekly.com/files/2022/03/MILW_weblogo.png,N,,2026-01-20 05:57:38.398384

DOJ says Minnesota wants a ‘state veto’

What they're saying:

Federal attorneys argue that Minnesota is ""effectively seeking a state veto over the enforcement of federal law"" which the DOJ refers to as an ""absurdity.""

In its complaint, the state argued that the federal operation has created uncertainty and danger. Federal officials say Minnesota's ""sanctuary"" policies have ""exacerbated dangers"" posed by undocumented immigrants in the Twin Cities.

The DOJ also claims it's their own federal offices who are facing danger as assaults against federal officers have increased in recent months.

""Federal officers and agents face violent attacks at federal buildings, at immigration processing facilities, and while in the field conducting enforcement operations,"" the DOJ's response states. ""Foreign criminal organizations have offered thousands of dollars as bounties for the murder of federal immigration enforcement officers and agents. Because federal immigration officers and agents have faced doxing, including revelation of their home addresses, these threats extend to their families.""

The DOJ adds: ""In and around Minneapolis, ICE officers operating out of the St. Paul Office have been confronted with increased threats, violence, aggression, attacks, vehicle block-ins, and obstruction of immigration enforcement operations. The increase in these types of incidents has obstructed enforcement operations, interfered with officers’ official duties, and posed significant safety risks to not only ICE officers but also the public. These incidents have further increased since Operation Metro Surge launched in early December 2025.""

Dig deeper:

Federal attorneys also say the state's legal basis is flawed, claiming Minnesota's view of the Tenth Amendment is not how the law has been applied.

""The Tenth Amendment does not give a state or a city a veto power over those federal activities,"" the DOJ writes, citing a 2023 case. ""Rather, ‘in our system of dual federal and state sovereignty, federal policies frequently generate indirect effects on state revenues or state spending.’""

The DOJ also argues its operation hasn't infringed on Minnesota's core policing powers nor has it violated Minnesota's sovereignty.

Minnesota brings lawsuit against feds over ICE surge

The backstory:

Last week, the State of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul announced a lawsuit against federal authorities aiming to end the ICE surge in Minnesota.

In its argument, the state cites ""harm"" brought by the surge, including the shooting of Renee Nicole Good at the hands of an ICE agent a week ago, among other conflicts.

State officials argue the operation isn't about safety or fraud as federal officials claim, but rather political retribution. At a court hearing last Wednesday, a judge denied the state's request to force an immediate end to the ICE operation but kept the lawsuit on the fast track.

What's next:

The judge ordered the DOJ to file its response to the temporary restraining order by Monday.

The state now has until Thursday to respond to these arguments.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox9.com/www.fox9.com/content/uploads/2025/05/1200/630/ice.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2026-01-20 04:59:01.023999

“The third death at Camp East Montana is a tragedy that serves as an urgent warning to us all.
However, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin responded to the accusations of inhumane conditions at Camp East Montana, saying they were “fearmongering clickbait.”","EL PASO, Texas (KTSM) — A coalition of Texas and New Mexico immigrant rights, legal advocacy, and faith-based organizations is demanding the immediate closure of Camp East Montana following the third in-custody death at the detention center, it was announced in a news release.

The coalition said it condemns the death of Victor Manuel Diaz — a 36-year-old undocumented migrant from Nicaragua — as it’s the third death connected to this detention center, “underscoring a deadly pattern of abuse, neglect, and impunity that has defined the facility since its opening.”

Diaz died on Wednesday, Jan. 14, at Camp East Montana. He was pronounced deceased at 4:09 p.m., and his death was a presumed suicide, according to ICE. However, the official cause of his death remains under investigation.

The announcement of Diaz’s death comes just days after The Washington Post reported last week that 55-year-old Geraldo Lunas Campos’ death — the second detainee who died at the detention center — could be ruled as a homicide.

The coalition said that Lunas Campos “died from asphyxiation after guards choked him to death, and that federal authorities subsequently are threatening to deport key witnesses to the incident, raising grave concerns about accountability and efforts to suppress evidence of abuse at the facility.”

Additionally, Francisco Gaspar Cristobal Andres was the first detainee held at the Fort Bliss immigration facility to die. The 48-year-old man from Guatemala was taken to the hospital on Nov. 16 and died on Dec. 3 of “suspected natural causes.”

The coalition is now calling on the Trump Administration to “immediately reverse course and demand that Congress act to end this cycle of abuse and impunity.”

“Camp East Montana must be closed without delay, and a full, independent investigation into all detention facilities must begin now. Failure to act will continue to cost lives,” read the news release.

Statements from representatives of these organizations read as follows:

Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center

“Camp East Montana was built to make people disappear, strip them of their rights, and warehouse human beings out of public view here in our border community. This is the third death at this facility, and each one shows the deadly cost of using detention as the default response to migration,” Marisa Limón Garza, executive director of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, said. “No one should die for seeking safety, dignity, or a future for their family. Camp East Montana is killing people, and it must be shut down immediately.”

Estrella del Paso

“We are outraged and heartbroken by the death of a third migrant at Camp East Montana. The three individuals who have died since August while detained were preventable deaths and reflect the dangerous and inhumane conditions migrants are being forced to endure. No one seeking safety, dignity, and opportunity should lose their life in government custody. Estrella del Paso calls for immediate accountability and transparency to ensure human rights violations and deaths at Camp East Montana cease immediately. Fort Bliss has a long and painful history of being used to carry out human rights atrocities – Japanese internment camps, the detention of unaccompanied children, and now immigrants. The Administration cannot continue to act with impunity and reckless disregard while people suffer and die behind locked gates. Every day that Camp East Montana remains open, thousands of parents, children, and individuals fleeing violence and poverty are placed at risk of losing their lives for seeking survival. We grieve the lives lost and stand in solidarity with their loved ones. Migrants are not disposable. They are human beings deserving of care, dignity, and protection. Camp East Montana should be shut down immediately. Anything less is a moral failure,” Melissa M. Lopez, executive director of Estrella del Paso, said

Border Network for Human Rights (BNHR)

“From the moment this makeshift mass detention camp opened, we warned that it would lead to grave abuse, neglect, and the systematic violation of fundamental human and civil rights. In recent weeks, our deepest fears have been realized through the unnecessary and preventable loss of human life,” Fernando García, executive director of the Border Network for Human Rights (BNHR), said. “The deaths of Víctor Manuel Díaz, Geraldo Díaz Campos, and Francisco Gaspar Cristóbal Andrés are not isolated incidents, they are the predictable outcome of a system that treats human beings as disposable in the name of an unaccountable and irrational enforcement strategy. This is a moral failure. We call on Congress to act with conscience, decency and humanity by fully investigating the conditions people are being forced to endure and by immediately shutting down Camp East Montana.”

Texas Civil Rights Project

“Three lives have now been lost at Camp East Montana in Fort Bliss due to irresponsible detention practices this year. They were sons, brothers, and fathers whose loved ones are never going to see them again. The federal government must be held accountable for these actions. As we see increased ICE and CBP enforcement continue to result in tragedy, the Texas Civil Rights Project calls on Congress to investigate the deaths of these men and immediately shut down Camp East Montana for the safety of all,” Rochelle M. Garza, president of the Texas Civil Rights Project, said.

ACLU of Texas

“We grieve the three lives already lost at this ICE detention center located on a U.S. military base,” said Savannah Kumar, ACLU of Texas staff attorney. “For months, we have interviewed people detained at Camp East Montana, who bravely spoke on the dangers they have experienced: beatings by officials, the denial of medical care, housing areas flooded with excrement, and inedible food that caused illness. Our letter alerted the government to conditions at a breaking point. We continue to demand, urgently, that ICE and the Department of Defense stop this cruelty by ending the detention of immigrants at Fort Bliss before additional lives are lost.”

Contigo Immigrant Justice

“It is clear that Fort Bliss Camp East Montana is not a place of safety, justice, or due process. We mourn the lives lost in detention and hold their families and loved ones in our hearts, knowing these deaths were preventable. Instead of cages and deaths, we need community-based alternatives that honor human dignity, provide access to legal counsel, and keep families together. We call for the immediate closure of Fort Bliss Camp East Montana and an end to the expansion of punitive detention that endangers lives,” Miles Tokunow, executive director of Contigo Immigrant Justice, said.

New Mexico Immigrant Law Center

“Camp East Montana needs to be closed immediately, and the community members detained there given urgent medical and legal access,” Teague Gonzalez, co-executive director at the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, said. “The human rights abuses taking place in this center are widespread. We cannot continue to allow our neighbors to be treated inhumanely. How many of our brothers and sisters need to die?”

Texas Immigration Law Council.

“The third death at Camp East Montana is a tragedy that serves as an urgent warning to us all. When the government can haul anyone off the streets, anywhere in the country, and place them in a deadly detention camp, no one is safe. This should outrage anyone who values life, liberty, and human dignity and calls for immediate independent review, oversight and accountability,” Kristin Etter, director of policy and legal services of Texas Immigration Law Council, said.

As KTSM previously reported, human rights groups sent a letter to ICE officials back in December, demanding an end to the immigration detention center at Camp East Montana.

The groups summarized in the letter account of horrific conditions, including beatings and sexual abuse by officers against detained immigrants, the groups said in a news release.

However, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin responded to the accusations of inhumane conditions at Camp East Montana, saying they were “fearmongering clickbait.”",https://www.borderreport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2026/01/Camp-East-Montana-detention-facility_372906.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-20 08:00:45.621674

Nevada Avenue ICE raid

The backstory:

Video captured ICE officers armed with assault rifles pushing through the private home on Nevada Avenue in St. Paul last Thursday, Jan. 15.

A neighbor told FOX 9 that family members told the agents had a warrant for the raid but never presented the documentation.

In the aftermath of the raid, loved ones filed a habeas petition in U.S. District Court, demanding the release of all six extended family members, including a 12-year-old boy.

Judge order Venezuelan family release

What we know:

In response to the habeas filing, U.S. District Court Judge John Tunheim issued an order directing DHS to respond and produce a judicial warrant by 5 p.m. on Monday.

The court said that in the absence of a warrant, their release would be granted.

Once the deadline passed, Tunheim ruled that DHS and its attorneys failed to respond, and the court granted the habeas corpus petition. He gave the department 72 hours to release all six of the detainees, who are believed to have been transferred out of Minnesota following their arrest.

Tunheim’s order states, they must be ""immediately returned,"" prior to being set free.

The judge is also demanding that the government provide an update to the court on the family’s status to ensure the order was fulfilled within five days.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox9.com/www.fox9.com/content/uploads/2026/01/1200/630/st-paul-ice-raid-thumb.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2026-01-20 04:59:18.383055

Karianne Lisonbee, R-Syracuse, said earlier this year she was mulling such legislation.","SALT LAKE CITY — Immigration is a big focus of attention across the nation, and several proposals have emerged or are in the works for consideration when Utah's 2026 legislative session starts next week.

Most notably, Rep. Trevor Lee, R-Layton, has put forward a proposal that would prevent immigrants in the country illegally from being able to tap into public benefits. The measure, HB88, would potentially make immunizations by public health officials, food at food banks and housing at homeless shelters off limits to the population. ""Benefits and welfare should go to citizens only,"" said Lee, an ardent critic of illegal immigration who also worries about the impact on U.S. culture of other classes of immigrants.

He's also considering legislation to eliminate the state program that lets Utah immigrants who are in the country illegally get driver privilege cards, which allow them to lawfully drive in the state. Another possibility, also in the works, would prohibit landlords and home sellers from renting or selling homes to those in the country illegally.

Other proposals from other lawmakers are in the works as well, including a measure put forward by Rep. Stephanie Gricius, R-Eagle Mountain, that would add a 2% tax to international remittances by immigrants in the country illegally. Rep. Cory Maloy, R-Lehi, is proposing a measure to beef up the rules meant to prevent immigrants from voting in elections. Rep. Matt MacPerson, R-West Valley City, proposes new rules targeting those who drive without a license, which includes immigrants, among others.

Last year was a big year for legislation focused on immigration and immigrants in the country illegally, and it appears the issue is returning for 2026. With the new session starting next Tuesday, Jan. 20, here's a look at some of the measures in the works:

HB88: The measure is modeled after a bill passed by Idaho lawmakers last year, HB135, which, as Lee puts it, ""takes all benefits from illegal immigrants.""

It would require proof of legal residency in the country to access testing at public health facilities for communicable diseases and immunizations. It would also require similar proof for those seeking help at food banks, crisis counseling and lodging at homeless shelters, presumably if the services are provided by state entities.

A critic of the measure, Ciriac Alvarez, senior policy analyst at Voices for Utah Children, said it's not crystal clear exactly how far-reaching HB88 would be. Her group advocates for Utah children, including immigrant children.

Alvarez worries that food banks and homeless shelters that receive state funds could fall under its umbrella and fears its impact on the estimated 100,000 immigrants in the country illegally in Utah and their 59,000 U.S.-born kids. She also wonders whether it would apply to other classes of immigrants, including asylum-seekers and immigrants in the country under the federal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

HB135, the Idaho measure used as a model for HB88, faces a legal challenge and, in the meantime, hasn't gone into effect, according to the National Immigration Law Center.

Lee hasn't yet put forward a specific proposal to end access to driving privilege cards. But he's a critic and says he's working on it.

Access to such identification helps immigrants in the country illegally stay and work here, undermining federal laws, Lee said. ""It straight-up rewards breaking the law and costs taxpayers. Utah's one of the only red states doing this — totally clashes with our values. Repeal time!"" he said in an email.

Alvarez said the program also benefits other classes of immigrants, including those with legal parole in the United States. If it's eliminated, she warns that some will still drive.

Lee's idea of a bill to prohibit renting or selling of homes to immigrants in the country illegally is modeled after a measure passed by lawmakers in Tennessee last year, SB392, he said. That measure also faces a legal challenge.

HB141: The measure would require proof of U.S. citizenship or legal residency to send money abroad. Lacking such identification, entities wiring the funds would be required to impose a 2% tax on the amount to be sent, money that would go into Utah's general fund.

The tax would potentially apply to the money that immigrants in the United States illegally send to family back in their home countries, known as international remittances. A provision in the bill allows those who have to pay the tax to get a credit for the amount when filing their income taxes.

Gricius, who didn't respond to a query seeking comment, pursued similar legislation last year, HB284, but it stalled as the session came to an end. Remittances by immigrants from Mexico and El Salvador, among other countries, are a significant source of income for family and other recipients in their home countries.

HB209: The bill calls for increased steps when people are registering to vote to make sure they are U.S. citizens, not immigrants, who aren't allowed to vote in U.S. elections, whether here legally or illegally.

""As for noncitizens voting, Utah law already makes it illegal. This bill is about tightening safeguards and public confidence, not responding to widespread fraud,"" said Maloy, sponsor of the measure. ""Even rare or inadvertent registrations undermine trust in elections.""

The measure requires presentation of proof of U.S. citizenship when applying to register to vote. Utah's REAL ID state-issued driver's licenses specify whether holders are U.S. citizens or immigrants and could be used to demonstrate citizenship. Voters without Utah REAL ID identity cards, which feature a gold star, ""will have to provide proof of citizenship to the county clerks,"" Maloy said.

The measure also contains a provision allowing for ""targeted review"" of registered voters suspected of not being U.S. citizens.

Utah Rep. Karianne Lisonbee, R-Syracuse, said earlier this year she was mulling such legislation. She cited at least two reports of noncitizens successfully registering to vote or actually voting in Utah. Maloy ended up as sponsor of the proposal.

HB136: The measure doesn't specifically single out immigrants but allows for seizure of cars operated by people without driver's licenses or driver privilege cards, which includes immigrants, among others.

MacPherson, the bill sponsor, noted 11 fatalities last year on Utah highways involving unlicensed drivers. Moreover, upward of 40% of ""vehicle interactions"" in West Valley City, where he lives, involve unlicensed drivers, he said. The pool of people without licenses includes kids, ""sovereign-citizen types"" and some immigrants, even though they are able to get driver privilege cards if not driver's licenses.

On encountering unlicensed drivers, police are ""stuck without tools to deal with it,"" MacPherson said. ""The best tool is to impound the vehicle. We already impound for DUI, reckless driving, expired registration and a host of other reasons. This gives this tool to law enforcement for this offense as well.""",https://img.ksl.com/slc/3140/314053/31405347.jpeg?filter=kslv2/responsive_story_lg,N,,2026-01-19 23:57:50.683576

""I was praying. I was like, God, please help me, I didn't do anything wrong. Why do they do this to me? Without my clothes on,"" Thao, a Hmong man born in Laos, told Reuters from his home on Monday, while neighbors were at work fixing the broken door.

Pictures of the incident showing Thao barely clothed and covered in a blanket taken by a Reuters photographer and bystanders spread on social media, further fueling concern that federal law enforcement officers were exceeding their authority as part of U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, which has seen some 3,000 officers deployed in the Minneapolis area.

A statement published by the family called the incident ""unnecessary, degrading, and deeply traumatizing."" The highest temperature in Saint Paul on Sunday was 14 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 10 degrees Celsius).

The Department of Homeland Security said officers were investigating two convicted sex offenders at the address and that a U.S. citizen living there refused to be fingerprinted or facially identified, so he was detained.

""He matched the description of the targets. As with any law enforcement agency, it is standard protocol to hold all individuals in a house of an operation for safety of the public and law enforcement,"" DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

'WHY ARE WE HERE'

DHS published wanted posters for two men targeted in the investigation who were still at large, describing each as a ""criminal illegal alien"" from Laos who is subject to deportation orders. One of the men in the wanted posters previously lived at the house but moved out, according to relatives close to the situation, who described him as the ex-husband of a member of the Thao family.

A U.S. District Judge in Minnesota on Friday issued an injunction blocking the Trump administration from some aggressive tactics that she said would ""chill"" an ordinary citizen from engaging in constitutionally protected protest.

""That conduct includes the drawing and pointing of weapons; the use of pepper spray and other non-lethal munitions; actual and threatened arrest and detainment of protesters and observers; and other intimidation tactics,"" Judge Katherine Menendez wrote.

The Trump administration is appealing her injunction.

Thao said his parents brought him from Laos to the United States in 1974 when he was four-years-old and that he became a U.S. citizen in 1991. During the ordeal, he feared being sent back to Laos, where he has no relatives.

He said he was singing karaoke when there was a loud noise at the door. He and his family hid in a bedroom, where the federal officers found him. Thao said that he was trying to find his ID as officers escorted him out of the house.

Thao was wearing only boxer shorts and Crocs on his feet when officers denied him the chance to put on more clothes, he said. He used a blanket that his four-year-old grandson had been sleeping with on the couch to cover his torso.

After taking his fingerprints and a head shot in the car, officers returned him to his home, Thao said.

""We came here for a purpose, right? ... To have a bright future. To have a safe place to live,"" he said. ""If this is going to turn out to be America, what are we doing here? Why are we here?""

NBC News has asked the Justice Department and the place of worship, Cities Church, for comment.
Dhillon said in her interview that the Justice Department is ""putting the facts together,"" adding that it was ""a very serious matter.""
""This is what the First Amendment is about, about the freedom to protest,” Lemon said in his YouTube channel video.","WASHINGTON — The Justice Department ""will pursue charges"" related to a protest in a church in St. Paul, Minnesota, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said Monday, specifically calling out ex-CNN journalist Don Lemon for his coverage of the event.

In an interview with conservative influencer Benny Johnson, Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, said journalism is not a ""shield"" from a ""criminal conspiracy.""

""Don Lemon himself has come out and said he knew exactly what was going to happen inside that facility,"" Dhillon said on “The Benny Show.” ""He went into the facility, and then he began — quote, unquote — 'committing journalism,' as if that’s sort of a shield from being a part, an embedded part, of a criminal conspiracy. It isn’t.""

Dhillon did not confirm whether the Justice Department would pursue charges against Lemon in particular. NBC News has asked the Justice Department and the place of worship, Cities Church, for comment.

Reached for a response to Dhillon's remarks, Lemon said in an email that ""it’s notable that I’ve been cast as the face of a protest I was covering as a journalist — especially since I wasn’t the only reporter there.""

""That framing is telling,"" he said. ""What’s even more telling is the barrage of violent threats, along with homophobic and racist slurs, directed at me online by MAGA supporters and amplified by parts of the right-wing press.""

Lemon said he stood by his reporting.

""If this much time and energy is going to be spent manufacturing outrage, it would be far better used investigating the tragic death of Renee Nicole Good — the very issue that brought people into the streets in the first place,"" he wrote, referring to the woman who was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer this month.

Dhillon said in her interview that the Justice Department is ""putting the facts together,"" adding that it was ""a very serious matter.""

""Come next Sunday, nobody should think in the United States that they're going to be able to get away with this,"" she said. ""Everyone in the protest community needs to know that the fullest force of the federal government is going to come down and prevent this from happening and put people away for a long, long time.""

In a video posted on his digital talk show’s YouTube channel, Lemon stands outside with protesters while he explains that he is at an “operation that is a secret.”

Speaking to Lemon, one of the protesters, Nekima Levy Armstrong, refers to the protest as “Operation Pull Up."" She says the protesters are “demanding justice for Renee Good and letting them know that this will not stand.”

In a later clip of the protest inside the church, Lemon says, “We’re not part of the activists, but we’re here just reporting on them.”

Lemon reported that activists had gone to the church because, they alleged, one of its officials worked at the local ICE field office. NBC News has not verified a connection.

Dhillon said Sunday afternoon on X that the Justice Department was ""investigating the potential violations of the federal FACE Act by these people desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshippers,"" referring to the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act.

The law, enacted in 1994, prohibits interfering with or obstructing people from seeking reproductive health services or exercising religious freedom at places of worship.

In her interview with Johnson, Dhillon also mentioned the possibility of invoking the Enforcement Act of 1871, also known as the Ku Klux Klan Act, which was passed during Reconstruction to protect Black Americans' civil rights.

""Whenever anyone conspires to violate the protected civil rights of American citizens, the Klan Act can be used to bring a conspiracy charge,"" she said.

Protesters can face restrictions on private property without the consent of the property owner.

A livestream posted on the Black Lives Matter Minnesota Facebook page showed protesters at the church Sunday chanting “ICE out” and “Renee Good.”

During the protest, Lemon reported from inside the church, interviewing a pastor who asked him to leave the building unless he was there to worship.

""This is what the First Amendment is about, about the freedom to protest,” Lemon said in his YouTube channel video.

Tensions and anti-ICE protests have grown in the aftermath of Good's killing in Minneapolis on Jan. 7. The administration has sided with Jonathan Ross, the ICE officer who shot her, arguing that he acted in self-defense. Protesters and Minnesota officials have slammed ICE, calling on the administration to remove its personnel.

President Donald Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act in response to the protests, which Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said would be ""a shocking step.""

""In Minneapolis, we’re not going to be intimidated,"" Frey said in an interview with NBC News' ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday. ""We’re not backing down.""","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260119-Don-Lemon-Harmeet-Dhillon-rs-79c13a.jpg",N,,2026-01-19 23:58:05.151035

At a press conference at Hope CommUnity Center in Apopka, Executive Director Felipe Sousa-Lazaballet and Central Florida Congressman Maxwell Frost joined others condemning the potential U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility at a warehouse in east Orlando.

“The people of Orange County, of Orlando and of Florida’s 10th congressional district do not want, and we reject, an ICE detention facility,” Frost said.

While there already is an ICE Field Office in Orlando, a new processing facility could further ramp up immigration detention efforts. The facility may be part of a national plan, first reported last month by The Washington Post, to detain immigrants in warehouses across the country.

“Let’s be clear about what’s going on across the nation,” Frost said. “They’re shopping around warehouses. This is one of many they’re looking at opening.”

As of Monday morning, roughly 183 people were detained in the Orange County Jail on an ICE hold without any local charges, but that number is likely higher when those held on minor criminal violations like traffic stops are accounted for, Rep. Anna Eskamani said.

“It’s very high,” Eskamani said of the number of people arrested. “When I visited the jail a few months ago it was at most 40 people under just ICE holds, so that’s substantially more.”

The surge in local arrests comes amid the possible deployment of U.S. troops to Minneapolis to quell immigration protests there after an ICE agent shot and killed a woman in a vehicle. Those at Monday’s news conference warned that Orlando could be the Trump administration’s next target in its immigration crackdown.

“We are seeing exactly what we have seen across the country,” Sousa-Lazaballet said. “We have heard from U.S. citizens that have been followed for several miles on the highway.”

Sousa-Lazaballet said ICE operations have increased locally and his organization is receiving roughly 60 calls per day, up from five, from family members of those arrested.

On Friday, Hope CommUnity Center said in a statement it confirmed about 300 people had been booked into the Orange County Jail on immigration holds in the previous 48 hours. A spokesperson for the jail told the Sentinel that a total of 831 people had been booked on such holds since Jan. 1. County Commissioner Nicole Wilson said that number was a shocking total because about 300 people had been booked in December.

WKMG and WFTV reported that ICE representatives toured a 439,000-square-foot east Orlando warehouse on Friday. It is zoned for industrial use and may require a zoning change if it’s pursued as an immigration facility. The Orlando City Council may have to approve such a change, though it’s unclear if the federal government can work around city rules.

Wilson said Monday she has already submitted a memo with potential draft language on how to block ICE from using the facility as a detention center under its zoning.

“This is a logistical issue as much as it’s a humanitarian issue,” Wilson said. “If local government based on the Florida constitution is where we look at that permitting, we look at that use and the underlying land use, and we scrutinize this.”

State Rep. LaVon Bracy Davis called everyone to peacefully protest ICE and said Martin Luther King Jr. Day is a day to remember what he stood for.

“If you are safe, you should be standing with those who are not,” Bracy Davis said. “Dr. King reminded us that the arc of the moral universe bends towards justice, but it bends faster when the dissatisfied pick it up, put it to work.”",https://www.orlandosentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/TOS-L-ICE-presser-01.jpg?w=1024&h=768,N,,2026-01-19 19:57:53.337006

Victor Manuel Diaz dies in ICE custody

The backstory:

ICE says contract security staff found Victor Manuel Diaz unconscious in his room at Camp East Montana. Medical staff on site were immediately notified and began life-saving measures. El Paso EMS was called at 3:35 p.m. and arrived 10 minutes later to continue efforts. Diaz was pronounced dead at 4:09 p.m. on Jan. 14.

Diaz had been in ICE custody since Jan. 6 after being arrested in Minneapolis for an immigration violation. He had entered the United States illegally on March 26, 2024, and was ordered removed in absentia by an immigration judge in August if 2025.

Cause of death under investigation

What we know:

ICE says Diaz's death is presumed to be a suicide, though the official cause is still being investigated.

ICE has protocols in place to report in-custody deaths, which include notifying Congress, stakeholders and the media. Reports are also made available on ICE's public website within 90 days. Federal officials released the following statement:

""ICE emphasizes that all detainees receive comprehensive medical care, including screenings and access to emergency services. They assert that no detained individual is denied emergency care during their stay.""

What they're saying:

U.S. Senator Tina Smith and Jason Chavez of the Minneapolis City Council issued statements on the man's death via social media.

""Hearing reports that a man taken by ICE in Minneapolis died in federal custody. This is another senseless tragedy, ICE has an obligation to keep detainees safe,"" Smith said on X. ""We need a complete and impartial investigation of what is happening in these detention centers.""

Victor Manuel Diaz, 36, originally from Nicaragua, was found “unconscious and unresponsive in his room” on 14 January at the Camp East Montana detention facility in El Paso, ICE said in a press release.

“They immediately notified contract medical staff on site to conduct life saving measures,” it said, adding that emergency medical technicians arrived to the facility but could not revive Diaz, who was pronounced dead just after 4pm. ICE asserted that Diaz “died of a presumed suicide” but that the “official cause of his death remains under investigation”.

Diaz was detained on 6 January during the Trump administration’s controversial deportation blitz in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He initially entered the US through the Mexican border in March of 2024, when border patrol agents picked him up and he was given a court date with an immigration judge, then released on parole. On 26 August of last year an immigration judge ordered Diaz’s removal “in absentia”. ICE detained him on 12 January in order to deport him.

The extensive tent facility is located on the Fort Bliss military base in El Paso.

Thirty-two people died in ICE custody last year, the highest number of fatalities in two decades. At least five people have reportedly died in ICE custody this year.

Another man, Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, who immigrated to the US from Cuba, died in the same detention camp on 3 January. ICE said Campos was “experiencing medical distress” and that staff provided emergency treatment in the hopes of saving him.

His death is potentially being investigated as a homicide. The local medical examiner determined the preliminary cause of death was “asphyxia due to neck and chest compression”, according to reports. ICE said he experienced a medical emergency after being “disruptive while in line for medication”.

Santos Jesus Flores, who was detained with him, told the Washington Post that he saw five guards choking him, and that he heard Lunas Campos repeatedly say in Spanish that he couldn’t breathe.

“He said, ‘I cannot breathe, I cannot breathe.’ After that, we don’t hear his voice anymore and that’s it,” the publication quoted Flores as saying.

After reports that Lunas Campos’ death might be investigated as a potential homicide, the Department of Homeland Security said in an email to the Guardian that he had tried to kill himself and “violently resisted” officers who were trying to help him.

Tricia McLaughlin, a DHS spokesperson, also told the Washington Post after it published its article that Lunas Campos was trying to take his own life. The allegation was not part of ICE’s initial statement.

Another Camp East Montana inmate, Francisco Gaspar-Andres, died at a nearby hospital on 3 December. He was 48.

That case claims that the surge of immigration agents is unconstitutional, and asks for an order blocking the operation from continuing.","Lawyers for the Trump administration said on Monday that they were appealing a judge’s injunction that imposed limits on immigration agents’ interactions with protesters in Minnesota.

In a short notice filed on Monday with the judge who issued the preliminary injunction last week, Justice Department lawyers said they would challenge those limits at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The lawsuit that led to the injunction claimed that federal law enforcement officers had repeatedly violated the rights of protesters who observed or recorded immigration enforcement actions or voiced opposition to those actions.

In her injunction, handed down on Friday, Judge Kate M. Menendez of the U.S. District Court in Minnesota ordered agents not to retaliate against people “engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest activity,” and not to use pepper spray or other “crowd dispersal tools” in retaliation for protected speech. The judge also said agents could not stop or detain protesters in vehicles who were not “forcibly obstructing or interfering with” agents.

Judge Menendez, who was nominated to the bench by President Joseph R. Biden Jr., did not give the plaintiffs everything they had sought in the injunction. She did not include specific protection for the recording of agents, nor did she impose rules about how agents issue dispersal orders.

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the appeal. Though a notice of appeal was filed with the district court, the full text of the appeal was not immediately available from the Eighth Circuit.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said on Friday in a statement responding to Judge Menendez’s injunction that “D.H.S. is taking appropriate and constitutional measures to uphold the rule of law and protect our officers and the public from dangerous rioters.”

She added that despite “grave threats,” agents had “followed their training and used the minimum amount of force necessary to protect themselves, the public and federal property.”

A spokeswoman for the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota, which backed the lawsuit, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the appeal.

The lawsuit described a “federal campaign to besiege cities across the United States in an unprecedented attack on civil liberties,” and described the case as an effort “to ensure that Minnesotans can assemble, observe, document, and criticize defendants’ activities, safely and unburdened by the fear of retaliation.”

The suit is one of several filed in recent weeks related to the surge of some 3,000 federal agents to Minnesota. The enforcement campaign has led to at least 2,400 arrests, as well as repeated clashes with protesters and two shootings, including the fatal shooting of Renee Good, a U.S. citizen who was killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis on Jan. 7. In another incident in Minneapolis last week, a federal agent shot and injured a man who officials said was in the country illegally and had assaulted an agent with a shovel or broom.

Judge Menendez is weighing a separate lawsuit filed by the state and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. That case claims that the surge of immigration agents is unconstitutional, and asks for an order blocking the operation from continuing. The state asked Judge Menendez to issue an immediate ruling in that case, but she declined last week to do so.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/19/multimedia/19nat-minnesota-appeal-1-fwqv/19nat-minnesota-appeal-1-fwqv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 16:57:55.073250

Mr. Trump had repeatedly vented his frustration with the Fed’s approach to monetary policy and Mr. Powell, whom Mr. Trump promoted to chair during his first term.
Mr. Powell, a registered Republican, was initially tapped to join the Fed as a governor by President Barack Obama.
The Trump administration is not challenging the constitutionality of the law requiring the president to have cause to fire Ms. Cook.
In contrast, the court said Ms. Cook may remain an active member of the board while her case is considered.","The Supreme Court’s review this week of President Trump’s attempt to fire a member of the Federal Reserve was always going to pose a key test of how much leeway the justices would give the president to remake and control the central bank.

Then the Justice Department issued subpoenas this month as part of a criminal investigation into the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell.

Legal experts said that development threatened to complicate the Trump administration’s case, making a potentially difficult-to-win case even more challenging.

Mr. Trump’s solicitor general will argue to the court on Wednesday that the president had a valid reason to fire Lisa Cook, who has been a Fed governor since 2022, because she allegedly engaged in mortgage fraud. She sued after Mr. Trump tried to oust her in August, arguing that the law that established the Fed allowed presidents to dismiss members only “for cause.”

Ms. Cook, who has not been charged with wrongdoing, denies the allegations, which relate to loan documents she signed before joining the Fed.

Analysts say the Powell subpoenas could bolster the sense that the Trump administration ginned up a pretext to oust Ms. Cook as a way to force the central bank to lower borrowing costs.

The move against Mr. Powell “undermines the administration’s contention that this is all about Lisa Cook’s conduct and not about her votes on monetary policy,” said Lev Menand, a Columbia University law professor who is closely tracking the case.

“It all tends to suggest that the goal here is to take over the Fed,” he said.

Mr. Powell will attend Wednesday’s arguments, along with Ms. Cook, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Central bank governors serve staggered 14-year terms “unless sooner removed for cause by the president,” according to federal law. Congress put those protections in place in 1913 and renewed them in 1935 to ensure the independence of the institution and allow officials to set monetary policy without political interference from the president.

The Justice Department is investigating whether Mr. Powell misled Congress when questioned in June about extensive renovations of the Fed’s headquarters in Washington that are running hundreds of millions of dollars over budget.

Mr. Powell has aggressively pushed back, saying the investigation is a “consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president.”

That is the same argument Ms. Cook’s lawyers will make during Wednesday’s argument. In filings, they have said the mortgage fraud allegation is “paper-thin, unproven” and a “manufactured” pretext for policy disagreements.

Mr. Trump had repeatedly vented his frustration with the Fed’s approach to monetary policy and Mr. Powell, whom Mr. Trump promoted to chair during his first term. Mr. Powell, a registered Republican, was initially tapped to join the Fed as a governor by President Barack Obama.

Despite his complaints about Mr. Powell, the president moved to fire Ms. Cook, a nominee of President Joseph R. Biden Jr., citing the allegations that she falsified bank documents to acquire more favorable loan terms.

Former top Fed and Treasury officials and Ms. Cook’s legal team have warned the Supreme Court that permitting Mr. Trump to fire her while her litigation is underway would spur economic turmoil and undermine public confidence in the central bank.

The Justice Department argues that Mr. Trump has cited a “cause” to fire Ms. Cook, and that the court cannot second-guess the specific reason the president has identified.

How much discretion presidents have to remove Fed officials, what counts as cause, and whether officials are entitled to notice and process before being ousted will be key questions for the justices at Wednesday’s argument.

The Trump administration is not challenging the constitutionality of the law requiring the president to have cause to fire Ms. Cook. That distinguishes the case from one the Supreme Court heard in December, in which the administration argued that laws requiring the president to identify a rationale before firing other independent regulators infringed on the president’s constitutional authority.

The Supreme Court has been overwhelmingly receptive to Mr. Trump’s efforts to remove regulators from other independent agencies. But the justices have repeatedly signaled that they view the Fed differently.

In cases involving the National Labor Relations Board, the Federal Trade Commission and the Merit Systems Protection Board, the justices allowed Mr. Trump to fire officials while their litigation was underway, despite congressionally imposed limits on the president’s removal power.

In contrast, the court said Ms. Cook may remain an active member of the board while her case is considered. The justices also went out of their way to suggest that the Fed may stand apart from other agencies, writing in an order in May that it is a “uniquely structured, quasi-private entity” with a distinct history.

The newly revealed subpoenas and investigation into Mr. Powell are not officially part of the record before the Supreme Court in Ms. Cook’s case, but experts said atmospherics can matter.

In April 2004, photographs showing U.S. soldiers abusing Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib were published the same day the court heard a challenge to the Bush administration’s detention of “enemy combatants” at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. The court ultimately ruled against the administration, saying those deemed enemy combatants must be able to challenge their detention before a judge or other “neutral decision maker.”

“That’s not what you want the justices reading about the morning of your argument,” Jonathan Adler, a law professor at William and Mary, said of the government’s lawyers in that case. “You want to be right on the law, but it certainly helps to have atmospherics on your side.”

Those atmospherics could play a role as the justices decide how much flexibility Mr. Trump has to get rid of Ms. Cook before her term expires.

Jennifer Nou, a University of Chicago law professor, said the court ordinarily gave broad discretion to such executive branch judgments. But she pointed to a case during Mr. Trump’s first term that showed that the justices would sometimes reject what they viewed as a made-up rationale by the president or his top advisers.

In 2019, the court rejected the administration’s justification for adding a question about citizenship status to the census. The court said the commerce secretary had not been upfront when he told Congress he acted “solely” in response to a Justice Department request. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote that the explanation “appears to have been contrived” and that the secretary “was determined” to add the question.

I am writing to express my concern over the recent resolution to discuss the possibility of the County Sheriff’s department cooperating with ICE by way of a 287(g) agreement. We are seeing a lot of opposition to ICE’s presence in our country. If ICE were pursuing and arresting immigrants with violent criminal records or proven gang affiliation, as was promised by the President, I don’t believe there would be such widespread opposition.

The fact that there is a quota set, and that people who have lived and worked here for years are being targeted, is the reason that citizens are forming groups to watch and even interfere with ICE agents performing their duties.

There is room for a debate over whether we should be deporting people who have no criminal record, but also no legal status. I think almost everyone agrees that our immigration system is badly in need of repair. However, my objection to ICE has much more to do with their tactics. They are masked and without visible ID in many if not all cases—as far as I know that is unacceptable for any law enforcement officer.

I assume that our county deputies will not be masked and will continue to have visible ID, but I’m trying to make a point here about the public sentiment ICE has generated. Their agents are being sent into selected cities in great numbers, outfitted with military gear and weaponry, and are generating an atmosphere, not of safety, but of fear. Incidents like the tragic death in Minneapolis and in other places are bound to happen, as citizens resist these tactics. They are provoking, not protecting.

There is currently a case pending in a state appellate court in Nassau County where the plaintiff is arguing that NY law prevents the police from arresting or detaining people for civil violations of federal immigration law. This is exactly the agreement that is being considered, the 287(g) agreement. My feeling is that the legislature should at the very least wait until this case is decided by the courts. Why put our county in jeopardy of lawsuits unnecessarily, or create the kind of division and anger we see elsewhere in our country?

I think most folks in St Lawrence County appreciate and respect the Sheriff’s department and think of its deputies as neighbors. This kind of cooperation with ICE will only be detrimental to that feeling.

Last week, the Supreme Court agreed to hear SEC vs. Sripetch, et al., a Ninth Circuit decision affirming a disgorgement award despite the SEC’s failure to demonstrate defrauded investors suffered pecuniary harm.1

The Supreme Court limited the SEC’s ability to claim disgorgement in the 2020 decision in Liu v. SEC, finding that disgorgement can be equitable relief if it is confined to the wrongdoer’s illicit net profits and is returned to victims.2 Following Liu, Courts split on pecuniary harm was needed to support a disgorgement award.3 For example, in SEC v. Govil, the Second Circuit concluded a showing of pecuniary harm was required given disgorgement’s equitable limitation that it be “awarded for victims.”4 In reaching the exact opposite conclusion, the First Circuit in SEC v. Navellier & Associates, Inc. held that disgorgement does not require a showing of pecuniary harm so long as disgorgement was “tethered to a wrongdoer’s net unlawful profits.”5 If that threshold is met, courts need not be concerned with a victim’s harm.6

The Court’s resolution in this matter will have wide implications for SEC enforcement, specifically the monetary penalties the SEC may seek both in negotiations and in litigation. If the Court finds pecuniary harm is required, it will further restrict the SEC’s powers.

According to the filings, the officer is believed to be Brian Palacios.

The documents were submitted by the ex-husband of Palacios' current partner as part of an ongoing custody dispute.

Palacios and his partner live in the same apartment complex where 43-year-old Keith Porter was shot and killed.

READ ALSO: Community demands accountability at vigil for father of 2 killed by off-duty ICE agent in Northridge

The filings also state that Palacios was known to have firearms inside the home.

Stacie Halpern, an attorney representing Palacios, told Eyewitness News that the allegations made against her client were investigated by law enforcement and the Department of Children and Family Services and said ""they were unable to find anything that corroborated the allegations and deemed them unfounded.""

She said Palacios acted in self-defense the night Porter was killed and said he was protecting the neighborhood.

The Department of Homeland Security has also not confirmed whether Palacios was involved in the shooting.

Porter was fatally shot the night of Dec. 31 in the 17700 block of Roscoe Boulevard.

According to a statement from DHS, the ICE agent said he heard gunshots outside of his apartment.

""The suspected gunfire grew progressively louder, indicating to the officer that whoever was firing a gun was approaching his apartment,"" read a statement released by Tricia McLaughlin, the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at DHS. ""The officer took his ICE authorized firearm and left his apartment to investigate. He moved to the ground level and went outside, where he believed the suspected gunfire was coming from.""

DHS said the agent encountered Porter holding what appeared to be a long rifle and ordered him to put it down.

""The ICE officer identified himself as law enforcement,"" read the DHS statement. ""In response, the individual pointed his weapon at the ICE officer. The officer ordered the subject to put the weapon down. When the subject refused to comply, the officer fired defensively with his service weapon at the subject to disarm him. The subject fired at least three rounds at the officer.""

Porter's family, however, disputes that account, saying his gunfire was part of a New Year's celebration.

Video showed protesters inside the church chanting ""ICE out"" and ""Justice for Renee Good"", the woman killed by an ICE agent in Minneapolis earlier this month.

Justice department officials accuse the protesters of ""desecrating a house of worship"", and say they will investigate them for civil rights violations.

Anti-ICE protests continue in the state against President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, and the Pentagon reportedly placed 1,500 soldiers on standby for possible deployment.

On Sunday, US Attorney General Pam Bondi vowed to exercise the ""full force of federal law"" against the demonstrators who interrupted the service at the Cities Church in St Paul, which neighbors Minneapolis.

Later on Monday, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said on X that the justice department ""will pursue federal charges in this case"".

Protesters say that one of the church's eight pastors, David Easterwood, is a local ICE official.

Easterwood was not leading the service on Sunday.

A person by the same name is identified in ACLU court filings as the acting director of the ICE St Paul field office, according to reporting by the Associated Press and the Minnesota Star Tribune newspaper.

The AP also reported he appeared alongside Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem in Minneapolis at a news conference last October.

The BBC has contacted the church for comment.

In a statement, DHS said it does not confirm or deny the identities of its agents as ""publicizing their identities puts their lives and the lives of their families at serious risk"".

Monique Cullars-Doty, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter Minnesota and one of the protest organisers, told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that ""we can't sit back idly and watch people go and be led astray"".

Elsewhere in the city, protests with occasional clashes have persisted at the Whipple building in Minneapolis where federal agents are headquartered.

A DHS spokesperson said on Monday that at least 3,000 people have been arrested in Minneapolis since the deployments.

On Friday, a US federal judge issued an order limiting the crowd control tactics that can be used by ICE agents toward peaceful protesters in Minneapolis.

Thousands of ICE agents are in Minnesota as part of a surge by the Trump administration after his election pledge for the biggest deportation operation of undocumented migrants in history.

On Sunday, CBS News reported that 1,500 active-duty soldiers have been placed on standby for possible deployment to Minneapolis, after President Trump said he may invoke the Insurrection Act to respond to protests.

The 19th-Century law allows the president to use active-duty military personnel to perform law-enforcement duties inside the US.

Dozens of people rushed into Cities Church in St. Paul Sunday morning, interrupting the church service and leading to tense confrontations, videos posted by activists and content creators show.

“ICE out!” protesters shouted as they were confronted by the lead pastor and congregants.

The demonstrators said they were there to protest David Easterwood, who is listed as a pastor at the church and appears to be the same David Easterwood who is a top ICE official in the Twin Cities. He was recently named as a defendant in a case brought by protesters who allege immigration agents had violated their First and Fourth Amendment rights.

“David Easterwood, out now!” protesters yelled at one point.

None of the videos show Easterwood in the church, and it’s unclear if he was in the building on Sunday. In response to CNN’s inquiry about his connection to ICE, a DHS spokesperson responded, “DHS will never confirm or deny attempts to dox our law enforcement officers.”

Federal investigation promised

Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon announced an investigation within hours, calling the protesters’ actions “desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshippers.”

Dhillon cited the FACE Act, a federal law that “prohibits the use or threat of force and physical obstruction that injures, intimidates, or interferes with a person seeking to … exercise the First Amendment right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship.”

A surge in immigration enforcement around Minneapolis, known as Operation Metro Surge, brought thousands of additional federal agents to the area and prompted widespread protests, especially after a Border Patrol agent fatally shot Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, on January 7.

The swift promise to investigate the demonstration stood in contrast to the administration’s response to Good’s death, as the Department of Justice quickly quashed an inquiry and refused to cooperate with local law enforcement agencies on their own investigation.

Nekima Levy Armstrong, a former president of the local NAACP chapter, told The Associated Press she considered the threat of an official investigation a sham.

“If people are more concerned about someone coming to a church on a Sunday and disrupting business as usual than they are about the atrocities that we are experiencing in our community, then they need to check their theology and they need to check their hearts,” she said.

Cities Church has not responded to CNN’s requests for comment. A St. Paul police vehicle was briefly seen parked outside the building Monday morning, and no one answered when a CNN crew rang the doorbell.

Who is David Easterwood?

The man targeted by protesters Sunday is the acting field office director in St. Paul for Enforcement and Removal Operations at ICE. In a declaration filed in this month’s lawsuit by protesters, Easterwood said he has worked for ICE since 2015.

Easterwood argued in his statement any order from the court would “further endanger the safety of law enforcement personnel and the public.”

Judge Katherine Menendez found ICE agents had been overzealous in pulling over some demonstrators who were following agents in vehicles.

“The Court has carefully considered and weighed Director Easterwood’s account of how vehicles have been used by observers to protest ICE activity in the Twin Cities,” Menendez wrote. “But, even crediting his statements about incidents of misconduct among other people following Operation Metro Surge, it simply does not establish reasonable, articulable suspicion to stop as to these particular plaintiffs.”

Despite Easterwood’s testimony, Menendez issued a largely symbolic injunction ordering agents not to detain people “who are engaging in unobtrusive protest activity, including observing the activities of Operation Metro Surge.”

Just days after taking his current position, Easterwood appeared alongside Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in a news conference on immigration enforcement in the Twin Cities.

“Our officers demonstrate every day what it means to serve with honor and dedication,” Easterwood said in October.

Easterwood does not have a listed phone number, and requests for comment sent to his office were not immediately answered.

“Agitators aren’t just targeting our officers. Now they’re targeting churches, too,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN. She also blamed Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey “for whipping these mobs into a frenzy and then allowing them to run rampant.”

With emotions running high and confrontational tactics escalating on both sides, Sunday’s protest highlights the growing tension between protecting free expression and silencing opposing voices.

“The question that we’re coming to is how law enforcement is going to protect the rights of protesters to engage in their First Amendment-protected activity, and at the same time not be intimidating other people for whatever rights they are engaged in,” CNN legal analyst Carrie Cordero said.

""If people are more concerned about someone coming to a church on a Sunday and disrupting business as usual than they are about the atrocities that we are experiencing in our community, then they need to check their theology and the need to check their hearts.""

The website of St. Paul-based Cities Church lists David Easterwood as a pastor, and his personal information appears to match that of the David Easterwood identified in court filings as the acting director of the ICE St. Paul field office. Easterwood appeared alongside DHS Secretary Kristi Noem at a Minneapolis press conference last October.

Cities Church did not respond to a phone call or emailed request for comment Sunday evening, and Easterwood's personal contact information could not immediately be located.

Easterwood did not lead the part of the service that was livestreamed, and it was unclear if he was present at the church Sunday.

In a Jan. 5 court filing, Easterwood defended ICE's tactics in Minnesota such as swapping license plates and spraying protesters with chemical irritants. He wrote that federal agents were experiencing increased threats and aggression and crowd control devices like flash-bang grenades were important to protect against violent attacks. He testified that he was unaware of agents ""knowingly targeting or retaliating against peaceful protesters or legal observers with less lethal munitions and/or crowd control devices.""

""Agitators aren't just targeting our officers. Now they're targeting churches, too,"" the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency stated. ""They're going from hotel to hotel, church to church, hunting for federal law enforcement who are risking their lives to protect Americans.""

Black Lives Matter Minnesota co-founder Monique Cullars-Doty said that the DOJ's prosecution was misguided.

""If you got a head — a leader in a church — that is leading and orchestrating ICE raids, my God, what has the world come to?"" Cullars-Doty said. ""We can't sit back idly and watch people go and be led astray.""

Can This Lawyer Change That?,"Michael Steinberger, www.nytimes.com, michael-steinberger",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/19/magazine/genocide-trial-human-right-international-law.html,"“It’s too early to write off the rules-based system, too early to write off the United States,” he says.
At the time, international law was an extremely circumscribed niche, mainly involving border disputes and other technical matters.
Even so, he continued to regard the United States as generally a force for good in the world.
“We are beginning to have to imagine doing the work we do without having the United States as a backstop,” he says.
He believed it was essential to try to steer humanity away from tribalism and hoped that international law could serve that purpose.","Despite the carnage in Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan, and even in the face of the Trump administration’s apparent determination to dismantle what remains of the liberal international order, the human rights attorney Philippe Sands insists he is not giving in to despair. “It’s too early to write off the rules-based system, too early to write off the United States,” he says. “It’s a long game.” Coming from Sands, who has devoted most of his career to trying to contain the darkest human impulses, the cautious pessimism is almost encouraging. He concedes, however, that it does feel as if the lessons of the 20th century are being cast aside and that the same sinister spirits that led to Auschwitz, Rwanda and Srebrenica are enjoying a revival. “There is definitely something in the air.”

Sands, who is 65, is among the pre-eminent figures in his field and has taken part in a number of landmark cases. He was a lawyer for Croatia in the genocide claim that it brought against Serbia, helped lay the groundwork for the prosecution of the former Liberian president Charles Taylor and was a member of the legal team that sought to hold the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet accountable for torturing and murdering political opponents. More recently, he was the lead outside counsel in the successful campaign to get Britain to return the Chagos Islands to Mauritius and argued for Palestinian self-determination in a case before the International Court of Justice. He also played a key role in the establishment of a tribunal to investigate Russia for crimes of aggression against Ukraine. Over the last three decades, few people have done more to shape the direction of international criminal law than Sands.

His latest book, “38 Londres Street,” was recently released in the United States. It recounts the indictment of Pinochet in 1998, his arrest in London and the ultimately unsuccessful quest to make him stand trial. The book, which takes its name from the building in Santiago that housed one of Pinochet’s clandestine torture centers, is also about the relationship between Pinochet and Walter Rauff, a senior SS officer — he developed the mobile gas chambers that the Nazis used to murder around 100,000 people — who fled to Chilean Patagonia after World War II.

The book is well timed. Scenes in the United States of masked law enforcement officers grabbing people off the street have evoked comparisons to Pinochet’s Chile and to Argentina’s Dirty War. Sands, whose wife, Natalia Schiffrin, is American (his brother-in-law is the Nobel-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz), says there is “at least the embryo of a parallel.” What especially troubles him is the Supreme Court’s 2024 decision granting presidents almost blanket immunity. As Sands asks: “If a president commits crimes against humanity, tortures or disappears people, is he going to be subject to examination by the courts? The answer appears to be no.” Sands fears that the Supreme Court, 80 years after the Nuremberg trials established that political and military leaders could be held accountable for atrocities against their own citizens, has ushered in what he calls a “new age of impunity.”

On the international front, certainly, the Trump administration feels unconstrained by existing laws and norms, a point demonstrated by the U.S. military incursion into Venezuela and acknowledged with disarming candor by the president himself in a subsequent interview with The Times. “I don’t need international law,” Trump said. Amid all this upheaval, Sands is currently arguing another major case before the I.C.J.: He is representing Gambia in the genocide claim that it filed against Myanmar over its treatment of the Rohingya people. The trial opened last week in The Hague and is scheduled to run through the end of the month. If Sands and his colleagues prevail, it will mark the first time that a state has been held responsible for genocide. The I.C.J. has no direct means of enforcing its judgments, however, and in the context of the current moment, the courtroom proceedings might seem like a forlorn attempt to add scaffolding to a collapsing edifice.

Last January, Sands delivered a Holocaust Remembrance Day lecture at the University of Cambridge, his alma mater. Although his work often immerses him in stories of appalling cruelty, he is by nature very cheerful, and he exuded warmth and affability as he reflected on his Cambridge education and talked about his career. He counseled the students against cynicism. He noted that international human rights law was still in its nascency and said he remained optimistic that its core values would ultimately triumph. “I firmly believe that the arc of history will follow the arc of justice,” he said.

But he acknowledged that history seemed to be taking an unfortunate detour. Donald Trump was back in the White House, and Elon Musk had given what many observers interpreted to be a Nazi salute at an inauguration event and had also told a far-right rally in Germany that it was time to move beyond the country’s past, and Sands conceded that it was hard not to feel a sense of foreboding. “This could end very badly,” he said.

He grew up in the shadow of bleak times. His mother, Ruth, is a Holocaust survivor; as a toddler, she was spirited out of Vienna by a Christian missionary named Elsie Tilney and spent several years in France in the care of a series of Catholic families who hid her Jewish identity. Sands was raised in London (he holds British and French citizenship). His father, Allan, was a dentist; Ruth owned a children’s secondhand bookstore. He has a younger brother, Marc, who recently retired as an executive at an art auction house.

Sands entered Cambridge in 1979 intent on studying economics. But he quickly soured on supply-and-demand curves and switched to law. He found that pretty stultifying too, except for the class he took on international law. Although the professor was, in Sands’s words, “a very dry Yorkshireman,” he was enthralled by the subject matter. He says that it was “about all these things that were not talked about at home but were very, very present.”

Upon graduating, he spent a year as a visiting scholar at Harvard Law School. In 1984, he returned to Cambridge to work as a fellow at the university’s Research Center for International Law, which was under the direction of Elihu Lauterpacht, Hersch Lauterpacht’s son, with whom he formed a close bond. At the time, international law was an extremely circumscribed niche, mainly involving border disputes and other technical matters. After the breakthroughs at Nuremberg, international criminal law had become largely moribund owing to the exigencies of the Cold War.

By contrast, international environmental law was an emerging subfield full of promise, and Sands became one of its pioneering figures. His foray into environmental law began with a paper that he wrote on transboundary pollution after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986. He helped start the Alliance of Small Island States, which has been at the forefront of the battle against climate change, seeking to ensure that the interests of island nations, which are particularly threatened, are represented in negotiations over emissions reductions and other measures. In 1995, he helped write what remains a widely used textbook on international environmental law. Sands is now active in the movement to have ecocide — loosely defined as illegal or wanton acts committed in the knowledge that they are very likely to cause severe environmental damage — recognized as an international crime.

The collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War created an opening to finally build on the legacy of Nuremberg, and the Balkan wars and the Rwandan genocide gave added impetus to that work. Pinochet’s arrest in 1998 in London appeared to mark a turning point in the fight for accountability: He was the first former head of state ever detained on foreign soil under the principle of “universal jurisdiction” — the idea that some crimes are so egregious that every nation has a right and a duty to seek to punish those responsible for them.

The British government released Pinochet in 2000, however, citing health concerns, and Sands says that after Sept. 11, the effort to make international criminal law more comprehensive and binding became significantly harder. According to Sands, “38 Londres Street” is in part an “elegy” for the time in the 1990s when the global human rights system seemed to take another step forward.

Still, even as progress slowed, Sands gained recognition for his deep knowledge of the law and for his litigating skills, and his expertise was sought not only by victims of human rights abuses but also by a few notorious oppressors. After Saddam Hussein was deposed and captured in 2003 by U.S.-led coalition forces, intermediaries reached out to see if Sands might be willing to provide legal advice to the Iraqi dictator if he was brought before an international tribunal (Sands wasn’t, and Hussein was convicted and sentenced to death by a special tribunal of Iraqi judges).

A few years later, at the request of the Syrian government, Sands traveled to Damascus to discuss with President Bashar al-Assad the legal jeopardy that he might face as a result of the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri of Lebanon. There was speculation that the Syrian government played a part in his killing, and al-Assad wished to know if he, as a head of state, could claim immunity from potential prosecution. Sands told him he could not. He says that he was offering “an independent opinion” to al-Assad and was never asked to represent him. He adds that upholding international law occasionally requires speaking to the bad guys too.

To Sands, the treatment of prisoners at Guantánamo and Abu Ghraib was a shocking betrayal of the values that the United States claimed to represent, and President Obama’s failure to hold those officials accountable remains a source of disappointment to him. Even so, he continued to regard the United States as generally a force for good in the world. The postwar global order was principally an American creation, and this extended to the advancement of human rights. “The United States was the architect, very largely, of the rules that I have been involved with my whole life,” Sands says. “We saw it as the mansion on the hill, the guardian of the idea of the international rule of law.” But a year into Trump’s second presidency, that no longer seems to be the case. “We are beginning to have to imagine doing the work we do without having the United States as a backstop,” he says.

In 2010, Sands was invited to give a lecture at the Ivan Franko National University of Lviv. He had never been to Lviv, a city in western Ukraine, close to the Polish border, but it was where his maternal grandfather, Leon Buchholz, was born and raised. Buchholz, who eventually settled in Paris, rarely spoke of Lviv or of the family that he lost in the Holocaust, a conspicuous silence during Sands’s childhood. After accepting the invitation, Sands decided to research the family history that Buchholz had never shared. In short order, he discovered the tragic fate of Buchholz’s mother and dozens of other relatives, and he learned too that Raphael Lemkin and Hersch Lauterpacht had both attended law school in Lviv. Sands also became acquainted with the sons of two of the men responsible for the deaths of his family members: Niklas Frank, whose father, Hans, administered German-occupied Poland during World War II and who was among the Nazi officials convicted at Nuremberg and executed; and Horst von Wächter, whose father, Otto, was the Nazi official in charge of Galicia, which included Lviv.

Sands told the stories of Hans Frank and Otto von Wächter and of how their sons reckoned with their crimes in a compelling 2015 documentary, “My Nazi Legacy,” which he wrote and narrated. Niklas Frank, who became a journalist, renounced his father and wrote a book harshly condemning him. Horst von Wächter is a more complicated figure. Although he later opened his family’s archives to Sands, he could not bring himself to accept his father’s culpability. The film’s most poignant scene comes when Sands, Frank and von Wächter visit the field not far from Lviv where in 1943 around 3,500 Jews were executed and buried, including some of Sands’s relatives (as well as relatives of Hersh Lauterpacht). Troops under the command of von Wächter’s father took part in the massacre. As Frank and von Wächter stand before a memorial commemorating the atrocity, Frank says, “This our fathers did.” From von Wächter’s stricken look, it seems clear that he knows the truth, but even then, he refuses to admit it.

A year after the documentary was released, Sands published “East West Street.” Part of the book is about the Nuremberg trials and the behind-the-scenes jockeying between Lemkin and Lauterpacht over how the defendants were to be charged. Lemkin wanted them tried for what he called “genocide” — for murdering people because they were members of a particular group, for killing Jews because they were Jews. Lauterpacht didn’t dispute that Jews had been victimized because of their identity, but he pushed to have the defendants charged instead with what he called crimes against humanity — with killing people as individuals. He believed it was essential to try to steer humanity away from tribalism and hoped that international law could serve that purpose. As Sands writes in “East West Street”: “By focusing on the individual, not the group, Lauterpacht wanted to diminish the force of intergroup conflict. It was a rational, enlightened view, and also an idealistic one.”

Lauterpacht prevailed at Nuremberg: In October 1946, 18 Nazi leaders were convicted of war crimes or crimes against humanity, but the judgments against them made no mention of genocide. Lemkin’s lobbying efforts did not go unrewarded, however. Two months after the verdicts in Nuremberg, the United Nations voted to designate genocide an international crime. And in the decades since, largely owing to the enduring resonance of the Holocaust, genocide has come to be regarded as the more consequential and damning accusation — the “crime of crimes,” as Sands puts it. He finds this regrettable; crimes against humanity are no less heinous than acts of genocide, and he believes they should carry just as much opprobrium. But the bigger problem, in his mind, is that because the word “genocide” has such powerful connotations, it is often used carelessly and as a cudgel.

The pitfalls of the genocide charge became apparent to Sands when he represented Croatia in the case that it brought against Serbia in 1999 (another lawyer on the team was Keir Starmer, now Britain’s prime minister). The allegation centered on the massacre in November 1991 of several hundred Croatian P.O.W.s and civilians by Serbian paramilitaries; the killings took place near Vukovar, a city in Croatia. When the I.C.J. finally issued a decision, in 2015 (the wheels of international justice are especially slow to turn), it declined to categorize the slaughter as genocide. The ruling infuriated Croats, and their outrage was compounded by the fact that the same court had earlier affirmed that the 1995 massacre of more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslims at Srebrenica, also by Serbian paramilitaries, did meet the definition. (The court ruled that those Serbian units committed genocide but concluded that the Serbian government itself could not be held responsible for the atrocities.)

Sands told me that this remains a source of resentment in Croatia. “Many people believe there will be another war because the Croats didn’t get their genocide. And their anger is against the Bosnians, who got a genocide. So you ask yourself the question: Why is that a socially useful outcome?” He says that Lauterpacht anticipated the danger in elevating genocide to a crime — that it would sharpen tribal instincts and make it more likely, not less, that eliminationist desires would be acted on — and that he has come to share this view. Intellectually, he stands with Lauterpacht.

At the same time, he admits that he is very sympathetic to Lemkin’s position. During a talk at the City University of New York last March, Sands recalled visiting the site near Lviv where his relatives were murdered. “Standing above that unmarked mass grave,” he told the audience, “it was impossible for me as someone who is Jewish not to feel a sense of kinship and connection with the people who were there simply because they were Jews who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.” They were unquestionably the victims of a genocide. So were the Tutsis in Rwanda and the Bosnian Muslims who were massacred in Srebrenica. And despite his frustration with how promiscuously the genocide charge is invoked, Sands is confident that he can make it stick in the case against Myanmar.

More than six years later, Gambia v. Myanmar has now gone to trial at the I.C.J. Under international law, genocide is difficult to prove. Sands and his colleagues must be able to show dolus specialis, or specific intent: They have to establish, through direct evidence or compelling circumstantial evidence, that the only reasonable inference the judges can draw is that the atrocities committed against the Rohingya were motivated wholly or partly by genocidal impulses. On the first day of the hearings, Sands told the court that his side would demonstrate that the violence inflicted on multiple villages by Myanmar’s military met that threshold. Just as in Srebrenica, he said, what occurred in those villages presents “the inescapable conclusion that the crimes against the Rohingya who lived there were perpetrated with genocidal intent.”

One reason the trial in The Hague is being closely watched is the implications that it might have for a case that the I.C.J. is expected to hear later this year: the genocide allegation that South Africa has brought against Israel over the war in Gaza. A determination that Myanmar committed genocide could foretell a similar judgment against Israel. If, on the other hand, the I.C.J. clears Myanmar, it would be interpreted as a positive sign for Israel. Many observers think the court would be reluctant to turn history on its head by making Israel the first nation found guilty of genocide.

What’s more, the judges will be under considerable pressure, because the case against Israel could have onerous consequences for them. The Trump administration has sanctioned a handful of judges and one prosecutor with the International Criminal Court over its 2024 decision to issue arrest warrants for Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and its former defense minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity, and it will undoubtedly seek to punish the I.C.J. if it rules against Israel. (The I.C.C. prosecutes individuals; the I.C.J. adjudicates disputes between countries.)

According to Sands, there is a simple explanation for his reticence: He hasn’t wanted to make any public statements that might prejudice the Myanmar case. What he is willing to say is that he thinks Lemkin would have regarded Israel’s military campaign in Gaza as genocidal, but so too the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack that prompted it. He also points out something else. In 2019, Time magazine published an article about Netanyahu that noted that he was reading “East West Street” and included a photo of him with the book in his hand. Sands’s son (he has three children) had the picture framed. “One thing we can say with certainty,” Sands says, “is that Benjamin Netanyahu is well aware of what Raphael Lemkin considered the crime of genocide and needs no lessons from anyone on the dangers he is likely to face on the basis of his actions.”

But even as he argues another case in The Hague, Sands has come to believe that the law isn’t the only avenue for establishing truth and accountability, or necessarily always the best one. Near the end of his talk in Cambridge, Sands took questions. One student suggested that as a condition for ending the war in Ukraine, Russia was likely to demand that any criminal charges against Vladimir Putin and other officials be dropped. (The recent peace plan endorsed by President Trump included full amnesty for all parties.) How, he asked, would Sands “balance the tension between stopping more violence and seeing justice for violence that has already happened?”

Sands said that in any situation in which a civilian population has been brutalized, the crimes must be acknowledged. “You have to find a way to address what happened,” he said. But he went on to tell the student that his work as a writer had broadened his view of how justice might be achieved. He mentioned, by way of example, the role that literature has played in helping Chile recover from the horrors of the Pinochet era. “It has had a profoundly important impact,” Sands said. He also cited Patrick Radden Keefe’s book “Say Nothing,” about sectarian violence in Northern Ireland.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/02/01/magazine/01mag-sands-HP-square/01mag-sands-HP-square-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 14:58:58.906844

While performing in his home state of New Jersey, Springsteen dedicated his 1978 song The Promised Land to Renee Good, the 37-year-old woman who was shot and killed by an ICE officer in Minnesota.

Springsteen told the crowd, which loudly cheered his remarks: “If you believe in democracy, in liberty, if you believe truth still matters, and it’s worth speaking out, and it’s worth fighting for; if you believe in the power of the law and that no-one stands above it; if you stand against heavily armed masked federal troops invading an American city, using Gestapo tactics against our fellow citizens; if you believe you don’t deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest, then send a message to this president. As the mayor of that city has said: ICE should get the fuck out of Minneapolis.”

Springsteen, who has condemned Trump’s actions before, said the song was about “both the beautiful but flawed country that we are, and to the country that we could be”.

“This song is for you, and in the memory of a mother of three and an American citizen, Renee Good,” he added.

The musician, whose lyrics have been praised for depicting the struggles and triumphs of working-class Americans, had already criticized Trump’s authoritarian leanings.

At a show in May in the UK he said: “In my country, they’re taking sadistic pleasure in the pain they inflict on loyal American workers.

""We're one of the only churches that are having in-person service. Most Latino churches don't have a service because even citizens and legal residents are afraid to come out or to go to the store,"" Pastor Sergio Amezcua said.

Since U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement began Operation Metro Surge in December, Amezcua has been helping families who don't feel safe leaving their homes.

When he first asked his assistant to put out a call on social media, he thought they would receive a few requests.

""That was at 11 a.m. in the morning and by 7 p.m., my assistant called me and said, 'Pastor, a lot of people registered.' I was like, '20 families? 10?' 'No, 2,000,'"" Amezcua recalled.

According to Amezcua, so far they've been able to help approximately 14,000 families, but around 25,000 families are registered.

Right now, they're distributing anywhere between 50,000 and 70,000 pounds of food per week with the help of hundreds of volunteers.

""It looks like they're responding to a hurricane catastrophe, but it is a mental catastrophe what the government is doing with us in Minnesota,"" Amezcua said.

DHH Church is helping families from not just the metro area but across the state. They also provide food to 20 churches, 10 schools and a refugee organization.

""Our refugees and our immigrant community... are going through hell and that's not the America... that we know,"" Amezcua said. ""I want to make clear... that from a conservative pastor, what Donald Trump and the White House is doing is horrible. We feel betrayed by him and his White House. That's the way we feel.""

Amezcua recalled getting a phone call from a mother who was reusing single-use diapers, saying, ""She was washing the diapers and I said, 'No, no, no'... I sent a text, if you can donate diapers. Our volunteer force showed up with what you see here.""

On the Sunday before Martin Luther King Jr. Day, DHH Church was full of volunteers and people dropping off donations. Amezcua said once he realized food banks would be closed for the holiday, he started texting people. The community quickly mobilized. They plan to help 700-1,000 families on Monday alone.

""This is one way that takes no skill. Just takes showing up and I think we gotta keep showing up for stuff,"" said Brian McDermott, a volunteer who also dropped off food donations on Sunday.

Amezcua said with 25,000 families registered, they can't reach everyone. He's hoping to train more churches to do what they're doing.

Worker detained

What we know:

The worker was detained while he was outside a work site.

""This is a detention that never should have happened,"" said Kershaw. ""He was detained by ICE purely based on his country of origin, he had every federal authorization to be here which is something we check at the city of St. Paul.""

Kershaw maintains he was legally authorized to work in the United States by the federal government, and has a valid commercial driver's license. The worker was taken to the Whipple Building in Minneapolis, before being transferred to a detention facility in El Paso, Texas.

Adding to the anxiety of the situation, Kerhsaw says the man has a serious medical condition that requires strict medication and a specific diet.

GoFundMe for worker

What you can do: The Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota and Representative Angie Craig are working to ensure he has what he needs to treat his illness, while the Public Works department is rallying together to raise money for his wife through a GoFundMe.

""This is someone who should be here, who had every right to be here, was helping to take care of St. Paul streets, and was illegally detained,"" said Kershaw.

Federal response to ICE lawsuit

The backstory:

A federal judge has fast-tracked a lawsuit filed by Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul against the federal government over increased ICE activities. The judge denied an immediate halt to the activities, and Attorney General Keith Ellison has since sent a letter to the judge requesting a preliminary injunction rather than a temporary restraining order, citing what he said were escalating harms from the federal government’s actions.

State officials argue the operation isn't about safety or fraud, as federal officials claim, but rather political retribution. The lawsuit alleges the enforcement activities are impacting schools and businesses, with local leaders urging federal agents to stop using what they describe as excessive force and start wearing body-worn cameras.

Officials have emphasized the lawsuit is not an attempt to try and block immigration enforcement altogether, but rather to stop what they describe as unlawful federal enforcement.

The other side:

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has repeatedly criticized the state and Minneapolis leaders, accusing them of protecting criminals in their opposition to ICE.

What's next:

The judge ordered federal officials to submit their response to the lawsuit no later than Monday, Jan. 19. The plaintiffs will then have until Thursday, Jan. 22, to respond to those arguments.

Federal officials have not filed a response as of Monday morning.

Troops on standby

In Memphis, Tennessee, the National Civil Rights Museum is going about its annual King Day celebration as normal.","As communities across the country on Monday host parades, panels and service projects for the 40th federal observation of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the political climate for some is more fraught with tensions than festive with reflection on the slain Black American civil rights icon’s legacy.

In the year since Donald Trump’s second inauguration fell on King Day, the Republican president has gone scorched earth against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and targeted mostly Black-led cities for federal law enforcement operations, among other policies that many King admirers have criticized.

One year ago, Trump’s executive orders, “Ending Illegal Discrimination And Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity” and “Ending Radical And Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing,” accelerated a rollback of civil rights and racial justice initiatives in federal agencies, corporations and universities. Last month, the National Park Service announced it will no longer offer free admission to parks on King Day and Juneteenth, but instead on Flag Day and Trump’s birthday.

The fatal shooting this month of an unarmed Minneapolis woman in her car by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents sent there to target the city’s Somali immigrant population, as well as Trump recently decrying civil rights as discrimination against white people, have only intensified fears of a regression from the social progress King and many others advocated for.

Still, the concerns have not chilled many King holiday events planned this year. Some conservative admirers of King say the holiday should be a reminder of the civil rights icon’s plea that all people be judged by their character and not their skin color. Some Black advocacy groups, however, are vowing a day of resistance and rallies nationwide.

‘We’ve always strived to be a more perfect union’

In a recent interview with The New York Times, Trump said he felt the Civil Rights Movement and the reforms it helped usher in were harmful to white people, who “were very badly treated.” Politicians and advocates say Trump’s comments are what are harmful, because they dismiss the hard work of King and others that helped not just Black Americans but other groups, including women and the LGBTQ+ community.

“I think the Civil Rights Movement was one of the things that made our country so unique, that we haven’t always been perfect, but we’ve always strived to be this more perfect union, and that’s what I think the Civil Rights Movement represents,” Gov. Wes Moore, Maryland’s first Black governor and only the nation’s third elected Black governor, said this week in an interview with The Associated Press.

Maya Wiley, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, one of the nation’s oldest and largest civil rights coalitions, said the Trump administration’s priorities make clear it is actively trying to erase the movement.

“From health care access and affordable housing to good paying jobs and union representation,” Wiley said, “things Dr. King made part of his clarion call for a beloved community are still at stake and is even more so because (the administration) has dismantled the very terms of government and the norms of our culture.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

The conservative Heritage Foundation think tank is encouraging the holiday’s focus to stay solely on King himself. Brenda Hafera, a foundation research fellow, urged people to visit the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park in Atlanta or reread his “I have a dream” speech delivered on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington nearly 63 years ago.

But using the holiday as a platform to rally and speak about “anti-racism” and “critical race theory” actually rejects King’s ambition for the country, Hafera argued.

“I think efforts should be conducted in the spirit of what Martin Luther King actually believed and what he preached. And his vision was a colorblind society, right,” Hafera said. “He says very famously in his speech, don’t judge by the color of your skin, but the content of your character.”

Groups call for holiday of reclamation, education and rallying

The NAACP, the nation’s oldest civil right organization which had a myriad MLK Day events planned for Monday, asserted that the heightened fears among communities of color and in immigrant communities mean King Day observances must take a different tone. People will have to put their safety first, even if their government isn’t, said Wisdom Cole, NAACP senior national director of advocacy.

“As folks are using their constitutional right to protest and to speak out and stand up for what they believe in, we are being faced with violence. We are faced with increased police and state violence inflicted by the government,” Cole said.

The Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of organizations affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement, has planned its events under the banner “Reclaim MLK Day of Action.” Organizers planned demonstrations in Atlanta, Chicago and Oakland, California, among other cities, over the weekend and Monday.

“This year it is more important than ever to reclaim MLK’s radical legacy, letting his wisdom and fierce commitment to freedom move us into the action necessary to take care of one another, fight back, and free ourselves from this fascist regime,” Devonte Jackson, a national organizing director for the coalition, said in a statement.

Indiana school cancels historic MLK Day event

For the first time in its 60-year history, Indiana University in Indianapolis canceled its annual Martin Luther King dinner. Over the years, the event drew notable guest speakers including Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman elected to Congress, and activist Angela Davis.

The reasoning was “budget constraints,” according to a social media post by the school’s Black Student Union. However, the group said it was worried this was “connected to broader political pressures.” A few students have since organized smaller community dinners or “eat-ins” to fill the void, WTHR-TV in Indianapolis reported.

Meanwhile, the St. Anthony of Padua Catholic Church in Westbrook, Maine, canceled a MLK Day service due to “unforeseen circumstances,” according to the parish website. But a member of the church’s “social justice and peace committee” told NewsCenterMaine.com that the pastor was concerned about people’s safety amid rumors of ICE agents being in the area.

Overall, there have been few reports of King Day events being majorly scaled down or canceled altogether.

In Memphis, Tennessee, the National Civil Rights Museum is going about its annual King Day celebration as normal. The museum is located on the site of the former Lorraine Motel, where King was shot on April 4, 1968. The museum is offering free admission on the holiday, an annual tradition.

“This milestone year is not only about looking back at what Dr. King stood for, but also recognizing the people who continue to make his ideals real today,” museum President Russell Wigginton said.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap26017756118578.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-19 12:58:04.556951

""We need to shut down all detention centers in Virginia. We need to ensure legal and financial support from the state and from the city for those detained. We must ensure that Richmond does not renegotiate any contract with Flock surveillance cameras or any other surveillance technology,"" one protester said.

Sunday's rally continued the momentum from last weekend's demonstration on Broad Street where around 300 people protested the deadly shooting of U.S. citizen Renee Good by a federal ICE agent in Minneapolis.

Richmond protesters demand justice after Renee Good killed in ICE shooting

Last Saturday's protest was one of hundreds planned for towns and cities across the country over the weekend, with demonstrators braving heavy rain as they assembled underneath the Maggie Walker statue to express frustration over Good's shooting.

""This is what that actually looks like, coming together for something good instead of violence and domination and terror,"" Te'Shaun Cleckley, one of last weekend's demonstrators, said.

Good, an Old Dominion University graduate and mother of three, was shot three times by the federal agent in an encounter captured on multiple cellphone videos that have sparked nationwide scrutiny.

The Trump Administration has defended the agent's actions, with President Trump stating Friday: ""We will always be protecting ICE and we will always be protecting our border patrol and our law enforcement.""

Cleckley urged fellow protesters to continue fighting for justice in Good's memory.

""Our mobilization to fight for justice and for liberation and for dignity and equity for everybody, isn't necessarily rooted in the reality that we're going to win,"" Cleckley said. ""It's rooted in the fact that we love the world around us, we love the people around us and we love the people that are gonna come after us. So my message would be, don't stop.""

Spanberger's policy reversal marks a sharp departure from Youngkin's approach, which included consistent support for ICE operations.

As a result, within the Fifth Circuit, providers cannot rely on the No Surprises Act (NSA) itself to enforce Independent Dispute Resolution (IDR) awards in court and face a heightened standing bar for ERISA-based claims where patients are insulated from financial harm. And the persuasive effect of the Fifth Circuit’s holding is bolstered nationwide.

Background

As we explained previously, Guardian Flight arose out of efforts by air ambulance providers Guardian Flight and Med-Trans to collect payments awarded through the IDR process under the NSA. After prevailing in multiple “baseball-style” IDR proceedings against an insurer, the providers alleged that the insurer failed to pay the awards within the 30‑day deadline required by the NSA. They sued to enforce those awards, asserting: (1) direct claims under the NSA; (2) derivative ERISA claims based on assignments from plan beneficiaries; and (3) a Texas quantum meruit claim. The district court dismissed across the board, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that the NSA does not create a private right of action for providers to enforce IDR awards, that the providers lacked ERISA standing because NSA‑protected beneficiaries suffered no concrete financial injury, and that the quasi‑contract claim failed because the services were rendered for the patients, not for the insurer.

Issues Presented in the Cert Petition

The certiorari petition asked the Supreme Court to review two issues with potentially far‑reaching consequences for NSA and ERISA litigation. First, it asked whether a breach of ERISA plan terms is itself an injury in fact to a plan beneficiary even where the beneficiary is insulated from out‑of‑pocket harm by the NSA’s balance‑billing protections, and therefore whether assignee‑providers can rely on that breach alone to establish Article III standing. Second, it asked whether, when Congress made NSA IDR awards “binding” and directed that insurers “shall” pay them within 30 days, it intended to permit providers to sue in court to enforce those awards, rather than leaving enforcement exclusively to administrative agencies. The petition argued that the Fifth Circuit’s answers to both questions deepen existing splits among the circuits on what constitutes a concrete injury under Spokeo and Ramirez, and on how to read statutory “binding” and “shall pay” language in the private-right-of-action context.

Practical Impact in the Fifth Circuit

With the Supreme Court’s denial of certiorari, the Fifth Circuit’s analysis now firmly governs within Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi and will be influential elsewhere. In practical terms, providers in the Fifth Circuit cannot bring standalone NSA claims to compel payment of IDR awards, and must instead look primarily to federal and state regulators (such as Health and Human Services) or to contract‑based remedies to address nonpayment. ERISA‑based claims will continue to face heightened standing scrutiny where patients are shielded from financial liability, as the Fifth Circuit treats the plan’s alleged failure to pay as a “technical” breach insufficient, by itself, to constitute a concrete injury to the beneficiary. And state‑law quasi‑contract theories remain constrained by the court’s view that services performed for patients do not satisfy Texas’s requirement that services be rendered for the defendant’s benefit.

Numerous other district courts throughout the United States have followed the Fifth Circuit’s lead in finding providers lack a private right of action to enforce IDR awards, and we expect the denial of certiorari will add further support for district courts considering the issue in the future.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.14355_0412.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 12:58:25.579400

Martin Luther King Jr., communities in the Bay Area will celebrate the legendary civil rights activist’s legacy by making their voices heard, amid the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion programs and deport historic numbers of immigrants.

“This year is not just about honoring history, it’s about practicing for the future,” said Gina Fromer, CEO of San Francisco social justice organization GLIDE. “I have no doubt that we need to march many times this year in defense of our rights. Dr. King said hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.”

Fromer said GLIDE’s annual march, which gathers at the San Francisco Caltrain station at Fourth and King Streets and has been a local tradition for 41 years, is intended to mirror the Selma to Montgomery protest marches of 1965.

Across the Bay Area, activists are seizing the moment and transforming what is typically a yearly opportunity to give back through acts of service into a day of political action. Throughout the Bay Area, residents are honoring MLK’s desire to strengthen community and building local resilience through shoreline cleanups, food distributions and interfaith gatherings.

This year, Fromer said, Glide’s march will advocate for “radical inclusivity” at a time when the rights of LGBTQ+, unhoused and immigrant communities are threatened. She noted that the current administration’s attacks make the late leader’s message of “unconditional love” more important than ever.

In the East Bay, the Freedmen Federation and Faith In Action East Bay have organized a Unity Vigil at Richmond’s City Hall to address what they call “state-sanctioned violence.”

Kira Lee, a professor and organizer with the collective, said the recent death of Los Angeles resident and U.S. citizen Keith Porter Jr. in ICE custody and sightings of federal immigration agents in Richmond have made it impossible to separate the holiday from the current political moment.

Lee called the surge in enforcement an “exercise in othering” that targets residents across race and citizenship status. “I don’t view this as an immigration issue. I view this as a racial issue,” Lee said.

“I view it as slave catching, where state violence is being used to decide who belongs and who doesn’t. Black and brown families have been screaming for protection this entire time.”

In the tradition of giving back, South Berkeley high school students with the youth design nonprofit Girls Garage will unveil their renovation of a home for an older Black couple this weekend.

The ribbon-cutting ceremony on Monday will mark the culmination of a year-long project to repair damage done by an unlicensed contractor that had left the family home unlivable and them at risk of displacement.

Emily Pilloton-Lam, the nonprofit’s founder, said that community-led projects offer people realistic ways to take action during periods of national uncertainty. And encouraging young women and gender-expansive youth to lead the remodel, she said, sends a powerful message.

“It is a very, very difficult time to maintain hope when we see what’s going on all over the country,” Pilloton-Lam said. “Projects like this bring us back down to a really human scale of one family, one neighbor and local organizations. It’s a reminder that we still can make a really big difference in the lives of individuals in our immediate community.”

While President Donald Trump scrapped free entry to National Parks on MLK Day, adding his own birthday to the calendar, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced on Friday that visitors can enjoy free entry at more than 200 of California’s state parks for MLK Day.

“Any medical center or hospital is supposed to be a place of healing,” said Dr. Brian Muthyala, a physician at the hospital systems Hennepin Healthcare and M Health Fairview. “It is a place where people go when they are at their most vulnerable, when they are hurt or scared or in need of care, and any presence that disrupts that environment is harmful.”

Officials with the Homeland Security Department said that they do not conduct operations in hospitals. “We go in if there is an active danger to public safety,” said Tricia McLaughlin, an agency spokeswoman.

Health care workers, however, describe a different reality, saying agents have broken hospital protocol, refused to provide documentation and, in some cases, gotten into shouting matches with doctors and nurses.

Over his 20 years as an emergency medicine physician, Dr. Robert LeFevere said, he had encountered law enforcement officers coming in with shooting victims and other patients.

“But federal agents barging into patient care areas trying to question or detain patients — I’ve never seen anything like that before,” said Dr. LeFevere, who works at Regions Hospital, a few blocks from the State Capitol in St. Paul.

Health officials for three of the state’s major health systems, which oversee medical centers and clinics where agents have been spotted, declined to comment on federal activity in their hospitals, but stressed that they do not help enforce immigration laws and that federal officers are expected to follow the law and medical facilities’ safety protocols.

Federal immigration officers, like all law enforcement agents, are allowed to enter hospitals, clinics and other medical institutions if they are accompanying a patient in their custody and cannot be restricted from accessing public areas. But hospital officials said they do not allow immigration officers into private spaces, such as patient rooms and care units, without judicial warrants and that security officers escort them and limit their searches to the terms of those warrants.

“To be clear: We do not allow ICE to circulate in our facilities,” said Aimée Jordan, a spokeswoman with Fairview Health Services and M Health Fairview, which oversees about 10 hospitals in Minnesota. “Our clinics and hospitals remain places where people can seek care without fear. Even in uncertain times — especially in uncertain times — that commitment does not change.”

One health official said that over the past week, agents had brought in about two dozen patients to M Health Fairview Southdale Hospital, which is the closest medical center to the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, a multiagency facility that includes a holding area for immigrant detainees. Whipple, located near the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, has become a key spot for clashes between protesters and federal agents.

Two nurses, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss patient care, described witnessing a confrontation between health care workers and federal agents last weekend that devolved into a screaming match in a hallway at Hennepin Healthcare System in Minneapolis.

A crowd of nurses and physicians, many in scrubs and medical gear, tried to stop the agents from shackling a severely injured man to his bedside, they said. Acquaintances in the patient’s neighborhood said they knew little about the man, except that he was a roofer and did not have family in the United States.

Hennepin County lawyers have filed a legal petition on behalf of the patient contesting his confinement by ICE, according to documents filed in a Federal District Court in Minnesota. Jeanette Boerner, the director of Adult Representation Services at Hennepin County, declined to comment on the specifics of the pending litigation.

D.H.S. officials and a lawyer representing the agency did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the episode or the man’s immigration case. Homeland security officials have until Tuesday to respond to the man’s legal petition.

The patient remains in the hospital, and agents have been rotating in and out of the facility as they keep watch at his side, according to three health care workers who asked not to be named because they did not have permission from their employer to speak on the issue.

About 10 miles to the east, in St. Paul, Dr. LeFevere said there had been at least two instances at Regions Hospital when federal agents entered the emergency department, once through the ambulance bay and another through a back entrance reserved for law enforcement.

In both cases, it appeared that the agents had been trailing people with whom they had interacted with on the streets, but the individuals were not in their custody, Dr. LeFevere said. The agents became argumentative when health care workers requested to see their warrants, but they eventually left the hospital, he said.

Dr. Loren Cobb, a psychiatry resident physician at the University of Minnesota and M Health Fairview, said she has been receiving texts and emails alerting health care workers that federal agents have been attempting to enter facilities on their grounds, including a children’s hospital. In at least one instance, the agents entered with someone in their custody, but in another, they were searching for a patient, she said. Staff and health teams have been reminded to follow proper hospital protocols, including not give away patient information.

“I am just worried it is going to escalate even more,” she said, adding that sometimes it is only herself and a handful of doctors on staff who are responsible for overseeing entire floors. “What happens if they inappropriately try to push forward? What comes next?”

Jeffrey Lunde, who serves as a Hennepin County commissioner and chairman of the hospital board of the Hennepin Healthcare System, said there were recent instances at Hennepin Healthcare in which hospital staff had asked federal agents to produce documentation as to why they were present in a private area or in a patient’s private room. Agents were not able to provide it.

“And that is where things get murky and difficult,” he said.

Nurses, doctors and other health care professionals across the Twin Cities had prepared for precisely such situations as they watched immigration crackdowns unfold in other cities over the past six months.

Jamey Sharp, a health care worker who is also a community organizer with the nonprofit Unidos MN, said his organization had trained more than 300 health care workers since March on patient privacy and knowing their rights. The group, which advocates social justice, said it had also helped to connect health care workers through Signal chat groups in hopes of tracking the activity of federal agents inside their facilities and ensure that rules were being followed.

But the reality has gone beyond the scope of their training. Many said they have been shocked, both by the actions of agents inside their hospitals, as well as the injuries that have required treatment as a result of confrontations on the streets. Some health care workers are holding news conferences to denounce the tactics. Dozens flooded a Hennepin Healthcare board meeting this month demanding that local officials provide stronger oversight in their facilities.

Health officials say they are limited in how they can respond. Though hospital staff are obligated to protect the rights of their patients, federal officers can argue that the people they are monitoring or questioning inside hospitals are a danger to society. Who prevails in that back and forth has largely been untested in the courts.

The tension is unfolding at the same time that Homeland Security Department officials are also reviewing the citizenship and legal status of staff at some area hospitals and across the country.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/18/multimedia/18nat-minn-hospitals1-bgqt/18nat-minn-hospitals1-bgqt-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 11:01:11.862244

WASHINGTON—The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) has filed a lawsuit against the District of Columbia to compel the release of public records showing whether, and to what extent, it is guarding against voting by illegal aliens. The suit, filed in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia on January 16, stems from the D.C. Department of Motor Vehicles’ (DC DMV) failure to respond to FAIR’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request submitted on November 12, 2025.

This legal action is a direct follow-up to FAIR’s ongoing investigation, launched in November 2025, into jurisdictions with policies that pose a high risk of facilitating voting by illegal aliens. To date, the investigation has focused on states like California, Colorado, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington—all of which engage in automatic voter registration, universal mail-in voting, and the issuance of driver’s licenses to illegal aliens. FAIR’s investigation seeks to determine whether adequate measures are in place in these jurisdictions to prevent noncitizens from registering to vote, and to ensure compliance with federal laws like the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) and the REAL ID Act.

FAIR’s FOIA request to the DC DMV specifically sought records, policies, and communications detailing how the agency distinguishes between U.S. citizens and noncitizens during voter registration processes, verifies citizenship status before transmitting data to election officials, and handles data from non-REAL ID-compliant credential holders. Since FAIR submitted its request in early November 2025, the DC DMV has provided no substantive response, determination, or records—an egregious violation of DC FOIA’s mandatory timelines.

“American citizens deserve confidence that their elections are secure and free from interference by those who are not eligible to vote,” said Dale Wilcox, FAIR’s Executive Director and General Counsel. “The District of Columbia’s refusal to provide these basic records raises serious questions about whether safeguards exist to protect election integrity. FAIR is committed to holding governments accountable and ensuring transparency in how voter rolls are managed, especially in jurisdictions with policies that invite abuse.”

“The DC DMV’s stonewalling is unacceptable and undermines public trust in our democratic processes,” added Mateo Forero, FAIR’s Director of Investigations and counsel of record in the case. “Our investigation is about uncovering the truth: Are these agencies doing enough to prevent illegal aliens from voting? By forcing the release of these documents through litigation, we aim to expose any vulnerabilities and push for reforms that prioritize lawful participation in elections.”

Appearing at the Light of Day Winterfest in Red Bank, N.J., Mr. Springsteen told the crowd: “We are living through incredibly critical times. The United States, the ideals and the values for which it stood for the past 250 years is being tested as it has never been in modern times,” according to videos that circulated online.

He added: “If you believe in the power of the law and that no one stands above it, if you stand against heavily armed mass federal troops invading an American city using Gestapo tactics against our fellow citizens, if you believe you don’t deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest, then send a message to this president.”

Mr. Springsteen went on to quote Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis, who had used an expletive to tell ICE to leave the city. He then dedicated his song “The Promised Land,” which tells of a young working-class man striving for a brighter future, to Ms. Good.

“This one is for you, and the memory of mother of three and American citizen Renee Good,” he told the crowd.

Ms. Good was fatally shot by an ICE agent, Jonathan Ross, on Jan. 7 in Minneapolis. Mr. Ross was standing near the front of Ms. Good’s car and fired his gun after she drove toward him and then turned to the right. Mr. Trump and administration officials have said that Ms. Good had “weaponized her vehicle” against the agent.

Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement on Sunday that no one cared about Mr. Springsteen’s “bad political opinions.”

“If he actually believed in the power of the law,” she said, “he would understand that criminal illegal aliens should be deported, that impeding federal law enforcement operations is a crime and that officers have a right to act in self-defense if an individual is using their car as a deadly weapon.”

Mr. Springsteen’s remarks on Saturday were hardly the first time the musician has spoken out against Mr. Trump and his policies.

Two days later during a vehicle stop in Portland, Oregon, a Border Patrol agent shot and wounded two Venezuelans. One of them, Luis David Nino-Moncada, recently pleaded not guilty of aggravated assault against a federal officer and damaging federal property.

Soon after, protests erupted across the country in both blue states such as California and New York and red states like Texas — which saw large demonstrations in Houston, Austin, Dallas and other cities.

Trump, who made mass deportations a centerpiece of his presidential campaign, reiterated his administration's commitment to the policy in a press release on Wednesday, linking higher deportations to lower housing costs, higher wages and lower crime.

During his second term, Trump has shifted the government's focus from border enforcement to arresting and deporting undocumented immigrants from the nation's interior. Daily ICE arrests in Texas have jumped from an average of 85 per day during the final 18 months of the Biden Administration to 176 per day in the first six months under Trump, according to a Tribune analysis.

Undocumented immigrants in Texas have reported staying home as much as possible to avoid being targeted by immigration officers or police.

Meanwhile, ICE facilities in Texas and elsewhere have been targeted: In September, a 29-year-old man fired on an immigration enforcement office in Dallas, killing two detainees and wounding another. Just a few months earlier, a group of nearly a dozen people attacked a detention center in Alvaro with tactical gear and weapons, injuring a local law enforcement officer.

Here's what to know about how ICE is operating in Texas and what rights people have when approached by an agent.

How is ICE arresting people in Texas?

The most high-profile operations are street raids, where ICE agents, often accompanied by state troopers and local police, target a particular area or business and arrest groups of undocumented immigrants.

Some of the biggest raids have taken place in and around Houston: In May, ICE said it deported more than 500 people and arrested more than 400 suspected undocumented immigrants in and around the city in roughly one week. In October, ICE carried out another massive operation in Houston over the course of 10 days, in which they said they arrested more than 1,500 undocumented immigrants.

ICE has focused mainly on the state's large urban areas, but earlier this year, according to Border Report, the head of the South Texas Builders Association said agents have been raiding construction sites along the border.

But the most common way ICE agents track down undocumented immigrants is through the local criminal justice system. Immigration agents can request that jails hold an undocumented person who has been jailed, then turn them over to ICE for deportation. The Harris County Jail leads the country for such immigration holds, also known as ICE detainers, according to a Tribune analysis.

ICE is also increasingly targeting immigrants when they arrive for court hearings or routine immigration appointments; ICE agents have arrested people at federal buildings in El Paso, immigration courts in San Antonio and probation offices in Dallas.

How and why does ICE work with local police departments?

Early in Trump's second administration, Gov. Greg Abbott directed the Texas Department of Public Safety to support federal immigration enforcement operations in tracking down and deporting undocumented immigrants.

Some sheriffs in Texas have signed agreements to work closely with ICE to enforce immigration laws. A new state law passed in last year's legislative session requires sheriffs in all counties with a jail to enter into such agreements, also known as the 287(g) program, this year. Since Trump returned to the White House, more than half of ICE arrests in Texas have come from local jails, according to the Tribune analysis.

Even in Democrat-run Texas cities like Austin and San Antonio, where local leaders in the past have stated their police won't cooperate with immigration officers, the state requires local police departments to support ICE operations — a policy adopted by other states like Florida and Louisiana.

According to KUT, the Austin Police Department on Thursday announced that officers have ""general orders"" to work alongside federal immigration officers to execute immigration warrants. In March, Houston police were instructed to call federal immigration authorities if they come across a person who has deportation orders in the national crime database.

Are any places off limits to ICE agents?

The Trump administration, early in his second term, rescinded federal policies that limited arrests of immigrants in sensitive locations such as schools, churches and hospitals.

But to enter private spaces such as homes and businesses, immigration agents and police still need a warrant signed by a judge to enter.

If ICE agents approach you in public, what are your rights?

Anyone confronted by an ICE agent has the right to remain silent and if the person is detained, they have the right to an attorney. If an agent doesn't have a signed warrant, people have the right to refuse them entry into their home and the right to refuse searches, regardless of their citizenship status. Agents have the right to pat a person down to check for weapons.

The American Civil Liberties Union advises people to stay calm and not resist or obstruct the agents. They also advise people not to lie to agents or give them fake documents.

They recommend that people memorize phone numbers of their family members and friends, and their lawyer. If they take medication, have a plan for another person to give those medications to agents if they are arrested.",https://cdn.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/19082548/0401-ICE-Raid-Minor-EG-26-1500x1001.webp,N,,2026-01-19 13:58:12.088434

President

Arab American Institute

How did we get to the point where the president can say and do things that put our culture and democracy at risk, and it’s just shrugged off as if it were normal?

In social media posts and unscripted press comments he uses language that would have been unimaginable coming from a president in any other period of American history. In just the past few months, Mr. Trump: was photographed making an obscene gesture and mouthing a vulgarity at a demonstrator; demeaned a popular TV personality who had just been murdered; called a Somali American member of Congress garbage, adding that all Somalis were garbage; called the Governor of Minnesota “retarded,” an especially hurtful slur as that governor has a son with a disability; and insulted women reporters who asked him challenging questions, calling them “ugly,” “obnoxious,” and “stupid.”

Parents wouldn’t tolerate this from their children and yet here we have a president of the United States demeaning his office by speaking in such a deplorable manner.

It’s not just the president’s speech that has been so “unpresidential.” Mr. Trump’s need to gratify his ego has led him to make exaggerated false claims about his grievances and his successes. He claims that he has been attacked by media, Congress, and law enforcement agencies like no other president in history. At the same time, he boasts that he has improved the economy and made our cities safer than they have ever been. None of this is true.

In an effort to impose his will and worldview, he has surrounded himself with White House staff and Cabinet that not only heap praise upon him and carry out his every whim, but also support his efforts to silence and intimidate those whom he has denounced as critics.

Herein lies a fundamental difference between President Trump’s first and second terms. In the former, some senior members of his staff and Cabinet served as a check on his behavior. Many were fired and replaced. He began his second term with a detailed plan to transform government, and with a more compliant senior leadership (e.g., the Department of Justice and FBI are willing to order investigations of his critics).

This combination of unchecked power, the president’s need to have his every ambition fulfilled, and his disrespect for law and precedent has led to actions that are illegal. In the first few months, his administration put in place a program to remove over 300,000 government employees. He shuttered USAID, the Voice of America, and the US Institute for Peace—all illegal actions as these were congressionally created and funded entities. He later reopened the Institute for Peace as the Trump Institute for Peace; renamed the nation’s premier center for the arts The Donald J Trump, The John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts without any authorization; and had the White House’s East Wing torn down to be replaced by another vanity project—a massive ballroom—which no doubt will also bear his name in the near future.

Conceivably the most dangerous of President Trump’s moves have been the dramatic expansion of ICE—the immigration enforcement entity—and its unleashing in US cities, posing a direct threat to American democracy.

In recent weeks Mr. Trump sent a massive contingent of ICE agents to Minneapolis, Minnesota ostensibly to root out illegal immigrants, while attempting to embarrass that state’s Democratic governor and to target one of Mr. Trump’s new favorites, Minnesota’s large Somali community. As expected, ICE’s arrests have been indiscriminate, detaining many legal residents and citizens, and their behavior unacceptably brutal. As seen in other cities, ICE behaviors have provoked widespread protests. In one horrifying incident, a member of an observer team monitoring ICE behavior was shot and killed through an open car window by an ICE agent.

The shooting was filmed from multiple angles, establishing that the victim posed no threat to the ICE agent. That didn’t stop the president and other administration officials from propagating a lie about what had transpired. They called the murdered woman a domestic terrorist, saying she’d threatened the life of the ICE shooter. Unwrapping this murder is instructive on many levels.

First, with the enormous budget appropriated for ICE expansion, that entity now has over 10,000 armed agents. The rapidity of its growth has led to inadequate vetting and training. More dangerous still is how ICE has recruited agents: at gun shows and right-wing events, and targeted advertisements on right-wing radio shows. The White House appears to be forming an ideologically cohesive national police force that is anti-immigrant and violence-prone and has been told by the administration that they can act with impunity.

This incident also points out the extent to which the White House is capable of fabricating a storyline that will be echoed by other leaders and their supportive media outlets. The impact is clear. A recent poll showed that, by a wide margin, most Americans believe that the woman’s killing was wrong, but more than three-quarters of Republicans believe the president’s narrative that the murdered woman was a threat to the ICE agent and her killing was justified.

So, how did we get to this point? The answer is clear. A president who says whatever he needs to say to justify his position, officials around him and a supportive media who vociferously agree with him and threaten those who disagree, and a cult-like movement of partisans who will believe what they are told even when the facts speak to a different reality.

ICE in Minnesota: Postal workers protest

… [The] smarter approach: abolish abuses, not ICE.” The memo added: “Immigration laws are meaningless if they are not enforced.
Outrage is widespread at ICE agents killing Renee Good, an unarmed Minnesota woman.
In response, Democrats on Capitol Hill need to support mayors and governors calling for an end to mass deployments of ICE agents.
Force him to defend his reckless political claim that ICE agents enjoy “absolute immunity” in a case where they kill a civilian.","It was more than five years ago, but Democrats are still hurting from self-inflicted wounds caused by the slogan “Defund the Police.”

The right-wing media’s echo chamber keeps bellowing those words with delight. They aim to make all Democrats look like they foolishly want to open the door to criminals. Now, Trump-approved media has a new siren call: “Abolish ICE.” They want any whisper of those words to become a weight to sink Democratic candidates and blunt what is widely forecast to be a blue wave in November.

Third Way, a center-left think tank in Washington, is warning about the political trap being set for Democrats: “The impulse is emotional. The slogan is simple. But politically, it is lethal,” cautions a recent memo. “Every call to abolish ICE risks squandering one of the clearest opportunities in years to secure meaningful reform of immigration enforcement — while handing Republicans exactly the fight they want. … [The] smarter approach: abolish abuses, not ICE.”

The memo added: “Immigration laws are meaningless if they are not enforced. And they can be enforced in ways that protect public safety…[voters] understand this. They responded strongly to what they saw as a lack of enforcement under President Biden. But they are also recoiling from Trump’s excessive force.”

Slogans aside, there are legitimate calls for Americans to take bold action. Outrage is widespread at ICE agents killing Renee Good, an unarmed Minnesota woman. At the White House, the press secretary publicly asked a reporter why Good died. “Because an ICE agent acted recklessly and killed her unjustifiably,” came the reply.

Under Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, ICE has undergone massive expansion — with funding now rivaling or exceeding that of the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration, making it one of the most heavily funded federal law enforcement forces in the country.

How did an immigration enforcement unit become the largest police force in the U.S.? The sad answer is that President Trump is using ICE’s growing presence in America’s cities to normalize the presence of armed federal agents on any street corner. Last week, he threatened to use the Insurrection Act to supplement ICE’s threatening presence with the U.S. military.

The president’s goal is to scare people into silence to halt rising dissent.

In response, Democrats on Capitol Hill need to support mayors and governors calling for an end to mass deployments of ICE agents. Local officials are plainly saying that these agents are making communities less safe.

What can congressional Democrats do about it?

Here is a to-do list.

First, impose congressional oversight.

Second, call Noem to the hearings and enlist Republicans to consider impeaching her if she does not reduce the budget and the size of this paramilitary force.

Third, call Vice President JD Vance to public hearings. Force him to defend his reckless political claim that ICE agents enjoy “absolute immunity” in a case where they kill a civilian.

Vance has a law degree and knows better. This is not a matter of “qualified immunity.” That doctrine protects state and local police from civil lawsuits for errors made as they properly protect the public.

Even with “qualified immunity,” it is important to codify its ICE limits and clear the way to apply accountability for egregious abuse of the public trust by armed agents of a democratic government.

The second Trump administration is barely a year old. He is ignoring legal limitations by unilaterally deciding to send the U.S. military into Venezuela to grab the country’s leader. Even before that act, he defied Congress by using U.S. military missile strikes to kill Venezuelan boat passengers he claimed were drug traffickers. That was way beyond appropriate action, including arrests and boat seizure, normally taken by the coast guard and customs officials.

Don’t forget that Trump’s officials have yet to offer evidence that the people on those bombed boats were drug dealers.

Now this imperious use of force by a president’s administration has come to the homeland, and an American woman lies dead at the hands of ICE.

This cannot go unanswered by Democrats in Congress.

They are in the minority in both the House and Senate. But Democrats have to reach for leverage, including using the threat of a government shutdown to express their outrage at the bloodshed in Minnesota.

Democrats will have a leverage point in two weeks, when the government runs out of funding.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) was right to allow an end to last year’s budget shutdown and to let Republicans hang themselves by ending ObamaCare subsidies that gave health care to millions.

A shutdown is still a dubious idea. But murder by a federal agent demands a response.

As we approach the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States this year, the words of our second president, John Adams, ing with renewed urgency:

“Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.”

Trump recently said the only limit on his power is “my morality.” Is that the explanation for his administration’s refusal to hold to the Constitution?

George Conway, the conservative lawyer now running for Congress in New York as a Democrat, put it bluntly: “The President of the United States is a criminal… He has no loyalty to the law or to the Constitution.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/AP26016127809169.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-19 11:01:07.178946

But the killing of Renee Good earlier this month by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer, as well as the regular, often violent confrontations that ICE stages on US streets, show so much that is unravelling in plain sight. The rule of law, the freedom to protest, and even the right to walk or drive in the streets safely without being assaulted by the state, seems to exist no longer in the towns and cities where ICE has made its presence felt. The most disturbing aspect of all this is how quickly it has happened. But for a government agency such as ICE to become the powerful paramilitary force that it is, several factors need to be in play first. Only one of them is Donald Trump.

ICE may look as if it came out of nowhere, but the sort of authoritarianism that results in these crackdowns never does. It takes shape slowly, in plain sight, in a way that is clearly traceable over time. First, there needs to be a merging of immigration and security concerns, both institutionally and in the political culture. Established in the wake of 9/11, ICE was part of a government restructuring under President George W Bush. It was granted a large budget, wide investigative powers and a partnership with the FBI’s joint terrorism taskforce. The work of enforcing immigration law became inextricably linked to the business of keeping Americans safe after the largest attack on US soil. That then extended into a wider emphasis, under Barack Obama, beyond those who posed national security threats, and on to immigrants apprehended at the border, gang members and non-citizens convicted of felonies or misdemeanours.

The dragnet became wider, the budgets became bigger, and due process started to wither. Trump then grew ICE into the largest federal law enforcement agency in the country, with a budget surpassing most of the world’s militaries. And he imbued the agency with a supreme mandate of saving the US from existential threat, a sort of praetorian guard vested with his executive power.

To get where the US is today, you also need an unhinged rightwing media to do the work of scaremongering and priming the public, relentlessly banging the drum on illegal immigration and the threat of demographic overwhelm. And, relatedly, of course, the US immigration crackdowns are sustained by a culture of plain old racism. One that hides behind concerns for public safety, but is in fact a way to channel discontent about the reality of a country that is far less white than many would like.

Next up is a long history and engrained culture of military supremacy. The scenes of ICE officers entering neighbourhoods, heavily armed, looked almost indistinguishable from scenes of US soldiers abroad. So much of the mythology of the American soldier, who has infinite mandate to use violence overseas in defence of freedom and American values, can be seen in the propaganda around ICE. The merging of military and policing functions can be seen in the absurd arsenals of domestic police forces, with their drones, weapons, explosives, armoured personnel carriers and masked faces. And it can be seen in the personnel who move between overseas and domestic forces. The New York Times has reported that Jonathan Ross, the ICE agent who shot Good, served in Iraq.

I have been thinking about what it was about the ICE phenomenon that felt chillingly familiar to someone who grew up under repressive regimes. It wasn’t the deployment of huge numbers of forces, nor was it even the violence. It was the sense that anything could happen to anyone, not just those expressly identified as the legitimate targets of crackdown. The abiding experience of living with authoritarianism is the sense not of imminent assault, but of the constant possibility that suddenly, you could be in trouble. At a traffic incident where the officer didn’t like your tone, at a gathering that was deemed to violate a curfew and then forcibly dismantled, or even on social media where a mindless post could affect your ability to leave the country. It is a state of effacement of all civil rights, and a swelling of government into a volatile, capricious overlord, as safe or scary as the single enforcer in front of you who happens to be vested with its power.

The US has passed through that veil. But there are warning signs in the UK. The relentless portrayal of immigrants as a threat to safety and social cohesion. The same glamorisation of the imagery of crackdown, now a feature of government propaganda as ministers attend Home Office immigration raids. The same expansion of powers and discretion to the police to include ever wider definitions of what a public order infraction is, such as factoring in the “cumulative impact” of pro-Palestine rallies. The transformation of protest into dissidence. The empowerment of the UK Border Force, which now has the right to seize someone’s mobile phone even when they are not under arrest. The swirl of nativism that underpins it all. Throw in one charismatic and mendacious political leader, and a rightwing press amplifying all the necessary fever dreams of a country in crisis, and you are on a path to passing through that veil. It can happen in Britain too, just with fewer guns.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bede4ac4a19025032159aee24854f90fb8afe5a/804_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=6b77efdf7197ae29ced2ca17f4cdd35a",N,,2026-01-19 09:58:10.073253

A group of protesters interrupted Sunday morning services at a St. Paul church because one of the pastors works with a federal immigration agency, according to police.

At approximately 10:40 a.m., officers were called to the Cities Church in the 1500 block of Summit Avenue after receiving reports that some 30 to 40 protesters had interrupted services, according to police spokesperson Nikki Muehlhausen.

By the time officers arrived, the group had left and was walking down the alley, she said.

In a Facebook post, protesters said they went to the church to ask for justice for Renee Good because they had identified a church pastor as the acting director for the St. Paul field office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The church’s website lists David Easterwood as a pastor. Easterwood is listed as a defendant in a Jan. 12 lawsuit filed by the state of Minnesota to halt the federal immigration crackdown that led to the fatal Jan. 7 confrontation between Good and an ICE agent. He also defended ICE tactics in an earlier filing on Jan. 5.

DOJ investigation

Later Sunday, Trump administration officials condemned the protest at the St. Paul church, which is is affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention, a conservative Protestant denomination headquartered in Nashville, Tenn.

The U.S. Department of Justice said it is investigating. Department of Justice Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said her agency is investigating federal civil rights violations “by these people desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshippers.”

“A house of worship is not a public forum for your protest! It is a space protected from exactly such acts by federal criminal and civil laws!” she said on social media.

Attorney General Pam Bondi also weighed in on social media, saying that any violations of federal law would be prosecuted.

Nekima Levy Armstrong, who participated in the protest and leads the local grassroots civil rights organization Racial Justice Network, dismissed the potential DOJ investigation as a sham and a distraction from federal agents’ actions in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

“When you think about the federal government unleashing barbaric ICE agents upon our community and all the harm that they have caused, to have someone serving as a pastor who oversees these ICE agents, is almost unfathomable to me,” said Armstrong, who added she is an ordained reverend. “If people are more concerned about someone coming to a church on a Sunday and disrupting business as usual than they are about the atrocities that we are experiencing in our community, then they need to check their theology and the need to check their hearts.”

Cities Church did not respond to a phone call or emailed request for comment Sunday evening, and Easterwood’s personal contact information could not immediately be located.

Easterwood did not lead the part of the service that was livestreamed, and it was unclear if he was present at the church Sunday.

Easterwood’s earlier statements

In a Jan. 5 court filing, Easterwood defended ICE’s tactics in Minnesota such as swapping license plates and spraying protesters with chemical irritants. He wrote that federal agents were experiencing increased threats and aggression and crowd control devices like flash-bang grenades were important to protect against violent attacks. He testified that he was unaware of agents “knowingly targeting or retaliating against peaceful protesters or legal observers with less lethal munitions and/or crowd control devices.”

“Agitators aren’t just targeting our officers. Now they’re targeting churches, too,” the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency stated. “They’re going from hotel to hotel, church to church, hunting for federal law enforcement who are risking their lives to protect Americans.”

Black Lives Matter Minnesota co-founder Monique Cullars-Doty said that the DOJ’s prosecution was misguided.

Whipple, located near the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, has become a key spot for clashes between protesters and federal agents.
The agents became argumentative when health care workers requested to see their warrants, but they eventually left the hospital, he said.
Some health care workers are holding news conferences to denounce the tactics.
Health officials say they are limited in how they can respond.","The arrival of thousands of federal immigration agents has altered life in Minneapolis and St. Paul in ways large and small, including in the corridors of hospitals serving the Twin Cities.

The sheer presence of the agents, sometimes in uniform, sometimes in plainclothes, has been enough to unnerve health care workers, who were already straining under conditions some have compared with those of the coronavirus pandemic.

In interviews, nurses, doctors and other health care workers said the crisis conditions brought on by the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown are wearing down overworked and understaffed medical institutions, and deteriorating patients’ trust in what are supposed to be safe havens.

“Any medical center or hospital is supposed to be a place of healing,” said Dr. Brian Muthyala, a physician at the hospital systems Hennepin Healthcare and M Health Fairview. “It is a place where people go when they are at their most vulnerable, when they are hurt or scared or in need of care, and any presence that disrupts that environment is harmful.”

Officials with the Homeland Security Department said that they do not conduct operations in hospitals. “We go in if there is an active danger to public safety,” said Tricia McLaughlin, an agency spokeswoman.

Health care workers, however, describe a different reality, saying agents have broken hospital protocol, refused to provide documentation and, in some cases, gotten into shouting matches with doctors and nurses.

Over his 20 years as an emergency medicine physician, Dr. Robert LeFevere said, he had encountered law enforcement officers coming in with shooting victims and other patients.

“But federal agents barging into patient care areas trying to question or detain patients — I’ve never seen anything like that before,” said Dr. LeFevere, who works at Regions Hospital, a few blocks from the State Capitol in St. Paul.

Health officials for three of the state’s major health systems, which oversee medical centers and clinics where agents have been spotted, declined to comment on federal activity in their hospitals, but stressed that they do not help enforce immigration laws and that federal officers are expected to follow the law and medical facilities’ safety protocols.

Federal immigration officers, like all law enforcement agents, are allowed to enter hospitals, clinics and other medical institutions if they are accompanying a patient in their custody and cannot be restricted from accessing public areas. But hospital officials said they do not allow immigration officers into private spaces, such as patient rooms and care units, without judicial warrants and that security officers escort them and limit their searches to the terms of those warrants.

“To be clear: We do not allow ICE to circulate in our facilities,” said Aimée Jordan, a spokeswoman with Fairview Health Services and M Health Fairview, which oversees about 10 hospitals in Minnesota. “Our clinics and hospitals remain places where people can seek care without fear. Even in uncertain times — especially in uncertain times — that commitment does not change.”

One health official said that over the past week, agents had brought in about two dozen patients to M Health Fairview Southdale Hospital, which is the closest medical center to the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, a multiagency facility that includes a holding area for immigrant detainees. Whipple, located near the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, has become a key spot for clashes between protesters and federal agents.

Two nurses, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss patient care, described witnessing a confrontation between health care workers and federal agents last weekend that devolved into a screaming match in a hallway at Hennepin Healthcare System in Minneapolis.

A crowd of nurses and physicians, many in scrubs and medical gear, tried to stop the agents from shackling a severely injured man to his bedside, they said. Acquaintances in the patient’s neighborhood said they knew little about the man, except that he was a roofer and did not have family in the United States.

Hennepin County lawyers have filed a legal petition on behalf of the patient contesting his confinement by ICE, according to documents filed in a Federal District Court in Minnesota. Jeanette Boerner, the director of Adult Representation Services at Hennepin County, declined to comment on the specifics of the pending litigation.

D.H.S. officials and a lawyer representing the agency did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the episode or the man’s immigration case. Homeland security officials have until Tuesday to respond to the man’s legal petition.

The patient remains in the hospital, and agents have been rotating in and out of the facility as they keep watch at his side, according to three health care workers who asked not to be named because they did not have permission from their employer to speak on the issue.

About 10 miles to the east, in St. Paul, Dr. LeFevere said there had been at least two instances at Regions Hospital when federal agents entered the emergency department, once through the ambulance bay and another through a back entrance reserved for law enforcement.

In both cases, it appeared that the agents had been trailing people with whom they had interacted with on the streets, but the individuals were not in their custody, Dr. LeFevere said. The agents became argumentative when health care workers requested to see their warrants, but they eventually left the hospital, he said.

Dr. Loren Cobb, a psychiatry resident physician at the University of Minnesota and M Health Fairview, said she has been receiving texts and emails alerting health care workers that federal agents have been attempting to enter facilities on their grounds, including a children’s hospital. In at least one instance, the agents entered with someone in their custody, but in another, they were searching for a patient, she said. Staff and health teams have been reminded to follow proper hospital protocols, including not give away patient information.

“I am just worried it is going to escalate even more,” she said, adding that sometimes it is only herself and a handful of doctors on staff who are responsible for overseeing entire floors. “What happens if they inappropriately try to push forward? What comes next?”

Jeffrey Lunde, who serves as a Hennepin County commissioner and chairman of the hospital board of the Hennepin Healthcare System, said there were recent instances at Hennepin Healthcare in which hospital staff had asked federal agents to produce documentation as to why they were present in a private area or in a patient’s private room. Agents were not able to provide it.

“And that is where things get murky and difficult,” he said.

Nurses, doctors and other health care professionals across the Twin Cities had prepared for precisely such situations as they watched immigration crackdowns unfold in other cities over the past six months.

Jamey Sharp, a health care worker who is also a community organizer with the nonprofit Unidos MN, said his organization had trained more than 300 health care workers since March on patient privacy and knowing their rights. The group, which advocates social justice, said it had also helped to connect health care workers through Signal chat groups in hopes of tracking the activity of federal agents inside their facilities and ensure that rules were being followed.

But the reality has gone beyond the scope of their training. Many said they have been shocked, both by the actions of agents inside their hospitals, as well as the injuries that have required treatment as a result of confrontations on the streets. Some health care workers are holding news conferences to denounce the tactics. Dozens flooded a Hennepin Healthcare board meeting this month demanding that local officials provide stronger oversight in their facilities.

Health officials say they are limited in how they can respond. Though hospital staff are obligated to protect the rights of their patients, federal officers can argue that the people they are monitoring or questioning inside hospitals are a danger to society. Who prevails in that back and forth has largely been untested in the courts.

The tension is unfolding at the same time that Homeland Security Department officials are also reviewing the citizenship and legal status of staff at some area hospitals and across the country.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/18/multimedia/18nat-minn-hospitals1-bgqt/18nat-minn-hospitals1-bgqt-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 09:58:29.056374

Speaking to Fox News on Sunday night, Blanche said the civil rights unit of the Justice Department would not bow to pressure to investigate the shooting death of Minneapolis resident and mother Good, 37, earlier this month.

“We don’t just go out and investigate every time an officer is forced to defend himself against somebody,” said Blanche. “We investigate when it’s appropriate to investigate.”

“So, no, we are not investigating. And if there comes a time when we need to, we will, but it’s not now,” Blanche added.

Increasingly tense confrontations between residents and federal officers have erupted in Minneapolis since Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was fatally shot behind the wheel of her car while protesting by ICE officer Jonathan Ross on January 7.

Blanche also said that footage of Good’s death has already “been reviewed by millions and millions of Americans because it was recorded on phones when it happened”.

However, analysis conducted by Minnesota Public Radio (MPR) and APM Reports found that there still remain questions about the shooting, including why it allegedly took more than 10 minutes after Good was shot before she was given CPR.

According to the MPR and APM reports, ICE agents left Good “bleeding and alone in the car for almost three minutes” and “turned away a man identifying himself as a physician who offered to help”.

The administration of President Donald Trump has argued that Ross, the ICE agent who shot Good up to four times, was acting in self-defence.

Top Trump officials, including Vice President JD Vance and White House adviser Stephen Miller, have also said that ICE officers have “absolute immunity” for their immigration enforcement actions.

Meanwhile, lawyers representing Good’s family said last week that they have launched their own “civil investigation” into her death.

“People in Minneapolis and across this country truly, truly care about what happened to Renee Good on January 7, 2026, and are committed to understanding how she could have been killed on the street after dropping her child off at school,” lawyer Antonio Romanucci said in a statement.

Top Minnesota Democrats under investigation

Blanche also separately confirmed reports that the DOJ has launched an investigation into Minnesota Governor and former vice presidential candidate Tim Walz as well as Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, alleging the two Democratic leaders were “encouraging criminals to go out on the street and impede ICE”.

Blanche’s comments are the first time a member of the Trump administration has confirmed media reports that Walz and Frey are under investigation.

“No matter who you are, whether you’re a governor, a mayor or somebody out there on the streets assaulting ice, you cannot, under federal law, you cannot impede a federal officer doing their job, and that’s what we’re looking at,” said Blanche.

Responding to earlier media reports that the DOJ had launched its probe, Frey said he would “not be intimidated”.

“This is an obvious attempt to intimidate me for standing up for Minneapolis, local law enforcement, and residents against the chaos and danger this Administration has brought to our city,” Frey said in a post on X.

Walz, meanwhile, responded to the reports indirectly, saying in a statement: “Weaponising the justice system and threatening political opponents is a dangerous, authoritarian tactic.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ap_696da9a40bdaa-1768794532.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2026-01-19 11:01:35.484365

Front Street, the main business street in Nome, Alaska, about four thousand air miles to the northwest, is two paces narrower but feels just as wide. Usually, there aren’t a lot of cars or pedestrians on Front Street, and the buildings that line it, none of them tall, seem to lean back from it. More dust and sand and rain and snow blow down Front Street than vehicles drive on it. Standing in line in the cheery post office on West Front, Nome-ites talk and laugh and exchange news. On days when the sand is blowing, some have goggles hanging from their necks or pushed up on their foreheads.

Nome’s sand contains gold, and other minerals. The iron in it will turn white cars a dingy yellow over time. During drier periods, small sand ripples form in corners along the streets, like sand on the bottom of a lake. Since the discovery of gold here, in 1898, billions of dollars have been taken out of Nome’s beach and from the bottom of the Bering Sea, just offshore. With gold at more than four thousand dollars an ounce, the gold dredges move constantly back and forth on the water on calm days in early fall. Ungainly with their beams and pipes, the dredges look like tufts of Rust Belt infrastructure that have blown loose and drifted westward and finally tumbled onto this distant sea. Rainy days turn the sand and dust on Nome’s streets into a thin grayish silt. This is what a place looks like when its streets are paved with gold.

The city of thirty-seven hundred residents is almost as far west as you can go in North America. Front Street parallels the sea, whose storms and giant blocks of ice have sometimes beaten the business district flat. Gold’s current valuation is just one of many international factors to keep in mind here. The Russia-U.S. border, which follows the International Date Line, is less than a hundred and fifty miles away. Provideniya, a Russian town with a formerly large military base, is two hundred and thirty miles from Nome. Cruise ships from Europe that have travelled the Northeast Passage route over the top of the planet stop in Nome, as do ships that have followed the Northwest Passage across northernmost North America.

Along the Alaskan coastline, it’s about a hundred and ten miles from Nome to Wales, the continent’s westernmost point. From Wales, it’s twenty-five miles to the Russian island of Big Diomede, and fifty-two miles to the coast of Chukotka, as that easternmost district of Russia is called.

Starting in 1999, I used to come to Nome to do research on a book I was writing about Siberia. I wanted to go from Nome to Russia, a goal that involved complications and extra trips on this side. One morning, in a Nome café called Fat Freddie’s, I met Jim Stimpfle, Nome’s most famous citizen, a man of grand ideas. The card he gave me listed him as a director of the Interhemispheric Bering Strait Tunnel & Railroad Group, whose intention was to dig a tunnel from near Wales to the “Chukotka Nose,” the very tip of Russia and of Asia, and to build a railroad that would go up the coast of North America, pass through the tunnel (“Just forty-one miles longer than the Chunnel!” Stimpfle said), and connect to another yet-to-be-constructed railroad, in Russia.

Stimpfle became famous in this way: His father was a dentist in Washington, D.C., with patients and friends in the diplomatic corps. Stimpfle wanted to be a diplomat himself, but after he graduated from George Mason University, in 1970, he ended up in Alaska, where eventually he married a Native woman, Yaayuk Bernadette Alvanna, whose family came from King Island, which is off the coast north of Nome. He became a real-estate agent; he says he has been inside almost every building in Nome. Through his wife, he learned that Natives on this side—the Yupik and the Inupiat—remembered relatives on the Russian side whom they hadn’t seen since J. Edgar Hoover and the Soviet government shut down cross-border travel and communication, in 1948, creating what became known as the Ice Curtain.

In the nineteen-eighties, Stimpfle decided to devote his spare time and energies to breaching that curtain, reëstablishing Russian-American connections, and reuniting Native relatives. By September, 1987, his efforts to restart travel back and forth had got the attention of Alaska Airlines and Exploration Cruise Lines. The Wall Street Journal did a front-page article about this lesser-known border, and quoted Stimpfle. After that piece, more reporters wrote about him. They said that Jim Stimpfle, a local real-estate agent and a private citizen in Nome, was working to end the Cold War.

At the Alaska Aviation Museum, near the airport in Anchorage, a Boeing 737 with the logo of Alaska Airlines on its sides and the company’s emblem of a smiling, parka-wearing Native man on its tail sits with other mothballed airplanes outside a hangar. A plaque beside it reads “Historic Flights to Russian Far East: Friendship Flight, Nome-Provideniya; June 13, 1988.” On that day, Stimpfle and seventy-nine other officials, reporters, and ordinary Alaskans, including thirty Native people, flew in this plane for an inaugural visit.

Photos of the delegation show Stimpfle on board among other smiling folks leaning over the seat backs and talking and standing in the aisle. He had coined the term “Friendship Flight,” and as the president of the Nome Chamber of Commerce had been agitating for the idea tirelessly. Mead Treadwell, at the time a young Yale graduate who had already been involved in Alaskan politics for a decade, remembers Frank Murkowski, then a U.S. senator, saying to him, “Mead, I’ve been getting Stimpfle’s faxes every day for a year and a half.” Murkowski was just one of dozens of officials whom Stimpfle besieged.

After the Friendship Flight took off from Nome, it flew for about forty-five minutes and landed on the gravel runway at Provideniya’s airport. The cabin door opened, uniformed Russian officialdom entered, and a pattern began that would be repeated many times—the checking of documents, the standing in line, the triple-thump of passport stamping, the boarding onto not-new buses, the arrival at a dim official hall, the salty snacks, the sit-down banquets, the ryumki (shot glasses) standing in rows, the toasts being raised bezkonechno (without end), the mutual incomprehension, the unmoored good cheer.

I went up the boarding stairs to the plane and stepped into its open door. The passenger seats had been removed and benches installed along the walls. When you’re an airline passenger, knee to spine with your neighbors, you forget that what you’re in is just a big tube. The almost empty piece of aluminum echoed and creaked.

Stimpfle still lives in Nome and is still its most famous citizen. I went there in September, and he was the first person I called. Fat Freddie’s has closed, and Stimpfle now patronizes the Polar Cub Café, where he sits with friends at the same table almost every morning. Just beyond the café’s broad windows, the waves of the Bering Sea batter the granite riprap frontage. One morning, Stimpfle joined me at a corner table. I’d last seen him twenty-four years ago, an interval that has slowed us both. He wore a brown knit cap with a bill, a zippered jacket, loose knee-length blue shorts over gray sweatpants, and black running shoes. He is tall and strong-looking, and his blue eyes, which used to spark behind his spectacles and sharp nose, have grown mellow.

Looking across the expanse of sea, he talked about his first attempts to contact somebody—anybody—on the Russian side. He began by filling balloons with air or with exhaust from his car and writing messages on the balloons themselves. Then, on a strong east wind one day, he released a weather balloon that he had filled with helium. Attached was a capsule containing small gifts—tobacco, sugar, tea, and sewing supplies—and a message of friendship which a schoolteacher in Nome had translated into Russian. Stimpfle watched the balloon rise and move offshore. Then the balloon began to descend, landed on the sea, and bounced along the surface. A seal hunter who happened to be passing by saw it and took it into his boat. He opened the capsule, saw the notes in Cyrillic, and thought the balloon must have come from Russia.

By following the boat along the coast, Stimpfle tracked down the hunter, Tim Gologergen, and explained about the balloon. Soon afterward, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) research ship, the Surveyor, docked in Nome. Its captain had received an invitation from the mayor of Provideniya, Oleg Kulinkin, to bring his ship to its harbor for a brief visit—something that had not happened in sixty years. Stimpfle gave the Surveyor’s captain a message to pass to Kulinkin. The captain did, and when the ship returned to Nome he brought a message from Kulinkin to Stimpfle. That was the first success Stimpfle had in reaching someone across the strait. When the Friendship Flight went to Provideniya, a year later, he met the mayor in person. Tim Gologergen was on the flight, too, and found relatives in town, to whom he spoke in Yupik.

Stimpfle added, “I heard that Kulinkin was later murdered by the Russian mafia in the Russian Far East city of Magadan, in a hotel where I had stayed myself.”

In 1991, Alaska Airlines began regular service to Magadan and Khabarovsk, a city well into Russia, on the Amur River. For a while, the Russian Far East seemed like an extension of North America’s West Coast. Aeroflot began to fly into Seattle and Anchorage. Once, in the mid-nineties, in the Seattle airport, when I was on my way from Montana to Los Angeles, I talked to a man from Orlando, Florida, who said he worked for a Saudi-owned oil company at a site on Sakhalin Island where he oversaw an operation involving supertankers and pipelines and underwater infrastructure maintained by teams of scuba divers, who also brought up delicious crabs that he ate. He said the fishing there was excellent, even right offshore. He then got in line for his Aeroflot flight to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, boarding on the same concourse as my flight to L.A.

Trans-strait connections multiplied. In the fall of 1988, a pod of gray whales became stranded in an iced-in pocket of the Beaufort Sea, off the city of Barrow, on Alaska’s North Slope, and a Soviet icebreaker arrived and opened the obstructed water and apparently freed them—they were seen no more. Between March and May, 1989, a combined expedition of Russian and U.S. sled-dog teams trekked from the city of Anadyr, in Chukotka, to the city of Kotzebue, on the Baldwin Peninsula, with an airlift from Nome for the last stretch. An Inuit Quaker evangelist named Robert Sheldon led a five-man Native expedition going in the other direction, from Alaska to Chukotka, by snowmobile. They needed a helicopter lift over the strait, which by then was no longer freezing all the way.

Provideniya and Nome agreed to declare themselves each other’s sister city. Bering Air, a prop-plane airline started in Nome by a couple from Michigan, began flights to Provideniya and Anadyr. Direct phone service was established; previously, calls from one side to the other had to go all the way around the world, via Moscow. A group of Soviet Young Pioneers visited the Nome Boy Scouts. Stores in Nome put up signs in Cyrillic and began to accept rubles from Russian tourists, who had started to come. Later, the stores were stuck with the rubles when the Russian government would not exchange them for dollars or let them be brought back into the country. The stores made gift packets of rubles and sold them as souvenirs.

A charitable group flew a Russian burn victim across the border for care in the U.S. Dancers from Provideniya performed in Nome, and there was a game between the cities’ youth basketball teams. The local paper, the Nome Nugget, reported that, with the border open, three Nome-ites had found spouses from Provideniya. The story said that the Alaskan men liked how the Russian women dressed, in skirts and high heels at ten below zero.

Hundreds of Russian students came to the University of Alaska campuses in Anchorage and Fairbanks, and exchange programs took Alaskan students to Russia. Sylvia Matson, whose ancestors were mostly Finns, had recently moved up from Sandstone, Minnesota, to join her husband, who had found a job as a mechanic at Bering Air. Not only is her husband also a Finn, but his name is also Matson—just by coincidence, because both families, when they arrived in the U.S., replaced their complicated Finnish last names with Matson, after a transoceanic shipping company. When she heard about the exchange program with Russia, she pushed to be accepted for it, even though she was a part-time student and not really qualified to apply. An exception was made, and in 1990 she and four other Alaskan students began the fall semester at the State Pedagogical Institute of Magadan, the public university in that city about twelve hundred miles west of Provideniya.

Magadan had a deadly reputation in the Stalin era, as a hub for Gulag mines where political prisoners slaved sometimes to death and produced gold and other minerals in the process. Matson arrived in September and moved in with a host family in which the father was a doctor and the mother an engineer. The entire district was rationing food, and people did not have a lot to eat. She thinks the family got extra food because she was staying with them. She ended up spending more of her time teaching than learning. Russians who speak English tend to have British accents, but as relations with the U.S. improved there was a vogue for speaking with an American accent. The students and teachers with whom Matson practiced English for many hours a day could not get enough of talking to her, and almost wore her out. They may have been surprised to learn afterward that other Americans they spoke to assumed they had learned their English in Minnesota.

With other students, she went on excursions into the forest, or taiga, saw abandoned and crumbling Gulag camps, rarely ate in the dining hall at the Pedagogical Institute (whose food was “really challenging”), and joined in the parade in early November honoring the glorious October Revolution. The school made clear that the American students were required to be a part of the event, which turned out to involve not marching but just kind of walking down Lenin Avenue to Lenin Square and buying stuff from street venders. She got the impression that the Russians who attended did not really want to be there.

In general, Matson and the other exchange students didn’t have much to do but be American. People invited them to dinner in their apartments. “There were families that asked me to come just because they wanted an American in their home,” Matson said. “It was humbling. To be treated to a lavish meal, and to have their children put on a special performance for you. And the little girls would give you their favorite doll—it was heartbreaking, and you couldn’t say no. Or they would just gaze at you and want to sit beside you on the couch. They dearly wanted to give to you because you had gifted them with your presence in their home. It was hard for me to know how to navigate that, at age twenty-four.

“When I left, in mid-December, my host family presented me with a lot of gifts, and a fur hat, and I knew there was an expectation that I invite them to visit me in Nome. But I couldn’t do that, for private reasons. I disappointed them, I know, and we did not keep in touch. Now my husband is retiring from Bering Air at the end of this year, and we’re moving back to Minnesota. We just sold our house and sent a container of our belongings on the container barge down to the Lower Forty-eight. As I was packing up and throwing out, I put aside the gifts the kids and grownups had given me in Magadan, and I’ve donated them to the historical museum here. The Russian women always said I didn’t dress up enough or use enough makeup. I still had the tin of pancake makeup they gave me. Now the museum has it, along with my students’ notes of appreciation, and the kids’ drawings, and a Russian Soviet Republic flag, and the dolls from the little girls. The museum says that at some point it will do a display about the years when Nome was in friendly contact with the Russians, and I’m glad these things will be in it.”

My own trip from Nome across the border happened in August, 1999. I flew Bering Air in a tour group consisting of two couples and me. Vladimir Bychkov, our guide, who met us in Provideniya, is a Russian Army kid from Chukotka, born when his father was stationed there. A mild and competent man, he would later become Provideniya’s mayor, occupying the same office once held by Jim Stimpfle’s first Russian contact, the apparently ill-fated Oleg Kulinkin. I had travelled a bit in western Russia by then, and Provideniya looked like other post-Soviet towns, except that large parts of it were ruins. After the Soviet Union ended, in 1991, remote places like this had been left on their own. The city’s population dropped drastically, and many of the high-rises were empty, with their windows smashed out and small waterfalls flowing down their front steps. After a few days in the town, we travelled by Army vehicle and boat to visit Native villages and stayed in fishing shacks or tents.

About a year later, the mood in the region had changed. People were talking about Roman Abramovich, the oil-and-aluminum billionaire, who was running for governor of Chukotka, mystifying everybody. Why would one of the world’s richest men want to be the governor of this abandoned, farthest-flung part of Russia? But he soon began to campaign throughout Chukotka and give money to local charities, and in December, 2000, he won the election, replacing the almost comically corrupt previous governor, Aleksandr Nazarov. Abramovich then opened new businesses in Anadyr and set about spending more of his own money on bettering the lives of local residents. He and his team rehabbed housing, repaired roads, reimbursed residents who had gone for years without receiving their salaries, brought in ships carrying food and supplies, and paid for talented kids from the region to study in Alaska. Chukotka residents hung portraits of Abramovich in their apartments the way Soviet citizens once hung portraits of Lenin.

I became friends with Ken and Tandy Wallack, whose company, Circumpolar Expeditions, had arranged my visit. They live in Anchorage, where many of Abramovich’s projects took him. The Wallacks have worked on all kinds of journeys on the other side of the strait. When an American adventurer with time and money wanted to go up the coast of Chukotka and across to the U.S. in a Native umiak, or walrus-skin boat, to show that humans could have come to North America by boat rather than on land—a kind of sub-Arctic Kon-Tiki—the Wallacks found Native people to make his boat for him and guide him. The Wallacks also helped Fiat, the Italian car company, negotiate the Russia-to-Alaska leg of a publicity trip around the world in special heavy-duty Iveco trucks, and handled logistical problems for Philippe Croizon, the French quadruple amputee and distance swimmer, when he swam between the Russian and American islands that Lynne Cox had linked in her famous cross-border swim in 1987. The Wallacks speak only English, but they have a gift for understanding the heavily accented English that different kinds of people speak, and then repeating it in English that interpreters can understand.

At the request of Abramovich, who had hired them, and whom they remember as pleasant and unassuming, they found places to stay for the hundred and fifty Chukotka high-school students he brought to Anchorage in groups of fifty at a time. The Wallacks set up visits to public schools, trips to McDonald’s, and other American activities. “For some reason, Abramovich wanted them all to go bowling,” Tandy Wallack said. “So we found a bowling alley for them and got them started—none of them had ever bowled—and they bowled.” The oligarch came and went in his private jet and kept a spare jet in Anchorage in case another might be needed at short notice.

In 2008, for reasons as opaque as his intentions in taking on the role, Abramovich resigned his governorship and went elsewhere in his extremely complicated and tiring-to-think-about billionaire’s world. The charities he set up for the people of Chukotka continued to exist, supposedly, but the interlude of benign mega-capitalist visitation in this part of the world was over.

“It all just kind of petered out,” Jim Stimpfle told me, in the Polar Cub Café. “The time of druzhba [friendship] across the border just ended. I went back to real estate full time. My wife had got tired of my spending so much effort with all this Russia business. And there was all the corruption, and the shakedowns, especially the landing fees that the Russian airports kept jacking up for Alaska Airlines and Bering Air, who both finally had to stop flying over there.” Alaska Airlines ended all its flights to the Russian Far East in 1998. Bering Air continued to operate an occasional charter flight until service to Russia entirely stopped with the war.

Part of the problem was that most people in the Russian Far East remained too poor to come to the U.S. or trade across the border in any meaningful way. Russia also began to be perceived as too dangerous. There were stories of American sailors beaten and robbed in Anadyr, of Japanese nature-documentary crews arrested and then released only after all their equipment had been confiscated. On one of the Wallacks’ trips to Chukotka, in the twenty-tens, when they were helping to make a documentary about an Alaska Native’s search for her relatives, authorities in the village of Lavrentiya detained them and their crew for having forgotten some paperwork. One by one, the Americans had to appear before a judge, plead guilty, and pay a fine. Some of the Native people of Chukotka, for their part, had grown tired of the stream of evangelists from North America. A Canadian preacher made a video of Natives screaming and crying and throwing themselves on the floor during a come-to-Jesus moment that he had brought about. Other Natives found the video demeaning when it was circulated. A few neighborly gestures still occurred—in the winter of 2012, Nome almost ran out of heating oil, and a Russian tanker arrived in mid-January to resupply the city. But after Russia’s seizure of Crimea, in 2014, remaining civilian communication across the strait began to shut down, and it dwindled to nothing in 2022 after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Nome’s geographic internationality helped inspire Jim Stimpfle to work for Russian-American understanding and peace. Since February, 2022, it has motivated other Nome-ites to go to war.

Mark Hayward, a military veteran and a former Special Forces medic who moved to Nome in 2018 with his wife, was in the predominantly Native community of Savoonga, on St. Lawrence Island in the Bering Sea, on February 24, 2022, the day of the invasion. He had gone there as an employee of the Norton Sound Health Corporation to teach residents how to be their own first responders and save lives until victims could be air-transported to better medical care in Anchorage or Seattle. You can’t see Russia from Wasilla, Alaska, but, if you go up on a hill on a clear day, you can see it from St. Lawrence Island. “I’m ashamed to admit, I had checked out of the world,” Hayward told me, by phone. “But, when that invasion happened, I was so freakin’ mad. There’s the Russian coast, less than a hundred miles from Savoonga. If Putin can roll tanks into his neighbor, why wouldn’t he send a sub up here to sink a tanker carrying the oil that keeps my family alive in the winter? When I got home, I knew what I had to do, and so did my wife. She said, ‘You’ve read the news. Get your ass on a plane and get over there.’ ” He left soon afterward, intending to join the foreign-volunteer legion defending Ukraine.

I first learned about Hayward from an article in the Washington Post by Zachariah Hughes, a reporter for the Anchorage Daily News. (He is a college friend of my daughter’s; she put the two of us in touch.) Hughes had gone to Nome last winter and met Hayward in person, but by the time I went, in September, readers of the Post article had sent Hayward money to support his war efforts; one had even funded his return to Ukraine. While walking around Nome, I came upon and tried to make sense of the city’s former hospital building, which sprawls in an indeterminate shape and contains the offices of the Department of Motor Vehicles, a car-repair garage, a pawnshop, the Nome courthouse, and the labyrinthine workshops of Rolland Trowbridge, an enterprising man who bought the building and damaged his knee crawling around in its crannies as he rehabbed it for its present uses. Trowbridge is a collaborator of Hayward’s, and has assembled military matériel in his workshop for Hayward to send to Ukraine via the international courier Meest, which specializes in transporting packages between Ukraine and North America.

I found Trowbridge by asking at the pawnshop. He’s a tall and big man with a well-trimmed beard and mustache, thick, dark eyebrows, and no hair at all north of that. For everyday life, he wears work boots and button-downs. He showed me what he was working on: shrapnel-deterring body armor made of Kevlar fabric sewn with Kevlar thread on his extra-large sail-making sewing machine. (Trowbridge is a sailor who first came to Nome in his own sailboat, amazingly, from Michigan.) In other nooks sat a one-person motorized paraglider that has a range of a hundred and fifty miles and resembles something that Wile E. Coyote might use, and several intricate multifaceted handheld devices for jamming the radio signals that guide drones.

In the nineteen-eighties and nineties, Nome residents had joined Jim Stimpfle in his projects of trans-strait druzhba; now dozens of them, by Trowbridge’s estimation, are helping Trowbridge and Hayward help Ukraine. Nome-ites have donated supplies, labor, and money raised at benefit events. He showed me slides of two used yellow-and-green Mercedes-Benz ambulances that he and Hayward bought with the money they raised, and drove from the U.K. to Ukraine in the summer of 2024. His and Hayward’s main achievement so far, he said, has been generating power for a Ukrainian arsenal of Javelin missiles that lacked functioning ignition and guidance systems. He said that by tinkering they put together twelve-volt motorbike batteries with improvised wiring that got the Javelins’ circuitry to work. Then the Ukrainians took these high-tech armor-piercing weapons to the front and “started poppin’ tanks” with them, Trowbridge said, forcing the Russians to turn back their advance on the city of Mykolaiv, a maneuver that could have led to the encirclement of the entire Black Sea region.

He showed me shelves and tables heaped with black, shiny Chinese electronics that he was testing and adapting. “I happen to know a lot about which Chinese equipment is good and which is junk, and how to order the best, which the Ukrainians generally can’t. And you always need to keep buying more of it because drone warfare is changing every day.”

Later, when I talked to Hayward in Mykolaiv from my hotel in Anchorage, he texted me a photograph of a sea-mammal-harpoon point made of shiny steel that he had brought to Ukraine from Savoonga. He also has a motorized paraglider with him. He said he planned to attach the point to a spear and take it up with him in the paraglider so he can harpoon an Orlan-10, one of the sophisticated drones that are killing Ukrainians. “I’m in this war all the way,” Hayward said. “I’ve spent down my I.R.A. and run through my savings. If Putin isn’t stopped here, he will keep on going, and we will all end up living in his gangster world. I’ll give everything I’ve got to stop him, and if I spend all my kids’ inheritance and more helping to create a world where aggression like this cannot stand, that’s an inheritance I’m proud to leave.”

In Nome, Trowbridge told me that he is worried about Hayward. He said, “I’m afraid Mark won’t be satisfied until he gets himself killed there.”

Gay Sheffield, the Bering Strait agent for the University of Alaska’s marine-advisory program in Nome, responds to concerns about sea mammals, subsistence-food sourcing, and environmental change in the region. She also serves as the commissioner of the Port of Nome. The scientific papers she has written or contributed to get down to the real details of life in the area. As someone who has spent a lot of my free time removing debris from trees in the five boroughs of New York City, I was drawn to a 2021 paper, of which she was the principal author, about a “marine debris event” in the Bering Strait in 2020. The study reported that, over the past two decades, five hundred metric tons of seaborne garbage had been collected from the shorelines in and near fifteen coastal communities. Much of it was “industrial fisheries debris”—floats and nets, pallets, deck boots, and various other items “with Russian, Korean, or other Asian lettering.”

Kitchen trash, vegetables, roach-spray cans, air fresheners, bathroom cleaners, a Russian Navy sailor’s cap, disposable gloves, water jugs, food packaging, juice bottles, men’s body-wash bottles—all had sloshed around in the strait and washed up on Alaskan shores. The absence of tampons or diapers in the debris suggested predominantly all-male groups of litterers, such as tanker or fishing-boat crews. The study said the debris could have come from a foreign ship that sank—given the lack of information from the Russian side, who could say? It stated and restated that without meaningful international communication the debris problem cannot be solved.

Other papers that Sheffield wrote or contributed to considered a huge toxic algae bloom in the strait and in the Chukchi Sea north of it, the ongoing disappearance of sea ice, and a recent increase in maritime industrial traffic. I hoped to meet Sheffield, so I stopped by the University of Alaska campus when I was in Nome, but she was on a research trip. When I spoke to her later, she told me that the federal government is not focussed on what is going on in the region. “Only two federal agencies are still in Nome,” she said. “The F.A.A. and the post office. The Parks Service office is closed because of the shutdown. NOAA has reduced its presence. So that means that, basically, the citizens of Nome and the coastal villages are trying to keep track of what’s going on in the region by themselves.

“The toxic algal bloom that happened in 2022 was by far the largest event of its kind ever seen in the U.S.,” she went on. “It stretched for more than six hundred kilometres in the strait and the Chukchi Sea, and certainly must have extended into the Russian side. Ultimately, we have no idea how much harm it caused, since much of it was carried out into the open sea, and onto the Russian coast. A lot of marine animals died, but we can’t be sure whether it was the algae that caused it. Consuming toxic marine life would have caused serious health problems in the region. The warming of the water and the continuing absence of sea ice have consequences. A big one has been the increase in industrial maritime traffic. More and more Russian tankers are bringing liquefied natural gas from the Gulf of Ob through the Russian Arctic, through the strait, and down to China. The federal managers for our maritime resources may have stopped paying very much attention to the region, but the Russians and the Chinese and those of us who live here have not.”

At the Museum of the Arctic and Antarctic, in St. Petersburg, Russia, there is a model of the Earth about fifteen feet across that you can walk around and study from above. What makes it different from other big globes is that it represents only the top part of the planet, no more than a quarter of the total sphere—that is, the entire Arctic and a few degrees latitude below it. Mead Treadwell, who moved to Alaska forty-seven years ago to work on Wally Hickel’s campaign for governor, has prospered there in the pipeline and telecommunications businesses, held political office (lieutenant governor), and served on many Arctic commissions, forums, and institutes. He knows that top part of the planet as well as anybody. I missed him in Anchorage, but met up with him a week later in New York, at another place of convergences, the Explorers Club, on East Seventieth Street. His conversation centered on Alaska but swooped all over that top-view, Arctic-focussed globe—from the Bering Strait to Prudhoe Bay to Russia’s Taymyr Peninsula to Greenland to Iceland to Finland to Wrangel Island, that island beyond the beyond, north of Chukotka, where Treadwell made two expeditions in 1990 that qualified him to become a member of this club.

He agreed with Gay Sheffield that we don’t pay enough attention to our Arctic. “The Barents countries, like Norway, Sweden, and Finland—and also the Laplanders who inhabit them—know much more about their end of the Arctic than we do about ours,” he said. He talked about the natural-gas fields of the far north, and described a fleet of Korean-built, Finnish-designed liquefied-natural-gas (L.N.G.) icebreaker tankers that have spoon-shaped bows and pointed sterns so they can go bow first or stern first, depending on the nature of the ice, and transport L.N.G. to China from western Russia via the Arctic route efficiently and economically. (He believes we should copy them in moving our own North Slope L.N.G. from Prudhoe Bay by sea, rather than relying on pipelines.) Communication between the U.S. and Russia across the strait still exists, he said. On issues of marine safety, search and rescue, and environmental emergency, the U.S. Coast Guard in Juneau still talks to the Russian border-security agents in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, and vice versa.

On the question of what is to be done today, he doesn’t know. “I always say that citizen-to-citizen diplomacy opened the border in the nineteen-eighties,” Treadwell said. “And failures of big-country diplomacy contributed to its closing, which started with Putin in 2000. First, Putin discouraged regional governors from doing international relations. Then he told the regions that he would be appointing the governors, and the citizens would no longer be voting on them. Those changes took power away from this neighborhood of the globe. His rise is a lot of the reason the border shut down. I think we could’ve done more with other Arctic-facing countries to counter that shift in power and keep our neighborhoods healthy.

“But there’s always change,” he continued. “A delegation of businessmen accompanied Putin on his recent Alaskan summit with Trump. I don’t know what subjects were discussed. But a lot can be done internationally with mining, shipping, fisheries, energy extraction, and tourism in our shared Arctic. Just because our Russian border appears to be mostly closed, don’t think people aren’t thinking about and planning for a different future.”

In September, 2022, two men who lived in the town of Egvekinot, in Chukotka, decided to escape from military recruiters who had been knocking on their doors. The men filled a sixteen-foot outboard motorboat with supplies and containers of gasoline and set out across the bay next to their village, then braved the open Bering Sea. After several days’ journey, they reached St. Lawrence Island—U.S. soil. Somehow, they had avoided swamping, sinking, drowning, exposure, hypothermia, or capture by the Russian border patrol. Soon after they arrived, U.S. immigration officers flew over from the mainland, arrested them, and brought them to a detention center in Tacoma, Washington.

The office of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, in Tacoma, took their case, and by January, 2023, it had won their release. According to Nicolas McKee, the staff attorney who represents both men, one of them has received asylum and lives in Washington State. The other is waiting for a decision in Alaska, where he has a fishing job in a Russian-speaking community.

Some thirty-five thousand Russians travelled by various routes to the southern border of the U.S. and asked for asylum there in the war’s first year alone; many have suffered in long confinement and with uncertain prospects. As far as anyone knows, the two men from Egvekinot are the only recent Russian asylum seekers to have come from the part of Russia where the United States is so close that under the right circumstances you can see it. McKee thinks that anyone else who succeeds in crossing the Russian-Alaskan border, as his clients did, will also have a good chance of receiving asylum. ♦","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/695ea96e40e629c67c05020d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/r48407.jpg",N,,2026-01-19 07:58:05.528895

Protest disrupts church services in St. Paul

What we know:

Activists with the Racial Justice Network disrupted church services at Cities Church in St. Paul to oppose a pastor at the church.

Protesters went to the church because they say the pastor in question, David Easterwood, is also the acting field office director for ICE in Minnesota. The protest was documented in part by former CNN anchor turned YouTuber Don Lemon. Video from Black Lives Matter Minnesota also show protesters chanting during services.

""This cannot be a house of God while harboring someone directing ICE agents to wreak havoc on our community,"" attorney Nekima Levy-Armstrong told Lemon during his livestream, explaining why the group was at the church. ""I am a reverend on top of being a lawyer and an activist, so I come here in the power of the almighty God.""

Dig deeper:

FOX 9 can confirm a man named David Easterwood is the acting field office director in Minnesota. Easterwood is routinely named in DHS court filings. However, FOX 9 wasn't able to confirm acting director is the same David Easterwood listed as a pastor on the CIties Church website.

The other side:

Easterwood did not appear to be on hand for Sunday's services. But the church's lead pastor, Jonathan Parnell, did speak with Lemon.

Parnell said the protests inside the church were ""shameful."" ""It's shameful to see anyone interrupt a public gathering of Christians in worship,"" said Parnell. ""I have to take care of my church and my family.""

Parnell then asked Lemon to leave unless he was there to worship.

DOJ says they are investigating

What they're saying:

Sunday afternoon, hours after the protests, officials with the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division said they were looking into the disruption.

In tweets, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon responded to video of the protest by writing: ""We are on it @CivilRights, working with the USAO in Minneapolis. This is un-American and outrageous.""

Dhillon later added: ""The @CivilRights is investigating the potential violations of the federal FACE Act by these people desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshippers. Considering and investigating other related crimes as well. @FBI activated too!""

The FACE Act prohibits the use of force to prevent people from receiving reproductive health services, or exercising First Amendment rights at a place of worship.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox9.com/www.fox9.com/content/uploads/2026/01/1200/630/cities-church-protest.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2026-01-19 11:01:40.245097

But it did include statements from the White House and Department of Homeland Security that were not part of what Alfonsi had used before her story was pulled. Some of statements, which were carried in full on the “60 Minutes” website, were dated prior to Dec. 21.

“Since November, ‘60 Minutes’ has made several attempts to interview key Trump administration officials on camera about our story,” Alfonsi said. “They declined our requests.”

Alfonsi did not immediately return a message from The Associated Press on Sunday. She said in her email that the administration’s refusal to consent to on-camera interviews was a tactical maneuver designed to kill the story.

CBS says it was always going to air the piece

CBS News, in a statement said, that its “leadership has always been committed to airing the ”60 Minutes” CECOT piece as soon as it was ready. Tonight, viewers get to see it, along with other important stories, all of which speak to CBS News’ independence and the power of our storytelling.”

Alfonsi’s report was the second of three on Sunday’s show, with the lead story being Cecilia Vega’s report from Minneapolis about ICE enforcement efforts and the protests to its tactics.

The initial decision to sideline Alfonsi’s CECOT story became a flashpoint for critics who said the appointment of Weiss, founder of the Free Press website who had no previous experience in television news, represented an attempt by the network’s new corporate leadership to curry favor with Trump.

While pulled from the broadcast in December, Alfonsi’s original story mistakenly became available online. CBS News had fed a version of the newsmagazine to Global Television, a network that airs “60 Minutes” in Canada, which posted it on its website before the last-minute switch removing the piece.

That enabled sharp-eyed viewers to see what Weiss had rejected, offering the opportunity to compare it to what “60 Minutes” eventually put on the air.

The body of the story was unchanged. It included a brief clip of President Donald Trump saying the prison operators “don’t play games,” and one from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying that “heinous monsters, rapists, murderers, sexual assaulters, predators who have no right to be in this country” were sent there.

Alfonsi’s introduction was updated to lead with the Jan. 3 U.S. raid that led to the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, currently held in U.S. custody. She changed the end of the story to include the administration comment, including its explanation for not providing detailed records on the migrants sent to El Salvador.

The administration also provided photos of tattoos worn by the two migrants Alfonsi interviewed, including one swastika that the interviewee said he had gotten as a teen-ager not knowing what it meant.

The CBS-administration relationship has evolved

Since Weiss’ appointment, Trump administration officials have been more visible on CBS News, in interviews that she sometimes helped arrange. The president himself was interviewed by Norah O’Donnell on “60 Minutes” on Nov. 2.

The New York Times reported Saturday that after Trump was interviewed last week by new “CBS Evening News” anchor Tony Dokoupil, Leavitt told the network that “we’ll sue your ass off” if the exchange wasn’t aired in full.

All of the 13-minute interview was shown Tuesday, an unusual step for one of the broadcast networks’ evening newscasts, a half hour summary of the day’s big stories. CBS told The Times that it had decided to run the interview unedited at the time it was booked.

Trump has objected in the past to how his interviews have been edited — including releasing an unedited transcript of an interview conducted by Lesley Stahl of “60 Minutes” in 2020.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F70%2F06%2F796ff77b45da90fcc169f06ab782%2Fcorrection-media-60-minutes-trump-67068.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 07:58:00.868121

“This is somebody who has done more for the fight against Parkinson's than anybody I know,” Springsteen said.","The Boss lowered the boom.

Bruce Springsteen criticized the Trump administration's deployment of ICE agents to Minneapolis and the fatal shooting by an ICE agent of Renee Good in comments at the Light of Day Winterfest main event show Saturday, Jan. 17 at the Count Basie Center for the Arts in Red Bank.

“I wrote this song as an ode to American possibility,” said Springsteen while introducing “The Promised Land.” “It was about a both beautiful but flawed country, that we are, and the country that we could be. Right now, we are living through incredibly critical times. The United States, the ideals and the values for which it stood for the past 250 years, is being tested as it's never been in modern times.”

The audience broke into applause.

“Those values and those ideals have never been as endangered as they are right now,” Springsteen said. “So as we gather tonight in this beautiful display of love and care and thoughtfulness and community, if you believe in democracy and liberty and believe the truth still matters, you must speak out and it's worth fighting for. If you believe in the power of the law and that no one stands above it. If you stand against heavily armed masked federal troops invading an American city, using Gestapo tactics against our fellow citizens. If you believe you don't deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest, send a message to this president as the mayor of that city has said, ICE should get the (expletive) out of Minneapolis.”

More waves of cheers came from the audience.

“This song is for you and the memory of a mother of three, American Renee Good,” said Springsteen, who then played the opening notes of “The Promised Land” on harmonica.

The Springsteen intro was similar to the Boss' state of democracy speeches he gave during the E Street Band's tour of Europe last year, which also criticized the Trump administration.

President Trump responded by attacking Springsteen on social media several times in response, including sharing a meme that depicted Trump hitting a golf ball and striking Springsteen, which knocks him down on stage.

The Light of Day, which has been supported by Springsteen, raises funds and awareness in the fight against Parkinson's and related diseases. In accordance with Light of Day history, Springsteen was not an announced artist at Saturday's show, which included performances by Gary “U.S.” Bonds, Adam Weiner of Low Cut Connie, Dramarama, Remember Jones, Fantastic Cat, Williams Honor, James Maddock, Joe D’Urso and Stone Caravan, Wille Nile and more.

Springsteen first appeared on Saturday with Nile when he and Maddock joined the rocker for his “One Guitar.” The Boss returned to join Gruschecky and the Houserockers as they backed Bonds on “Jole Blon.”

“I knew they was going to start some (expletive),” said Bonds as he embraced by Springsteen.

“Bonds is (expletive) 86 years (expletive) old,” said Springsteen, 76. The Boss was instrumental in revitalizing Bonds' career in the early '80s by penning hits like “This Little Girl,” performed on Saturday, for Bonds.

“I got at least 10 more years in me, I know that,” Springsteen said.

“I love these young folks,” Bonds said. “I'm going to teach them how to rock 'n' roll.”

There was lots of rock ’n’ roll on stage Saturday night as the show lasted six hours, ending at 12:30 a.m. The nightcap was a performance of Springsteen's “Light of Day,” and then a rendition of Happy Birthday for festival founder Bob Benjamin, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 1996.

He's now confined to a wheelchair. Springsteen stroked his hand after singing.

“This is somebody who has done more for the fight against Parkinson's than anybody I know,” Springsteen said. “Bob Benjamin, let's sing for him.”

The Boss ended the show with an acoustic rendition of “Thunder Road” with an audience singalong.

The recent fatal shooting of a woman in Minneapolis by an ICE officer has further inflamed tensions surrounding the Trump administration’s immigration agenda, which have been present throughout President Trump’s second term.

Trump on Thursday warned of using the Insurrection Act following demonstrations in Minneapolis, but said a day later there was no reason to invoke the law immediately.

“I don’t think there’s any reason right now to use it, but if I needed it, I’d use it,” Trump told reporters.

On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed her agency is working on an internal review of the actions of the ICE officer that killed Renee Good.

Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz) also said Sunday that he believes “ICE needs to be totally torn down.”

“It has to be created in the image of what people want, right? And what does that look like?” Gallego told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “From my experience running in Arizona, in a very hard, hard state when it comes to immigration and immigration issues, people want immigration enforcement that goes after criminals, right, and focuses on criminals, and immigration enforcement that is actually focused on security, and not the goon squad that has come from Stephen Miller and Donald Trump.”

Gov. Abigail Spanberger moved swiftly on immigration policy in her opening slate of executive orders, rescinding a directive from her Republican predecessor that expanded Virginia’s cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The order repeals former Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s Executive Order 47, which required the Virginia State Police and the Virginia Department of Corrections to enter into 287(g) agreements with ICE. The order also encouraged local police and sheriffs to do the same.

Repealing Executive Order 47 does not terminate existing 287(g) agreements. Under their terms, the agreements remain in effect until they are suspended or terminated by either party.

Spanberger’s executive order argues that the policy diverted limited law-enforcement resources away from core public safety functions.

It reads: “This executive order rescinds Executive Order 47, which requires and encourages state and local law enforcement to divert their limited resources for use in enforcing federal civil immigration laws,” the order states. “Ensuring public safety in Virginia requires state and local law enforcement to be focused on their core responsibilities of investigating and deterring criminal activity, staffing jails, and community engagement.”

Under 287(g) agreements, state and local law-enforcement agencies — including sheriffs’ offices and police departments — are authorized to carry out limited federal immigration enforcement duties under ICE supervision. Those functions can include identifying people in jail who may be subject to deportation, serving certain administrative immigration warrants on people already in custody, and, in some cases, deputizing officers with limited ICE authority during routine law-enforcement work.

According to ICE’s website, there are currently 32 active 287(g) agreements in Virginia involving local governments, state agencies and correctional facilities. Five of those agreements are with state agencies, while the remainder involve local law-enforcement agencies.

Spanberger previewed the move in her inaugural remarks on Saturday, emphasizing her administration’s approach to immigrant communities.

“Our hardworking, law-abiding, immigrant neighbors will know that when we say that we will focus on the security and safety of all of our neighbors, we mean them too,” Spanberger said.

Youngkin’s original order declared that “Virginia is not a sanctuary state” and argued that the “nexus between illegal immigration and dangerous criminal activity is real.” The policy drew condemnation from immigrant-rights groups and the ACLU of Virginia, while Democratic lawmakers criticized it as a misallocation of resources that undermined trust between communities and law enforcement.

House Republican Leader Terry Kilgore said the decision to end 287(g) agreements for state police would make Virginia less safe.

“This decision allows criminal illegal immigrants to remain in our communities and commit crimes over and over again by shielding them from cooperation with federal law enforcement,” Kilgore said. “That is not public safety — it is reckless.”

Former Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares said the move was a “disaster for public safety.”

“Mark my words, there will be Virginians who will be robbed, raped and murdered as a result of this anti public safety executive order. No one should be surprised,” Miyares posted on X.

Mary Bauer, executive director for the ACLU of Virginia, said Spanberger’s executive order was a good start but that she now must end 287(g) agreements between state agencies and ICE.

“It is not the job of Virginia’s law enforcement agencies to carry out the Trump administration’s brutal and fear-based anti-immigrant agenda,” Bauer said. “(Spanberger’s) executive order recognizes that blurring the line between Virginia law enforcement and federal immigration agents not only diverts Virginia resources away from public safety priorities, but erodes public trust by terrorizing communities and breaking apart families.",https://www.virginiascope.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC_0400-scaled.jpeg,N,,2026-01-19 07:58:09.635315

In Doe v. HHS (5th Cir. Jan. 16, 2026), Dr. John Doe—a physician challenging an Adverse Action Report (“AAR”) lodged in the National Practitioner Data Bank—sought reconsideration from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) of a prior refusal to remove the AAR. HHS denied the request with a terse rationale: that Doe was “not eligible for additional administrative review.”

After Doe sued under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) in the Eastern District of Texas, HHS defended on a different theory: that it denied reconsideration on the merits because Doe failed to identify new evidence sufficient to reopen. The district court dismissed the APA claim, treating the denial as effectively unreviewable because Doe had not presented new evidence.

The Fifth Circuit reversed and remanded, holding that HHS’s shift in rationale violated the Chenery principle: a reviewing court may assess agency action only on the grounds the agency itself invoked in the administrative record.

Key issues

Whether HHS may defend an agency decision on a litigation rationale different from the rationale stated in the final agency action.

Whether HHS’s stated “ineligibility” ground was consistent with its own guidance governing reconsideration.

What remedy is appropriate when Chenery is violated at the motion-to-dismiss stage in an APA case.

Parties

Plaintiff–Appellant: John Doe, M.D., Ph.D.

Defendant–Appellee: United States Department of Health and Human Services

2. Summary of the Opinion

The Fifth Circuit held that HHS’s litigation position—asserting a merits-based denial for lack of new evidence—could not be used to uphold an agency action that, on its face, denied relief because Doe was “not eligible” for reconsideration. Applying SEC v. Chenery Corp, the court ruled that it could not credit post hoc rationalizations offered by agency counsel.

The court further observed that HHS’s own guidance contemplated that upon a reconsideration request, the agency would either affirm the prior decision or issue a revised final decision—yet HHS instead declared Doe “not eligible” for reconsideration, a position the court said was “not true” under the guidance language. The Fifth Circuit therefore reversed the dismissal of the APA claim and remanded for further proceedings.

3. Analysis

A. Precedents Cited

1) SEC v. Chenery Corp, 332 U.S. 194 (1947)

The decision rests on Chenery’s “simple but fundamental rule” that a court must judge an agency action “solely by the grounds invoked by the agency.” In Doe v. HHS, that meant the court could not affirm (or sustain a dismissal premised on) a rationale HHS did not provide to Doe in the administrative record. The operative ground was “not eligible for additional administrative review,” not “we reviewed your new evidence and reject it on the merits.”

2) Calcutt v. FDIC, 598 U.S. 623 (2023) (per curiam)

The Fifth Circuit used Calcutt v. FDIC to reinforce the modern Supreme Court’s insistence that courts are “powerless” to affirm agency action by “substituting” a better rationale when the agency’s own reasoning is “inadequate or improper.” Here, the district court’s approach—accepting the litigation theory that the denial rested on lack of new evidence—was functionally a substitution of grounds inconsistent with Calcutt’s instruction.

3) Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156 (1962)

Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States supplies the more specific administrative-law admonition that appellate courts may not accept “post hoc rationalizations” and that an agency order must be upheld, if at all, on the basis articulated by the agency itself. The Fifth Circuit treated HHS’s merits-based defense on appeal as exactly the sort of post hoc rationalization Burlington forbids.

4) McLouth Steel Prods. Corp. v. Thomas, 838 F.2d 1317 (D.C. Cir. 1988)

The panel cited McLouth Steel Prods. Corp. v. Thomas in connection with the proposition that agencies must adhere to mandatory procedural language in their own guidance (or at least must supply a lawful explanation if they depart from it). The Fifth Circuit invoked this authority while noting HHS’s guidance describing what happens after a reconsideration request—suggesting HHS did not do what it promised it would do.

5) Prior litigation involving Doe and the AAR

The opinion situates the dispute against extensive prior proceedings where Doe tried to remove the AAR, including:

Doe v. Rogers, 139 F. Supp. 3d 120 (D.D.C. 2015) (“Doe I”)

[Doe] v. Rogers, 656 F. Supp. 3d 78 (D.D.C. 2023) (“Doe II”), aff’d sub nom. Doe v. Rodgers, No. 20-5297, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 3540 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 14, 2023) (“Doe III”), cert. denied, 144 S. Ct. 328 (2023)

[Doe] v. Peconic Bay Med. Ctr., No. 181 N.Y.S.3d 884 (N.Y. App. Div. 2023)

[Doe] v. Peconic Bay Medical Center et al., No. 2:10-cv-05588 (E.D.N.Y. filed Dec. 2, 2010)

[Doe] v. Peconic Bay Med. Ctr., 59 N.Y.S.3d 310 (N.Y. App. Div. 2017)

While these cases did not control the Chenery issue, they provide the procedural posture for why Doe sought reconsideration based on discovery materials and why HHS’s characterization of what it did on reconsideration mattered for APA review.

6) Judge Haynes’s pro se deference authorities

In a concurrence in part and dissent in part, Judge Haynes cited: Maleng v. Cook, 490 U.S. 488 (1989) and Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519 (1972), emphasizing that pro se filings are construed with deference. Those cases informed Judge Haynes’s proposed procedural remedy (a limited remand to allow fuller presentation to the district court), though the majority resolved the appeal on Chenery grounds as to the APA claim.

B. Legal Reasoning

1) The agency’s stated ground controls

The majority framed the case as one where its “analysis begins and ends” with the agency’s stated rationale. HHS’s final agency action said only that Doe was “not eligible for additional administrative review.” Under Chenery, that statement set the boundaries of judicial review: the court could not treat the decision as if it instead said “we considered your new evidence and deny reopening on the merits.”

2) A guidance mismatch underscored the inadequacy of the “ineligible” rationale

The court found the “not eligible” rationale inconsistent with HHS’s published guidance. The opinion quotes the National Practitioner Data Bank Guidebook as describing two outcomes after a reconsideration request: “Either the previous decision will be affirmed” or a “revised final decision will be issued.” The agency did neither; it issued a threshold ineligibility denial, contrary to the guidance’s described process. That mismatch mattered because it made the agency’s stated ground appear factually and procedurally defective, and it prevented the court from accepting HHS’s later attempt to recast the denial as merits-based.

3) The district court’s dismissal could not stand once the rationale shifted

The district court dismissed the APA claim on the understanding that Doe “failed to present any new evidence,” treating the denial of reconsideration as unreviewable on that basis. The Fifth Circuit held that approach effectively relied on a rationale not provided by the agency to the applicant—and, indeed, contradicted by the agency’s own written “not eligible” statement. Under Chenery and its progeny, that warranted reversal and remand.

4) Remedy: reversal and remand for further proceedings

The court did not decide the ultimate merits of Doe’s APA claim. It vacated the dismissal and remanded so that the case proceeds with the agency action judged on its stated ground (or for further agency explanation consistent with administrative-law requirements). The remedy reflects Chenery’s standard solution: the agency must supply the lawful, contemporaneous rationale in the record, not through later advocacy.

C. Impact

1) Litigation discipline for agencies: the record must match the defense

The decision reinforces in the Fifth Circuit that agencies cannot pivot in court from a threshold rationale (“ineligible”) to an alternative rationale (merits-based “no new evidence”) to avoid review or shore up a weak administrative explanation. For agency litigators, the case is a warning that the administrative decision letter and record must contain the grounds the government expects to defend.

2) Procedural regularity in reconsideration regimes

Although the opinion is brief, its reliance on the Guidebook’s mandatory-seeming description suggests heightened scrutiny when an agency’s reconsideration procedures are framed in “either/or” terms and the agency instead chooses a third option (ineligibility) without explanation. Future challengers may cite Doe v. HHS when an agency denies reconsideration using a rationale that does not track its published process.

3) Administrative law, not NPDB merits, drives the holding

The ruling does not establish substantive standards for removing AARs or interpreting the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986 (“HCQIA”). Its precedential force lies in administrative law: courts in the Fifth Circuit will police explanation-shifting and require agencies to stand on what they said when they acted.

4) Interaction with pro se considerations (Judge Haynes’s view)

Judge Haynes would have affirmed the unappealed constitutional claims and preferred a limited remand to permit counsel-developed arguments to be aired first in the district court, invoking the deference owed to pro se litigants. Even though the majority did not adopt that procedural framing, the separate writing signals that, on remand, district courts may be receptive to fuller development where initial briefing was pro se—while still remaining bound by Chenery’s restriction on post hoc agency rationales.

4. Complex Concepts Simplified

Administrative Procedure Act (APA): A federal statute that allows courts to review many final agency actions to ensure the agency acted lawfully and provided a reasoned explanation.

Final agency action: The agency’s definitive position (often a letter or decision) that marks the end of the administrative process and is typically what courts review.

Chenery principle: Courts can uphold agency action only for the reasons the agency itself gave at the time it acted—not reasons invented later by lawyers in litigation.

Post hoc rationalization: A justification offered after the fact (in court) that is not found in the agency’s original decision.

National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB): A federal repository that includes certain adverse reports about medical practitioners; hospitals and other entities consult it for credentialing and privileging decisions.

Adverse Action Report (AAR): A report submitted (here, by a hospital) reflecting an adverse professional action, potentially affecting a physician’s career opportunities.

Reconsideration vs. reopening: Agencies sometimes allow a party to ask the agency to revisit a prior decision; such requests often require “new evidence” or similar showings. The key in this case is that whatever the agency’s standard is, it must be the standard the agency states and applies in the record.

The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a federal lawsuit accusing the Trump administration and different government agencies of using racial profiling to conduct illegal stops and arrests in Minnesota.

According to The Hill, the lawsuit names defendants including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol. Both agencies have a heavy presence in Minnesota, which is currently being targeted by unprecedented immigration-enforcement actions.

“Masked federal agents in the thousands are violently stopping and arresting countless Minnesotans based on nothing more than their race and perceived ethnicity irrespective of their citizenship or immigration status, or their personal circumstances. At the center of DHS’s campaign are Somali and Latino people, who are being targeted for stops and arrests based on racial profiling motivated by prejudice,” the lawsuit alleges.

“DHS’s crude dragnet ensnares non-citizens, including individuals with immigration status, without warrants or any lawful basis for arrest,” the lawsuit says. “And its discriminatory practices also sweep in numerous US citizens in the process, shackling them and scanning their faces while ignoring documentation of US citizenship.”

In court filings, the American Civil Liberties Union described the experience of plaintiff Mubashir Khalif Hussen, who claims to have been detained by immigration agents despite repeatedly telling them that he is a U.S. citizen. Both Hussen and the ACLU say that ICE refused repeated requests to inspect Hussen’s identification.

“At no time did any officer ask me whether I was a citizen or if I had any immigration status,” Hussen said. “They did not ask me for any identifying information, nor did they ask about my ties to the community, how long I had lived in the Twin Cities, my family in Minnesota, or anything else about my circumstances.”

After his initial detention, Hussen was taken to a government services building in Whipple, Minnesota. Only there was Hussen allowed the opportunity to retrieve and share a picture of his U.S. passport. He was ultimately released, but only after being shackled and fingerprinted.

Another plaintiff, 25-year-old Mahamed Eydarus, claims to have been shoveling snow out of a parking space with his mother when they were both surrounded by unidentified, masked federal agents. The agents did not present any identification but demanded that Eydarus prove that he was “not illegal.” During the encounter, the agents allegedly questions why Eydarus and his mother kept speaking in Somali.

“The government can’t stop and arrest people based on the color of their skin, or arrest people with no probable cause,” said Kate Huddleston, senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project.

“These kinds of police-state tactics are contrary to the basic principles of liberty and equality that remain a bedrock of our legal system and our country,” Huddleston said.

Catherine Ahlin-Halverson, a staff attorney with the ACLU’s Minnesota branch, was similarly critical of the federal government’s new tactics.

“ICE and CBP’s practices are both illegal and morally reprehensible,” she said.

“Federal agents’ conduct—sweeping up Minnesotans through racial profiling and unlawful arrests—is a grave violation of Minnesotans’ most fundamental rights, and it has spread fear among immigrant communities and neighborhoods,” Ahlin-Halverson said in a statement. “No one, including federal agents, is above the law.”

The US has sent hundreds of mostly Venezuelan migrants without trial to the facility, known as CECOT.

“Last year, the Trump administration deported hundreds of Venezuelans to El Salvador, a country most had no ties to, claiming they were terrorists,” CBS said in a programme description on the show.

In a segment of the show, correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi speaks with two Venezuelan men who were later released, and who described conditions in the facility as “brutal and torturous”.

The segment on CECOT included accusations of torture inflicted on Venezuelan deportees sent to the prison and raised questions about how the US characterised them.

After an attempted abduction left a couple dozen observers standing on a neighborhood street, one ICE vehicle circled the block, broadcasting a looped audio recording of a woman screaming.
There are some heartwarming videos of agents falling down (“ICE on ice!”) but we slip too, running towards or away from them.
Lake Street, a major corridor of immigrant businesses in the neighborhood, has been crawling with ICE vehicles every morning this week.
After Good’s murder and Noem’s announcement that the number of ICE agents in Minnesota would triple, everyone I know cancelled their social plans.","At 9 AM I fall in love with Amy. We’re in my friend’s old Corolla, following an Immigration and Customs Enforcement vehicle in our neighborhood. We only know “Amy” through the Signal voice call we’re on together, alongside more than eight hundred others, all trying to coordinate sightings throughout South Minneapolis. Amy drives a silver Subaru and is directly in front of us, expertly tailing a black Wagoneer with two masked agents in front. The Wagoneer skips a red light to try and lose us, but Amy’s fast. She bolts across the intersection, Bullitt-style, and we follow just behind, shouting inside the car, GO AMY! WE LOVE YOU! “I’m gonna fucking marry Amy,” my friend says. “You think it’s chill to propose over this call?”

You can’t walk for ten minutes in my neighborhood without seeing them: boxy SUVs, mostly domestic-made, with tinted windows and out-of-state plates. Two men riding in front, dressed in tactical gear. Following behind is a train of three or four cars, honking. Sometimes there are bikers, too, blowing on neon-colored plastic whistles that local businesses give out for free. Every street corner has patrollers on foot, yelling and filming when a convoy rolls by.

If the ICE vehicles pull over, people flood the street. Crowds materialize seemingly out of nowhere. The honking and whistling amps up, becoming an unignorable wail, and more people stream out of their houses and businesses. When agents leave their cars they’re met with jeers, mostly variations on “Fuck you.” Usually someone starts throwing snowballs. Agents pull out pepper spray guns, threatening protesters who get too close. If there’s enough of a crowd, they use tear gas. Meanwhile they go about their barbaric business: they’ve pulled someone out of their car or home and are shoving them into a vehicle, handcuffed. Over the noise, an observer tries to ask the person being detained for their name and who they want contacted. Sometimes a detainee’s phone, keys, or a bag make it into an observer’s hands. Everyone is filming. The press is taking photos.

Soon the agents are back in their vehicles. They pull risky maneuvers to move through the crowd and speed off. No more than six or seven minutes have elapsed, and another neighbor has been kidnapped. Observers are left to deal with the wreckage: tow an abandoned car, contact family, sometimes collect children. There are lawyers on call, local tow companies offering free services, mutual aid groups to support families after an abduction. Some observers stay behind to do this kind of coordination, and some get back in their cars or on their bikes and speed off again. If enough people get there fast enough, ICE might back off next time. At a minimum, their cruelty can’t go unchallenged.

I’m in my kitchen typing out “do swim goggles protect you from tear gas.” The AI search response that I’ve failed to disable tells me they can “help significantly.” I laugh at this ridiculous tableau. The local ACE Hardware store posted on Facebook that they’ve stocked up on respirators and safety goggles. What I once considered hardcore riot gear is now essential for leaving the house.

I live near the intersection of Chicago Avenue and Lake Street, two major South Minneapolis thoroughfares that mark the northwest corner of the Powderhorn Park neighborhood. My house is a mile north of where George Floyd was murdered by Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin in 2020 and even closer to where Renee Good was murdered by ICE agent Jonathan Ross this month. Since the Department of Homeland Security initiated “Operation Metro Surge” in December, there have been at least half a dozen abductions that I know of on or around my block. A nearby house of recently arrived Ecuadorians used to be home to sixteen adults and six children. Six weeks into the federal invasion, only eight adults remain.

Citywide, hundreds of people are being abducted from their homes and separated from their families. Citizens are racially profiled and asked for papers. Exact numbers on detainees are unreliable, but the number of federal agents is roughly three thousand. These numbers are similar in scale to ICE operations in other cities across the US, including LA and Chicago, but what’s new in Minneapolis are the extreme tactics that federal agents are using to repress organized resistance. The stories circulating online and by word of mouth are harrowing: federal agents surrounding observer cars to trap them, then smashing car windows and dragging observers out; agents spraying mace six inches from someone’s face or spraying mace into intake vents so that the inside of cars are immediately flooded; agents suddenly braking at seventy miles per hour on the freeway and forcing tailing vehicles to swerve; agents throwing observers on the ground, punching observers in the face, agents taking observers on aimless rides around the city while taunting them with racial or sexual epithets; agents holding observers at the federal detention building for hours without access to phone calls or lawyers. (This is merely how ICE terrorizes US citizens.)

What also feels new is the frequent candor with which ICE agents are displaying hateful ideology. Two days after Good was murdered, DHS overtly referenced a Neo-Nazi anthem in a nationwide recruitment post. Agents seem to feel empowered to say new kinds of chilling things out loud. One told an observer: “Stop following us, that’s why that lesbian bitch is dead.” (He was referring to Good.) A friend of mine was sexually harassed by an ICE agent, who called them “too pretty” to stay locked up while in detention. Another was shoved to the ground and asked, “Do you like the dirt, queer?” Sometimes the behavior is simply bizarre. After an attempted abduction left a couple dozen observers standing on a neighborhood street, one ICE vehicle circled the block, broadcasting a looped audio recording of a woman screaming.

In these moments the whole situation can seem ridiculous. The professional kidnappers step out of their flashy American cars with their special outfits on. They wave their little mace guns at us, but we’re not scared—we have oversized ski goggles! A particularly comic element at play is that we’re in the middle of another winter with wild variations in temperature, meaning that Minneapolis streets are covered in thick sheets of ice. There are some heartwarming videos of agents falling down (“ICE on ice!”) but we slip too, running towards or away from them. It can feel kind of slapstick, until you remember that they will destroy someone’s life today, and that they can kill you.

A black gloved hand reaches out of the Wagoneer window and begins to give a princess wave to us, then the peace sign, then a thumbs up. They’re mocking us. The agents stop their vehicle suddenly but Amy brakes in time. Luckily, so do we. ICE has been using “brake-checks” as pretense for detaining observers. Another observer car pulls up and my city council member steps out. He strides up to the Wagoneer, blowing his whistle. (Absolutely everyone is confronting ICE—I’ve encountered my old boss from the local cafe scuffling with agents, too.) Someone on the street starts filming and the bicyclist we know in the chat as “small fry” shouts at the agents to get out of Minneapolis. We’re honking. The Wagoneer idles for a few minutes and then takes off towards the freeway. We follow until they’re on the exit ramp. It feels good to watch them leave the neighborhood, but I worry about where they’re headed next. We drive towards home and come across another two vehicles with observers tailing behind. Lake Street, a major corridor of immigrant businesses in the neighborhood, has been crawling with ICE vehicles every morning this week.

Powderhorn Park is a middle-class neighborhood known for its May Day parade, replete with larger-than-life puppets and steampunk Mad Max vehicles. Artists and families live here, and young queer people, and many immigrants, most arriving from Ecuador in recent years. The past few summers, the block south of me has become impassable every evening as hundreds of my Spanish-speaking neighbors use the park for massive volleyball tournaments. Food vendors set up tables and families bring lawn chairs to watch the games. Last year, two women sold grilled chicken on the corner closest to me. My neighbor’s lawn became a kind of informal restaurant, where customers would sit at the warping picnic table and eat. I bought their chicken a few times, and it was awesome.

A week into the invasion my neighbor with the picnic table called to ask if I was available to come with one of the two vendors to an immigration appointment. The woman had been contacted by USCIS that morning and was told to come in at 3 o’clock that same afternoon. She was worried she could be detained on the spot and had a newborn with her. Several neighbors gathered to arrange a ride, but in the end she only wanted a lawyer and translator to attend with her. I heard later that at the appointment she announced she wanted to self-deport, trading a planned exit for the fear of being taken at random. Her sister, the other vendor, is still here. The Saturday after Good’s murder, she and I sit with a small group of volunteers gathered to talk about how to improve rideshare coordination over WhatsApp. She tells us in Spanish that migrants can’t use corporate rideshare services because there have been reports of Uber drivers taking people directly to ICE. Of the more than two hundred people in the rideshare text thread, half are citizens offering rides and half are requesting. “I like being in this group because I’m meeting so many neighbors I would not have met otherwise,” someone says at the meeting. “I hope we stay connected after this is all over.”

Powderhorn is the same park where, in June 2020, a majority of Minneapolis City Council members stood on stage and announced their support for defunding the Minneapolis Police Department. It’s also where more than 10,000 people gathered to protest ICE the weekend after Renee Good was shot. Minneapolis learned a lot from the George Floyd protests and it shows. Well before Kristi Noem announced DHS operations in Minnesota, the neighborhood got ready. It started with rapid response preparation in the park’s recreation center and legal observer trainings at a church. Then it was block-by-block meetings. Small networks that formed in 2020 were reactivated to distribute 3D-printed whistles and practice scenarios for confronting agents. When ICE deployed in December, Signal threads for local alerts quickly surpassed the thousand-user limit, and an extensive mutual aid ecosystem of grocery runs and rideshares emerged overnight. After Good’s murder and Noem’s announcement that the number of ICE agents in Minnesota would triple, everyone I know cancelled their social plans. Lots of people called off work.

What we’re doing now is this: The trainings have evolved into street medic workshops on protecting yourself from chemical weapons and lessons on digital security; there’s a meet-up to sew reinforced umbrellas as shields from mace and a collection spot for barricade materials. And this is what it’s like: Sometimes you’re chasing ICE off your street, maybe you’re buying groceries for a family, but a lot of the time you’re on your phone. Behind every actionable piece of organizing are hours spent coordinating in Signal threads, calling to check up on someone, scrolling live feeds. At night, over dinner, it’s all anyone can talk about. Did you hear? Did you see that post? Did you read in the thread?

I moved to Minneapolis in 2019 because I was looking for a mid-sized city where rents were still relatively cheap. I knew it was a place where people could afford to be punks and experimental artists and career anarchists. I also knew it was a city with “good politics,” whatever that meant to me at the time. The first summer I lived here, my new friends were going to northern Minnesota on the weekends to support Indigenous resistance camps opposing construction of the Line 3 tar sands pipeline. During Covid, they were standing in parking lots, distributing food and diapers, or defending homeless encampments from police. The uprising following George Floyd’s murder brought everyone out to the streets each night for a week. It’s simply true, I learned, that when you only work part-time, when your main expense is a $400-a-month room in your punk house, you have time to organize. From anarchist info shops to nonprofit worker centers, from the founding of the American Indian Movement in 1968 to the first formations of Anti-Racist Action in the 1980s, grassroots organizing undergirds the culture of the city in a unique way.

Trump officials have made it clear that Operation Metro Surge is as much about seizing migrants from their homes as it is about repression of dissent to fascism. But they seem confused about how exactly the dissent works, and about where it’s coming from. Tricia McLaughlin, Assistant Secretary of DHS, lambasted Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey, governor Tim Walz, and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison—all varyingly pro-cop centrist liberals—for their non-compliance with federal operations on X. “Sanctuary politicians like Ellison are the EXACT reason that DHS surged to Minnesota in the first place,” she wrote. Did she think the attorney general was out in the streets, throwing snowballs with his constituents?

One tactic of fascism is to shift the scales of political alignment: centrists become stalwarts of the radical left; moms become “domestic terrorists.” Everyone with a whistle becomes antifa. And actually, that last part is correct—or at least it should be. A general strike has been called for Friday, January 23. With luck, thousands of Minnesotans will join in on what many further left are already doing: stopping business as usual and withdrawing their consent from fascism. Among many things I hope for, I want to see volleyball games in the park again this summer.",https://www.nplusonemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/G-cR9YaXYAAlIzr-e1768686637747.jpeg,N,,2026-01-19 07:58:13.660095

A federal judge in Minneapolis cited the episodes in an unusually detailed ruling on Friday that found a pattern of misconduct by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and ordered them and other immigration agents to stop using excessive force against protesters while conducting their operations in the city.

In some ways, legal experts said, the judge’s order was fairly mundane because it merely ordered the federal agents to follow established constitutional law, permitting peaceful protests.

In other ways, it stood out.

“Extraordinary,” Michele Goodwin, a law professor at Georgetown University, said of the decision. The judge, she said, reviewed dozens of witness declarations and video evidence and found conduct “alarming enough, dangerous enough that the court has imposed a preliminary injunction.”

Protesters and state officials have for weeks been calling on the federal government to withdraw its immigration agents from Minneapolis, a movement that has only intensified since Renee Good was shot and killed on Jan. 7 by Jonathan Ross, an ICE officer.

In late December, the American Civil Liberties Union, on behalf of several protesters, filed a complaint against the federal government and its agents seeking to protect the protesters’ rights to speech, assembly and unlawful search and seizure.

The court order was based on earlier interactions that immigration agents had with protesters that did not gain as much attention as the killing of Ms. Good. The accounts described in the order were submitted to the court from declarations and video submissions from both parties.

Ms. Goodwin was one of several legal scholars and criminal justice experts who said the conduct of ICE agents during Operation Metro Surge, the government’s name for its immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, evoked the attacks by police officers in Birmingham, Ala., on civil rights protesters in 1963.

David Rudovsky, a University of Pennsylvania law professor, also noted the similarities. “I think about the civil rights movement in the South and how Southern law enforcement reacted with hoses, dogs and lynchings,” he said.

Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, called the judge’s findings “ridiculous” on Sunday in an interview with CBS’s Face the Nation and then blamed the protesters.

“We only use those chemical agents when there’s violence happening and perpetuating and you need to be able to establish law in order to keep people safe,” she said, adding that the judge’s order will not change the agency’s operations on the ground. “It’s basically telling us to do what we’ve already been doing,” she said.

Her agency was expected to appeal the ruling.

The case is the latest in a series of legal challenges across the country, including in California, Illinois and Washington, D.C., where civil and immigrant rights organizations have sought to curb the tactics of federal agents.

In Illinois, where immigration agents massed for several weeks last year, a federal judge issued a sweeping injunction that placed several limits on how agents could use force and interact with protesters. An appellate court later blocked that ruling, calling it too broad and too prescriptive.

The legal moves have come as the Trump administration pursues its deportation agenda, a cornerstone of the campaign that helped get Mr. Trump elected to a second term. For many, including in Minnesota, the immigration crackdown is the welcome fulfillment of that promise and should not be impeded by protesters.

The 83-page ruling found that “the record adequately illustrates that the defendants have made, and will continue to make, a common practice of conduct that chills observers’ and protesters’ First Amendment rights.”

Judge Katherine Menendez, who was appointed to the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota by President Joseph R. Biden, said that neither party requested an evidentiary hearing, even though the court made that available.

She also stated that she gave “substantial weight” to the sworn statements from the plaintiffs and noted that immigration agents involved in the interactions with protesters did not provide sworn declarations.

Rather, the defense depended on testimony from David Easterwood, who directs the Minneapolis field office for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations. Mr. Easterwood said he was not present at the encounters, but rather relied on “personal knowledge, reasonable inquiry and information made available to me.” Judge Menendez said because of that, she gave “considerably less weight” to the testimony of Mr. Easterwood.

In one episode described in the order, Judge Menendez concluded that federal agents likely were “simply fed up with the protesters generally” when they decided to violently arrest a man who was involved in peaceful activity.

“‘Let’s get this guy,’ one of the agents said, before they grabbed Abdikadir Noor, and threw him to the ground,” the ruling said.

While ICE contended in court papers that Mr. Noor was leading an agitated crowd of protesters as agents attempted to make an arrest, videos showed that he had pushed another protester away from the officers and held his arm up to urge other protesters to stay back, the court ruling said.

He was detained by ICE agents, taken to a federal building, shackled and put in a cell, and later released, according to the decision.

Ms. Tincher woke to learn that ICE agents had arrived in her Near North neighborhood in Minneapolis. She drove to a nearby home that was surrounded by agents to find out what was happening.

Standing about six feet from agents who had encircled the home, she said, she heard officers say, “Get back,” and “Take her down.”

Within about 15 seconds, she said, several agents had grabbed her and pulled her to the ground, then handcuffed her while she was face down in the snow. Witnesses said she did not physically resist agents or taunt or threaten them.

ICE agents took Ms. Tincher to the federal building where they removed some of her clothes, cut off her wedding ring, and shackled her. Before releasing her, they told her she would be charged with obstructing a federal officer. She was never charged.

In court papers, Mr. Easterwood said that Ms. Tincher had attempted to cross into the perimeter of the house and tried to push an ICE officer out of the way.

But Judge Menendez disagreed.

She also cited a number of incidents of ICE agents “gratuitously deploying chemical irritants at observers and protesters.”

Alan Crenshaw, 35, a Minneapolis resident involved in the protests, said he entered a restaurant and witnessed two agents “violently slamming a young Black man against the wall” even though the man was yelling in pain and telling them he was a U.S. citizen.

Outside, he said, he saw the agents push the young man into the snow for no apparent reason, handcuff him and place him in a car.

As a crowd gathered, Mr. Crenshaw said multiple people were being pepper sprayed with no warning. Agents drove slowly past, opened the car door and sprayed a bystander on the side of the road. Then, another ICE car without lights drove past and sprayed Mr. Crenshaw right in the face.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/18/multimedia/18nat-injunction-folo-04-fzpv/18nat-injunction-folo-04-fzpv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 23:58:21.745769

Whether it concerns visa status or Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity, the constitutionality of recent federal action is being highly contested across the country.

In light of this national discourse, a crowd of around 80 students, community members and professors gathered at SIU Simmons Law School on Wednesday, Jan. 14 for a lecture regarding ICE, immigration and new policies under the Trump administration.

Ohio State University’s César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández presented a lecture titled “Immigration Law in Turbulent Times” in which he describes recent events involving immigration through a legal lens. His lecture highlighted the increase in ICE raids across the country, clashes between civilians and agents that have led to shootings — like the fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month — lawsuits, mass protests, the recent addition of 75 new countries to the U.S. visa ban list and the overall confusion concerning the legality of federal deportation practices.

Hernández’s teaching and writing details the intersectionality of criminal and immigration law and his lecture at SIU focused on the constantly evolving legal landscape that surrounds immigration enforcement techniques.

Attendees were able to speak with Hernández beforehand and ask questions after his lecture.

In his lecture, Hernández spoke about Trump’s campaign, and how he specifically pledged to evoke a deportation operation similar to President Eisenhower’s 1954 military-style campaign aimed at ending undocumented immigration by deporting hundreds of thousands of Mexicans through mass raids and arrests throughout southwestern America.

Hernández detailed the non-fatal shooting of Marimar Martinez, a Chicago woman whose SUV allegedly struck an ICE agent’s vehicle in October of 2025, after which the agent fired five shots, striking Martinez multiple times. Martinez’s vehicle was “boxed in” by ICE vehicles during the time of the shooting, and is among many of the contentious incidents in which ICE agents have used lethal force while conducting raids.

“The head of the FBI called her (Martinez), a domestic terrorist,” Hernández said.

She was later charged with assaulting and impeding federal officers, but the government’s account was challenged with conflicting evidence, including body-camera footage and text messages from an agent. Federal prosecutors then dismissed these charges citing prejudice, which means the case cannot be reopened because of a weak or flawed case.

Hernández then spoke about the fatal shooting of Good, who was shot and killed by an ICE agent in January 2026 while in her vehicle as she engaged with agents during a neighborhood raid in Minneapolis.

“Good did not open the door. She did not exit the car. She continued driving it. First backwards, then forwards, then to the right. Then an agent, phone in one hand, shot her with a gun that he held in the other.” Hernández said. “The script repeats: Good is dead, and high level government officials say she is a domestic terrorist.”

Hernández also talked about the role that court case Terry v. Ohio plays during ICE raids. The 1968 Supreme Court ruling found it constitutional for police to “stop and frisk” without probable cause if they have reasonable suspicion that someone was involved in a crime.

Hernández said that Terry v. Ohio ties directly into a “turbulent time” on the west coast, with hundreds of ICE agents in the Los Angeles area. A district court in California recently responded to a lawsuit, Vasquez v. Noem (2025), that was brought by a group of people who were stopped and questioned by ICE agents. The plaintiffs believe they were racially profiled.

Hernández explained that the lawsuit, if successful, would prohibit ICE from racially profiling based on skin color, native language, accents, location or work/profession. A federal judge from California then agreed and issued an order restricting these tactics of profiling because it was a violation of the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court later paused the judge’s ruling, allowing ICE to continue those tactics.

Hernández noted that Brett Kavanaugh, a U.S. Supreme Court justice, is of the opinion that immigrants “often work in certain kinds of jobs, such as day labor, landscaping, agriculture, and construction, that do not require paperwork and are therefore especially attractive to illegal immigrants; and that many of those illegally in the Los Angeles area come from Mexico or Central America and do not speak much English.”

Kavanaugh was appointed in 2018, and has since written multiple court opinions about whether or not factors like race and ethnicity could be considered in immigration stops under the Fourth Amendment.

“How would an agent know that someone does not speak much English? How would an agent go about racially or ethnically categorizing a person?” Hernández asked, referring to Kavanaugh’s remarks regarding the Supreme Court’s hearing of Noem v. Vasquez. “Kavanaugh did not explain how agents were supposed to figure out those factors.”

Hernández explained that he and a friend, “just two brown-skin Latinos speaking Spanish” were having coffee.

“If we said one word to each other in English, it is one more than I can recall. If an immigration agent happened to be nearby, would they hear my conversation, not in English, and then decide that it must be because I cannot speak English?” Hernández asked. “What type of work would they decide I do? Would they assume that I am a tenured, full professor who holds an endowed chair at one of the country’s premier public universities?”

Hernández also spoke about the contingency surrounding the 14th Amendment, which states that people born of naturalized citizenship in the U.S. are citizens of the U.S. and that no state can enforce a law that can abridge the privileges and immunities of citizenship. Upon Trump’s second term, he challenged the interpretation of the 14th Amendment and what it means to be a “natural-born citizen” through an executive order. Trump argues that birthright citizenship should not automatically apply to children born to undocumented immigrants or parents without permanent legal status.

Hernández said that if this case is constitutionalized, “It will leave many of us without the U.S. citizenship we thought was woven into our legal DNA.”

In September 2025, the Supreme Court decided to hear the case. The court will likely not have a decision until mid-2026.

He closed his lecture with sobering remarks.

“We struggle to agree about whether what we see is real,” Hernández said. “We struggle to agree on whether the days are dominated by light or by darkness. We struggle to agree on whether the political storm in which we find ourselves is one of rejuvenation or one of decay.”

Hernández is currently the Gregory H. Williams Chair of Civil Rights and Liberties at Ohio State. Hernández has earned recognition as one of the top 10 most cited immigration law scholars in the U.S. Among being a scholar and author, Hernández is a former member of the ABA Commission on Immigration.

Simmons Law School Dean Hannah Brenner Johnson explained the importance of these lectures and continued conversations. She said the lecture was created in honor of the school’s founding dean, Hiram Lesar, whose work revolved around civil rights and public policy.

“I think at this particular point in our nation’s history, immigration is a very, very hot-button issue. So, it was very timely to bring a scholar in to talk about some of the constitutional issues that have arisen, and to also bring humanity to the problem as well,” Johnson said.

Attendee Sheila Simon, former lieutenant governor of Illinois and Simmons Law School professor, offered her perspective on Hernández’s lecture in an interview with the DE.

“I think it’s really important for them (law students) to hear the importance of conversation and the continued dialogue, and valuing the rule of law as a way to prevent violence,” Simon said.

The agents — wearing masks and carrying guns — raided five used-clothes warehouses, arrested more than 20 people and seized $176,000.

Three months later, as the cases head to trial, prosecutors want to ban any mention of ICE, masks or guns from the courtroom.

“The concern is that all this media attention surrounding these ICE shootings and ICE raids and things, they really strike an emotional chord with people,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Benjamin Lyles said during a hearing on Monday. “And the concern is that the jury would be triggered by use of ‘ICE,’ ‘masks,’ ‘firearms,’ and ‘yelling and screaming,’ and decide the case based on their emotions and ignore the court’s instructions to weigh the evidence.”

Jurors should focus on the facts, Lyles said, not how ICE conducted the raids.

Lyles summarized the government’s argument during a hearing in the case against Pedro Quintero Cardenas, 29, of Mission.

Cardenas managed Cardenas General Merchandise, which is located near the intersection of South Ware Road and Military Highway in McAllen.

Cardenas General Merchandise purchased used clothing from Goodwill locations in Ohio and Maine, according to documents filed in an unrelated lawsuit. The clothing is typically sold to customers in Mexico.

Agents raided Cardenas General Merchandise and detained 23 people on Oct. 2.

Twelve had tourist visas, according to the criminal complaint against Cardenas. Another 11 had no legal status in the United States.

“He admitted to hiring visa holders and undocumented individuals,” Mirna Garcia, a special agent with Homeland Security Investigations, which is part of ICE, testified during a hearing in October. “He also admitted to paying them in cash and not withholding taxes or Social Security from their paychecks.”

People with tourist visas can’t work in the United States.

“The business itself was an illegal enterprise,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Patricia Cook Profit said during the October hearing, “because it was employing these illegal individuals who had no status to work in the United States.”

A grand jury indicted Quintero on eight charges, including participating in a conspiracy to encourage non-citizens to illegally enter or reside in the United States. He pleaded not guilty.

Quintero returned to court Monday.

Depositions had been scheduled for 10 a.m. and the government wanted to prohibit Quintero’s attorney from mentioning ICE, masks, guns or people yelling and screaming during the raids.

“The jury has a right to know all the details — all the facts — of the case,” attorney Edelmiro Arredondo III, who represents Quintero, told a judge.

Arredondo said the details would provide “a more colorful picture” for the jury.

“The government’s position is that allowing all this ‘color’ that defense counsel wants into the depositions will seriously risk jury nullification,” Lyles said.

Mentions of ICE, masks or guns are “completely irrelevant,” Lyles said, to whether Quintero encouraged non-citizens to enter or reside in the United States.

“It’s clear, I think, that use of those words risks inflaming the jury, creating undue prejudice and jury nullification,” Lyles said.

It wasn’t the first time Lyles had made that argument.

In December, when a man accused of witness tampering requested a trial, prosecutors urged a judge to ban any mention of ICE or masked agents.

Attorneys largely avoided both topics. After more than six hours of deliberation, jurors found the man guilty.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Juan F. Alanis, who presided over the hearing on Monday, granted the government’s motion to prohibit “argument or evidence designed to elicit jury nullification,” but refused to ban any mention of ICE, masks, guns or yelling and screaming.

“If they’re with ICE, that’s a factual statement,” Alanis said. “If they had masks on, that’s a factual statement. If they had their firearms in use, that’s a factual statement.”

Alanis noted that he wasn’t present when agents executed the search warrants and didn’t know what, exactly, happened.

“If, for whatever reason, they felt a need — they had to raise their voice to get control of the situation, that may be just a factual statement,” Alanis said. “I don’t know.”

The ruling is limited to depositions in the case against Quintero. Prosecutors remain free to make a similar request before trial.

“I understand the government’s concern,” Alanis said. “The defense is on notice: If they decide to grandstand or go beyond just asking the straightforward questions, at a later date a judge may disallow that information being played before a jury.”

The client complained on to LeO and, after he refused to accept the investigator’s decision, a final decision was issued by ombudsman Hannah Logue.
Instead, she reduced the costs bill by 50%, resulting in an order that Mr Sufian refund £4,911.50.
This contributed “to a significant extent” to her decision that Mr Sufian had failed to provide reasonable costs information throughout his instruction, Judge Pilgerstorfer held.
The judge quashed LeO’s decision on the costs information and the remedy and directed it to reconsider them.","The Legal Ombudsman (LeO) has been ordered to reconsider part of its findings of poor service by a direct access barrister after it overlooked a key piece of evidence.

However, Marcus Pilgerstorfer KC, sitting as a deputy High Court judge, dismissed all of Md Abu Sufian’s other challenges to LeO’s decision.

Aside from the mistake of fact, he found neither procedural faults in the way LeO dealt with the case nor unreasonableness or irrationality in its decision making.

Mr Sufian, head of 160 Fleet Street Chambers in London, for ‘Client N’ on several pieces of immigration work, including two oral permission hearings in judicial review proceedings, preparing an appeal to the Court of Appeal – which was conceded before the hearing and led to an order of £16,350 in costs in favour of his client – and a successful challenge to directions to remove the client from the country, again with costs.

Client N complained to Mr Sufian’s chambers about various matters, including that the Court of Appeal costs were paid directly to the barrister. These were rejected, with the chambers saying Client N authorised payment of the costs direct to him.

The client complained on to LeO and, after he refused to accept the investigator’s decision, a final decision was issued by ombudsman Hannah Logue.

She found Client N had agreed that Mr Sufian could keep the Court of Appeal costs but went on to decide he failed to provide adequate costs information throughout his instruction, backdated one client-care letter, and failed to inform her of the costs award.

In deciding remedy, Ms Logue found that Mr Sufian received £27,210.50 but that Client N only reasonably expected to pay £17,298 based on the costs information provided.

However, if she ordered him to refund the difference of £9,912.50, that would have meant Mr Sufian receiving only 39% of the overall costs bill of £44,598. Given that the quality of the actual legal work was good, this would be unfair, Ms Logue decided.

Instead, she reduced the costs bill by 50%, resulting in an order that Mr Sufian refund £4,911.50.

The barrister brought a judicial review on multiple grounds and the only successful element was over one piece of work for which LeO said he did not provide costs information when in fact the client-care letter had expressly quoted a fee of £7,500.

LeO accepted that the evidence pack Ms Logue had used was missing the relevant page and that this amounted to a mistake of existing fact.

This contributed “to a significant extent” to her decision that Mr Sufian had failed to provide reasonable costs information throughout his instruction, Judge Pilgerstorfer held.

Further, it affected the decision on remedy. Under Ms Logue’s original methodology, adding £7,500 to the fees Client N reasonably expected to pay would have meant Mr Sufian was only overpaid by £2,412.50. Given that, she may well have stuck with that approach.

The judge quashed LeO’s decision on the costs information and the remedy and directed it to reconsider them.",https://www.legalfutures.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Marcus-Pilgerstorfer-KC.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 19:58:10.010092

Several particularly relevant human rights that would feature in a national Human Rights Act include: The right to health: this right would ensure everyone has access to safe and affordable healthcare.","Did you know that Australia has no national human rights framework? Australia has been a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights since 1948, but this has never been adopted into Australian law.

There are state and territory-based human rights charters in Queensland, Victoria and the ACT, with legislation introduced in NSW in October 2025. However, these do not bind our federal government and are not necessarily very effective in enforcing human rights. Governments remain able to have the final say without oversight on whether a law or decision will infringe on a person or group’s human rights.

The national campaign for a Human Rights Act is well underway, and the ANMF has signed onto this campaign as a supporter. So, what would a national Human Rights Act look like, and how would it operate?

History of the campaign

There have been several attempts to launch a Human Rights Act in previous decades, the most recent of which occurred during the Rudd government. The concept of enshrining human rights on a national level appears inherently good, but the campaign has historically failed due to a lack of political will. After all, a large part of a Human Rights Act would be to require governments to consider human rights when making laws and decisions.

What will a Human Rights Act do?

Put simply, a Human Rights Act would do three core things:

Hold our governments accountable.

Consolidate and promote our national values of equality and non-discrimination.

Align our laws with our international obligations and provide legal clarity.

In doing these three things, a Human Rights Act would allow everyone in Australia to look to a set of rights that encapsulates our values and provides an understanding of what people can and cannot do, consistent with a rights-based framework.

Given the federal government makes laws and decisions in relation to key areas like immigration, childcare, aged care, welfare, taxation, and some aspects of health and housing, it is important they are bound by a human rights framework. A Human Rights Act would make sure the government considers our human rights and acts without breaching them. Key examples where a human rights framework would have impacted and potentially prevented poor decision-making include the Robodebt crisis or the use of indefinite immigration detention.

Finally, a Human Rights Act would enable the enforcement of our rights by the courts and prosecutions when they are breached. Individuals or groups would have a clear framework by which they can assess whether their rights have been breached and strong enforcement mechanisms to ensure those breaches do not continue.

How will a Human Rights Act impact ANMF members and patients?

Several particularly relevant human rights that would feature in a national Human Rights Act include:

The right to health: this right would ensure everyone has access to safe and affordable healthcare. It also ensures the underlying determinants of health including environment and work facilitate a person’s good health. This right in particular would have huge impacts for our members and patients across the health system, ensuring healthcare is delivered in a safe environment and at a high quality by appropriately qualified people.

The right to an adequate standard of living: this right would guide housing policy to ensure it is available and affordable, particularly for public and social housing. It would also impact welfare policy to ensure that our society’s most vulnerable are able to have dignity in their lives.

The right to privacy: in an increasingly digitised world, this right would ensure everyone has their privacy and data protected.

The right to education: this right operates to ensure education is readily accessible and affordable for everyone.

The right to freedom of association: this right enshrines the right for you as our members to be part of a trade union.

The right to work: this right ensures that everyone is able to meaningfully gain a living from employment and enjoy favourable conditions at work. Clearly, this is core business for the ANMF!

The arguments for a national Human Rights Act are resounding, and the ANMF is advocating for it to be added to the Albanese government’s legislative agenda.",https://anmj.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/HumanRightsWEB.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 23:58:10.854138
,Agencies,2026-01-19 00:03:51+00:00,CNN,Aftermath video of latest ICE shooting in Minneapolis involving an undocumented ... - CNN,"Diego Mendoza, Caroll Alvarado, Alaa Elassar",,,,,https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/18/us/ice-agent-shooting-video-minneapolis,"But videos from Sosa-Celis’ family appear to tell a different story.
Exactly one week earlier, an ICE agent in Minneapolis shot and killed Renee Good, a mother of three, in her vehicle.
In the video, the family tells a 911 dispatcher that agents shot Sosa-Celis as he tried to enter his home.
In the Thursday statement from DHS, ICE said the agent who shot Sosa-Celis did so after chasing him on foot after Sosa-Celis crashed into a parked car.
Once we were inside, they shot at Julio.’” After ICE shot and then detained Sosa-Celis, Sosa-Celis joined a Facebook livestream while in the hospital.","Newly obtained videos of the moments right after the Wednesday incident in which an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot a Venezuelan man in the leg in Minneapolis appear to contradict at least some of ICE’s claims about events leading up to the shooting.

In a statement Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security said the agent targeted, chased and then shot the man in self-defense as the agent was being “ambushed” by three people. But accounts in the videos contradict the identity of the person DHS says federal agents chased, and the details of the shooting itself.

According to DHS, federal agents were conducting a “targeted traffic stop” when, they say, Julio Sosa-Celis, an undocumented Venezuelan national, resisted arrest and started to “violently assault” one of its officers. During the struggle, DHS said in the statement, two additional people came out of a nearby apartment and attacked the officer using a snow shovel and a broom handle.

According to DHS, Sosa-Celis “got loose” and began striking an agent “with a shovel or broom stick.” DHS says the agent then “fired a defensive shot,” which hit Sosa-Celis in the leg.

The three people who allegedly assaulted the officer ran into the apartment building and barricaded themselves before agents arrested all three, DHS said.

But videos from Sosa-Celis’ family appear to tell a different story. One of them shows a video call made by Sosa-Celis’ partner and reviewed by CNN, frantically describing to family members what she says happened, according to Alicia Celis, the mother of Sosa-Celis, who spoke to CNN.

The call appears to contradict ICE’s claims in DHS’ Thursday statement. There, ICE said it was Sosa-Celis who was driving a vehicle that crashed, and Sosa-Celis who fled on foot before agents struggled with him on the ground.

In the call, Sosa-Celis’ partner seems to say the driver of the car was not Sosa-Celis, but Alfredo Alejandro Aljorna — another man ICE detained during the same raid.

“Julio arrived first. They were chasing Alfredo — he had to jump from his car,” Sosa-Celis’ partner says during the call. “He ran and they threw themselves on top of him. After, Julio threw open the door, and they shot.”

The incident marks the second time in a week an immigration agent shot someone while on the job, sparking heated clashes in Minnesota and prompting President Donald Trump to threaten to use the Insurrection Act. Exactly one week earlier, an ICE agent in Minneapolis shot and killed Renee Good, a mother of three, in her vehicle.

Sosa-Celis was taken to an ambulance and hospitalized; the city of Minneapolis confirmed he had non-life-threatening injuries. CNN has contacted city officials to determine whether he is still hospitalized.

In a statement to CNN on Saturday, DHS stood by its initial statement that the subject of the raid on Wednesday was Sosa-Celis and that he was driving the vehicle.

The family’s version of events, heard in a livestreamed Facebook video when family members frantically called 911 to ask for help, also differs from DHS’ statement.

In the video, the family tells a 911 dispatcher that agents shot Sosa-Celis as he tried to enter his home.

“They were following my husband for about 30 minutes. They were trying to crash into him. He arrived at home and because we closed the door on them, they shot him!” a woman can be heard telling the dispatcher. It’s not clear who is speaking or whether Sosa-Celis is the person referred to as being followed.

Throughout the initial video, several family members can be heard pleading with the dispatcher for help.

“Where did they shoot your cousin?” a 911 dispatcher asks the family over the phone. “In the leg! The leg! Please help us! We have kids!” a man responds.

“We have a small child in the house!” one woman says in the background. “And if they shoot?” another woman asks.

“Do you know who shot them?” the dispatcher asks the group. “The ones from ICE! The ones from ICE!” a man replies.

The stream ends with the family continuing to speak with the dispatcher on the phone.

A different video obtained by CNN shows what was happening outside the home while the family waited inside.

In the video, agents are seen approaching the home and setting off a flash-bang. Smoke can be seen, and ramming sounds are heard as someone says, “They’re in! There’s more than a dozen of them.”

Mothers of detained men dispute DHS statement

Alicia Celis also told CNN she has spoken to her son only once, briefly, from the hospital after the shooting. Celis said she had not asked her son about ICE’s claim he attacked agents with a broom or shovel.

“(Julio) only called me to tell me that he is fine, for me not to worry, and for me to stay calm and not cry,” Celis said.

In the Thursday statement from DHS, ICE said the agent who shot Sosa-Celis did so after chasing him on foot after Sosa-Celis crashed into a parked car. DHS also described the agent as “fearing for his life” when he fired the shot. But in an interview with CNN, Mabel Aljorna, the mother of Alfredo Alejandro Aljorna, disputed both of those claims on the basis of her conversation with her son immediately after the shooting.

Aljorna said her son told her he was the one being pursued on foot by ICE, and that Sosa-Celis was already inside the home when the agent shot him — not outside, where ICE says the agent fired the shot.

“He told me, ‘Mom, ICE was chasing me. Once we were inside, they shot at Julio.’”

After ICE shot and then detained Sosa-Celis, Sosa-Celis joined a Facebook livestream while in the hospital. In that video, he says there was a physical confrontation between him and agents before the shooting as he tried to help Aljorna get inside the home.

However, he also claims he was inside the house and the ICE agent was outside — and the two were separated by a closed door — when the agent shot him, while Sosa-Celis was locking the door and Aljorna was already inside.

“What happened was that ICE had been chasing my cousin from far way. He came over here, and he tried coming to the house,” Sosa-Celis said. “He got there and he was able to escape. We struggled with them. We were successful in helping my cousin get inside. And as I tried shutting the door, ICE shot me in the leg.”

“The shot that was fired happened when my cousin managed to escape, and he entered inside,” Sosa-Celis said on the livestream. “I closed the door. And as I was locking it, I heard the shot, and that’s when I realized I had been shot in the leg.”

CNN visited the home Friday. The front doorway was boarded up and there was no evidence to be found about the condition of the front door at the time of the shooting.

CNN has been unable to directly reach Sosa-Celis and Aljorna for comment.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2256383698.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-18 19:57:53.573433

Republicans in Congress say this is the crowning achievement of Trump’s immigration approach.
While DHS did not respond to request for comment for this story, Noem has routinely defended Trump’s immigration approach.
Similarly, the Trump administration refused for months to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia from the same Salvadoran prison.","In his first year back in office, President Trump has completely shifted the U.S. approach to immigration, launching the most visible enforcement effort seen in history while closing the door to many legal pathways for entering the U.S.

Trump promised to plug the border and crack down hard on those living in the country illegally, and under his tenure crossings have fallen to a historic low while the number of people kept in immigration detention centers has soared.

Whether Trump has fulfilled his promise to go after the worst of the worst when it comes to immigrants in the country illegally is in dispute. More than 70 percent of those held in immigration detention have no prior criminal record.

Separately, many of those targeted have legal status in the U.S., as the Trump administration pushes to end, pause or limit various ways to lawfully live in the country.

The crackdown may also be negatively impacting Trump’s polling numbers.

Polling shows Trump’s approval rating has slipped from 50 percent to 40 percent in the span of a year. In a recent Quinnipiac University poll, 57 percent of respondents said they did not approve of how Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) enforces immigration laws. And a poll from The Economist saw a surge in support for abolishing ICE, with 46 percent recently saying they wanted to scrap the agency, up from 27 percent in July.

Republicans described the year as a culmination of Trump’s most prominent campaign pledge.

“Our job is pretty basic. What did you tell the voters you were going to do when you ran for it? If you get elected, go do what you say. No one does that better than President Trump,” said Rep Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), one of the president’s allies in Congress.

“He told us he could secure the border. He did it in like four months time.”

Democrats argue Trump’s actions have at times descended into unlawful territory.

Rep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.), who has introduced legislation to shift a number of immigration enforcement policies, said Trump’s actions “completely demeans and denigrates the American values that this country has lived, has relied on for 250 years.”

“The damage to the country is far greater than the actual policy or even the deportation results, because what he’s attacking are the very fundamental values that have been the bedrock of this country since its founding, which is that it’s the land of opportunity that was built by immigrants, has been a refuge for those who are suffering around the world,” he said.

A focus on immigrants with legal status

While Trump pledged to remove those in the country illegally, the president has taken a whirlwind of actions that instead target immigrants with legal status.

“The truth is that the Trump administration campaigned on immigration reform, but what we’ve seen and what he’s delivered goes well beyond what he said,” said Shev Dalal-Dheini, senior director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

“Not only has he shut down the border, he has shut down legal immigration and taken away legal status from individuals who had it,” she added, noting that those whose status has lapsed can then face deportation.

In his first year back on the job, Trump has ordered a re-review of the 200,000 refugees who had been admitted under the Biden administration, a group that undergoes some of the most rigorous vetting before arriving in the U.S.

And in the wake of the killing in November of a National Guard officer in Washington, D.C., Trump paused the processing of pending immigration petitions for people from 19 countries on the travel ban list, a group that grew significantly as the president expanded the ban to 39 countries. The move meant those seeking green cards or even set to naturalize were stuck in limbo, unable to advance their petitions.

In March, Trump said he would strip the parole status former President Biden gave to citizens of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Honduras, curtailing the two-year status and forcing roughly 530,000 people to leave the country.

Trump has also moved to scrap deportation protections for 12 of the 17 countries designated for so-called temporary protected status (TPS).

Meant to block deportation of citizens whose home countries are experiencing natural disasters or civil unrest, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has repeated the same refrain as it has ended the status country by country: “Temporary means temporary,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in ending the TPS for Somalia.

Collectively, lifting TPS jeopardizes the status of more than 1 million people, and it’s one of the few issues that has sparked some pushback from within the GOP.

Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R), whose Florida district includes many people who came in on parole or were covered by TPS, said the process needs more “nuance” to account for those who had legitimate concerns in fleeing dictatorial regimes.

He blamed Biden for a poor process that is “creating a very difficult situation to actually solve this issue for folks who, by the way, are here and are good people, and they committed the original sin, right, [on immigration]. But then most Americans understand, [for] those people, we should have a process,” Diaz-Balart said.

The Trump administration has also revoked 8,000 student visas amid a pushback on people it says have espoused views counter to U.S. interests. The majority of those visas revoked appear to be for committing crimes while in the country, but at least 200 to 300 visas were revoked over alleged support for terrorism, a term the department used for some who have protested the Israel-Palestine conflict.

Beyond students and faculty, the State Department also rescinded permissions for five technology researchers focusing on disinformation the Trump team accused of targeting conservative speech.

Immigration advocates say the move is a clear infringement on free speech.

“One of the ways that they have used the immigration system to impact democratic norms is in the weaponization and targeting people for what is speech, using the system against people who dare say something that the administration disagrees with — not [speech] that is illegal by any means, just not something that they that they want to hear,” said Jorge Loweree, managing director at the American Immigration Council.

Trump has also sought to prevent new immigration to the U.S. through various moves.

In October the president set the lowest refugee cap in history, allowing just 7,500 refugees to come into the country in the coming year, down from the goal of 125,000 set under Biden. In addition, Trump has dictated that accepted refugees should primarily be white South Africans.

Beyond the initial travel ban, Trump announced last week he would also pause immigration visa processing for 75 countries, effectively blocking immigration from nearly 40 percent of the countries on the globe.

Trump also suspended the green-card lottery, targeting the method the Brown University shooter used to arrive in the U.S., upending a program that allows up to 55,000 people a year to migrate.

Trump has opened up some new immigration pathways, but those options have been tied to hefty fees. He revamped the investor visa as a so-called Gold Card for those willing to pay $1 million. H-1B visas now also come with a $100,000 price tag.

Visible enforcement and growing detention

Trump has fundamentally changed the dynamic at the southern border as well as how immigration officials carry out enforcement across the country, part of a widely publicized campaign.

Data tracking crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border shows a nosedive from roughly 100,000 a month under the last few months of the Biden administration to an average of around 10,000 a month since Trump retook office.

Republicans in Congress say this is the crowning achievement of Trump’s immigration approach.

“We’ve pretty much solved that problem,” Rep. Lisa McClain (R-Mich.), chair of the House Republican Conference, said of the border.

“So I think it’s been pretty doggone good. It’s been so doggone good that we don’t even talk about the border anymore. That is absolutely fantastic.”

Much of Trump’s focus has been on removing people already in the country as the president has sought to impose the largest mass deportation effort in history.

Rates of those held in immigration detention are also at their highest ever, with some 70,000 people currently locked up and facing deportation.

However, 73 percent of those currently held in detention have no criminal record. The data, compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, indicates that within the 28 percent who do have a criminal record, “many of those convicted committed only minor offenses, including traffic violations.”

“‘Mass deportation’ isn’t possible with any kind of targeted approach,” Loweree said. “Their promises to deport people en masse by going after ‘criminals’ were a lie from the start.”

The tactics used by the administration to remove people have also come under significant scrutiny.

ICE officers, backed by other DHS officials, have been dispatched to carry out raids in left-leaning cities across the country. Tracked by protesters and observers, city-by-city footage has emerged of aggressive and at times violent enforcement.

ICE’s policies have particularly come under scrutiny since an officer shot and killed Renee Good on a Minneapolis street earlier this month. The administration argues the ICE officer feared for his life because Good, driving her car, was threatening him. City and state officials argue the ICE officer acted recklessly.

Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.) said those images have been a turning point for the public, referencing video of ICE officers cutting a woman’s seatbelt to drag her out of her car as well as the viral footage of Good’s death.

“The American people are changing their views on immigration, whereas immigration, maybe in the past, was seen as a negative thing, a bad thing, I think all polls show that that’s no longer the case,” he said. “And I think the American people are more empathetic about immigrants in the plight of immigrants, as they see with their very own eyes, what’s happening across the country.”

In the wake of Good’s death, the administration has largely doubled down, accusing her of acting as a domestic terrorist while noting attacks against ICE officers.

While DHS did not respond to request for comment for this story, Noem has routinely defended Trump’s immigration approach.

“ICE isn’t the problem. The problem is sanctuary politicians and the violent criminal illegal aliens they protect,” Noem recently wrote on social platform X.

“President Trump and this administration work to protect every single American and make sure that they can live in a safe community and can raise their kids without fear.”

Court battles on policy and with judges themselves

Many of Trump’s immigration moves have been paused or overturned by the courts, but the Trump administration has aggressively fought those orders and, in some cases, defied a judge’s directives.

The Trump administration faced a contempt of court inquiry after it sent more than 100 Venezuelan men to be imprisoned in El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act. Numerous courts ruled Trump did not have the power to expel the men without giving them the chance to contest allegations of gang ties.

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg determined the Trump team “secretly spirit[ed]” them away after his order to halt or turn around any flights. After Boasberg issued an additional ruling offering the Venezuelans a way to return to the U.S. to continue their court battles, Secretary of State Marco Rubio argued they would not return, citing ongoing negotiations after toppling Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.

Similarly, the Trump administration refused for months to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia from the same Salvadoran prison. Abrego Garcia, who was previously protected from being deported to his home country, was removed because of an administrative error. While numerous courts ordered the administration to attempt his return, it did not do so until it brought him back to face human trafficking charges relating to a 2022 traffic stop.

After lawmakers won a suit challenging a DHS policy seeking to block them from making unannounced visits to detention centers, Noem again tried to enforce the policy.

The Trump administration has also come under fire for interfering with the immigration court system, where migrants pursue asylum and other legal claims for remaining in the country. In some cases, prosecutors pushed to dismiss cases, only to end someone’s legal claim so an officer waiting outside the courtroom could arrest them and fast-track their deportation.

Goldman, who has sought to bar the practice, noted migrants who are pursuing a lawful pathway to immigration cannot be deported.

“The courthouse stuff is the betrayal of the promises of the campaign, when Donald Trump said that he would be focusing on going after the worst of the worst, citing murderers and rapists and sex traffickers and horrific violent criminals,” he told The Hill.

“To turn around and be so lazy and ineffective that they resort to just waiting for people who are following the requirements of immigration law, showing up for court appearances, showing up for their required check-ins, and instead of getting a benefit from doing things the right way, they’re getting smashed and detained and deported. And it’s such a sabotage and it’s so repulsive that rather than going after serious felons who should be deported they’re going after the people trying to do it the right way.”

Trump has faced roughly 150 major lawsuits challenging his immigration policies, and many of his moves remain tied up in court.

An effort by Trump to scrap birthright citizenship for those born to parents who are not American, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, is set to be weighed by the Supreme Court this spring.

He has also tried through numerous different policies and executive orders to end the legal right to asylum, effectively ending the pathway.

Many of Trump’s attempts at scrapping TPS have also been halted, in some cases because the administration failed to follow a process that requires offering detailed analysis of how country conditions have shifted.

But the Supreme Court has also repeatedly blocked lower court injunctions, allowing the Trump administration to continue to deport people to countries they are not from and to force those on parole to leave the country.

Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) pushed back on criticism of Trump, arguing he is using all the legal levers at his disposal to remove those not lawfully present in the U.S.

“He’s simply enforcing the law and a policy of enforcing the law, even one that did not prioritize criminal aliens, would still be enforcing the law,” he said.

“The fact that we had four years of not enforcing the law, flagrantly ignoring the intent of Congress and existing laws, is the four years of criminal conduct by Joe Biden.”

The 3 years ahead

Much of Trump’s immigration push is only just beginning.

Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump was given $45 billion in ICE funding to expand detention capacity to 135,000 at any given time.

Already the administration has struggled to secure facilities to house the migrants it wishes to detain, pushing them to work with states to line up more space. That includes so-called Alligator Alcatraz, a facility made of tents and chain link fences constructed in just days on an old airway strip in Florida.

Immigration advocates fear many who pose no real threat will continue to be exposed to harsh detention conditions.

“The fact that we’re spending billions of American taxpayer money on detaining individuals who are not criminals, who are not risks to our country, is outrageous,” said Dalal-Dheini, with the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

Some in the GOP are hopeful that the trickle of migrants will mean the party will make good on its promise to review immigration reform once the border is secure.

Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), a former federal prosecutor, said that the focus should be on dangerous criminals and lamented that some industries, including those that need seasonal workers, have been hit hard by Trump’s enforcement.

“They always say, ‘Well, you gotta wait till the border’s secure to talk about immigration reform.’ So then that’s going to be the next debate,” he said.

“We got to look at some common sense solutions,” he said. “There are industries that really need the labor, and that’s the ag industry – I talk to them all the time, the construction, the restaurant [industries].”

He also noted areas like the tech sector also need workers.

Democrats hope to win back the House majority this fall and then have greater power to investigate the administration and curtail its immigration practices.

“This is a marathon. This is not a sprint. And so, yeah, people feel exhausted. I’m a fighter,” Espaillat said.

“I want to see how we could combat [Trump] and make sure that the right things are done.”

But others see Trump’s immigration moves as part of a broader militarization that aligns with decisions to flex U.S. might and trample on the rights of citizens and residents.

“I’m scared,” Goldman said when asked about possibilities under the rest of Trump’s term.

“It’s getting worse and worse and worse.”

Sebastian Ordonez, 58, was detained Thursday morning by ICE agents after leaving his Brooklyn apartment building because he lacked legal immigration status, according to Zhuang.

Ordonez is from Guatemala, but his family and close friends say he has no history of violent crime and has been part of the Brooklyn community for nearly 20 years.

Though his lawyer, Michael Musa-Obregon, believes his client is not legally in the country, he says “everybody is entitled to due process.”

“You cannot just randomly walk up to people, racially profile them, look at them like they’re other. And because of the color of their skin, and their mannerisms, or whatever other things you have as an agent in your brain, assume or presume that they are here illegally,” Obregon said.

On Friday, Zhuang, Bishop Salgado, and other community members gathered to demand that federal representatives act swiftly to end federal immigration enforcement. They are also calling for Ordonez’s release from custody.

“We have to stand up against this nonsense. Against this illegal act by our president,” Councilmember Susan Zhuang said. “We have to make sure everyone deserves due process, regardless of what legal status you have in this country.”

Solidarity follows Ordonez’s detention and the federal visa ban on 75 countries deemed likely to need public assistance in the U.S.

PIX11 News reached out to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for details on Ordonez’s detention, but the department was not immediately available to comment.",https://www.borderreport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2026/01/BISHOP-detained-e1768614790343.png?w=1280,N,,2026-01-18 19:57:37.588541

Mr. Thune pushed him to support Mr. Cassidy, the person said, noting potential consequences for key votes in the future.
The timing of Mr. Trump’s endorsement surprised Ms. Letlow, according to a colleague who spoke to her on Saturday night.
That includes Mr. Cassidy, who voted in favor of Mr. Trump’s choice for health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., last year, despite expressing misgivings.
Mr. Cassidy, who is a physician and a proponent of vaccines, has remained a public skeptic of Mr. Kennedy.","And while the board was conceived as part of Mr. Trump’s plan to oversee Gaza, there is no mention of Gaza in the charter. That omission added to speculation that the group may have a broader mandate to cover other conflicts and could even be aimed at creating a U.S.-dominated alternative to the United Nations Security Council.

A Security Council resolution adopted in November 2025 endorsed Mr. Trump’s plan for ending the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and welcomed the establishment of the board as a transitional administration that would set the framework and coordinate funding for Gaza’s redevelopment.

The enclave was devastated during the two years of war. About 80 percent of the buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed, according to the United Nations. Many of the roughly 2 million residents are still living in tents among millions of tons of rubble.

The board’s charter was sent out with invitations to potential members over the weekend. A copy reviewed by The Times was verified by an official on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate diplomacy. News of the $1 billion buy-in was previously reported by Bloomberg.

On Friday, the White House announced the board’s members would include Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, and Ajay Banga, the head of the World Bank.

Several countries said they had received invitations to join, including Argentina, Canada, Egypt and Turkey. King Abdullah II of Jordan has also been invited, the Jordanian Foreign Ministry announced on Sunday.

Mr. Trump, who is to chair the board, said in a post on Truth Social last week that it will be “the Greatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled at any time, any place,” though much about it remained unclear.

The charter appears to outline a much more ambitious role for the board than the one described in Mr. Trump’s plan for Gaza, published in October 2025, as well as the subsequent Security Council resolution.

The board’s mission, according to the charter, is to seek “to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict” and “to undertake peace-building functions in accordance with international law.”

The preamble emphasizes the need for what it calls “a more nimble and effective international peace-building body” and laments that “too many approaches to peace-building foster perpetual dependency and institutionalize crisis rather than leading people beyond it.”

According to the charter, the board is expected to meet for voting at least annually, and expenses are to be funded through voluntary contributions from member states or other sources. The charter does not elaborate on the peacekeeping efforts.

Along with the “Board of Peace,” the White House on Friday also outlined a “Gaza Executive Board” that would help liaise with a committee of Palestinian technocrats appointed to administer daily life in Gaza. The Gaza executive board includes Ali al-Thawadi, a senior Qatari official, and Hakan Fidan, the Turkish foreign minister, among others.

The composition of the executive board prompted the office of Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to issue a rare public protest against the Trump administration, saying it “was not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy.”

While an Israeli businessman is on the executive board, Israeli government officials have not been named to it.

Miri Regev, an Israeli minister from Mr. Netanyahu’s conservative Likud party, told Israel’s public broadcaster, Kan, on Saturday that Israel objected to participation of Qatar and Turkey, adding, “Prime Minister Netanyahu will do everything to change that decision.”

Relations between Israel and Turkey have oscillated over the decades, but since the war in Gaza, set off by Hamas’s attack against Israel in October 2023, they have deteriorated.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has downgraded ties with Israel, repeatedly compared Mr. Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler and praised Hamas, while hosting its officials. Israeli officials are anxious about the prospect of Turkey gaining influence over Gaza’s future.

After Israel struck Qatar in September 2025 in a failed attempt to kill Hamas leaders meeting there, Mr. Netanyahu defended the action and lashed out against the country for giving what he called “safe haven” to the militant group, even as Qatar was trying to negotiate a cease-fire.

Qatari officials have said they hosted Hamas officials at the request of the U.S. government to facilitate channels of communication. Mr. Netanyahu has in the past relied on Qatar to send millions of dollars a month to Gaza, a policy that was intended to keep the peace but that also helped prop up Hamas’s rule over the territory.

Israel’s priority is seeing Gaza demilitarized. Hamas so far has not agreed to lay down its arms.

But after being pressed on a video that backed up the accounts provided to the court, she changed course. Protesters were to blame for the use of force, she said, adding that federal officers “only use those chemical agents when there’s violence happening and perpetuating.”

The ruling on Friday by Judge Kate M. Menendez of the Federal District Court in Minnesota said that chemical agents had been used against protesters on at least four separate occasions and called the evidence of their use “uncontroverted.”

“Federal agents used chemical irritants” to punish protesters for exercising “protected First Amendment rights to assemble and to observe and protest ICE operations,” the judge wrote in issuing her injunction, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

In response to an inquiry about Ms. Noem’s comments, Tricia McLaughlin, a homeland security spokeswoman, did not comment on Ms. Noem’s initial denial and backtracking of immigration agents’ use of force. Instead, she emphasized that assaulting and obstructing law enforcement is a felony, and accused protesters of tampering with agents’ vehicles and attacking officers with fireworks and automobiles.

Judge Menendez had dismissed the government’s claims that all use of pepper spray and other chemical irritants had happened after agents were “attacked,” finding that “protected conduct,” including protesting and observing the operations, had “motivated” the agents’ “adverse actions.”

The injunction issued last week stemmed from a lawsuit filed by activists who have protested the crackdown or observed the department’s operations in Minnesota. The suit was filed in December, before an immigration agent shot and killed an unarmed U.S. citizen, Renee Good, in Minneapolis on Jan. 7, prompting increased protests against the crackdown.

Ms. Good, 37, had partially blocked a roadway where agents were working and did not follow commands to get out of her S.U.V. As she began to drive away, an agent near the front of her car opened fire.

In addition to barring agents from using “crowd dispersal tools” in retaliation for protected speech, Judge Menendez also said agents could not stop or detain protesters in vehicles who were not “forcibly obstructing or interfering with” agents.

On Sunday, Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, defended the Justice Department’s decision to not investigate the agent who fatally shot Ms. Good, saying that doing so would be bowing to “pressure from the media” and politicians.

“We investigate when it’s appropriate to investigate, and that is not the case here,” Mr. Blanche said on “Fox News Sunday.” “We don’t just go out and investigate every time an officer is forced to defend himself against somebody.”

The Justice Department has instead pushed to investigate Ms. Good’s widow, prompting several federal prosecutors in the state to resign.

Ms. Noem said during the interview that her department was conducting a separate, internal review of the agent’s actions, “following the exact same investigative and review process” that existed for years.

Even as critics of the government’s tactics say the operations, particularly in Minnesota, have indiscriminately swept up individuals based on racial and ethnic profiling, President Trump and members of his administration have insisted they are aimed at violent criminals.

Department of Homeland Security officials have repeatedly said that 70 percent of those detained in the administration’s immigration crackdown have been charged or convicted of a crime. That figure is roughly in line with a New York Times analysis of immigration arrests between the start of Mr. Trump’s term and Oct. 15, which found that 67 percent of those taken into custody had been at least charged with a crime of some kind.

But Ms. Noem on Sunday went a step further. “Every single individual” arrested by immigration agents had broken the law, she told “Face the Nation,” adding that 70 percent of those detained had either committed or been charged with violent crimes specifically.

Ms. McLaughlin, the department spokeswoman, did not respond directly to an inquiry about that statement, but repeated the department’s position that 70 percent of those arrested had been convicted or at least charged with a crime of some kind.

He added: “If you believe in the power of the law and that no one stands above it, if you stand against heavily armed mass federal troops invading an American city using Gestapo tactics against our fellow citizens, if you believe you don’t deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest, then send a message to this president.”

Mr. Springsteen went on to quote Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis, who had used an expletive to tell ICE to leave the city. He then dedicated his song “The Promised Land,” which tells of a young working-class man striving for a brighter future, to Ms. Good.

“This one is for you, and the memory of mother of three and American citizen Renee Good,” he told the crowd.

Ms. Good was fatally shot by an ICE agent, Jonathan Ross, on Jan. 7 in Minneapolis. Mr. Ross was standing near the front of Ms. Good’s car and fired his gun after she drove toward him and then turned to the right. Mr. Trump and administration officials have said that Ms. Good had “weaponized her vehicle” against the agent.

Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement on Sunday that no one cared about Mr. Springsteen’s “bad political opinions.”

“If he actually believed in the power of the law,” she said, “he would understand that criminal illegal aliens should be deported, that impeding federal law enforcement operations is a crime and that officers have a right to act in self-defense if an individual is using their car as a deadly weapon.”

Mr. Springsteen’s remarks on Saturday were hardly the first time the musician has spoken out against Mr. Trump and his policies.

When Mr. Springsteen endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign in 2024, he called Mr. Trump the “most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime.” Last year, Mr. Springsteen opened his “Land of Hope and Dreams” tour in England by accusing Mr. Trump and his administration of trampling on civil rights and siding with dictators.

In response, Mr. Trump wrote on social media that Mr. Springsteen “ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT.” He also called for a “major investigation” into Mr. Springsteen and other celebrities, including Beyoncé and Oprah Winfrey.

Undeterred, Mr. Springsteen released a six-track EP that offered a mix of songs and his political remarks from the show in England. That project began with his statement that the United States was “in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.”

Even so, the Pentagon last week put troops with two infantry battalions with the Army’s 11th Airborne Division on alert in case they ended up being called up, two Defense officials said.

“The Department of War is always prepared to execute the orders of the commander in chief if called upon,” Sean Parnell, the Pentagon’s chief spokesman, said in an emailed statement, using the Trump administration’s preferred moniker for the department.

The Pentagon last week also quietly alerted 200 Texas National Guard troops to be ready to deploy to Minnesota in the event that Mr. Trump followed through with his threat. The Texas Guard soldiers have remained on standby since returning home from Chicago late last year.

But the deployment of troops from the 11th Airborne Division, which is based in Alaska, would be a major escalation for Mr. Trump, who has already sent National Guard troops into a number of American cities.

The use of military force on domestic soil in the United States is rare, and it is usually reserved only for the most extreme situations. Active-duty forces are barred from domestic law enforcement unless the president invokes the Insurrection Act, which allows for the use of federal troops on U.S. soil.

The order putting the troops on notice to deploy was reported earlier by ABC News.

On Friday, a day after issuing his Insurrection Act threat, Mr. Trump appeared to walk back his comments. “I don’t think I need it right now,” he told reporters while leaving the White House to spend the weekend in Florida.

Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2024, urged Mr. Trump on Thursday to back off the heated rhetoric. “Let’s turn the temperature down,” the governor wrote on social media. “Stop this campaign of retribution.”

The Justice Department has opened an investigation into Mr. Walz and Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis, an escalation in the state-federal battle over the conduct of immigration agents in the city.

Mr. Trump was talked out of invoking the Insurrection Act in 2020 following the protests over the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis policeman. At the time, his defense secretary, attorney general and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff all advised him against sending active-duty troops into American cities to battle local citizens.

But Mr. Trump has a much more compliant Pentagon in his second term, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has worked to amplify Mr. Trump’s directives and inclinations, rather than seek to restrain him.

One defense official said on Sunday that the Pentagon was aware that Mr. Trump had appeared to back away from his threat, but also said that Mr. Hegseth wanted to be prepared.

“RUN JULIA RUN!!!” Mr. Trump wrote, adding that “Should she decide to enter this Race, Julia Letlow has my Complete and Total Endorsement.”

The move is likely to create new tensions between Mr. Trump and Senate Republicans.

Mr. Trump called Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the majority leader, on Friday and said he was likely to endorse Ms. Letlow, according to a person briefed on the conversation who was not authorized to discuss the private remarks.

Mr. Thune pushed him to support Mr. Cassidy, the person said, noting potential consequences for key votes in the future. The majority leader also noted that Mr. Trump was starting to push a major health care bill, which Mr. Cassidy would have jurisdiction over as chairman of the Senate’s health committee.

Mr. Cassidy responded to Mr. Trump in a social media post of his own on Saturday night: “I’m proudly running for re-election as a principled conservative who gets things done for the people of Louisiana. If Congresswoman Letlow decides to run I am confident I will win.”

Ms. Letlow did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday night, but on social media, she wrote that she was honored by the endorsement and made it clear that she was likely to announce a campaign.

“This United States Senate seat belongs to the people of Louisiana, because we deserve conservative leadership that will not waver,” she wrote.

The timing of Mr. Trump’s endorsement surprised Ms. Letlow, according to a colleague who spoke to her on Saturday night. The congresswoman had told people she would not enter the race without Mr. Trump’s official backing. But the move had long been in the works.

Mr. Trump first met with Ms. Letlow on March 5 of last year, the morning after the president’s address to a joint session of Congress. The Oval Office meeting included, among others, Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff; James Blair, a deputy chief of staff; and Representative Lance Gooden of Texas. Mr. Gooden helped arrange the meeting with Ms. Letlow.

In the meeting, Mr. Trump told Ms. Letlow that he would support her if she decided to challenge Mr. Cassidy, according to a person who was in the room and insisted on anonymity to describe the private conversation. But he said he would have to lie low for the time being to avoid a repeat of Mr. Trump’s clashes with former Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, who routinely broke with the president, including on his vote to remove him from office.

Ms. Letlow, a former teacher whose political profile in her state grew when redistricting added Baton Rouge to her mostly rural constituency, is not known in the Capitol as an aggressive politician. She was hesitant to make any moves with only private assurances of Mr. Trump’s support.

Ms. Letlow spoke again with the president at the congressional picnic on June 12.

He again privately expressed his support, according to a person who heard their conversation. But he had still said nothing publicly. And she had still heard nothing more concrete from Mr. Trump or anyone in his political operation as of Dec. 11, when she announced her engagement at a holiday ball at the White House.

Big donors, meanwhile, were still giving money to Mr. Cassidy and telling Ms. Letlow that, until she formally declared that she was running, they would support him.

Ms. Letlow had almost resigned herself to staying out of the race. This month, she filmed two campaign commercials: one for a re-election campaign to the House, and one for a potential Senate race. As the February filing deadline approached, she did not know which one she would be using, according to a person briefed on her campaign plans.

But Ms. Letlow has been building quiet support from encouraging colleagues in the House, who said they expected her to jump in now and campaign aggressively.

Any endorsement of a candidate opposing a sitting senator is viewed as unwelcome by Senate Republicans, and it is a move the conference writ large has sought to avoid. That includes Mr. Cassidy, who voted in favor of Mr. Trump’s choice for health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., last year, despite expressing misgivings.

Mr. Cassidy, who is a physician and a proponent of vaccines, has remained a public skeptic of Mr. Kennedy.

But he has taken pains to repair relations with Mr. Trump. As of late Saturday, the post he had pinned atop his X account featured a photograph of a meeting with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office as the president signed red hats.

“This is what a great working relationship looks like,” the October post from Mr. Cassidy said.

Mr. Trump’s endorsement of a potential Cassidy challenger comes days after the president frustrated Senate Republicans when he declared that five other G.O.P. senators should never be re-elected because of their opposition to him on military intervention in Venezuela. Among them was Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who is seen as the party’s most vulnerable incumbent in 2026.

Mr. Trump has also been unwilling to throw his support behind Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, who is facing a competitive primary race against two challengers, Ken Paxton, the state attorney general, and Representative Wesley Hunt of Texas.

Mr. Thune indicated to reporters last week that, despite his best efforts to persuade the president to back Mr. Cornyn, the three Texans were going to have to “duke it out in the primary.”

The National Republican Senatorial Committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Mr. Trump’s latest move.

Alex Latcham, the executive director of the main super PAC aligned with Senate Republicans, said in a statement on Saturday that his group’s mission was “to preserve and expand” the Republican Senate majority.

“Anything that distracts from our efforts to beat Democrats in November is unhelpful,” he said.

The El Paso County Sheriff’s Office held a town hall meeting to discuss public safety, community policing and the implementation of Texas Senate Bill 8.

The town hall meeting was held on Saturday, Jan. 17, at the Socorro Ramirez Community Center, located at 106 Payton Rd. The Border Network for Human Rights co-hosted the event.

As KTSM previously reported, SB 8 mandates that every sheriff’s office in Texas counties with a population over 100,000 enter into a 287-G agreement with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Under the agreement, trained local officers are allowed to carry out certain federal immigration functions.

Out of the three options given for the agreement, Ugarte said they will move forward with the Warrant Service Officer option: limits participation to serving administrative warrants or detainers on individuals already booked into the county jail.

This means that all warrant checks are done by federal officers, rather than local staff, to see if a detainer or immigration warrant exists for someone booked into the county jail. The bill officially went into effect this year on Jan. 1.

“This is not an option. This is not something that I wanted to do. But the Sheriff’s Office needs to do it because it’s a state law,” Ugarte said.

Ugarte spotlights the current political atmosphere, with ICE raids occurring in El Paso and across the nation, and emphasizes the importance of transparency.

“It’s very important because there’s a lot of confusion, there’s a lot of fear in our community because of what’s going on across the nation with federal agencies. So us, as local officials, it’s important to be transparent and talk to the community and have these forums if they have any questions so they can hear it directly from the Sheriff’s Office on what we are doing,” Ugarte said.

Ugarte also notes that, although the Sheriff’s Office is partnering with federal agencies, the priority of his office will remain focusing on crimes affecting the community.

“We work in collaboration with other agencies, but I want to remind the community that the focus of the Sheriff’s Office is dealing with crimes and issues that affect our community. That is the priority of the Sheriff’s Office,” he said.

He asks that if residents see ICE agents out in El Paso County, to not interfere with the investigations, including blocking roadways, assaulting the agents or damaging any property.

“If you do not agree with ICE and if you want to protest, you have a right to protest, but you need to protest from a distance. Keep your distance from the federal officers so they can do their job and do not interfere with any of their investigations,” Ugarte said.

Samantha Singleton, the policy director for the Border Network for Human Rights, said the topic most talked about was concerns about ICE and DHS raids that have been happening in El Paso.

“Outside of the 287-G agreements, the community is really concerned about Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s raids that are taking place, about Homeland Security investigation raids that are being taken place, that there is no checks and balance when it comes to the federal organizations, that they are not identifying themselves, to community members that are coming in mass and they wanted to know if there was something that they should do or could do as community members to respond to these outgoing enforcement tactics that are taking place,” Singleton said.

She said that the Sheriff’s Office can assist in situations by confirming if the people investigating are federal agents. Once they have identified that they are agents, the Sheriff’s Office has to back off, as they do not have power over them.

“I believe the community should know that there’s always a way to get involved. So we ask that if you have questions, utilize our organization to be a resource. There are some tools that we have that we can help the community with. Most importantly, we want the community to know that we are here and we are here to assist and that we are each other’s keeper. And so we want you all to reach out to us if there are things that is needed from you,” Singleton said.",https://www.ktsm.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/38/2026/01/EPCSO-BNHR-town-hall-meeting.png?w=1280,N,,2026-01-18 23:58:17.244363

Throughout her campaign, Sherrill positioned herself as a bulwark to the Trump administration.","Murphy spoke with POLITICO for an hour last week to reflect on his eight years in office, which concludes on Tuesday. He’s the first Democrat in decades to win two terms in the New Jersey governor’s office, and he steps down with his party on an even stronger footing than when he arrived in Trenton. That may have been hard to fathom when the former Goldman Sachs banker emerged seemingly out of nowhere a decade ago to succeed Republican Gov. Chris Christie.

But after years as a finance chair of the Democratic National Committee and U.S. ambassador to Germany under President Barack Obama, Murphy leveraged his wealth and connections to clear a crowded primary field to become New Jersey’s 56th governor. He’ll turn over duties to former Rep. Mikie Sherrill, plus the largest Democratic majority in the Legislature since Watergate.

Over the course of the conversation, Murphy toggled between national and local fights — from the investigation of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, which he called “breathtaking,” to his policy achievements at home, including the legalization of marijuana and raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.

But, like virtually everything else in American life, Trump dominated. And after eight years of governing with Trump in the foreground or the background, Murphy has a vantage point on the president unlike any other governor in the country.

During the pandemic, Murphy also had a working relationship with former White House senior adviser and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, whom he praised for his efforts to provide ventilators and personal protective equipment. He said that “people forget” that “early on,” the administration was “pretty good on this.”

Murphy said he “expanded” his relationship with the president into “adjacent lanes,” like over the Portal North Bridge, an upgrade project important to the Northeast rail corridor that the Trump administration approved federal funding for later in 2020.

“When he ran the first time, he had a great line, he said, ‘I’m the only president, if I get elected, I’ll be the only president in history who understands what rebar is,’” Murphy said, referring to his discussions of the bridge with Trump. “So I would try to couch it in a lane that I thought would connect with him. So less flattery than, ‘Wait a minute, I know this is his lived experience,’ or knowing New Jersey well.”

There’s less of that this time around. Beyond having what he called a “cordial conversation” with the president after he was elected again, Murphy hasn’t spoken with Trump lately — “it’s not that I wouldn’t speak to him, but it’s just harder,” he said — but talked to chief of staff Susie Wiles a couple of weeks ago.

The difference between the two Trump administrations, Murphy continued, is that “they know what they’re doing” and “there are no, that I can find, powerful voices on the other side of some of the actions.”

“I’m not a big Mike Pompeo fan, but Pompeo is brilliant, number one in his class at West Point — you know, a serious person,” he said. “Or Gary Cohn, who I know well, used to work with at Goldman Sachs, was the national economic adviser, Jared himself, who I have enormous regard for. Those folks are not on the scene, and I feel like that’s the biggest — there’s no ballast.”

Even with a good relationship, New Jersey hasn’t been immune over the years to federal issues trickling down into the states. And there’s been plenty of disagreement between the governor and Trump, including on offshore wind, which the president has sought to kill: “We’ve fought like heck against the Trump team on offshore wind,” Murphy said. “I don’t think it makes any sense.”

New Jersey has also been bullish when it comes to legal action against the administration, with outgoing Attorney General Matt Platkin suing more than 40 times since Trump came back into office.

And Murphy himself hasn’t been completely untouched. Last year, Trump border czar Tom Homan said that Murphy could be prosecuted over a comment he made suggesting he was harboring an immigrant at his home, and former acting U.S. attorney Alina Habba said she was investigating him over immigration enforcement. Nothing came out of either of those threats, according to Murphy.

But the governor said that he found that Trump has not gone “out of his way” to impact the Garden State — and “for the most part” still isn’t.

That doesn’t mean he’s not worried.

“I wake up every day hoping that we don’t get hit in an innocent drive-by shooting [and] the shrapnel comes our direction,” he said. “You’re balancing. You can’t abandon your values. You can’t abandon communities or people who are being attacked for no good reason on the one hand. And on the other hand, you’re trying not to start World War III, and that’s hard.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Those fears have only been exacerbated in recent weeks and months. In Murphy’s view, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act “will be awful for New Jersey.” The state, which is home to a prominent population of immigrants and a controversial immigrant detention center, is “not immune” to action from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, he said, adding that he’s worried a situation like the ICE agent who fatally shot a U.S. citizen in Minnesota could happen here.

Beyond New Jersey, Murphy expressed concern with the administration’s way it went about capturing Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. When it comes to talk about the U.S. seizing Greenland, he said that discussing “a land grab from an ally and a NATO partner of the United States” is “so beyond the pale.” And the Justice Department’s criminal investigation into Powell “further undermines an institution that we’ve spent a couple of centuries building up,” Murphy said.

In just a couple of days, Murphy will hand the keys over to Sherrill, who had a blowout win in November to secure a third Democratic term in a row leading the state, a feat that has not been accomplished for six decades. Throughout her campaign, Sherrill positioned herself as a bulwark to the Trump administration. In an interview last month, her campaign manager and soon-to-be chief of staff told POLITICO that they would be willing to work with the president if the “administration wants to get on the team” to support her efforts to make “life easier and more affordable for New Jerseyans.”

Trump endorsed Sherrill’s opponent Jack Ciattarelli — a change from previous New Jersey gubernatorial elections. He didn’t get involved in Ciattarelli’s 2021 race against Murphy, nor did he back Murphy’s opponent in 2017.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fbd%2F9f%2F184d59794edaa0bd46cbc33ea8df%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2244527993,N,,2026-01-18 17:57:30.119803

He brought chaos to American streets,Alex Woodward,,,,,https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-protests-ice-arrests-insurrection-act-b2900860.html,"“This long ago stopped being a campaign of organized immigration enforcement,” he said January 13.
Businesses have been forced to close.” Trump promised to target the “enemy within” throughout his campaign and into his second administration.
Years later, without any new restrictions on federal immigration enforcement, a Republican-controlled Congress last year approved a massive injection of taxpayer cash into ICE that outpaces most foreign military budgets.
Indiscriminate, large-scale arrests increased by 600 percent within the president’s first nine months, with roving patrols and raids supplementing targeted operations, according to the American Immigration Council.
Immigration arrests have more than quadrupled.","Nearly one year after returning to the White House with a promise to carry out the “largest deportation operation” in American history, masked immigration officers ripped a woman from her car as she tried to get to a doctor’s appointment in Minneapolis. On the other side of the country, a 21-year-old protester in Santa Ana, California, was recovering from eye surgery after an officer fired a riot-control weapon inches from his face.

They both came just days after an officer fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Good.

The Trump administration’s promise to go after the “worst of the worst” in his nationwide campaign to rapidly deport tens of thousands of people has turned American cities into conflict zones patrolled by hundreds of masked and heavily armed officers.

Democratic officials warned for months that a surge of militarized Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection officers would only stir up more unrest. They warned that the scenes of mass protests were by design, giving the president an opening to invoke the Insurrection Act and deploy active-duty troops on Americans in cities run by his political enemies.

Since returning to the White House, Trump has reshaped the government to pursue an anti-immigration agenda across nearly every federal agency, with a mission to find, arrest and deport thousands of people, deter new arrivals and impose new restrictions on legal immigration that have repulsed humanitarian aid groups and civil rights advocates.

Thousands of people, most of whom have never been convicted of a crime, are now locked up in immigration detention centers, entering a byzantine legal process that the administration has pushed to make it virtually impossible to escape.

Federal officers, whose identities are largely kept secret and whose faces are covered, are routinely seen jumping out of cars and vans to round up immigrants and citizens alike, sometimes leaving their cars stranded in roadways or rolling down streets. They leave behind neighborhoods in shock and families in crisis, scrambling where to find members who often end up jailed hundreds of miles from home.

From Los Angeles and Portland, Oregon, to Chicago, New York City, New Orleans and Charlotte, North Carolina, footage and stories of violent arrests and volatile protests have emerged at a dizzying pace.

In Washington, D.C., last summer, Trump invoked a never-before-used authority to seize control of the city’s police department as deployed the National Guard and surged federal officers into the streets, claiming the city was overrun with “bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people.” Officials there accused the administration of waging a politically motivated “hostile takeover.”

And in Minnesota, where thousands of federal officers descended in recent weeks, “news reports simply don’t do justice to the level of chaos and disruption and trauma the federal government is raining down upon our communities,” according to Governor Tim Walz.

“This long ago stopped being a campaign of organized immigration enforcement,” he said January 13. “Instead, it’s a campaign of organized brutality against the people of Minnesota by our own federal government.”

“People are being racially profiled, harassed, terrorized, and assaulted,” Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said in a statement announcing a lawsuit accusing the Trump administration of “spreading terror” in the state. “Schools have gone into lockdown. Businesses have been forced to close.”

Trump promised to target the “enemy within” throughout his campaign and into his second administration. In 2023, he told a crowd in Iowa that he would send troops into Democratic-run cities whether officials there wanted them or not.

“And one of the other things I’ll do — because you’re supposed to not be involved in that, you just have to be asked by the governor or the mayor to come in,” he said. “The next time, I’m not waiting.”

Facing widespread protests against his mass deportation campaign, and relying on varying justifications for their deployment, Trump did exactly that. In June, the president began ordering National Guard troops to several Democratic-led cities, an effort that one federal judge rebuked as “a national police force with the president as its chief.”

Legal challenges from state and local officials accused the administration of using American streets for political theater, an attempt to stir up unrest to justify the president’s military and federal law enforcement occupation of cities with large immigrant populations.

In December, the Supreme Court blocked the administration from sending the military into Chicago, and, sensing impending legal failures in the face of other lawsuits over his threats to put boots on the ground, Trump pulled out of the idea altogether on New Year’s Eve.

But the administration has continued to surge officers into Democratic-led cities, dovetailing with the president’s crusade of retribution against his political opponents.

In courtrooms across the country, protesters and detainees alleged officers shot them with chemical weapons at point-blank range, turned neighborhoods into “war zones” filled with tear gas, and racially profiled citizens and Native Americans before hauling them to detention centers.

The administration “has blown through normative guardrails to make mass deportations a central element of government function,” according to the Migration Policy Institute.

That “scorched-earth anti-immigration campaign” is “part of a broader Trump administration assault” on constitutional rights, from the arrests of international scholars Mahmoud Khalil and Rumeysa Ozturk that presaged the administration’s threats to dissent, to his ongoing efforts to unilaterally define who gets to be a citizen, according to Uzra Zeya, president of Human Rights First.

Days after an ICE officer in Minneapolis fatally shot Renee Good, whose death sparked a renewed wave of protests and political outrage, Trump promised a “day of reckoning” for Minnesota, his latest target. “RETRIBUTION IS COMING,” he wrote.

Less than one year after she was sworn into office, Homeland Security Kristi Noem is now facing threats of impeachment from dozens of Democratic members of Congress. And years after moderate Democratic figures sidelined “abolish ICE” demands, lawmakers entered the new year mulling how to cut off new funding for the agency, potentially triggering yet another government shutdown in Trump’s second presidency.

The “abolish ICE” movement gained momentum on the political left under Trump’s first term after the administration’s catastrophic family separation policy and a fresh wave of raids and arrests. Years later, without any new restrictions on federal immigration enforcement, a Republican-controlled Congress last year approved a massive injection of taxpayer cash into ICE that outpaces most foreign military budgets.

A record amount of new funding has turned ICE into the single largest federal law enforcement agency in the nation’s history, with nearly $15 billion a year to expand immigration detention and billions more dollars to recruit and hire officers.

Indiscriminate, large-scale arrests increased by 600 percent within the president’s first nine months, with roving patrols and raids supplementing targeted operations, according to the American Immigration Council.

Those arrests exploded alongside a historic expansion of immigration detention, with dozens of jails, makeshift facilities and state-backed facilities such as “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida and a wing of the notorious Angola prison in Louisiana holding more than 60,000 people at any given time, shipped around the country and jailed hundreds of miles from where they were picked up.

Unauthorized arrivals at the U.S.-Mexico border have plummeted. Immigration arrests have more than quadrupled. Detentions are at their highest level in modern American history.

More than 622,000 people were deported by the end of 2025, according to Homeland Security. But as many as 73 percent of those booked into ICE custody last year had no criminal convictions, according to ICE data reviewed by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.

The administration has also “de-legalized” more than 1.5 million people who were already legally living and working in the United States, swiftly expanding the pool of “undocumented” or “illegal” immigrants who were following immigration law until the moment Trump’s government changed it.

Immigration agencies are canceling citizenship hearings and threatening green card holders and married immigrants interviewing for permanent legal status. Officers have arrested thousands of people who were showing up for court-ordered check-ins with ICE or immigration court hearings where they sought to make their case to stay in the country, with federal agents waiting on the other side of the door to literally rip them away from their lawyers and families.

With that radical expansion of the nation’s immigration detention centers came an avalanche of reports of abuse and neglect inside them.

A series of sworn testimonials from detainees at the largest ICE facility in the country allege deteriorating conditions and routine beatings that have left several people hospitalized, including detainees whose testicles were “firmly crushed” by guards.

Federal judges have intervened to force ICE to improve conditions inside facilities in New York and Chicago, where detainees were allegedly forced into cramped cells near open toilets without adequate food, water, clean clothing or a place to bathe or brush their teeth.

“After nearly 35 years of experience with federal law enforcement in this judicial district ... I have never encountered anything like this,” Trump-appointed Judge Gary Brown wrote in response to squalid conditions at one facility on Long Island.

He rebuked “chillingly brutal conditions” at the jail and questioned why ICE shouldn’t be held in contempt.

The agency’s behavior “shocks the conscience,” he wrote.",https://static.the-independent.com/2026/01/15/14/45/Ongoing-federal-immigration-crackdown-in-Minneapolis-stb4tb8d.jpeg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2026-01-18 17:57:41.572592

A new Reuters/Ipsos survey found American approval of Trump’s immigration approach at its lowest point since he returned to the White House.
In an AP-NORC poll, just 38 percent of Americans approve of Trump’s immigration enforcement, down from a 49 percent high this spring.
The polls come after ICE officer Jonathan Ross fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month, marking a major flash point in Trump’s immigration crackdown and sparking protests across the country.
“Immigration is an issue with a lot of nuance, and there’s no nuance in the Trump administration’s approach,” GOP strategist Alex Conant said.","President Trump is facing signs that his immigration crackdown is losing popularity with American voters as fallout grows from the fatal shooting of a Minnesota woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer this month.

Recent polling has found Trump’s approval on immigration at a low point and shown that even some Republican voters are critical of immigration officers’ approach.

The poll numbers come as some high-profile figures on the right have criticized ICE in the wake of the Minneapolis shooting, underscoring the potential political liability for the party as it heads into the midterms.

“This is the kind of political issue that can get out of control,” Republican strategist Jason Cabel Roe said.

Immigration has long been one of the president’s strong suits, and he won his second term partly on the promise of tough border policies and mass deportations.

But his administration’s aggressive moves have drawn sharp pushback from the left, prompted protests throughout the year and now appear to be dragging down his approval numbers.

A new Reuters/Ipsos survey found American approval of Trump’s immigration approach at its lowest point since he returned to the White House. In an AP-NORC poll, just 38 percent of Americans approve of Trump’s immigration enforcement, down from a 49 percent high this spring. And a majority of voters in a recent CNN poll conducted by SSRS said ICE’s actions are making American cities less safe.

The polls come after ICE officer Jonathan Ross fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month, marking a major flash point in Trump’s immigration crackdown and sparking protests across the country.

Administration officials have argued Ross acted out of self-defense, alleging Good was impeding federal law enforcement. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem swiftly labeled Good’s actions as “domestic terrorism.”

A 53-percent majority of voters in a Quinnipiac Poll said the Minnesota shooting wasn’t justified, including 92 percent of Democrats, 59 percent of independents and 10 percent of Republicans.

The Reuters survey found a notable 39 percent of Republicans said officers should limit harm to others, even if they make fewer arrests as a result.

“Immigration is an issue with a lot of nuance, and there’s no nuance in the Trump administration’s approach,” GOP strategist Alex Conant said.

“Americans want to see immigrants that cause crime deported, but they’re much more tolerant of undocumented immigrants who’ve been here a long time and are contributing to the economy and otherwise not breaking laws,” he noted.

Another signal of frustration in the days since the Minneapolis shooting has come from a small handful of media figures popular on the right, even as Republicans in Washington have largely been supportive of the ICE operations.

Conservative commentator Bill O’Reilly warned that ICE “needs to deescalate.” And podcaster Joe Rogan, who boasts a right-leaning audience and backed Trump in 2024, questioned, “Are we really gonna be the Gestapo, ‘Where’s your papers?’ Is that what we’ve come to?”

“Here’s the reality: the President campaigned on and won an election based on his promise to carry out the largest mass deportation operation in history – he’s keeping his promise and the American people are appreciative,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement to The Hill.

Good’s shooting has renewed some Democrats’ calls to abolish ICE. In an Economist/YouGov poll, a 46-percent plurality of respondents supported shuttering the agency, including 47 percent of independents and 14 percent of Republicans.

A CNN/SSRS poll found that, among the 56 percent of respondents who labeled the shooting an “inappropriate” use of force, 9 in 10 said it “reflects bigger problems with the way ICE is operating.”

“There’s been a drip, drip downward as far as approval on how [Trump] is handling immigration,” Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy said.

Malloy noted that more than 8 in 10 voters said they’d seen video footage of the Minneapolis shooting just days afterward, and that it could grow to have an even larger impact as coverage continues.

Democratic strategist Eddie Vale said his party should seize on the issue entering the midterms, arguing Trump “is in trouble” because of the administration’s hard-line tactics.

“Whenever they get a chance to talk immigration or health care or the economy, they should [talk about it] because people are against Trump on all of it,” Vale argued.

Democratic strategist Anthony Coley said Democrats should frame the argument as anti-American.

“What ever happened to ‘love thy neighbor as thyself’?” Coley said. “What Trump is doing on immigration isn’t about right vs. left. It’s about right vs. wrong. It’s immoral and anti-American, and that’s how Democrats should talk about it.”

Some Democrats, though, stress the party should be strategic in seizing on the controversy: A memo from the center-left think tank Third Way cautions the party to “abolish ICE abuses — not ICE” to avoid the blowback that came with prior calls to “defund the police.”

Some Republicans argue the winds will shift in the GOP’s favor when it comes to immigration. GOP strategist Ford O’Connell forecasts Trump “is going to prevail on this issue” because Democrats “will go too far” with calls to curtail ICE.

“Democrats think that this is going to be a winning issue for them, and they’re going to be wrong,” O’Connell said.

Still, Republican strategist Doug Heye said this might be a problem for Republicans in the midterm elections because “they’ve backed themselves into a corner on this.”

“They can oppose some administration policies — which leads [the media] to go mental with the ‘What does it say about Trump’s hold on the party?’ — but they can’t challenge him on things that are core to his identity. And this is,” Heye said.

White House border czar Tom Homan this week said the Trump administration needs “to be better at messaging what we’re doing out there” when it comes to immigration, arguing it faces “a lot of false media.”

Despite the signals of voter frustration, whether immigration and ICE actions remain a problem for the GOP in the midterms depends on what happens next, Republican strategists said.

“It depends how the Democrats respond. I think if the Democrats become anti-ICE and anti-law enforcement, I think that that will only help Republicans. If instead Democrats use this opening to rebrand themselves as more middle-of-the-road on immigration … that could help them politically,” Conant said.

Though Trump’s overall disapproval rating is reaching all-time highs as the immigration debate intensifies, Republicans “have plenty of time to claw some of this back” before November, said Scott Tranter, director of data science for Decision Desk HQ.

“What will be interesting to me is if it affects some of the big primaries, which will have an effect on control. Like, how does this play in the Texas Senate primary in two months? … How does this play out in the Michigan open Senate race? Immigration is obviously a big issue,” Tranter said.

The polling is a problem “in the immediate,” Roe said, but there will be “a thousand outrages” in the 10 months until Election Day.

“So it is an issue, but I imagine it’s going to get replaced by other issues. But it also depends on how things play out from here,” Roe said, crediting some of the anger over ICE to media coverage and blue-state leaders not cooperating with the agency’s actions.

Republican strategist Brian Seitchik, who worked for the Trump campaign in 2016, agreed with that sentiment.

“This is short-term pain for long-term gain,” Seitchik said.

Republicans running in the midterms “are simply going to have to weather the storm.”

“There’s no magic to get around it,” Seitchik said. “All we can do is make Americans see the long-term benefit.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/ImmigrationCrackdown_Mueller_AP_AdamGray.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-18 17:57:36.229039

“We are following the exact same investigative and review process that we always have under ICE and under the Department of Homeland Security and within the administration,” Noem said in an interview on CBS News’s “Face the Nation.”

“The exact same policy that the Biden administration used, the exact same review, so we haven’t changed any of that,” she continued.

Noem pushed back on Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s (D) statement that “The only person not being investigated for the shooting of Renee Good is the federal agent who shot her.”

“I would not listen to Gov. Walz,” Noem said in response. “He has a very bad track record.”

“Face the Nation” moderator Margaret Brennan read from part of the agency’s handbook.

Brennan confirmed once again: “OK, so there is some review of his actions, is what I understand you saying there.”

Indigenous members of the Arizona House Democratic Caucus on Friday condemned what they described as the unlawful detention of a Navajo man by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

As the man at the center of the incident recounts what happened, he said the encounter left him fearful, traumatized and questioning his safety in his own homeland.

In a statement released Jan. 16, Reps. Brian Garcia of Tempe, Mae Peshlakai of Cameron and Myron Tsosie of Chinle rebuked ICE agents for detaining Peter Yazzie, a Diné, earlier this month while he was in the Phoenix area for work. The lawmakers said Yazzie was carrying valid tribal identification and a birth certificate at the time but was detained anyway.

According to the statement, Yazzie was approached by ICE agents while traveling to work in Peoria, Arizona. Media reports and a viral TikTok video shared by Yazzie prompted widespread concern and scrutiny, leading Indigenous lawmakers to publicly denounce the incident and call attention to what they described as systemic targeting of Native Americans.

“ICE agents continue to show a complete disregard for the rule of law and have absolutely no justifiable reason to go after Indigenous Tribal members,” the lawmakers wrote in their joint statement. “In case they need a history lesson, tribal members are United States citizens.”

They added that Yazzie “should never have been approached” and said that instead of being immediately released with an apology, he was “manhandled, detained and accused of lying and theft.”

Lawmakers condemn detention, call it unlawful

Federal authorities have not publicly released details of the incident. In recent days, Yazzie has shared his account on social media, describing being detained by multiple law enforcement vehicles in Phoenix.

Yazzie said he often sleeps in his vehicle while working in the Phoenix area during the winter months, explaining that the weather allows him to do so as he travels for construction work throughout the year.

“I’m saying that I live out of my ride because, I mean, it’s Phoenix in the wintertime. It’s perfect weather,” Yazzie said. “I do that almost every year. I work in Phoenix throughout the winter, travel in the summer times.”

He said the incident happened early in the morning as he was preparing for work.

“I start work at five, I’m up at four, and I was getting ready, putting on my work shirt, standing outside of my ride,” he said.

Yazzie said several vehicles, including Suburbans, pulled into the area one after another, with only two using lights. At first, he believed law enforcement was conducting a raid unrelated to him.

“They got out and had ‘Police’ written on the back of their vest, so I’m thinking this must be like a drug raid or something,” he said.

Yazzie said officers began yelling commands at him, ordering him to face his vehicle and place his hands on it. He said he complied immediately.

“Where I’m from, you learn that when it comes to the law, you do what you’re told. Otherwise, things escalate,” he said.

He said he watched another man forcibly removed from his truck.

“They pull another guy out of his truck, and they drag him on the ground, like literally dragged him on the ground,” Yazzie said.

Moments later, he said, officers forced him to the pavement.

“They tossed me down, knees on the back, facing the pavement,” he said.

Yazzie said he realized the encounter involved immigration enforcement only after hearing an officer identify himself.

“That’s when I heard him say, ‘immigration control,’” Yazzie said.

He said he immediately told agents that he is Navajo and had identification inside his vehicle, including his wallet, Social Security card, Certificate of Indian Blood and birth certificate.

“I’m full-blooded Native,” he said. “My wallet’s in the car. My ID’s in there. My Social Security card. The backpack in the back seat has my CIB and my birth certificate.”

Despite this, Yazzie said he was placed inside a vehicle while agents searched his car.

“They start pulling off, and I’m like, ‘Why are we leaving? You guys have my identification,’” he said.

Yazzie recounts early-morning stop, detention

Yazzie said agents accused him of stealing both the vehicle and his identity.

“They said that car came back under another name. It’s not listed under the name you gave us, which leads us to believe you stole the vehicle and you stole your identity as well,” he said. “They told me I had 24 hours for my information to come back, otherwise they’d place me with the rest of the deportation detainees.”

He said the threat left him imagining the worst.

“I’m thinking, ‘What the hell? I have a job. I have bills. I have kids,” he said. “And their response was, ‘Oh, we’ll get them next.’”

Yazzie said that at that point he stopped trying to explain himself.

“They’re not listening to me, no matter what I say,” he said.

While detained, Yazzie said he encountered other men who were also picked up while going about their daily lives.

“These were guys who, just like me, left early one morning for work or left to get dinner for their families and never came home,” he said.

He said several men asked him to notify their families if he was released.

“I don’t know if you’ve ever seen a grown man with fear and desperation in his eyes,” Yazzie said. “If that doesn’t move you, then you’re not human.”

Yazzie said he was eventually released without explanation or apology.

“They let me go. Not so much as an apology,” he said.

When he returned to his vehicle, he said it had been ransacked.

“They took everything out, ran through everything,” he said. “I had to fix up my car. I had to call my superintendent, my general foreman, my actual foreman and notify them what happened.”

He said the experience has had a lasting impact on his sense of safety.

“I’m not gonna lie. This is something that has me angry, stressed and worried,” he said. “I gotta look over my shoulder all the time now.”

He said the treatment went beyond racism.

“This is racism, but it’s beyond racism,” Yazzie said. “This is hating someone like they’re a pest or a rodent.”

He compared the experience to being dehumanized in his own homeland.

“You’re treated like a stray dog, like you don’t belong here,” he said. “And not only that, we don’t need to earn a place here. This is where we’re from.”

Yazzie said his family’s roots run deep on this land.

“This is where I was born. My parents were born, my grandparents, great-great-grandparents, all the way down the line,” he said. “We’ve never been nowhere else.”

Encounter changes sense of safety

The Arizona lawmakers echoed those sentiments in their statement, saying ICE’s actions are “making everyone less safe” and accusing Republican-supported immigration policies of violating basic rights and human dignity.

“It has to stop,” the lawmakers said.

In follow-up posts, Yazzie said the attention surrounding his story has brought both support and fear. He said people have offered him places to stay, meals and assistance, but he has remained cautious.

“I feel like I put a large target on my back,” he said. “I feel like I’ve been back in survival mode.”

He said he has changed locations nightly and remains hyper-aware of his surroundings.

“When I’m asleep in my car, I’ll hear a door shut or some kind of fast movement, and I’m just waiting for that knock at the window,” he said.

Despite the trauma, Yazzie said he continues to believe change is possible.

“I still believe we have enough humanity in us to come back from this,” he said. “To turn things around.”

Three members of the Oglala Sioux tribe were detained by ICE, and continue to remain in their custody in Minneapolis, according to their tribal officials.

Federal officials have not publicly commented on the incident. The Arizona lawmakers said they are calling for accountability and greater protections for Indigenous people who they say continue to be wrongfully targeted by immigration enforcement.

Anyone with information related to similar incidents is encouraged to contact civil rights organizations or elected representatives, said lawmakers.",https://navajotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/dq-border18.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 19:58:04.378882

One lawsuit by the ACLU has already resulted in a federal judge, Kate Menendez, issuing an order restricting what ICE agents can do when confronting peaceful protestors.

The judge's order says there can be no ICE retaliation against protestors, no detaining people without probable cause unless they are obstructing agents or committing a crime, no using pepper spray on a peaceful protest, and allowing drivers to follow ICE agents' vehicles at a safe distance. On ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan"" this Sunday morning, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the order changes nothing about how federal agents are conducting their business in Minnesota.

Another development is that the U.S. Justice Department has opened criminal investigations into Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey for allegedly obstructing the work of federal agents.

Appearing on WCCO Sunday Morning with Esme Murphy, Attorney General Keith Ellison called this latter investigation ""from the playbook.""

""This is the president who is persecuting Jerome Powell of the Fed, who tried to prosecute James Comey of the FBI, and the current attorney general of New York, Letitia James. He uses the criminal justice system to persecute the people he doesn't like,"" Ellison said.

The second federal lawsuit against ICE was filed late last week by the state of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. It seeks to stop ICE activity throughout the state. The lawsuit argues the unprecedented surge of an estimated 3,000 federal agents is endangering citizens. It accuses ICE of violating the First and Tenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.

That lawsuit argues that President Trump is retaliating against Gov. Tim Walz, who ran against Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance on Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris' ticket, for his objections to ICE activity.

""What the federal government needs to do is leave and stop the surge,"" Ellison said.

The Tenth Amendment protects states' sovereignty and limits federal powers to those granted in the U.S. Constitution. It provides autonomy to the states in issues like education, elections and public safety. While Ellison is optimistic, some legal experts think the lawsuit is a long shot because it would be similar to telling the FBI it could not operate in the state.

The state, in this second lawsuit, is seeking an immediate temporary restraining order limiting ICE activities. The judge in the case is Kate Menendez, the same judge who issued that first order favorable to peaceful protestors. The judge said last week she would not issue the temporary restraining order until she heard a response from the federal government. That response is due to be filed at 5 p.m. Monday, which is the federal Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/18/454ef978-d6d2-43d0-8b1d-d216d2fde6fa/thumbnail/1200x630/bf35a562013bb6332b90700dad4b5214/gettyimages-2256249848.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 17:57:59.089111

“They will push our core European allies further away while doing nothing to advance US national security,” Murkowski maintained.
Meanwhile, the Republican US House member Michael McCaul expressed similar concerns, cautioning that a US military intervention in Greenland would probably spell disaster for the Nato alliance.
That is why he has repeatedly floated multiple ways of acquiring Greenland, ranging from purchasing the territory to the possibility of a military takeover.
Nonetheless, former US House speaker Newt Gingrich was one Republican who seemed unconcerned about Trump’s approach.","Donald Trump’s escalating calls for the United States to seize or otherwise obtain Greenland has ignited fresh criticism from the president’s own Republican party, with some saying it could hurt the US economically or strain the Nato military alliance.

Such Republicans included US senators Thom Tillis and Lisa Murkowski, who were part of a bipartisan group to travel to Denmark to discuss concerns in Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory.

Both Tillis and Murkowski sharply criticized new tariffs threatened on Saturday by Trump on a slew of European countries – including Denmark, Germany, France and the UK – until the US is allowed to purchase Greenland.

Murkowski wrote on X that the tariffs were “unnecessary, punitive, and a profound mistake”, coming after Nato allies deployed troops in Greenland on Thursday in response to Trump’s threats to forcefully take the Arctic island if needed.

“They will push our core European allies further away while doing nothing to advance US national security,” Murkowski maintained. “We are already seeing the consequences of these measures in real time: our Nato allies are being forced to divert attention and resources to Greenland, a dynamic that plays directly into [Russian leader Vladimir] Putin’s hands by threatening the stability of the strongest coalition of democracies the world has ever seen.”

She urged Congress to exercise its authority over tariffs to ensure they are “not weaponized in ways that harm our alliances and undermine American leadership”.

Tillis, for his part, wrote on X: “This response to our own allies for sending a small number of troops to Greenland for training is bad for America, bad for American businesses, and bad for America’s allies. It’s great for Putin, [Chinese leader] Xi [Jiping] and other adversaries who want to see Nato divided.”

Tillis added that “actively pushing for coercive action to seize territory of an ally is beyond stupid”.

“It hurts the legacy of President Trump and undercuts all the work he has done to strengthen the Nato alliance over the years,” Tillis maintained.

Mike Pence, the US vice-president during Trump’s first White House term, separately said he believed “the current posture … does threaten to fracture that strong relationship, not just with Denmark, but with all of our Nato allies”.

“Denmark is a very strong ally of the United States of American,” Pence said Sunday on CNN’s State of the Union.

Meanwhile, the Republican US House member Michael McCaul expressed similar concerns, cautioning that a US military intervention in Greenland would probably spell disaster for the Nato alliance.

Appearing on ABC’s This Week, McCaul said: “The fact is, the president has full military access to Greenland to protect us from any threat” that could materialize on the Arctic island.

“So, if he wants to purchase Greenland, that’s one thing,” he continued. “But for him to militarily invade would turn … Nato on its very head and, in essence, press a war with Nato itself. It would end up abolishing Nato as we know it.”

Trump has repeatedly argued that US control of the island is necessary for national security, pointing to concerns about Russia and China expanding their influence in the Arctic. That is why he has repeatedly floated multiple ways of acquiring Greenland, ranging from purchasing the territory to the possibility of a military takeover.

During a Sunday appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press, Republican US senator Rand Paul weighed in, saying it “ridiculous” to portray Greenland as some urgent situation.

“There’s no emergency with Greenland,” Paul said.

Trump has insisted that Denmark cannot be relied upon to protect Greenland in the case of a confrontation with China or Russia, even as he has also said that “something will work out” with respect to the future governance of the Danish territory.

The goal of the bipartisan delegation of US lawmakers who traveled to meet with Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen was to emphasize the Republican dissent to any suggestion that the United States should forcefully seize Greenland.

Polling also shows a substantial majority of Americans oppose taking control of the island.

Nonetheless, former US House speaker Newt Gingrich was one Republican who seemed unconcerned about Trump’s approach.

Gingrich went on Sunday’s Cats Roundtable radio program and called Trump’s posture with Greenland “a lot of noise to set up a negotiation to get what he wants”.

That “is tourist rights, economic rights, mineral rights and national security rights”, Gingrich said.

Gingrich pointed to Greenland’s abundance of natural resources and noted that China, Russia and the US all have an interest in accessing its minerals. He also called Greenland’s oil and gas reserves “a huge economic opportunity”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7cc9c3ff5d5cee2fddc4c47ef39c344dab03d2a/639_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=663dab34da0603d7b41b99cae84c3a73",N,,2026-01-18 14:57:24.932607

He has also not ruled out stripping Americans who immigrated to the country from Somalia of their citizenship.After the killing of Renee Good by an ICE officer last week, Landsman had already previously taken to social media to speak out against federal immigration enforcement's highly visible presence in Minneapolis and other American cities, calling it a bad law enforcement strategy.""They’re pulling resources from our border and immigration system, and failing to stop violent and dangerous criminals,"" said Landsman of ICE's efforts in Minneapolis. ""Instead, they’re targeting law-abiding, legal immigrant and asylum seekers – people who have been in the country and contributing for decades – and disrupting our economy and communities.""Landsman continued by saying that comprehensive immigration reform is needed in the country, and that he believes that immigrants deserve to be treated ""humanely and with dignity"" by the federal government. Landsman, a Democrat, has been a member of Congress since 2023. He is up for reelection this year, where his race is expected to be one of the most hotly contested in the country after Ohio redrew its congressional maps last year to make the state's 1st Congressional District more competitive.

Ohio Rep. Greg Landsman says that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers should leave the city of Minneapolis.

In a statement, Landsman said on Saturday that ICE is provoking chaos in the city, and that operations are intentionally being conducted in a manner that is designed to rile up city residents.

""ICE should immediately withdraw from Minneapolis before more innocent Americans are hurt,"" said Landsman. ""They murdered Renee Good, tear gassed an infant, shut down schools, established 'checkpoints' in an American city, and continue to intentionally incite chaos and violence.""

Landsman continued by saying that the best thing for law enforcement to do to restore peace to the city is for ICE to leave, adding that the Minneapolis Police Department is being unfairly burdened by federal officers' continued presence.

""What they are doing is not only dangerous to American citizens but also incredibly disrespectful to local law enforcement whose job has been made infinitely more difficult because of ICE’s chaos and violence – which ends when they leave,"" he continued. ""For the sake of law and order and the safety of innocent Americans, ICE must immediately withdraw from Minneapolis.""

ICE officers have been stationed en masse in the city at the request of President Donald Trump since December, when fraud scandals involving day cares throughout Minnesota began to spark national attention. Nearly 100 people have been charged in connection with the alleged crimes, most of whom are of Somali descent.

Trump has since used highly inflammatory and racially-tinged rhetoric over the past month to refer to the immigrant community in the city, calling Somalis ""garbage"" who ""contribute nothing"" to the United States. He has also not ruled out stripping Americans who immigrated to the country from Somalia of their citizenship.

After the killing of Renee Good by an ICE officer last week, Landsman had already previously taken to social media to speak out against federal immigration enforcement's highly visible presence in Minneapolis and other American cities, calling it a bad law enforcement strategy.

""They’re pulling resources from our border and immigration system, and failing to stop violent and dangerous criminals,"" said Landsman of ICE's efforts in Minneapolis. ""Instead, they’re targeting law-abiding, legal immigrant and asylum seekers – people who have been in the country and contributing for decades – and disrupting our economy and communities.""

Landsman continued by saying that comprehensive immigration reform is needed in the country, and that he believes that immigrants deserve to be treated ""humanely and with dignity"" by the federal government.

Momentum in Democratic-led states for the measures, some of them proposed for years, is growing as legislatures return to work following the killing of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer. But Republicans are pushing back, blaming protesters for impeding the enforcement of immigration laws.

Democratic bills seek to limit ICE

Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul wants New York to allow people to sue federal officers alleging violations of their constitutional rights. Another measure aims to keep immigration officers lacking judicial warrants out of schools, hospitals and houses of worship.

Oregon Democrats plan to introduce a bill to allow residents to sue federal officers for violating their Fourth Amendment rights against unlawful search and seizure.

New Jersey's Democrat-led Legislature passed three bills Monday that immigrant rights groups have long pushed for, including a measure prohibiting state law enforcement officers from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy has until his last day in office Tuesday to sign or veto them.

California lawmakers are proposing to ban local and state law enforcement from taking second jobs with the Department of Homeland Security and make it a violation of state law when ICE officers make ""indiscriminate"" arrests around court appearances. Other measures are pending.

""Where you have government actions with no accountability, that is not true democracy,"" Democratic state Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco said at a news conference.

Democrats also push bills in red states

Democrats in Georgia introduced four Senate bills designed to limit immigration enforcement — a package unlikely to become law because Georgia's conservative upper chamber is led by Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, a close Trump ally. Democrats said it is still important to take a stand.

""Donald Trump has unleashed brutal aggression on our families and our communities across our country,"" said state Sen. Sheikh Rahman, an immigrant from Bangladesh whose district in suburban Atlanta's Gwinnett County is home to many immigrants.

Democrats in New Hampshire have proposed numerous measures seeking to limit federal immigration enforcement, but the state's Republican majorities passed a new law taking effect this month that bans ""sanctuary cities.""

Tennessee GOP works with White House

The bills Tennessee Republicans are introducing appear to require government agencies to check the legal status of all residents before they can obtain public benefits; secure licenses for teaching, nursing and other professions; and get driver's licenses or register their cars.

They also would include verifying K-12 students' legal status, which appears to conflict with a U.S. Supreme Court precedent. And they propose criminalizing illegal entry as a misdemeanor, a measure similar to several other states' requirements, some of which are blocked in court.

""We're going to do what we can to make sure that if you're here illegally, we will have the data, we'll have the transparency, and we're not spending taxpayer dollars on you unless you're in jail,"" House Speaker Cameron Sexton said at a news conference Thursday.

Trump administration sues to stop laws

The Trump administration has opposed any effort to blunt ICE, including suing local governments whose ""sanctuary"" policies limit police interactions with federal officers.

States have broad power to regulate within their borders unless the U.S. Constitution bars it, but many of these laws raise novel issues that courts will have to sort out, said Harrison Stark, senior counsel with the State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin Law School.

""There's not a super clear, concrete legal answer to a lot of these questions,"" he said. ""It's almost guaranteed there will be federal litigation over a lot of these policies.""

That is already happening.

California in September was the first to ban most law enforcement officers, including federal immigration officers, from covering their faces on duty. The Justice Department said its officers won't comply and sued California, arguing that the laws threaten the safety of officers who are facing ""unprecedented"" harassment, doxing and violence.

The Justice Department also sued Illinois last month, challenging a law that bars federal civil arrests near courthouses, protects medical records and regulates how universities and day care centers manage information about immigration status. The Justice Department claims the law is unconstitutional and threatens federal officers' safety.

Targeted states push back

Minnesota and Illinois, joined by their largest cities, sued the Trump administration this past week. Minneapolis and Minnesota accuse the Republican administration of violating free speech rights by punishing a progressive state that favors Democrats and welcomes immigrants. Illinois and Chicago claim ""Operation Midway Blitz"" made residents afraid to leave their homes.

Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin accused Minnesota officials of ignoring public safety and called the Illinois lawsuit ""baseless.""

— Terik Hashmi, immigration attorney with International Law Group

WASHINGTON DC, DC, UNITED STATES, January 18, 2026 /EINPresswire.com/ — U.S. immigration law firm International Law Group (ILG) announced today that it is offering rapid-response immigration consultations for Venezuelan nationals and families in the Washington, DC, Maryland, and Virginia (DMV) area who are facing heightened immigration enforcement, status uncertainty, or expiring protections.

Recent federal actions and policy changes by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) have created widespread confusion and anxiety among Venezuelans, particularly those relying on Temporary Protected Status (TPS), pending asylum applications, work permits, or other humanitarian and employment-based immigration benefits. Increased data reviews, background checks, Requests for Evidence (RFEs), Notices to Appear, and referrals to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have made early legal review critical.

“Many Venezuelans in the DMV area are understandably worried about what these changes mean for their families, jobs, and futures,” said Terik Hashmi, senior attorney at International Law Group. “Our message is simple: don’t panic, but don’t wait. Ignoring a notice or assuming nothing will happen can be a serious mistake. Early legal guidance can significantly change the outcome.”

To meet urgent demand, International Law Group is offering confidential Zoom consultations, including evenings and weekends, to quickly assess risk, explain options, and help clients respond appropriately to government action.

International Law Group services include:

• Emergency Zoom consultations (available nationwide)

• Review of USCIS, DHS, and ICE notices

• TPS status review and transition strategies

• Asylum and humanitarian case audits

• Work permit (EAD) and Green Card planning

• ICE encounter preparedness and rights counseling

International Law Group has decades of experience representing immigrants in high-stakes, time-sensitive cases, including those involving sudden policy shifts, enforcement actions, and humanitarian crises.

Adds Mike Meier, senior attorney at International Law Group: “Consultations are confidential and designed for urgent situations. We strongly encourage Venezuelan community members in Washington, DC, Maryland, and Virginia who have received notices, whose TPS or work authorization is expiring, or who are unsure about their current status to speak with an experienced immigration attorney immediately.”

Transcript: Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan""

A federal judge on Friday blocked federal law enforcement from using pepper spray or nonlethal munitions on peaceful protesters as demonstrations continue. The judge also barred federal agents from stopping or detaining drivers and passengers when there is ""no reasonable articulable suspicion"" that people driving near protests are forcibly interfering with law enforcement operations.

On Sunday, Noem called the order ""a little ridiculous.""

""We only use those chemical agents when there's violence happening and perpetuating and you need to be able to establish law and order to keep people safe,"" Noem said. ""So that judge's order didn't change anything for how we're operating on the ground, because it's basically telling us to do what we've already been doing.""

Thousands of federal agents have been deployed to the Minneapolis area in recent weeks for immigration enforcement operations and to investigate fraud allegations in the state. Federal law enforcement agents have faced allegations of using aggressive tactics.

Noem put the blame on protesters and local leaders for violent incidents, including one in which a couple said they and their six children were tear-gassed while driving home from basketball practice.

""That family was caught up in that situation because of violent protesters that were impeding law enforcement operations, and that family would have never been in that situation if those protesters had been acting peacefully and law enforcement was able to do their job without being threatened,"" the secretary said.

Noem said ""the mayor and the governor have allowed this kind of violence to be perpetuated across Minneapolis,"" claiming it's ""why there's other innocent people that are impacted throughout the city.""

The administration has faced renewed scrutiny and ramped-up protests after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent fatally shot Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month. Last week, Senate Democrats on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee urged the GOP chairman to call Noem and White House border czar Tom Homan to testify before the panel.

Noem said Sunday that Good ""weaponized her car and threatened the life of a law enforcement officer and those around him."" She said the 37-year-old woman was ""impeding law enforcement operations for quite some time before this incident happened,"" while saying the incident was a ""tragedy."" She added that the officer ""relied on his training to defend his life and to defend those around him.""

Asked whether the agency was conducting a review of the agent who shot Good, Noem said, ""We are following the exact same investigative and review process that we always have under ICE and under the Department of Homeland Security and within the administration.""",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/18/edf04c16-ba1d-4629-bf3d-0734361dbf88/thumbnail/1200x630/714a0d3d1a59cc46e31671a3199faf8e/noem-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 15:57:44.324253

In the CBS News/YouGov poll conducted late last week, 61 percent of respondents say the way ICE is conducting its operations when it stops or detains people is “too tough,” while 15 percent say it’s “not tough enough.” Another 24 percent say it’s “about right.” That marks a shift from a similar poll released at the start of November, when 53 percent said ICE operations were too tough, and 17 percent said they were not tough enough.
Among Republicans, the share who say ICE has been too tough in its conduct ticked up 4 points, to 19 percent, in the latest poll.

That marks a shift from a similar poll released at the start of November, when 53 percent said ICE operations were too tough, and 17 percent said they were not tough enough.

The shift comes mostly from Democrats and independents, both of which saw a 9-percentage point increase in the share who say the way ICE has conducted its operations has been too tough — to 94 percent and 68 percent, respectively.

Among Republicans, the share who say ICE has been too tough in its conduct ticked up 4 points, to 19 percent, in the latest poll.

Similarly, the latest poll shows Americans are increasingly doubting the administration’s claims that it is prioritizing “dangerous criminals” in deporting migrants who are living in the country illegally.

Today, 56 percent of people say the Trump administration is prioritizing for deportation “people who aren’t dangerous criminals,” up from 52 percent in the November poll.

Overall support for Trump’s program to deport immigrants are in the country illegally has dropped, from 52 percent in the November poll to 46 percent now.

The poll was conducted a week after an ICE officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good during a standoff with protesters in Minneapolis. The Trump administration maintains the officer acted in self-defense and feared for his life, pointing to video footage it says shows Good was using her car to threaten his life. Critics, however, say the footage shows Good was trying to drive away from the officer, not run him over.

On Wednesday, the first day of the three-day poll, another ICE officer shot and injured a Venezuelan migrant in Minneapolis after the officer was allegedly attacked when following the target on foot after he fled a traffic stop.

This time around, it would behoove us to pay attention to his powerful 1967 speech at Riverside Church, “Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence,” opposing the war in Vietnam.

The moral principles he affirmed, with Rabbi Abraham Heschel, himself a great moral leader, at his side, apply with piercing relevance to the upheaval facing our democracy today.

State terrorism against the immigrant community confronts us daily. Agents with face masks and no identification inflict harm on families as men masked with white hoods once did when perpetrating evil on the nation’s minority communities.

People have been killed, families broken up, and small children handcuffed. There has been long-term detention in disgusting facilities, and people dispatched to countries which are foreign to them. We see attacks on boats, killing people with impunity. Congress is lamer than ever in asserting the rule of law.

Amnesty protections have been abandoned, regardless of how severe the persecution and oppression that immigrant families had to flee or the economic disaster they faced. There have been mass deportations, no matter how many years immigrants have lived as our neighbors and supported our country. Never mind the risk to them if they return to their former homeland.

Dismantling the safety net for vulnerable America’s seniors and poor is underway. The world’s wealthiest country now denies aid to poor countries facing immeasurable poverty and rampant violence. Free speech and dissent are on the Administration’s and Texas Governor Greg Abbott’s chopping block.

We are replicating those dark days of American history from which we thought we had emerged.

Fort Bliss in El Paso, a major immigrant detention facility, was a Japanese internment site 80 years ago. The national security rhetoric used to justify mass incarceration today is the same used for the forced removal and incarceration of Japanese Americans.

The Administration’s actions are against people of color—the same grievance Dr. King articulated about the Vietnam war.

Dr. King understood the retaliation he would suffer for his speech, but his moral challenge to the government was necessary, and correct. He lost significant support among white allies, including President Johnson, and the powerful media. His popularity sank because he did not stick to the “civil rights script” expected of him.

Howard Thurman, the premier Black theologian, in his 1946 essay, “The Fascist Masquerade,” faulted the Christian church for “the bitter truth” of permitting hate-inspired groups … to establish squatter’s rights in the middle of believers because there has been no adequate teaching on the meaning of faith, the faith in terms of human dignity and human worth.”

Faith groups are finally heading his warning. For religious folks, as for non-believers, this current struggle is about the inherent dignity of people and fairness, or, as Pope Leo has forcefully framed it, the core values of democracy.

At a January 9th candlelight vigil for Renee Nicole Good, two days are an ICE agent killed her, Bishop Rob Hirschfeld of the Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire announced he had advised his clergy, “that we may be entering into that same witness,” and to get their affairs in order and write their wills because “it may be that now is no longer the time for statements, but for us, with our bodies, to stand between the powers of this world, and the most vulnerable.”

Dr. King put his body on the line, as had countless others for a more just society.

For Dr. King’s holiday this year, we must jettison our comfort zone and not rest on the laurels we thought that society had accomplished, but which our federal and state governments are steadfastly discarding with abandon.

The call for us is to accept that moral challenge and shed our complacency and, as Dr. King put it in 1967, “go down the path of protest and dissent, working for the health of our land” before “America's soul becomes totally poisoned.”

It is time to break silence and put our bodies on the line.

To find out, I sat down with immigration attorney Adriana Pereyra of Integrity Law Firm, who says what's happening in Southern Nevada isn't always visible.

""How often are we seeing this? Is this happening a lot more often than what people are actually realizing?"" I asked.

""Yes, it definitely is. Even my clients who are detained have told me, you know, they bring 10-15 people a day, just in Henderson detention center,"" Pereyra said.

Here's why that matters: Under federal immigration law, ICE has the authority, including through what's called the 287(G) program, to operate with local jails. ICE can identify and take into federal custody people who were booked into jail.

""ICE is still very involved here in our community?"" I asked.

""Absolutely they're just doing it in a different way that is not so public,"" Pereyra said

.According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security website, ICE also maintains holding facilities in Southern Nevada, including the Henderson Detention Center and the Nevada Southern Detention Center, where people taken into ICE custody can be detained for immigration proceedings.

When the justices on Wednesday consider the legality of his bid to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, their willingness to preserve the U.S. central bank's independence will be ​put to the test.

With control over U.S. monetary policy at stake, the legal battle over Trump's attempt to remove Cook marks the second case involving an action by the Republican president of vast economic significance ‌to reach the Supreme Court during its current term, which began in October.

Make sense of the latest ESG trends affecting companies and governments with the Reuters Sustainable Switch newsletter. Sign up here.

The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, heard arguments in November concerning Trump's sweeping global tariffs, with justices indicating skepticism over the lawfulness of these import taxes on nearly every U.S. trading partner imposed under a law meant for use in national emergencies. Its rulings in the tariffs and Cook cases are expected by the end of June but could come sooner.

The court has been largely deferential to Trump in a series of rulings on an emergency basis since his return to office 12 months ago as he repeatedly tests the limits of presidential authority. The justices, however, may be less eager to strengthen Trump's hand over the economy.

""I think they worry about the effect that removal of central ‌bank independence could have on the economy,"" said John Yoo, who served as a Justice Department lawyer under Republican former President George W. Bush.

""It seems a basic principle of macroeconomics, ​backed up by the experience of other countries, that political control over the money supply, interest rates and central banking will inevitably lead to inflation,"" said Yoo, now a University of California, Berkeley law professor.

According to legal scholars, the court has not been so directly involved in U.S. economic policy since the justices weighed the constitutionality of Democratic President Franklin Roosevelt's muscular agenda called the New Deal during the 1930s amid the crisis of the Great Depression.

'NOT UNBOUNDED'

Columbia Law School professor Kathryn ‍Judge said the fights involving Fed independence and Trump's tariffs ""will be key in determining the scope of the president's authority to unilaterally determine economic policy.""

""This Supreme Court has taken a very expansive approach to executive authority,"" Judge said, ""but it is not unbounded.""

Cook, an appointee of Democratic former President Joe Biden and the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, sued Trump in August after he sought to fire her, an unprecedented step by a president against a central bank official. Trump claims that Cook committed mortgage fraud before being appointed to the ⁠Fed by his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden in 2022, an allegation she denied and described as a pretext to try to remove her for her monetary policy stance.

Similarly, Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Sunday called a criminal investigation of him launched by ‍Trump's Justice Department a pretext to gain more influence over the central bank and monetary policy. The investigation centers on Powell's congressional testimony about a Fed building project.

Critics see the steps by Trump and his administration targeting Cook and Powell as a bid to ‌pressure the Fed ‌to lower interest rates before the November midterm elections in which Democrats are hoping to regain control of Congress from the Republicans. Pocketbook concerns may loom large for voters.

""With each passing day - and with each passing attack by the Trump administration - I suspect that the court increasingly sees the value of an independent Fed,"" University of Illinois Chicago law professor Steve Schwinn said.

Yoo added that ""Trump is not helping his own case with the Department of Justice's implausible criminal investigation"" of Powell.

REMOVAL PROTECTIONS

Cook has said Trump's allegations of mortgage fraud did not empower him to remove her under the Federal Reserve Act, the law that created the central bank in 1913. Aiming to insulate the Fed's decision-making from politics, Congress included provisions constraining a president's ability ⁠to fire a Fed governor, allowing removal only for adequate ""cause,"" ⁠not policy differences.

A Washington-based federal judge ruled that Trump's ​claims were likely insufficient grounds to fire Cook. A federal appeals court in Washington denied Trump's request to halt the judge's ruling, prompting his request to the Supreme Court.

Legal analysts said the justices have offered recent clues signaling their interest in protecting the Fed's independence. For instance, they allowed Cook to remain in her post as the case plays out after allowing Trump to remove officials from other agencies with similar tenure protections while those cases proceed.

Last May, the court let Trump fire two Democratic members of federal labor boards ‍while challenges to their removals continue in lower courts. In that ruling, called Trump v. Wilcox, the court sought to allay concerns that letting the president fire officials from federal labor boards would imperil the independence of the Fed.

""We disagree,"" the court wrote in an unsigned opinion. ""The Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.""

Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California, Berkeley ‍Law School, said the court's interest in protecting Fed independence likely will be very important as it weighs Cook's case.

""In Trump v. Wilcox, the court discussed the Fed being different even though it had nothing to do with that case,"" Chemerinsky added.

RELATED: Judge rules feds in Minneapolis immigration operation can’t detain or tear gas peaceful protesters

“I think it lays out some ground rules going forward for ICE to operate within,” says Ryan Wood, a former chief immigration court judge. “It really lays out the framework for future court actions for violating those court orders.”

The decision, by U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez, prohibits federal immigration agents in Minnesota from arresting, detaining or retaliating against peaceful protesters or observers.

They also can’t use pepper spray or other non-lethal munitions against them.

“These are just some of the foundational and fundamental principles under which any law enforcement operation really needs to abide,” notes Jessica West, a professor at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law. “I think her goal was to start the process of having a dialogue between law enforcement and the courts about what is and what is not permissible.”

But the injunction goes further.

It says federal officers can’t stop or detain drivers or passengers in vehicles with no reasonable suspicion that they’re forcibly obstructing or interfering with agents.

That includes those following at an “appropriate distance.”

Wood says he’s concerned about clarity in the ruling.

“These are all messy situations,” he explains. “What does it mean to have a reasonable distance between a protester and an arrest incident? What does it mean to have a reasonable distance by an ICE vehicle and a vehicle that’s following it?”

The ruling follows a case filed in December by six Minnesota activist-observers, represented by the ACLU.

RELATED: ACLU sues ICE, claiming federal agents deprived citizens of civil rights

Their argument — that government officers are violating the constitutional rights of Twin Cities residents.

West believes the government will appeal, but she says there’s an opportunity for the Department of Homeland Security as well.

“One potential way the government could take this is to start to not only train and hand this order out to their officers on the ground,” she notes. “To start to correct information about who’s doing what, where, when, and hold some of those people accountable; to change the culture a little bit.”

After the ruling, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the agency is taking “appropriate and constitutional measures to uphold the rule of law and protect our officers and the public from dangerous rioters. We remind the public that rioting is dangerous — obstructing law enforcement is a federal crime and assaulting law enforcement is a felony.”

The statement went on to say: “Rioters and terrorists have assaulted law enforcement, launched fireworks at them, slashed the tires of their vehicles, and vandalized federal property. Others have chosen to ignore commands and have attempted to impede law enforcement operations and used their vehicles as weapons against our officers. Despite these grave threats and dangerous situations, our law enforcement as followed their training and used the minimum amount of force necessary to protect themselves, the public, and federal property.”

The judge ordered the federal government to inform all officers about the ruling within 72 hours as of Friday night.

So far, DHS has not commented on whether there would be an appeal to the ruling and what the process would be to get information about it to officers in the field.

Wood says he hopes the judge’s ruling will make a difference.

“I think this one might have more legs and really provide some careful guardrails for ICE to operate within,” he notes. “I’m hopeful that this court decision will provide some guidance to them, education as to the boundaries and the elements of impeding federal law enforcement officers.”",https://kstp.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FED-JUDGE-PROTEST-RULING_PKG_KSTPb6fa_146_mxf_00.00.06.42.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 10:58:04.723785

Meanwhile, Republicans overwhelmingly feel the protesters have gone too far.

In the wake of events in Minneapolis, overall support for the deportation program — which has roughly divided the nation for months — has dipped even as it continues to draw strong backing from Republicans and especially strong backing from MAGA.

And in sum, the public expresses a difference between how they see the goals of the deportation program and how it's being carried out.

There are shifting perceptions of who is being targeted by the program. Americans are increasingly likely to say the administration isn't prioritizing dangerous criminals, and most think the administration is trying to deport more people than they thought it would.

So, as Americans look overall, a slight majority feel ICE is making the communities where it is conducting operations less safe, many more than feel it's improving safety.

Over the course of the term, overall approval of the deportation program started net positively, became more divided over the summer, and then hovered near that division for months. In the wake of events in Minneapolis, it dropped to its lowest overall mark of the term.

More people like what they believe the program's goals are than like the approach being taken. The former is mixed, while the latter is negative.

Overall, Mr. Trump's approval on handling immigration has also ticked down to its lowest point of his second term, though it continues to outpace his approval on the economy and inflation.

Views on the shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent in Minneapolis hew closely to party lines. Republicans tend to call it justified, while Democrats and independents say it was not. Most also say that they don't believe the administration's response to it has been fair.

Non-MAGA Republicans are less inclined than MAGA to call the shooting justified.

Thinking about what should be next for ICE, the recent events in Minneapolis appear to have at least partially reinforced preexisting views about the deportation program. Democrats say recent events mean ICE operations in the U.S. should be decreased, though they already opposed the program. Republicans either say it means operations should be increased or kept the same; they've long favored the program.

Looking overseas to Greenland and Iran

Looking overseas, with widespread opposition to the prospect of military action in Greenland or Iran, a majority of Americans appear pessimistic about what Mr. Trump's policies might bring in terms of peace and stability in 2026.

Most Americans think the U.S. does have strategic interests in Iran, but they are more divided on whether or not it has moral responsibilities there.

Most don't think the U.S. has effective plans for military action there, and two-thirds feel it would be a long and costly involvement. Those sentiments are closely connected to opposition to the idea of force.

The idea of using military force to take Greenland faces overwhelming opposition across party lines, including most MAGA Republicans, who say they would disapprove. For context, they have largely backed the president after he has taken military actions, including in Venezuela and the strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities last year.

Whether they support military action in Greenland and Iran or not, most Republicans do think Mr. Trump has made the U.S. position in the world stronger.

What do Americans think would happen if the U.S. took Greenland by force?

Some think taking Greenland would constitute a show of force to Russia and China, and just over half think it would provide access to needed natural resources. But large majorities also think it would cause the U.S. to leave the NATO alliance and create instability in the world.

Views about the latter two implications are very closely associated with opposition to the idea.

The group has published dozens of press statements in recent weeks accusing Democrats of wanting to abolish ICE — even those who haven’t made direct statements using the phrase.
Laura Hernandez, executive director of Freedom for Immigrants, a California-based organization that advocates for the closure of detention centers, said the increase in lawmakers calling to abolish ICE is long overdue.

She pointed out that alongside ICE agents have been Border Patrol, FBI and ATF agents.","“Abolish ICE.”

Democratic lawmakers and candidates for office around the country increasingly are returning to the phrase, popularized during the first Trump administration, as they react to this administration’s forceful immigration enforcement tactics.

The fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent this month in Minneapolis sparked immediate outrage among Democratic officials, who proposed a variety of oversight demands — including abolishing the agency — to rein in tactics they view as hostile and sometimes illegal.

Resurrecting the slogan is perhaps the riskiest approach. Republicans pounced on the opportunity to paint Democrats, especially those in vulnerable seats, as extremists.

“If their response is to dust off ‘defund ICE,’ we’re happy to take that fight any day of the week,” said Christian Martinez, a spokesperson for the National Republican Congressional Committee. The group has published dozens of press statements in recent weeks accusing Democrats of wanting to abolish ICE — even those who haven’t made direct statements using the phrase.

Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Corona) amplified that message Wednesday, writing on social media that “When Democrats say they want to abolish or defund ICE, what they are really saying is they want to go back to the open borders policies of the Biden administration. The American people soundly rejected that idea in the 2024 election.”

The next day, Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Mich.) introduced the “Abolish ICE Act,” stating that Good’s killing “proved that ICE is out of control and beyond reform.” The bill would rescind the agency’s “unobligated” funding and redirect other assets to its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security.

Many Democrats calling for an outright elimination of ICE come from the party’s progressive wing. Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) said in a television interview the agency should be abolished because actions taken by its agents are “racist” and “rogue.” Jack Schlossberg, who is running for a House seat in New York, said that “if Trump’s ICE is shooting and kidnapping people, then abolish it.”

Other prominent progressives have stopped short of saying the agency should be dismantled.

Sen. Alex Padilla, (D-Calif.) who last year was forcefully handcuffed and removed from a news conference hosted by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, joined a protest in Washington to demand justice for Good, saying “It’s time to get ICE and CBP out,” referring to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

“This is a moment where all of us have to be forceful to ensure that we are pushing back on what is an agency right now that is out of control,” Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said on social media. “We have to be loud and clear that ICE is not welcome in our communities.”

Others have eyed negotiations over the yearly Homeland Security budget as a leverage point to incorporate their demands, such as requiring federal agents to remove their masks and to turn on their body-worn cameras when on duty, as well as calling for agents who commit crimes on the job to be prosecuted. Seventy House Democrats, including at least 13 from California, backed a measure to impeach Noem.

Rep. Mike Levin (D-San Diego), who serves on the House Committee on Appropriations, said his focus is not on eliminating the agency, which he believes has an “important responsibility” but has been led astray by Noem.

He said Noem should be held to account for her actions through congressional oversight hearings, not impeachment — at least not while Republicans would be in control of the proceedings, since he believes House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) would make a “mockery” of them.

“I am going to use the appropriations process,” Levin said, adding that he would “continue to focus on the guardrails, regardless of the rhetoric.”

Chuck Rocha, a Democratic political strategist, said Republicans seized on the abolitionist rhetoric as a scare tactic to distract from the rising cost of living, which remains another top voter concern.

“They hope to distract [voters] by saying, ‘Sure, we’re going to get better on the economy — but these Democrats are still crazy,’” he said.

Democrats have for years struggled to put forward a unified vision on immigration — one of the top issues that won President Trump a return to the White House. Any deal to increase guardrails on Homeland Security faces an uphill battle in the Republican-controlled Congress, leaving many proposals years away from the possibility of fruition. Even if Democrats manage to block the yearly funding bill, the agency still has tens of billions of dollars from Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Still, the roving raids, violent clashes with protesters and detentions and deaths of U.S. citizens and immigrants alike increased the urgency many lawmakers feel to do something.

Two centrist groups released memos last week written by former Homeland Security officials under the Biden administration urging Democrats to avoid the polarizing language and instead channel their outrage into specific reforms.

“Every call to abolish ICE risks squandering one of the clearest opportunities in years to secure meaningful reform of immigration enforcement — while handing Republicans exactly the fight they want,” wrote the authors of one memo, from the Washington-based think tank Third Way.

“Advocating for abolishing ICE is tantamount to advocating for stopping enforcement of all of our immigration laws in the interior of the United States — a policy position that is both wrong on the merits and at odds with the American public on the issue,” wrote Blas Nuñez-Neto, a senior policy fellow at the new think tank the Searchlight Institute who previously was assistant Homeland Security secretary.

Roughly 46% of Americans said they support the idea of abolishing ICE, while 43% are opposed, according to a YouGov/Economist poll released last week.

Sarah Pierce, a former policy analyst at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services who co-wrote the Third Way memo, said future polls might show less support for abolishing the agency, particularly if the question is framed as a choice among options including reforms such as banning agents from wearing masks or requiring use of body cameras.

“There’s no doubt there will be further tragedies and with each, the effort to take an extreme position like abolishing ICE increases,” she said.

Laura Hernandez, executive director of Freedom for Immigrants, a California-based organization that advocates for the closure of detention centers, said the increase in lawmakers calling to abolish ICE is long overdue.

“We need lawmakers to use their power to stop militarized raids, to close detention centers and we need them to shut down ICE and CBP,” she said. “This violence that people are seeing on television is not new, it’s literally built into the DNA of DHS.”

Cinthya Martinez, a UC Santa Cruz professor who has studied the movement to abolish ICE, noted that it stems from the movement to abolish prisons. The abolition part, she said, is watered down by mainstream politicians even as some liken immigration agents to modern-day slave patrols.

Martinez said the goal is about more than simply getting rid of one agency or redirecting its duties to another. She pointed out that alongside ICE agents have been Border Patrol, FBI and ATF agents.

“A lot of folks forget that prison abolition is to completely abolish carceral systems. It comes from a Black tradition that says prison is a continuation of slavery,” she said.

But Peter Markowitz, a law professor and co-director of the Immigration Justice Clinic at the Cardozo School of Law, said the movement to abolish ICE around 2018 among mainstream politicians was always about having effective and humane immigration enforcement, not about having none.

“But it fizzled because it didn’t have an answer to the policy question that follows: If not ICE, then what?” he said. “I hope we’re in a different position today.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6316803/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6131x3219+0+436/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa6%2F72%2F14f965e74a87aa0f7516fba88748%2Fgettyimages-2256036466.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 09:58:02.249674

It was also the first time the National Guard had showed up to protect the Department of Homeland Security in its immigration work.
The recent conflicts with local officials have alarmed some former leaders of the Department of Homeland Security.","In November 2002, President George W. Bush signed a bill creating a federal agency devoted to protecting the United States. The country was still reeling from the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington, and the threat of international terrorism permeated public life.

Among the agencies that would be included in the Department of Homeland Security, as it would be called, would be Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection — the parts of the government most responsible for enforcing federal immigration laws.

“The new department will analyze threats, will guard our borders and airports, protect our critical infrastructure, and coordinate the response of our nation for future emergencies,” Mr. Bush said at the time, adding that the department would “focus the full resources of the American government on the safety of the American people.”

But more than two decades later, as thousands of ICE and Border Patrol officers flood Minneapolis, some Democratic leaders say the department’s role appears to have strayed far from its original purpose, turning its tools of enforcement away from external threats and toward President Trump’s domestic critics.

They say enforcement has looked more like an occupation, as officers in helmets and tactical gear have faced off against hostile residents and left-wing protesters in Los Angeles, Portland, Chicago and Washington. The interactions, broadcast to the world through social media videos filmed by protesters and federal agents alike, have given the impression of a government at war with the country’s own cities.

The Department of Homeland Security “was designed to protect Americans from threats, and what we’ve essentially done is, in some cases, we’ve turned that agency on Americans,” said Mayor Keith Wilson of Portland, Ore., a Democrat. “It’s deeply unsettling.”

Mr. Wilson said he was concerned that federal immigration enforcement activities could lead to a shooting like the one in Minneapolis that took the life of Renee Good, a 37-year-old protester fatally shot by an ICE officer. Hours after his comments, Border Patrol agents shot two Venezuelan nationals who had rammed their vehicle, the department said. The Venezuelans survived their injuries, and one was charged in connection with the incident.

More than two decades after its formation, the Department of Homeland Security is the government’s largest law enforcement agency, with around 250,000 employees. It includes many functions that are not directly part of the turmoil on the ground, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the agency that oversees airport security.

Yet even those agencies have come under pressure to meet Mr. Trump’s political objectives, with the airport security agency providing information to immigration agents and Mr. Trump trying to redirect disaster funding away from states not cooperating with his deportation goals.

ICE’s budget increased dramatically because of the sweeping domestic policy bill the president signed into law last July, making it the highest funded law enforcement agency in the federal government.

Under Mr. Trump, the department also redirected thousands of agents from their normal duties to focus on arresting undocumented immigrants, a New York Times investigation found last year.

The Trump administration and officials in some of the targeted cities have used militaristic language to describe the conflict unfolding on the ground.

A lawsuit filed this week by Minnesota described the recent deployment of thousands of immigration agents and officers as “a federal invasion of the Twin Cities.”

“I see it as a personal militarized police force for the president to do his bidding against people who don’t see the world through the lens of the ultra rich,” said Mayor Brandon Johnson of Chicago, a Democrat.

Mr. Trump has recently raised the possibility of invoking the Insurrection Act, which would allow him to deploy the military to suppress rebellions and enforce federal laws. On Tuesday, he said on social media that Minnesotans should expect more action in their state, and that the “DAY OF RECKONING & RETRIBUTION IS COMING.”

Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, has called Chicago a “war zone,” and said the agency had made parts of the city “much more free.” In recent weeks, the department has described Minnesota as a place where there was “rampant fraud and criminality happening.”

Mr. Bush at the time said that the United States would be better equipped to “reduce our vulnerability and, most important, prevent the terrorists from taking innocent American lives.”

Building the agency was a big task, with all or portions of 22 federal agencies, including the Coast Guard and what was then the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to be folded into a single department. Some politicians in Washington initially resisted the creation of a new cabinet-level agency, including Mr. Bush.

Supporters of the department’s stepped-up role on immigration enforcement this year say the surge of officers in cities has made the country safer by rounding up violent criminals. They say voters endorsed decisive action on immigration when they elected Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly criticized “sanctuary cities” that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. He has pledged to be more aggressive.

“What these mayors are asking D.H.S. to do is not really an option,” said Chad Wolf, an acting homeland security secretary during the first Trump administration. “The majority of American people said, ‘We don’t want that America. We actually want criminal illegal aliens arrested and removed, as well as others.’”

Some law enforcement officials who have had productive relationships with federal authorities in the past have watched the new D.H.S. approach with concern.

“The biggest question that I’ve been receiving is: How will we intercede if there’s a conflict between community members and D.H.S.?” Shon Barnes, Seattle’s chief of police, said in an interview last fall. “Who will we side with? What will we do?”

The answer, Chief Barnes said, was that the department would “keep the peace.”

Jim McDonnell, the chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, said the city had long had close ties to D.H.S., in particular the agencies focused on criminal matters. But that cooperation became harder last summer, he said, when the agency launched a regionwide immigration operation that ensnared thousands of immigrants.

“This has been something very different — unprecedented — that we’ve seen here,” he said last year.

In many ways, Los Angeles was on the front line of the agency’s incursion into large, Democratic-led cities. Last June, following protests of an ICE operation in downtown Los Angeles, the agency empowered Border Patrol agents to lead immigration enforcement in the area.

Soon, agents were seen raiding carwashes, Home Depot parking lots and other locations. At one point, border agents traveled through a city park as a show of force. It was also the first time the National Guard had showed up to protect the Department of Homeland Security in its immigration work.

“The federal government invaded, intervened and created a problem, and then patted themselves on the back for so-called saving the city, when the city was never at risk of anything,” said Karen Bass, the city’s Democratic mayor.

The recent conflicts with local officials have alarmed some former leaders of the Department of Homeland Security.

When it was created, the agency was not just supposed to connect different parts of the federal government, but also expand its outreach to local and state entities.

“We must open lines of communication and support like never before, between agencies and departments, between federal and state and local entities, and between the public and private sectors,” Tom Ridge, who led the White House Office of Homeland Security, a precursor of the Department of Homeland Security, said when he was sworn in.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/16/multimedia/00dc-dhs-cities-02-zqfl/00dc-dhs-cities-02-zqfl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 09:58:17.853514

Laura Gillen, provided a statement calling for federal immigration reform that avoided any mention of Hochul’s proposals.
Republicans in the past have pointed to state-level laws in Democratic-dominated Albany to blast Democrats running for federal office.
Democrats in Albany this year want new boundaries around federal immigration officers — provisions that would apply to a state with a civically engaged immigrant population.
Hochul will also implement restrictions on new state-funded public safety grants to require they not be used to support civil immigration enforcement by the federal government.
Spurred by efforts in California — like requiring ICE agents be unmasked — Fahy and her fellow legislators have been on group chats trading ideas for new ways of bottling up federal enforcement efforts.","“They’re going to have to be really careful how they talk about this,” Laura Curran, a Democrat and former Nassau County executive, said of her party’s swing seat candidates. “We don’t want to talk about defunding the police or all that stuff.”

Proposals by Hochul and the Democratic-dominated state Legislature to put guardrails around Trump’s immigration tactics have not been enthusiastically received by vulnerable House Democrats.

Reps. Tom Suozzi and Josh Riley would not comment on the governor’s policy pushback, which she outlined in her State of the State speech this week. And a third Democrat, Rep. Laura Gillen, provided a statement calling for federal immigration reform that avoided any mention of Hochul’s proposals.

Efforts in Albany to check ICE’s actions are quickly becoming an issue in the three Democrats’ races as Trump moves to deport more undocumented immigrants and potentially use the Insurrection Act to quell adversarial protests. Republicans plan to mount competitive campaigns against Suozzi, Riley and Gillen this year with the goal of making in-roads among voters in purplish areas of New York state. Attacks over the governor’s immigration measures are already starting: A spokesperson for the House Republicans’ campaign arm accused Hochul and her fellow Democrats of trying to “reopen the illegal immigration floodgates.”

“New Yorkers haven’t forgotten what Democrats’ reckless open borders did to their state, and they won’t stand for it again,” said National Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Maureen O’Toole.

The stakes for New York Democrats to get the immigration policy right couldn’t be higher. Races in at least four seats in this deep blue state are expected to determine control of the House — and the course of Trump’s final two years in office.

Republicans in the past have pointed to state-level laws in Democratic-dominated Albany to blast Democrats running for federal office. GOP candidates hammered Democrats, regardless of what office they were running for, over a controversial law that restricted cash bail.

State-backed provisions that undermine federal law enforcement stand to serve as a replay of a fight that played out in several election cycles and led to electoral gains for Republicans.

Gillen’s office sidestepped questions about the Hochul-backed measures and instead called for action on the federal level.

“Our immigration system has been broken for decades and is in dire need of repair,” she said in a statement. “Comprehensive reform must be done at the federal level. Congress should pass my bipartisan Dignity Act to strengthen our border security, remove dangerous criminals, and provide a pathway for law-abiding immigrants to earn legal status.”

Curran, who led bellwether Nassau County for four years, believes Democrats in swing seats will have to remain cautious with calls to scale back ICE. But she acknowledged some voters want action following Good’s death and Trump’s threat of invoking the Insurrection Act amid ICE’s clashes with protesters. The fraught emotions have created a tricky balancing act for Democrats in tough races.

“The dramatic nature of all this ICE action is really starting to freak people out,” Curran said. “The popularity of Republicans is starting to go down if this escalates. This is going to become much more toxic, but I also understand why some of these Congressional Democrats are being vanilla. I understand these districts; they have to be.”

The lack of support for Hochul’s ICE-curbing plans among the trio of vulnerable New York Democrats underscores how Trump’s increasingly controversial deportation efforts continue to be a third rail for the party. Democrats have struggled to articulate an alternative plan and voters punished their candidates in 2024 as the president returned to the White House promising swift action.

But the expansive efforts to remove people from the country have changed how the party’s officials — especially at the state level — are approaching the issue.

Democrats in Albany this year want new boundaries around federal immigration officers — provisions that would apply to a state with a civically engaged immigrant population. Hochul wants to make it easier for New Yorkers to sue federal officials in state court and to require a judicial warrant before carrying out a civil deportation proceedings in locations like schools or houses of worship. Hochul will also implement restrictions on new state-funded public safety grants to require they not be used to support civil immigration enforcement by the federal government.

The moderate Democrat in interviews has hammered ICE’s recent actions around the country, accusing the agency of abusing its power.

“It hurts peoples’ confidence in all law enforcement,” she told Fox 5. “This undermines the NYPD, and our state police, who are just doing their jobs.”

State lawmakers have proposed bills to prohibit federal agents from wearing masks while carrying out their official duties. They are calling for new monitoring requirements for ICE. And there are discussions to guarantee that every person facing civil deportation proceedings has access to an attorney.

“There’s a massive shift — including my own shift,” said Democratic state Sen. Pat Fahy. “Public opinion has shifted dramatically.”

The Albany-area Democrat has worked with state lawmakers across the country in recent weeks to develop new legislation. Spurred by efforts in California — like requiring ICE agents be unmasked — Fahy and her fellow legislators have been on group chats trading ideas for new ways of bottling up federal enforcement efforts. She acknowledged, though, that some moderate Democrats are yet to come around amid uncertainty over how the rapidly changing events will shape the public’s view of the deportation crackdown.

“The marginal Democrats or the swing area Democrats are still nervous about it,” she said. “But now it’s more than an immigration issue. This is about who we are as Americans.”

Even among Democrats eager to put the brakes to ICE’s enforcement there are disagreements.

Hochul is typically cautious around controversial immigration issues — she is not embracing calls to expand sanctuary protections and said in a Fox 5 interview this week she does not want the agency abolished. But the governor received standing ovations from the audience when she laid out her immigration measures in her State of the State address — a speech given days after Good’s shooting in Minneapolis and an indication she is delicately threading a needle with her proposals.

“This doesn’t interfere with lawful enforcement or public safety,” Hochul said in the speech. “It simply affirms a core truth: Power does not justify abuse.”

There are signs voters across the country are becoming unnerved by immigration agents’ expansive tactics and deployments. A Quinnipiac University poll this week found 57 percent of voters disapproved of how ICE is enforcing immigration laws while 53 percent of those surveyed believe Good’s shooting was not justified.

Hochul has said she was “sickened” by Good’s death and called for “recourse” when a federal official acts inappropriately.

“Let’s start holding these people accountable,” she told MSNOW this month.

Her likely Republican opponent, Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, has taken a starkly different posture.

Blakeman — who signed an executive order opposing sanctuary-related policies — told reporters this week he does not want to “put any shackles on ICE.” He said videos of Good appeared to show her turning her car toward an ICE agent and “trying to run down” the officer — a claim Hochul’s campaign rebuked. The Republican added that there should be more support for victims of crimes by undocumented immigrants.

“You want to talk about ICE? Let’s talk about the victims of crimes committed in New York state by the people who shouldn’t be here,” said Blakeman, who Republicans expect will have strong coattails in down-ballot Long Island races.

The differing views among Democrats over how to address Trump’s immigration actions highlights Hochul’s imperative to win over statewide voters, while swing seat incumbents must take a more careful approach, said independent political analyst J.C. Polanco.

“Hochul understands she’s never going to win a Blakeman voter,” he said. “Unfortunately for Gillen and Suozzi, they need Blakeman voters.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fb5%2F22%2Fb0d1e60342c3bbdd4d8cfb61aa4f%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2254658829,N,,2026-01-18 09:58:20.729538

Jacob Ellis, an organizer of the protests, estimated there were twice the number of protesters than on a standard Saturday.

Recent warnings about Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents potentially conducting widespread action in Portland and Lewiston drew a crowd of about 200 people to Monument Square. On both sides of Congress Street, the majority of protesters held up signs against ICE, including “ICE is slippery and dangerous” and “crack ICE.”

While some have been protesting consistently, many demonstrators were there for the first time, compelled to participate because of the recent actions of ICE officers and the Trump administration.

Amara Aiken, 21, is one of them. Aiken said while it is always important for those with more privilege and power to stand up for those who are being targeted, it’s especially essential today.

After hearing about the recent fatal shooting of a woman in Minneapolis by an ICE officer, Aiken said people are worried that something similar might happen in Portland. In a tight-knight community like Maine, Aiken said, people are concerned it could happen to someone they know.

“Everyone’s having that anxiety that ‘oh, my neighbor might be next, my friend might be next, my partner might be next,’” Aiken said.

Aiken is a manager in a taqueria, and when rumors started spreading about ICE in Portland, the owner and the management team established a protocol in the event that officers show up. They’ve decided they would ask the agents to leave and would refuse to serve them.

At the protest, a nurse gave a speech in front of the crowd, explaining that she has had conversations at work about what to do if ICE agents try to forcibly enter the doctor’s office.

Since hearing the rumors of ICE activity in Maine, many protesters said they have been trying to help out their neighbors and immigrants in their community, from sharing the number of the Maine ICE Watch Hotline to keeping track of where ICE officers might be located.

Jane Hoover, a retired nurse, said she has been involved in helping immigrants for years, from tutoring to helping provide shelter to attending the weekly protest whenever she can.

Hoover pointed sadly to a young girl standing on the sculpture in the middle of the square with a sign that read, “This is home. Why are we scared?”

The girl wasn’t the only one feeling scared. Protesters also said they felt sad, angry, disheartened and resigned. Some, like Nancy Anderson, still felt hopeful.

Anderson was glad to see new faces at the protest Saturday, including many young people. Anderson, who is 76 years old, said it crossed her mind that ICE officers might come to the protest, but there was no place she’d rather be than trying to defend democracy in the country for her four grandkids and help those at risk.

“Our Somali communities are vibrant and a gift to Maine, and people are coming together to do what is necessary to support them,” she said.

Ellis, the organizer, said he was encouraged by the number of people at the protest Saturday, although he is infuriated by the circumstances that necessitated the demonstration.

There will be another protest against ICE at 5 p.m. Sunday at Monument Square in coordination with other rallies across the country, he said.

Burks said that MPR journalists have focused less on competition with other outlets and more on answering the questions of viewers.","After a federal immigration agent shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis, Minnesota, with grisly videos quickly going viral on social media, news organizations from around the state, country and world dispatched correspondents and anchors to the scene.

In the days since, that media presence has ebbed and flowed – though a well-resourced local news corps and many national journalists have remained, including reporters for the Guardian, covering additional clashes between police and protesters.

Another shooting (of a man attempting to flee arrest, the government said) on Wednesday drew more coverage, and on Thursday a CNN crew was hit with projectiles while covering a protest against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

While cuts and closures have thinned out local news reporting around the country, the Minneapolis media market remains strong, ensuring the shooting – and what has followed – have received robust coverage.

“I think we have the strongest media ecosystem of any city that’s parallel to our city,” said Matt Carlson, a Minneapolis-based professor of journalism for the University of Minnesota, mentioning the Star Tribune newspaper, Minnesota Public Radio, and smaller outlets such as the Sahan Journal, which covers immigrant communities, including the Somali refugee population that has come under attack from conservatives. (There’s also Alpha News, a conservative outlet that made headlines by publishing cell phone video taken by the ICE officer who killed Good.)

While there are always debates about national and international journalists parachuting in to cover catastrophes, “I think people in Minneapolis are actually excited to see national coverage of this, because we know that we can’t stop what’s happening by ourselves,” Carlson said.

He also predicted that Minneapolis will remain an epicenter of ICE activity and counter-protests, with Donald Trump recently threatening to invoke the Insurrection Action and send troops to the city.

“I would be very happy if the national news were able to leave because things have died down,” he said. “Unfortunately, this is not a case where things are dying down.”

Here are some of the journalists and newsroom leaders who have participated in coverage.

Omar Jimenez, anchor and correspondent, CNN

Jimenez, 32, came to the story last week with a lot of experience reporting in Minneapolis.

In May 2020, Jimenez was arrested live on CNN while covering protests in the city following the murder of George Floyd, which occurred just blocks away from where Good was killed.

While Jimenez’s team was quickly released, the incident made international headlines as an extraordinary incursion into the activities of journalists.

Since then, Jimenez has returned to the city multiple times for reporting trips. He said his antenna is always up for stories involving Minneapolis. So he flew to Minnesota a few hours after the shooting, arriving on the evening of 7 January and driving straight from the airport to the spot where Good was shot.

“When it became clear that obviously this was going to be as big as it has become, that’s when a manager of mine kind of walked in and said, ‘Hey, are you able to go to Minnesota as soon as possible?’” (He was only delayed, he said, because he needed to go home and get warmer clothes after seeing the weather forecast in Minnesota.)

During his reporting in Minneapolis last week, Jimenez said he met several people that he first encountered back in 2020.

“It’s a little bit of a balance in the sense that you obviously don’t want to be the story,” he said. “But I do think what you want is to try and be able to convey an authentic space, especially when you have the luxury of a camera. Even though everyone is seeing what you’re seeing, they’re not feeling it. There is a little bit of a barrier still. And so that’s why it is a constant balance of: ‘how close do we want to get?’”

Jimenez got pretty close to the action on 8 January, when CNN viewers watched him and his crew running away from law enforcement agents who had moved aggressively toward protesters after someone threw a water bottle at them.

While Jimenez is now back in New York City, he said: “I am not done with this story. I can tell you that.”

Kathleen Hennessey, editor and senior vice-president, Minnesota Star Tribune

A veteran of the Associated Press and the New York Times, Hennessey only took on the top editorial position at the newspaper (which was previously called the Minneapolis Star Tribune) last May. It’s fair to say that she’s been busy, considering the number of major stories that have happened in the state since then, including the June 2025 assassination of state representative Melissa Hortman and her husband.

“It’s been maybe busier, newsier than I expected to some degree, but it’s also been really rewarding to be at a place that feels so needed,” she said.

Hennessey’s newsroom of about 200 people has broken several major stories since the shooting, including being the first outlet to report the ICE officer’s name. That story drew a sharp rebuke from DHS press secretary Tricia McLaughlin, who called the outlet “reckless” and said it should “delete their story immediately” (it didn’t).

Hennessey said the decision to name the shooter (Jonathan Ross) was “a very deliberate, much-discussed decision” – but she added that it “wasn’t a particularly tough call”.

She said her news team had been “on edge and prepared and ready” for the Good story, considering the surge of deportation enforcement in recent weeks in the community.

“By this time, we feel pretty well practiced in sort of the quick mobilization of an all-hands-on-deck moment,” she said. “And so this was another one of those, really. Just about everybody immediately ran to their stations and did what they do.”

Considering how widely covered this story has been, “I encourage our newsroom to remember that nobody knows this place better than we do,” she said, “and nobody can be as close to the people involved, and be a more reliable source for people who actually live here.”

Unsurprisingly, Hennessey said the Star Tribune’s website has received a very large number of online readers over the last week and a half – though it’s a bit harder to net paying subscribers.

Going forward, she said she expects her newsroom to remain in overdrive covering the story. “It’s ongoing, it’s unfolding, and it feels very everywhere all at once,” she said. “At any given moment, there’s just a million videos popping up everywhere of incidents and encounters with ICE that feel newsworthy.”

Alex Tabet, political reporter, MS NOW (formerly MSNBC)

Tabet, who arrived in Minnesota at 1am on 7 January, made it to the scene of the shooting extremely quickly. He had already been tipped off by an ICE observer that there was an enforcement action going on in the neighborhood, and then got word that someone had been shot. It was his third reporting trip to Minnesota over the past month. “We were the first – at least – TV crew on the ground,” he said.

Tabet’s first call was to his network’s editorial leaders and standards officials, telling them, “Hey, this is what we know, this is what we don’t know,” he said. “And we started vetting all of the information that we had to try to figure out what is appropriate to put on air, what should we hold off on, basically making sure we had hit the threshold of understanding what was going on.”

Tabet, who left Minnesota on Tuesday after almost a full week, said he’s “hoping to go back as soon as possible” – though he said the network is well staffed on the story. The decision to leave “was a discussion between my bosses and I, because there’s only so many days [you can go] without sleep”.

“I know MS NOW is committed to having a strong presence on the ground, because they recognize how important of a story this is right now,” he said.

Megan Burks, deputy managing producer, MPR News (Minnesota Public Radio)

Burks, who coordinates daily news coverage for the NPR member station, said the newsroom had been settling into a new rhythm since the 7 January killing of Good. And then on Wednesday, a federal officer shot a man in the leg, leading to new protests and clashes with law enforcement.

“Just as it felt like we were settling into a manageable rhythm, this new twist came and now we’re back to trying to figure out what is our new normal, what is our new rhythm,” she said.

Burks said that MPR journalists have focused less on competition with other outlets and more on answering the questions of viewers.

“Knowing that we can’t focus on everything, we’re trying to let the audience drive some of what we choose to put our stamp on,” she said.

Nicole Sganga, homeland security correspondent, CBS News

Sganga arrived in Minneapolis two days before the shooting. She participated in a ride-along with immigration agents and interviewed Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, pressing her on how she can “justify” the government sending 2,000 DHS agents to the city.

In addition to reporting on the ground about Good’s killing, Sganga covered the intensification of immigration raids after the incident.

“My approach is always, ‘get there, bear witness, ask questions,’” Sganga said.

She said it’s been important to cover the story from Minneapolis to be able to press government officials on “contradictory accounts” of what happened and what is happening.

“That kind of independent reporting and verification is critical to holding power to account and to clarifying the facts for the public,” said Sganga, who has reported for the network for a decade.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db15c70b319ad3d587a5d51b7ccf3c7301280013/506_0_5055_4046/master/5055.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b91d9258b3d9dea6d35eeab10b3eab38",N,,2026-01-18 09:58:28.290296

The Next Century Foundation´s Research Officer, Olwyn Matthews, takes up the challenge:

Since its origins as the Brexit party in 2018, Reform UK has maintained a strong focus on immigration, Zia Yusuf (Head of Policy for Reform UK) naming UK return agreements for irregular or unauthorised migrants as the party’s “almighty foreign policy campaign”. Since the 2024 General Election, Reform UK’s primary policy document remains the party’s manifesto, “Our Contract With You”. Whilst Reform UK party members refer back to the core policies of this document, their ongoing discussion and media comments on foreign policy matters provide current insight into how a Reform UK government would approach foreign affairs.

Despite only having 5 MPs in the 650-seat House of Commons, Reform UK have topped recent opinion polls on voting intention in Parliament, reaching 31% in 2025. These results are far above the next contender, the Conservative party, with 18% voting intention. Polling offers a snapshot of voting decisions but makes the prospect of Reform UK success in the 2029 general election much more likely than in 2024.

Reform UK’s Approach to Foreign Affairs

With a populist party so focused on anti-migration and fuelling Euroscepticism, the increased probability of a successful campaign leaves many to question how a Reform government would approach foreign affairs. This is particularly relevant in an international arena with emerging populist parties favouring nationalism and the rejection of international community.

President Trump’s Administration

Reform UK’s approach to the US is mainly derived from Leader of Reform UK, the MP Nigel Farage’s public admiration for President Trump and their personal relationship. Generally, party members praise Trump’s administration, and it can be expected that their foreign policy would be closely aligned with Trump’s direction. Alan Mendoza, Reform UK foreign affairs advisor (Alan is also founder of the small right wing think tank, the Henry Jackson Society), has commended Trump’s “decisive” politics, particularly with regard to the Trump brokered Gaza Peace Plan of October 2025. In response to the recent US invasion of Venezuela, Farage commented the move by Trump was “contrary to international law”, but if it makes China and Russia “think twice, it may be a good thing”.

It is clear from Reform UK’s outlook on foreign affairs that its policy would follow a similar trajectory to the Trump administration. However, this personal relationship does not provide any clear foreign policy plan or confirm US support.

Israel

Reform UK has no clear policy on Israel or Palestine, but members of the party have shown strong support towards Israel. Farage has rejected the idea that the UK stop the arms supply to Israel and also opposes the arrest warrant for Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by the International Criminal Court (ICC). MP Richard Tice, Deputy Leader of Reform UK has accused Tom Fletcher, UN humanitarian chief, of “lying with absurd claims” regarding the “UN’s genocide smears” against Israel.

The party itself has displayed support of Israel last year as it founded Reform Friends of Israel, joining similar groups such as Labour Friends of Israel (LFI) and Conservative Friends of Israel (CFI), cementing even further their backing for the State of Israel. Both individual members and the party itself have been outspoken on its support for Israel and, even without an explicit policy, it can be expected that, if elected to office, a Reform government would back the state.

Palestine

With regard to Palestine, many members of the party, including Farage, Mendoza, and Tice have condemned the UK’s decision to recognise the Palestinian state in September 2025. 2023 London Mayoral candidate for Reform UK, Howard Cox, stated in a Reform UK press release, “flying the Palestinian flag in our Capital is needlessly provocative” and, “As London Mayor, I would not allow any pro-Palestinian protests to take place in London whilst the conflict between Israel and Hamas continues in Gaza.”

In response to President Trump’s Gaza Peace Plan announced in October 2025, Farage and Mendoza have publicly celebrated Trump’s “personal diplomacy and intervention”. To reach permanent peace in Gaza, Mendoza claims there are three issues that must be addressed: (i) the disarmament of Hamas and their removal from power, (ii) the governance of Gaza “free of terrorist control”, and (iii) the determination of who will enforce peace.

Russia and Ukraine

Farage has shown a mixed stance towards Russia and Ukraine over the years. Recently, the party has been under scrutiny as its former Welsh leader and Member of European Parliament, Nathan Gill, was jailed in November 2025 for taking bribes to make statements in favour of Russia. In June 2024 Farage made comments implying that the Russian invasion was provoked by NATO advances. After criticism, he then called the invasion “immoral, outrageous, and indefensible”, but that “poking a bear is obviously not good foreign policy”. Despite his previous statements, which imply NATO expansionism is partly to blame for provoking the Russian invasion, Farage now views Ukraine joining NATO as “essential” to a peace deal.

On January 6th 2026, both Britain and France committed troops to Ukraine following the implementation of any peace deal. This was negatively received by Farage, claiming he would vote against sending British soldiers to Ukraine. The Reform leader argues Britain has neither the manpower nor the equipment to commit to an operation with an unknown timeline. This comment was made after 24 world leaders and Ukrainian allies making up the “coalition of the willing” discussed strategic plans post-peace deal.

Farage’s reluctance to send troops to Ukraine has been highlighted by cabinet minister Pat McFadden as a “pro-Russia” outlook, arguing that sending British troops is not just for Ukraine, but is a “British national security interest”. However, Mendoza argued Reform UK’s opposition to the Prime Minister’s Ukraine plans is not because the idea of sending British forces to Ukraine is the “wrong principle”, but that the plan itself is “unviable”. Moreover, Farage’s declaration that he would ensure the UK was a leading NATO force, alongside his recent support for Ukraine´s aspiration to become a NATO state, leaves one to assume that Farage would provide assistance to Ukraine as “once you’re a NATO member, you must be defended”. Reform voters on the other hand show scepticism in regard to the idea of sending British troops and only 4/10 voters are shown to favour the provision of arms to Ukraine.

The current reluctance from both Farage and the party’s voters introduces doubt as to how a Reform government would approach Putin´s Russia in the future and to what extent the party would utilise British forces.

Reflecting on Reform UK’s 2024 General Election Manifesto

“Our Contract With You” remains the most recent written document on Reform UK’s policy. The party’s foreign policy outlined in the document is extremely limited and vague, prioritising anti-immigration policy and arguably demonising foreigners and foreign influence.

Immigration

In 2025, the current Labour government announced their intent to extend the Indefinite Leave to Remain qualifying period from 5 to 10 years, presumed to enter into effect in April 2026. Reform UK’s migration policy sets to erase the Indefinite Leave to Remain status, replaced with a pathway by which migrants would be required to apply for a 5-year work visa. This would be a radical policy change. A salary threshold, at least £60,000 per year, would also be required, linking the number of dependents to the individual’s income, compared to the current (and already high) £41,700 per year requirement. This particular element of their policy would make little difference. If elected, Reform UK would prohibit anyone except British citizens from accessing welfare, raising questions as to the treatment of EU citizens with settled status who can acquire benefits outlined in the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement. The party has also announced plans to implement an “immigration tax” which would increase the national insurance rate to 20% for migrant workers, deterring employees from hiring non-British citizens.

Defence

As part of the Brexit Policy, Reform UK’s Manifesto calls for the “Independence for Britain’s Armed Forces” from the EU Command and Control Force. This would involve abandoning current membership in the EU Horizon programme, stop any financial support of the European Defence Fund, and participation in the EU’s military mobility project.

Defence spending would be increased to 2.5% of the national GDP by Year 3, to 3% by Year 6. This is very similar when compared to Labour’s current spending of 2.5% national GDP in 2027, increasing from 2.3%. Reform UK calls to increase the size of Britain’s Armed Forces by 30,000 troops and to ensure a leadership position in NATO.

The introduction of the “Armed Forces Justice Bill” would “protect” servicemen and women “from civil law and human rights lawyers”. Presumably, this would allow British soldiers who have committed crimes overseas to escape any prosecution.

Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, has shown mixed support of military intervention over the years, but based on opinion polls, Reform UK voters do not think an active role in foreign affairs is necessary. Less than half of Reform UK voters view this as extremely or very important, with 29% accepting that the UK consider the interests of allies.

Disengagement from International Institutions

What little foreign policy that there is in Reform UK’s Manifesto is limited to immigration, sparse defence policy, and the rejection of the international institutions with the planned exit from several conventions and agreements.

The Manifesto states intent to leave the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) – this is framed in the Manifesto and by Farage as a way to “stop the boats” that is argued to contribute to “uncontrolled Immigration”. If exiting the ECHR, the UK would join Russia and Belarus as the only states to have left or been expelled from the Convention. This would be followed with a replacement of the Human Rights Act 1998 (which authorises the ECHR into domestic UK law) with a “British Bill of Rights” which could involve the re-evaluation of the rights of UK citizens. The suggest altered policy regarding the ECHR and the Human Rights Act 1998 would presumably weaken or remove legal protections for asylum seekers and would re-shape the UK’s approach to settlement in the UK.

A UK departure from the ECHR would also impact the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA), which itself is under fire in the Manifesto which calls for a round of renegotiations, as it claims a “so-called EU ‘level playing field’ is holding us back”. As the party initially formed as the ‘Brexit Party’, the severing of ties with EU conventions and agreements is not at all surprising.

Climate Change Denial and goodbye to the ICC

Beyond these EU agreements, the manifesto pledges to withdrawal from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the eradication of any domestic and international goals to reach Net Zero. On Thursday 8th January, MP Richard Tice, Deputy Leader of Reform UK, echoed these plans, now calling for the UK to follow Trump’s move to quit the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the organisation that supports the annual COP climate conferences, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which Tice claims are “failing British voters”.

The disengagement with international agreements can also lead the assumption that Reform UK will very likely ignore any international law. Danny Kruger, Reform UK MP, declared in October 2025 that the party would rewrite UK’s ministerial code, a plan also stated in the party’s Manifesto. The ministerial code refers to “the overarching duty on ministers to comply with the law, including international law and treaty obligations”. Kruger affirmed his “glaring objection” to this code “is that it requires them (the ministers) to acknowledge international law in their decision making. That is an immediate change we would make.” This change would allow or even be shown to encourage policymakers to act even more lawlessly.

This neglect of international law is further evident with the party’s dismissal of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in response to the Chagos deal. The Reform party has declared plans to cancel the current Labour government’s Chagos deal, signed in May 2025. This deal agrees upon the transfer of sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, after people were removed from the territory by the UK in the 1970’s to claim the land for a US military base. Farage argues that giving up Diego Garcia in particular – the largest island crucial for US/UK military interventions – is “the single most important thing that we give America right now”, and this ‘loss’ plays “into China’s hands”.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) published their advisory opinion, demanding the UK cease control over the Chagos Islands and relinquish sovereignty to Mauritius. Farage has dismissed this as “an advisory judgement from the International Criminal Court has no force of legal power whatsoever; indeed, America disregards it so much that it is not even a member.” The UK’s exit from any of these institutions, and lack of participation in the international arena would lose any leadership position the UK may have on the international stage.

Reducing Foreign Aid

Reform UK stated in the run up to the 2024 General Election that it would slash “wasteful” spending, one example being the cutting of foreign aid by 50%. More recently, Reform UK has announced plans to limit foreign aid much further to £1 billion, a decrease from the £14 billion budget in 2024. Approximately £750 million of this sum would be spent to maintain membership of international organisations such as the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, allocating the rest for “genuine disaster relief”.

This was renounced by Gideon Rabinowitz, Director of Policy and Advocacy at Bond, arguing that such a vast cut in foreign aid would cause “irreversible damage to the UK’s safety net” in an “increasingly unstable world”. With the reduced contributions to international organisations, there would be extreme risk of losing influence in these spaces of international collaboration. A relation can be made to the Trump administration’s “slash and burn” approach to government financing, with the closure of USAID in 2025 felt across the globe.

Conclusion

Reform UK maintains a focus purely on the ‘national interest’, with a lack of appetite to support international causes. Reform UK voters continue to hold more nationalistic views on foreign policy compared to other voters, with a lower level of approval for British action overseas. Generally, with a future Reform UK government, one could expect nationalist, Trump-aligned policy on migration, higher defence spending, slashing ties to international partners, and decreasing foreign aid.

Several South Asian civil rights and advocacy organizations are condemning the U.S. State Department’s decision to suspend immigrant visa processing for citizens of 75 countries, a move scheduled to take effect Jan. 21, calling on President Donald Trump to immediately rescind what they describe as discriminatory measures.

The South Asian Bar Association of North America Foundation said the policy unfairly penalizes people from the South Asian subcontinent, including Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Nepal, and undermines principles of equity, family unity and human dignity.

Rittu Kumar, president of the South Asian Bar Association of North America Foundation, said the organization views the policy as discriminatory in both impact and intent.

“The South Asian communities have long contributed to the social, cultural, academic, and economic fabric of the United States. Policies that single out entire nations and populations for exclusion, under the guise of security or administrative efficiency, perpetuate harmful stereotypes, fuel xenophobia, and punish individuals based on nationality rather than any individualized assessment,” Kumar said.

Asked about data on how many South Asians could be affected and whether the group plans legal action, Kumar told indica the foundation is monitoring developments but does not plan to file a lawsuit.

“I do not have any data available for how many South Asians would be impacted and we do not intend to file a lawsuit. We will be keeping a close watch regarding the changing landscape affecting immigration rights, and reaffirm our commitment to advocating for an immigration system that treats all people with dignity and respect,” Kumar said.

In its statement, the South Asian Bar Association of North America Foundation rejected the administration’s rationale for the suspension and criticized what it described as a broader pattern of restrictive immigration policies.

“We reject the false narrative that immigration from South Asia, and other named countries, poses a threat to the United States. History and evidence show the opposite, inclusive immigration policies strengthen communities, foster innovation, and uphold democratic values,” the statement said. “This announcement and other country-specific immigration restrictions that the Trump administration has enacted in the last 12 months are a modern version of xenophobic U.S. immigration policies and seek to reverse decades of legal immigration to the United States. Blanket bans and pauses erode trust in government and damage the nation’s moral standing.”

The organization called on the federal government to reverse course.

“The SABA North America calls on the U.S. government to immediately rescind these discriminatory measures, restore fair and timely visa processing, and pursue immigration policies grounded in justice, transparency, and due process,” the statement said. “We stand in solidarity with South Asian communities in the United States and abroad, as well as all affected individuals and communities, and reaffirm our commitment to advocating for an immigration system that treats all people with dignity and respect, regardless of where they come from.”

Other civil rights organizations also voiced strong opposition. The Council on American-Islamic Relations said the suspension would have sweeping consequences for immigrant families and communities of color.

“The Trump administration’s sweeping decision to indefinitely suspend immigrant visa processing for nationals of 75 countries is a cruel, unjustified and bigoted policy that undermines American values and divides American families from their relatives overseas,” the group said. The organization said the policy disproportionately targets majority Black, Brown and Global South nations, including many Muslim-majority countries.

Asian Americans Advancing Justice said the decision represents one of the most restrictive immigration actions in decades and likened it to earlier racially discriminatory policies.

“This new policy constitutes one of the most restrictive attacks on the immigration system that our nation has seen in decades,” the organization said. “It blocks hundreds of thousands of people from immigration pathways established by Congress and harkens back to the racially discriminatory immigration restrictions of the 1920s that effectively barred Asian and Black immigrants.”

The group said the suspension would separate families and block workers who have followed existing legal pathways to permanent residence.

“The pause disproportionately targets immigrants of color, yet another indication of the xenophobia and racism driving this administration’s policies,” the organization said. “Asian Americans will suffer under this pause, with 44% of Asian immigrant visa holders, and over 135,000 individuals, barred.”

Asian Americans Advancing Justice also disputed the State Department’s justification for the policy.

“The State Department has justified this action based on supposed concerns about public benefit usage by immigrants. This is a blatant lie,” the organization said. “Various rules already restrict the ability of immigrant visa recipients to qualify for public benefits. Moreover, countless studies have shown that immigrants enhance economic growth, and that access to public benefits leads to better long-term outcomes for children, families and society.”

The organization urged the administration and Congress to reverse the suspension and pursue broader immigration reform.

“Policymakers should expand access to immigration and address root causes of poverty and displacement with dignity, not exclusion,” it said. “We call on the administration to immediately reverse this decision and work with Congress to improve, and not curtail, our immigration system.”",https://indicanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/pexels-n-voitkevich-7235892.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 12:59:29.409872

Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has used the presidential pardon power to reward his supporters and potential allies.","“Move fast and break things” – the Silicon Valley mantra – aptly describes the whirlwind start to President Donald Trump’s second term.

The president hit the ground running last January, issuing a flurry of executive orders, including pardons for most Jan. 6 defendants and the launch of the Department of Government Efficiency, Elon Musk’s effort to slash the federal government.

One year on, Mr. Musk is long gone, as is DOGE. And the impact of President Trump’s ambitious and aggressive efforts to reshape policy – indeed, America itself – is coming into focus. He has pushed the envelope on presidential power, issuing more executive orders in his first year back than in his entire first term. He has bypassed Congress and challenged the courts, invaded Venezuela and arrested its leader, exacted retribution on his perceived enemies, and transformed the White House itself with golden decor and a big planned ballroom.

Mr. Trump’s second term makes the first term look like a dress rehearsal. It’s almost as if he spent his first four years in office figuring out how much power he had, and came back determined to use every bit of it.

Fifty years from now, will historians be calling Mr. Trump a “transformational president”? Or will this period ultimately seem like a lot of tumult that added up to little long-term change? Likely both. Every president leaves a stamp on the office and the country. As always, the challenge is to separate the signal from the noise.

Mr. Trump has made plenty of promises (or threats) that have gone nowhere – from claiming he could end Russia’s war on Ukraine within 24 hours to saying he would turn the Gaza Strip into a luxury tourist destination.

But in many ways, Mr. Trump has already changed the United States profoundly, including its role in the world, in ways that may have lasting impact.

A timeline at the bottom of this article charts major presidential events this past year.

More stories on President Trump’s second term after one year:

• On the economy, no recession, but no boom either

• Shattering foreign policy norms

• Battling universities over antisemitism and DEI

America’s image in Europe as a steady ally has been torpedoed, as made clear in the president’s new National Security Strategy, which lauds Europe’s “patriotic” – i.e., nationalistic – parties. Mr. Trump’s new tariff regime has upended global trade, while his crackdown on illegal immigration cut off the flow of migrants at the border and sparked major unrest in Minneapolis.

He’s also shrunk and reshaped parts of the U.S. government, including eliminating “diversity, equity, and inclusion” as a priority. The departments and agencies that Mr. Trump gutted, such as the Education Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, will be hard to reconstitute, even if a future president wants to do so. In all this, and perhaps most important, he has reset the bar for using executive power.

“Previous presidents have been criticized for using executive orders and trying to act unilaterally, but he’s taken it to a different level,” says Matthew Dickinson, a presidential scholar at Middlebury College in Vermont. “It’s going to be hard to put that genie back in the bottle.”

In a year of upheaval, one notable aspect of Trump 2.0 has been the loyalty and stability of his team. Unlike Year 1 of his first term, when the president rapidly cycled through top aides in key spots – including his chief of staff, press secretary, and chief political strategist – this year has seen little staff turnover. “Let Trump be Trump” appears to be the guiding philosophy of Term 2.

Looking ahead, Mr. Trump’s power might get a real check after the fall midterm elections, if Democrats retake the House of Representatives. Signs of “lame duckery” are already appearing, as some Republicans start pushing back on his policies and approach. Still, he has a year to go with the current Congress – and that’s a lifetime in Trump time.

On immigration, big goals and big controversy

In Year 1, President Trump oversaw an avalanche of anti-immigrant policies – while creating exceptions for some immigrants who are white or rich. From borderlands to urban centers, his administration targeted illegal immigration and lawful pathways alike. He condemned many migrants, generally, as criminals. He called some, specifically, “garbage.”

Invoking a rare wartime law – and disputed gang ties – the Department of Homeland Security sent more than 100 Venezuelans to a notorious Salvadoran prison in March. A federal judge has asked the administration to address due process violations, while the government dismisses former detainees’ claims of abuse.

The president kept campaign promises as he sought to “seal” the southern border. Border Patrol apprehensions, a proxy for illegal crossings, sank to their lowest level since 1970. A surge of armed forces to the border included the creation of new military zones. In the interior, controversial waves of immigrant arrests – many targeting people without criminal records – at times ensnared U.S. citizens. Even as the administration withholds certain data, it reports deporting over 600,000 people. Mr. Trump also limited legal immigration, including of refugees, while prioritizing Afrikaners from South Africa. As foreigners from 39 countries face entry bans, Mr. Trump is offering “gold card” residency for $1 million per person.

Heading into Year 2, polling suggests the public has soured on his immigration agenda. An immigration officer's fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month has also sparked protests there and nationwide.

What to watch: whether the Supreme Court lets the president end the constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship.

Steering a new direction on social issues

President Trump has taken a number of steps in office aimed at defeating “woke” ideology – including dismantling diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs that he said illegally discriminated against white people.

On his first day in office, Mr. Trump signed an executive order instructing government agencies and departments to terminate all DEI offices and positions, “equity action” plans, and DEI performance requirements.

This order was a direct response to the first executive order President Joe Biden signed after his own inauguration, instructing agency heads to assess the equity of agency policies and actions. Another Trump executive order rescinded affirmative action requirements for federal contractors. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi issued a memo instructing the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division to investigate illegal DEI mandates in the private sector and in educational institutions that receive federal funds.

In response, major U.S. companies from Walmart to Meta scrapped diversity goals and training programs. And hundreds of colleges and universities have ended programs that promoted DEI on campus or focused on LGBTQ+ or minority students.

Mr. Trump moved to undo protections for transgender people, making it federal policy to recognize only two genders and rescinding federal funds from schools that allow biological males to compete in women’s sports. After Mr. Trump revoked Mr. Biden’s executive order that allowed transgender troops to serve openly in the military, the Department of Defense issued a ban on transgender service members, which the Supreme Court has upheld. His Department of Health and Human Services in December proposed a sweeping set of new rules that would dramatically restrict access to gender-transition treatments for minors.

Mr. Trump has also tried to shift American culture in a more conservative direction. He has instructed the Smithsonian museums to root out what he calls anti-American propaganda in their exhibits. He took over the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, appointing a new board that tapped him as its chair, eliminating “woke” programming, and adding his name to the building’s exterior.

Justice as retribution?

The first year of this second Trump administration has challenged long-standing norms in the criminal justice system. Having criticized the justice system as unfairly targeting him, Mr. Trump appears to be trying to use the system in a similar fashion.

He has pushed for prosecutions of his political adversaries and issued pardons for allies. He has personally criticized lower court judges who ruled against his administration, while one of his top aides has railed against “judicial tyranny.” Presidents have traditionally refrained from direct criticism like this out of respect for the judiciary’s independence and to uphold public confidence in the courts. Amid Mr. Trump’s attacks, violent threats against federal judges rose.

In September, Mr. Trump called for two adversaries – former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James – to be prosecuted. Indictments quickly followed – against Mr. Comey on charges of lying to Congress, and against Ms. James on charges of mortgage fraud. Both deny the charges, and both cases have since been dismissed on procedural grounds. In January, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced that he was being investigated for allegedly lying to Congress. The investigation is a pretext, Mr. Powell said, for not acquiescing to Mr. Trump’s demands to lower interest rates.

Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has used the presidential pardon power to reward his supporters and potential allies. On his first day in office, he issued pardons to more than 1,500 people convicted or charged for their participation in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, including hundreds charged with violent felonies.

A chain saw, but DOGE doesn’t meet its target

Remaking the federal bureaucracy began on President Trump’s first day in office, when he created the Department of Government Efficiency. Under the leadership of Mr. Trump’s billionaire benefactor Elon Musk, DOGE became synonymous with the president’s effort to dislodge what he calls the “deep state” and slash a “bloated” federal government. Mr. Musk set a goal of cutting $2 trillion from the country’s $7 trillion budget. By its own accounting, DOGE – which disbanded eight months ahead of schedule – only achieved about 10% of its cost-cutting goal; media investigations and conservative think tanks suggest the true savings were roughly half that, at best.

Still, cuts were widespread across the government. According to data released by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management in January, more than 322,000 federal employees have left the government since January 2025, either through layoffs or after taking buyouts. But some agencies also rehired workers, either out of necessity or because of court rulings, leading to an overall workforce cut of roughly 220,000 employees, or a 10% reduction. This falls short of Mr. Trump’s stated goal of four reductions for every new hire, and is less than President Bill Clinton’s federal workforce cut of about 17% in the 1990s.

The cuts varied across the government, with some agencies and departments harder hit than others. The U.S. Agency for International Development was shuttered almost entirely, the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities was cut by more than 50%, and the Department of Education by more than 40%. The Departments of the Treasury, Agriculture, State, and Health and Human Services each lost around 20% of their workforces. The Department of Defense, on the other hand, only fell by 8%.

Beyond the current cuts, workers and experts fear that the administration’s attacks on federal workers may damage future recruitment. Mr. Trump also signed executive orders to allow for more politically appointed positions – a “sharp departure,” says Rachel Augustine Potter, a politics professor at the University of Virginia, from “the meritocratic foundations of the U.S. bureaucracy.” If courts uphold these changes, she writes, it could make it difficult for America to return to a less politicized, expertise-based civil service.

The president hit the ground running last January, issuing a flurry of executive orders, including pardons for most Jan. 6 defendants and the launch of the Department of Government Efficiency, Elon Musk’s effort to slash the federal government.

One year on, Mr. Musk is long gone, as is DOGE. And the impact of President Trump’s ambitious and aggressive efforts to reshape policy – indeed, America itself – is coming into focus. He has pushed the envelope on presidential power, issuing more executive orders in his first year back than in his entire first term. He has bypassed Congress and challenged the courts, invaded Venezuela and arrested its leader, exacted retribution on his perceived enemies, and transformed the White House itself with golden decor and a big planned ballroom.

Why We Wrote This

Beyond policy specifics, Donald Trump has in many ways raised the bar for how much power a president can wield unilaterally. Controversy has followed, regarding both the policies and the approach to power.

Mr. Trump’s second term makes the first term look like a dress rehearsal. It’s almost as if he spent his first four years in office figuring out how much power he had, and came back determined to use every bit of it.

Fifty years from now, will historians be calling Mr. Trump a “transformational president”? Or will this period ultimately seem like a lot of tumult that added up to little long-term change? Likely both. Every president leaves a stamp on the office and the country. As always, the challenge is to separate the signal from the noise.

Mr. Trump has made plenty of promises (or threats) that have gone nowhere – from claiming he could end Russia’s war on Ukraine within 24 hours to saying he would turn the Gaza Strip into a luxury tourist destination.

But in many ways, Mr. Trump has already changed the United States profoundly, including its role in the world, in ways that may have lasting impact.

A timeline at the bottom of this article charts major presidential events this past year.

More stories on President Trump’s second term after one year:

• On the economy, no recession, but no boom either

• Shattering foreign policy norms

• Battling universities over antisemitism and DEI

America’s image in Europe as a steady ally has been torpedoed, as made clear in the president’s new National Security Strategy, which lauds Europe’s “patriotic” – i.e., nationalistic – parties. Mr. Trump’s new tariff regime has upended global trade, while his crackdown on illegal immigration cut off the flow of migrants at the border and sparked major unrest in Minneapolis.

He’s also shrunk and reshaped parts of the U.S. government, including eliminating “diversity, equity, and inclusion” as a priority. The departments and agencies that Mr. Trump gutted, such as the Education Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, will be hard to reconstitute, even if a future president wants to do so. In all this, and perhaps most important, he has reset the bar for using executive power.

“Previous presidents have been criticized for using executive orders and trying to act unilaterally, but he’s taken it to a different level,” says Matthew Dickinson, a presidential scholar at Middlebury College in Vermont. “It’s going to be hard to put that genie back in the bottle.”

In a year of upheaval, one notable aspect of Trump 2.0 has been the loyalty and stability of his team. Unlike Year 1 of his first term, when the president rapidly cycled through top aides in key spots – including his chief of staff, press secretary, and chief political strategist – this year has seen little staff turnover. “Let Trump be Trump” appears to be the guiding philosophy of Term 2.

Looking ahead, Mr. Trump’s power might get a real check after the fall midterm elections, if Democrats retake the House of Representatives. Signs of “lame duckery” are already appearing, as some Republicans start pushing back on his policies and approach. Still, he has a year to go with the current Congress – and that’s a lifetime in Trump time.

On immigration, big goals and big controversy

In Year 1, President Trump oversaw an avalanche of anti-immigrant policies – while creating exceptions for some immigrants who are white or rich. From borderlands to urban centers, his administration targeted illegal immigration and lawful pathways alike. He condemned many migrants, generally, as criminals. He called some, specifically, “garbage.”

Invoking a rare wartime law – and disputed gang ties – the Department of Homeland Security sent more than 100 Venezuelans to a notorious Salvadoran prison in March. A federal judge has asked the administration to address due process violations, while the government dismisses former detainees’ claims of abuse.

The president kept campaign promises as he sought to “seal” the southern border. Border Patrol apprehensions, a proxy for illegal crossings, sank to their lowest level since 1970. A surge of armed forces to the border included the creation of new military zones. In the interior, controversial waves of immigrant arrests – many targeting people without criminal records – at times ensnared U.S. citizens. Even as the administration withholds certain data, it reports deporting over 600,000 people. Mr. Trump also limited legal immigration, including of refugees, while prioritizing Afrikaners from South Africa. As foreigners from 39 countries face entry bans, Mr. Trump is offering “gold card” residency for $1 million per person.

Heading into Year 2, polling suggests the public has soured on his immigration agenda. An immigration officer's fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month has also sparked protests there and nationwide.

What to watch: whether the Supreme Court lets the president end the constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship.

Steering a new direction on social issues

President Trump has taken a number of steps in office aimed at defeating “woke” ideology – including dismantling diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs that he said illegally discriminated against white people.

On his first day in office, Mr. Trump signed an executive order instructing government agencies and departments to terminate all DEI offices and positions, “equity action” plans, and DEI performance requirements.

This order was a direct response to the first executive order President Joe Biden signed after his own inauguration, instructing agency heads to assess the equity of agency policies and actions. Another Trump executive order rescinded affirmative action requirements for federal contractors. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi issued a memo instructing the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division to investigate illegal DEI mandates in the private sector and in educational institutions that receive federal funds.

In response, major U.S. companies from Walmart to Meta scrapped diversity goals and training programs. And hundreds of colleges and universities have ended programs that promoted DEI on campus or focused on LGBTQ+ or minority students.

Mr. Trump moved to undo protections for transgender people, making it federal policy to recognize only two genders and rescinding federal funds from schools that allow biological males to compete in women’s sports. After Mr. Trump revoked Mr. Biden’s executive order that allowed transgender troops to serve openly in the military, the Department of Defense issued a ban on transgender service members, which the Supreme Court has upheld. His Department of Health and Human Services in December proposed a sweeping set of new rules that would dramatically restrict access to gender-transition treatments for minors.

Mr. Trump has also tried to shift American culture in a more conservative direction. He has instructed the Smithsonian museums to root out what he calls anti-American propaganda in their exhibits. He took over the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, appointing a new board that tapped him as its chair, eliminating “woke” programming, and adding his name to the building’s exterior.

The latest incident comes amid heightened tensions in the city in Minnesota state following the fatal shooting of Renee Good by a federal immigration agent earlier this month.

Demonstrators chanting against US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol gathered near City Hall and quickly pressed the rival group toward a municipal building before forcing them to retreat to a nearby hotel.

Water balloons and snowballs were thrown at the right-wing demonstrators in weather that reached -4 degrees Fahrenheit (-20 degrees Celsius) with the wind chill.

Police kept their distance and no serious injuries were reported.

Who is behind the pro-ICE rally?

Right-wing influencer Jake Lang, who organized the pro-ICE rally, later claimed on social media he was stabbed, but Minneapolis police said no report was filed and they received no injury complaints.

Lang is one of more than 1,500 people pardoned by US President Donald Trump after their criminal convictions related to the January 6, 2021, riot on the US Capitol. He faced multiple charges, including assaulting a police officer with a baseball bat.

The right-wing social media personality, who recently announced plans to run for US Senate in Florida, is known for making anti-Muslim and antisemitic comments.

Ahead of his appearance, Lang had posted on social media that he intended to ""burn a Quran"" on the steps of City Hall. It did not appear that he actually burnt a copy of the Muslim holy book.

Pro-ICE rallies in Minneapolis have often targeted the Somali immigrant population in Minneapolis, most of whom ⁠are Muslim.

What are the anti-ICE protesters saying?

The anti-ICE rally was organized by the People's Action Coalition Against Trump.

Residents had vowed to blockade the neighborhood and not let the marchers into the area after pro-ICE protesters announced their plans to march to where many Somali immigrants live.

""We're out here to show Nazis and ICE and DHS and MAGA you are not welcome in Minneapolis,"" protester Luke Rimington told AP news agency. ""Stay out of our city, stay out of our state. Go home.""

Minnesota's leadership at odds with Trump

Trump has sent thousands of immigration agents into the Minneapolis area, citing alleged misuse of federal funds and singling out the state's Somali immigrant community.

Minnesota's Democratic Governor Tim Walz has mobilized the National Guard to support law enforcement in the state, officials said in a statement.

The state's Democratic leadership has clashed with the Trump administration over the crackdown, with the Justice Department opening an investigation into Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey saying they have impeded federal immigration enforcement through their public statements.

Meanwhile, a US judge restricted federal agents on Friday from interfering with peaceful protesters, even as Trump backed away from a threat of invoking the Insurrection Act over the demonstrations.

Karmel Mall in south Minneapolis contains more than a hundred small businesses in suites offering everything from clothing and food to insurance and accounting services. On Thursday, the noisy hallways inside lay quiet, save for occasional chatter between neighboring vendors. The smell of fried food still wafted from the bakeries, the central heating hummed and the sound of Quran recitation flowed quietly from some shops.

But many sellers sat alone in their clothing stores, waiting for the occasional customer to walk by. Everyone is afraid of federal immigration agents, business owners said. Sellers and customers, citizens and noncitizens. Some don’t bother opening shop because they aren’t expecting any customers.

“It’s been like this for three weeks now,” said Abdi Wahid, who works at his mom’s convenience store in the mall. “Everywhere it’s all been closed up, all the stores.”

Karmel Mall is an economic hub for the area’s Somali population, which is the largest in the U.S. But it also features housing, a mosque and Quran classes, serving as a robust community center for the area.

The economic impact of the Trump administration's “Operation Metro Surge” stretches beyond the Somali community: many immigrants are on edge, afraid to go to work or leave their homes amid the immigration crackdown.

But President Donald Trump has made the Somali community a special target of his deportation rhetoric after a recent government fraud case in Minnesota included a number of Somali defendants. Since December, Trump has made numerous jabs at the community, calling them “garbage” and saying “they contribute nothing.""

Wahid said early afternoons at the family business once meant 15 to 20 customers. These days, it’s tough to get one.

Wahid is a citizen, but he said the fear extends beyond just immigrants. Citizens are also scared of coming in, especially following the killing of Renee Good and the ICE raid at Roosevelt High School in south Minneapolis.

“I think that caused a lot of people to not even want to come,” he said, because they could be targeted “just because of their race.”

Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that law enforcement uses “reasonable suspicion” to make arrests under the fourth amendment.

“A person’s immigration status makes them a target for enforcement, not their skin color, race or ethnicity,” she said.

Upstairs, Bashir Garad runs Safari Travel & Accounting Services. Not only has the crackdown in Minneapolis meant he's lost almost all his customers, but his existing clients are cancelling upcoming trips because they’re worried they won’t be let back into the country.

“They see a lot of unlawful things going on in the city,"" he said. “They look at something bad, and then they think some bad things may happen to them.” The majority of his clients are East African, and nearly all are U.S. citizens. They still hesitate to travel.

“The government is not doing the right thing,” he said. “If there’s a criminal, there’s a criminal. Regardless, there are ways to find the criminal, but to marginalize the community’s name, and a whole people, that is unlawful.”

Ibrahim Dahiye, who sells electronics, said winter always used to be slow, “but now it’s totally different. No one comes here. All the stores are closed, few are open.”

Since the crackdown began, Dahiye said his business is down $20,000 monthly, and he’s now pooling funds to make rent.

He said he's lost most of his customers. His employees are too scared to come to work. He tapped his jacket pocket, saying he keeps his passport on him at all times.

“I don’t know what we can do,” Dahiye said. “We believe in Allah, but we can’t do anything.”",https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/abc_news_default_2000x2000_update_16x9_992.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 09:58:35.061188

Five hours away at the Fort Benning U.S. Army base, near Columbus, ICE conducts more specialized tactical training for its elite units.
As ICE’s special response teams have expanded, so has its programming at the military base.
To train its sniper teams and special response groups, ICE has also inked deals with military contractors and obscure security firms.
“Target Down Group is honored to have provided training to them in order to assist them [sic] perform their duties.” The other ICE training contractors mentioned in this story did not respond to inquiries, nor did ICE.","Over the past six months, per federal procurement records reviewed by The Lever, a variety of shadowy private security and weapons firms have been tapped to provide firearms and combat training to Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) snipers and special response teams — several of which had never before received any federal contracts.

Jonathan Ross, the ICE agent who killed 37-year-old legal observer Renee Good in Minnesota last week, was a 10-year veteran of an ICE special response team, the agency’s equivalent of a SWAT team. Good’s killing has sparked nationwide unrest and scrutiny of ICE’s increasingly violent tactics.

The firms that have won valuable contracts under the Trump administration to train officers like Ross include a Texas armed security company, a politically connected sniper firm in Florida, and a shadowy tactical training company in Virginia. One, Target Down Group, is owned by the brother of Rep. Nick LaLota (R-N.Y.), as Wired reported in September.

These firms are among the many private entities, alongside private prison companies and social media surveillance firms, lining up for their cut of the Trump administration’s deportation spending blitz, which nearly tripled ICE’s annual budget with the enactment of the GOP’s One Big Beautiful Bill in July.

ICE’s workforce has ballooned by 120 percent since President Donald Trump’s inauguration amid an unprecedented hiring frenzy. The agency has slashed its training requirements and loosened hiring standards to hire as many new recruits as possible.

The new contracts with little-known companies that advertise training in “advanced techniques once exclusive to military protection units,” are another window into the ongoing militarization of ICE, a subagency of the Department of Homeland Security.

ICE has long deployed tanks and specialized tactical units in the course of immigration enforcement. But the agency is now spending more than ever before on munitions and military equipment to outfit its officers. The consequences of this spending spree, in the view of many people who have taken to the streets in Minneapolis and around the country, were seen in the killing of Good and, a day later, the shooting of two people during a traffic stop by ICE.

A Bloomberg report last month found that ICE spent nearly $140 million on weapons and ammunition in the final weeks of the 2025 fiscal year, buying from some vendors that had previously worked primarily with the Pentagon. (A single vendor, Lionheart Alliance, received a $49 million contract last month to provide tactical gear like ballistic helmets to ICE.)

Most new ICE recruits go through several weeks of routine training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia. Five hours away at the Fort Benning U.S. Army base, near Columbus, ICE conducts more specialized tactical training for its elite units. As ICE’s special response teams have expanded, so has its programming at the military base.

ICE also rents firing ranges around the country for its agents; ICE spends the second-highest amount of money on gun-range contracts in Minnesota, behind Texas.

ICE’s training methods at Fort Benning have come under scrutiny before. In 2019, under the first Trump administration, the agency inked a contract with military contractor Strategic Operations, Inc. to build out its “tactical operations complex” at the military base, including a “hyper realistic” replica of a home in Arizona and an apartment complex in Chicago in order to train its agents for supposed “urban warfare.”

Strategic Operations, Inc. received a subsequent $975,000 contract from ICE in 2024 for another “modular training structure” at Fort Benning, procurement records show.

Already, since Sept. 1, 2025, ICE has spent nearly $8 million on new equipment — including simulation rounds, junk cars, sniper training gear, and a model building — for various training courses, including for its tactical training at Fort Benning, per The Lever’s review of contracting records.

To train its sniper teams and special response groups, ICE has also inked deals with military contractors and obscure security firms.

In July, ICE awarded a first-time, $23,000 contract to Reticence Group LLC, a Texas-based armed security firm, for “specialized law enforcement pistol and rifle” training. The company, led by two SWAT officers in Texas, advertises that it offers “covert and confidential armed security contractors” for the private sector, as well as “firearms training that pushes limits.”

Another sole source contract in July for $35,000 was awarded to Path Consulting LLC, a Virginia Beach-based firm that, according to a contract notice, provides “[close-quarter combat] live fire training” and would help an ICE special response team “develop new standard operating procedures.”

Although the contract notice indicated that Path Consulting LLC had worked with ICE in the past, no other online procurement records mention its name. A call to a phone number linked to the company went unanswered.

In September, ICE issued a no-bid contract to Target Down Group, a company owned by Dan LaLota, the brother of Nick LaLota, who has served as the Republican U.S. Representative for New York’s 1st congressional district since 2023. (Dan LaLota denied his brother had any role in the award when asked by Wired in September.) Most of Target Down Group’s leadership are veterans of the U.S. special forces; the company’s president, Dan LaLota, is a former U.S. Marine.

The company’s website advertises “elite firearms instruction,” drawing from “years of experience as veterans from U.S. Military Special Operations.” In the Department of Homeland Security’s September justification for the no-bid contract, officials wrote that ICE had an “immediate requirement to procure precision fires and specialized observation capabilities for the national Special Response Team (SRT) sniper program.”

“The law enforcement officers of ICE have a very challenging job to conduct,” LaLota wrote in response to The Lever’s request for comment. “Target Down Group is honored to have provided training to them in order to assist them [sic] perform their duties.”

The other ICE training contractors mentioned in this story did not respond to inquiries, nor did ICE.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2255809580-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 14:57:28.524563

Kaden Rummler said in an interview that he was in agonizing pain and underwent an extensive six-hour surgery to his left eye after he was injured at a Jan. 9 protest over the fatal shooting of a woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis. Rummler said he has no depth perception and can no longer drive. Shards of metal and a nickel-sized piece of plastic remain lodged in his skull, his attorney said, and he is considering suing.

""It's going to affect every aspect of my life,"" said Rummler, who hopes to pursue a career in forestry.

A second demonstrator at the same protest outside a federal immigration building in Santa Ana told the Los Angeles Times he was also blinded in one eye by a projectile fired by federal agents. Britain Rodriguez, 31, said he was standing on steps outside the immigration building when he was struck in the face.

""I remember hitting the ground and feeling like my eye exploded in my head,"" Rodriguez told the newspaper.

The Department of Homeland Security didn't respond to questions from The Associated Press about what type of projectile was used. Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for the agency, said in an emailed statement this week that the protesters were violent and that two officers were injured but didn't specify the extent of their injuries. DHS said one demonstrator was taken to the hospital with a cut. McLaughlin confirmed to the Times that was a reference to Rummler and called his injury claims ""absurd.""

Rummler has been charged with a misdemeanor count of disorderly conduct. One of his fellow protesters was jailed for several days and has been charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding a federal officer.

Rummler's attorney John Washington said doctors want to know whether the materials in the projectile could be toxic but have been unable to get answers from DHS. Washington said based on their preliminary investigation they believe it was a capsule made from metal and plastic containing pepper spray.

The injuries in California are the latest in a growing number of violent encounters between federal agents and community members during protests over the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.

Federal immigration agents deployed to Minneapolis have used aggressive crowd-control tactics that have become a dominant concern after the deadly shooting of Renee Good.

In Santa Ana, hundreds of people marched in the streets on Jan. 9 to protest Good's killing. A smaller group later congregated outside the federal immigration building, shouting expletives through megaphones about ICE, according to video taken by OC Hawk, a group that films breaking news in Orange County.

The video shows a handful of officers in riot gear standing guard and urging demonstrators to move back. An orange cone is later seen rolling onto a plaza outside the building, and authorities begin firing crowd-control projectiles as they walk toward the crowd.

In the video, an officer is seen grabbing a protester by the arm and Rummler and a few others are seen stepping forward shouting in response. An officer then fires a crowd-control weapon, striking Rummler from several feet away. Rummler grabs his face and falls to the ground, and an officer grabs him by the shirt and drags him backward across the ground toward the building, the video shows. Later, video appears to show him face down on the ground being handcuffed.

Rummler said he joined the protest against immigration authorities because he can't stand seeing families torn from their homes. Despite his injuries, he said he would do it again.

""I refuse to sit around idly and watch that happen, and in 50 years, I would absolutely regret not trying to make a change,"" he said.

Washington, a civil rights lawyer, said his client could have been killed.

""Any officers with just the most basic training would know you don't shoot someone ever in the face with this, but let alone at point-blank range, and that's because it is a lethal weapon when used like that, and it very nearly was,"" Washington said.

Geoffrey Alpert, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at University of South Carolina, said a thorough investigation is needed into the reason for using a high level of force in that situation.

""I don't know of any projectile where you train to shoot at that close range,"" Alpert said.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18381267_010925-kabc-raw-ice-protest-oc-vid-vid.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-18 10:58:00.307280

Conclusion The Second Circuit’s disposition in Hinds v. Bondi reinforces two practical rules in immigration litigation.","1. Introduction

Hinds v. Bondi (2d Cir. Jan. 16, 2026) is a nonprecedential summary order reviewing a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) that (1) sustained removability and (2) affirmed the Immigration Judge’s (“IJ”) discretionary denial of cancellation of removal.

The petitioner, Devon Alexander Hinds, a lawful permanent resident and native and citizen of Barbados, pleaded guilty on July 15, 2021 to New York Penal Law § 260.10(1) (endangering the welfare of a child). DHS charged him as removable for a “crime of child abuse” under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(E)(i). The IJ ordered removal and denied cancellation of removal as a matter of discretion; the BIA affirmed.

The petition raised two core issues: (1) whether the child-endangerment conviction categorically fits the immigration “crime of child abuse” ground—especially after Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo ended Chevron deference; and (2) whether the agency committed reviewable legal error in denying cancellation, given its credibility and evidentiary findings.

2. Summary of the Opinion

Removability: The Second Circuit denied review. It held that it remains bound by prior circuit precedent treating New York Penal Law § 260.10(1) as categorically matching the BIA’s child-abuse definition, and that Loper Bright does not permit a panel to disregard those precedents. The court also noted an independent procedural barrier: Hinds did not raise his removability challenge to the BIA.

Cancellation of removal: The Second Circuit dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, concluding that Hinds’s arguments attacked factfinding and the weighing of evidence—matters largely insulated from review by statute—rather than presenting a constitutional claim or colorable question of law.

3. Analysis

A. Precedents Cited

1) Child-abuse removability and post-Loper Bright stare decisis

Matthews v. Barr, 927 F.3d 606 (2d Cir. 2019): The court treated Matthews as controlling authority that a conviction under New York’s child-endangerment statute is a categorical match to the BIA’s definition of “child abuse.” Matthews also supplied the panel-rule framework: panels are bound by prior panels unless overruled en banc or by the Supreme Court.

Florez v. Holder, 779 F.3d 207 (2d Cir. 2015): Florez is the earlier decision adopting the BIA’s child-abuse definition in the context of New York Penal Law § 260.10(1), at least in part within a Chevron-deference framework. Hinds relied on Florez’s observation that it was “unlikely” the court would have adopted the BIA’s definition absent deference.

Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024): The petitioner argued that because Loper Bright overruled Chevron, the circuit should stop deferring to the BIA’s definition and revisit Florez/Matthews. The panel rejected that move, emphasizing Loper Bright’s statement that it did “not call into question prior cases that relied on the Chevron framework.”

Garcia Pinach v. Bondi, 147 F.4th 117 (2d Cir. 2025): The opinion treated Garcia Pinach as the circuit’s post-Loper Bright instruction that “Loper Bright provides no basis for us to disregard” earlier Chevron-reliant circuit precedent. This case is the immediate bridge from Loper Bright’s general statement to the Second Circuit’s operational rule of adherence.

Ud Din v. Garland, 72 F.4th 411 (2d Cir. 2023): Cited for the issue-exhaustion principle—courts generally do not review issues not first presented to the agency. The panel used Ud Din to underscore that Hinds did not challenge removability before the BIA.

2) Cancellation-of-removal review limits and the law/fact line

Rodriguez v. Gonzales, 451 F.3d 60 (2d Cir. 2006): Used to frame the two-step structure of cancellation of removal: (i) statutory eligibility and (ii) discretionary decision whether relief is warranted.

Wilkinson v. Garland, 601 U.S. 209 (2024): Central to jurisdiction and standards. The court cited Wilkinson both for the proposition that review is limited to constitutional claims and questions of law, and for its taxonomy distinguishing reviewable “application of a statutory legal standard … to an established set of facts” from unreviewable factfinding like credibility determinations.

Barco-Sandoval v. Gonzales, 516 F.3d 35 (2d Cir. 2007): Cited for the idea that use of an “incorrect legal standard” can supply a reviewable question of law in cancellation cases.

Mendez v. Holder, 566 F.3d 316 (2d Cir. 2009): Cited for the principle that “ignoring or seriously mischaracteriz[ing]” important facts can present a reviewable legal error.

Penaranda Arevalo v. Bondi, 130 F.4th 325 (2d Cir. 2025): The court relied on Penaranda Arevalo to draw the jurisdictional line: it lacks jurisdiction to review “the agency’s weighing of the evidence, or the logic it employed in drawing inferences from it.”

3) Use of police reports/complaints and agency fact roles

Padmore v. Holder, 609 F.3d 62 (2d Cir. 2010): Invoked by Hinds to challenge reliance on a police report. The panel distinguished Padmore as a case about impermissible BIA fact-finding (not the IJ’s factfinding role).

In re Arreguin De Rodriguez, 21 I. & N. Dec. 38 (B.I.A. 1995): Cited by Hinds to argue arrest reports deserve little weight. The panel distinguished it: there, prosecution was declined and wrongdoing was denied; here, there was a conviction and not a complete denial.

Carcamo v. U.S. Dep't of Just., 498 F.3d 94 (2d Cir. 2007): The panel treated Carcamo as affirming that “police reports and complaints, even if containing hearsay and not a part of the formal record of conviction,” may be admitted for discretionary-relief determinations.

Argueta v. Holder, 617 F.3d 109 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting In re C-V-T, 22 I. & N. Dec. 7 (B.I.A 1998)): Cited for the proposition that “proof of genuine rehabilitation” is a relevant discretionary factor in the overall balancing test.

B. Legal Reasoning

1) Removability: exhaustion + binding precedent after Loper Bright

The court’s removability analysis proceeds on two reinforcing tracks.

Agency exhaustion: Because Hinds did not challenge removability in his BIA appeal, the court invoked Ud Din v. Garland for the general rule against reviewing issues not presented to the agency. The panel noted this as a threshold obstacle, though it also addressed the merits in the alternative (“assuming arguendo”).

Stare decisis despite Chevron’s demise: On the merits, the panel treated Florez v. Holder and Matthews v. Barr as binding circuit precedent establishing that New York Penal Law § 260.10(1) qualifies under the BIA’s “crime of child abuse” definition. Although Hinds argued Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo undermined those decisions by eliminating Chevron deference, the panel applied the circuit’s post-Loper Bright approach from Garcia Pinach v. Bondi: Loper Bright expressly disclaimed disturbing prior Chevron-based outcomes, so it does not provide an “intervening Supreme Court decision” sufficient to permit a panel to overrule prior circuit authority.

In practical terms, the decision announces a stability rule: in this circuit, the end of Chevron does not automatically reopen settled circuit constructions in immigration cases where the circuit previously deferred to the agency, absent a more specific Supreme Court signal or en banc reconsideration.

2) Cancellation of removal: jurisdictional limits and deference to IJ factfinding

For cancellation, the panel emphasized the statutory jurisdictional bar in 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), with the savings clause for constitutional and legal questions in § 1252(a)(2)(D). Citing Wilkinson v. Garland and Penaranda Arevalo v. Bondi, the panel treated credibility determinations, evidentiary weight, and inferential reasoning as unreviewable factual matters.

The panel then mapped Hinds’s arguments onto that law/fact line:

Credibility and the incident facts: The IJ found Hinds generally credible but not credible about the incident underlying the conviction, because his testimony conflicted with the victim’s sworn statement and other record evidence (including an order of protection). The court characterized this as classic IJ factfinding under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4)(B), not legal error.

Police report reliance: The panel relied on Carcamo v. U.S. Dep't of Just. to conclude that police materials can be used in discretionary-relief adjudication. It also rejected the claim that the BIA engaged in improper factfinding, pointing to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (BIA reviews IJ factfinding only for clear error). Padmore v. Holder was distinguished on this basis.

Rehabilitation evidence: The IJ considered Hinds’s failure to complete sex offender counseling (even if not court-ordered) as part of the discretionary assessment, supported by Argueta v. Holder and In re C-V-T. The panel treated Hinds’s objections as disagreement with weighing and inference, not a legal-standard error under Barco-Sandoval v. Gonzales or a serious mischaracterization under Mendez v. Holder.

Because Hinds did not identify a legal-standard mistake, a constitutionally cognizable defect, or a serious record distortion, the court held it lacked jurisdiction and dismissed that portion of the petition.

C. Impact

Post-Loper Bright continuity in the Second Circuit: Even after Chevron’s overruling, litigants challenging long-settled circuit outcomes that incorporated Chevron deference face a steep barrier. This order—tracking Garcia Pinach v. Bondi—signals that only an en banc decision or a more directly on-point Supreme Court ruling is likely to dislodge existing circuit immigration precedent.

Strategic premium on agency issue preservation: The court’s reliance on Ud Din v. Garland reinforces that arguments (including new legal theories prompted by intervening Supreme Court decisions) should be raised to the BIA to avoid forfeiture/exhaustion problems.

Narrow channel for cancellation-of-removal appellate review: The decision exemplifies the constrained review permitted by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) and (D) after Wilkinson v. Garland: framing disputes as “legal questions” will fail if the substance is disagreement with credibility calls, evidentiary weight, or inferences.

Use of police statements in discretionary relief: By leaning on Carcamo v. U.S. Dep't of Just., the order underscores that sworn victim statements and police documents can significantly influence discretionary relief outcomes even if they include hearsay—so long as used for discretionary assessment rather than categorical removability.

4. Complex Concepts Simplified

“Categorical match”: A method of deciding whether a state conviction fits a federal immigration removal category by looking at the statute’s elements (what the law requires for conviction), not the person’s specific conduct. Here, prior cases held New York Penal Law § 260.10(1) matches the BIA’s “child abuse” concept.

Chevron deference and Loper Bright: Chevron required courts (in many circumstances) to defer to reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes. Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo ended that doctrine going forward, but—crucially for this case—the Supreme Court said it was not reopening past cases that used Chevron. The Second Circuit treats that as a reason to keep following its earlier decisions unless an en banc court or the Supreme Court specifically changes the rule.

Issue exhaustion: Generally, you must present an argument to the agency (here, the BIA) before asking a federal court to review it. The court cited this as a reason it “generally” will not review removability arguments not raised before the BIA.

Discretionary relief vs. eligibility: Even if someone is legally eligible for cancellation of removal, the IJ can still deny it as a matter of discretion after weighing positive and negative factors (rehabilitation, seriousness of conduct, family ties, etc.).

Jurisdiction limits and “questions of law”: Congress largely barred courts from second-guessing discretionary denials like cancellation, except for constitutional claims and legal questions. Courts may review legal-standard mistakes, but not ordinary fact disputes like who is more credible or how much weight to give a police statement.

IJ vs. BIA fact roles: The IJ is the factfinder. The BIA generally may not find new facts; it reviews the IJ’s factfinding for “clear error.” That distinction is why Padmore v. Holder (BIA factfinding) did not help Hinds where the IJ made the factual determinations.

5. Conclusion

The Second Circuit’s disposition in Hinds v. Bondi reinforces two practical rules in immigration litigation. First, within the circuit, Loper Bright does not authorize panels to depart from prior Chevron-influenced circuit holdings such as Florez v. Holder and Matthews v. Barr; absent en banc or Supreme Court overruling, those decisions continue to govern. Second, challenges to the discretionary denial of cancellation of removal must identify a genuine legal or constitutional defect; disputes over credibility, evidentiary weight, and factual inferences—like the agency’s reliance on a victim’s sworn police statement—are typically outside the court’s jurisdiction.",https://www.casemine.com/images/casemine-share.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 10:58:21.776558

Good evening. My name is Bella Ryb and I’m the executive director of the Constitutional Law Center here at Stanford. And it is my pleasure to welcome you all to our annual Supreme Court roundup and preview. Tonight we have three fabulous panelists to talk us through the most important Supreme Court cases of last term and this term, and I’m excited to introduce them.

First, we have our very own Easha Anand. She is an assistant professor and the co-director of the Supreme Court Litigation Clinic here at Stanford Law School, where she represents employees, non-citizens, consumers, unions, criminal defendants, and civil rights plaintiffs before the United States Supreme Court.

She has also briefed well over 100 Supreme Court cases. She clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts of the United States Supreme Court. With that, I’ll hand it over to our panelists. Thank you.

Thank you Bella. Can you guys hear me in the back? Is this better? Better? Yeah. Okay. Uh, thank you Bella. Thanks to the Constitutional Law Center. Uh, thank you all for being here. It is such a treat to be here with Jeremy and Colleen. So thank you two from flying for flying out. Um, so those of you who have been here in previous years kind of know the drill.

We’ll each take a few minutes to kind of put a theme or a high level thought about the court on the table. Then we’ll kind of each run through a case from last term that’s significant and a case from this upcoming term that’s significant. Um, and one of us will kind of take point on table setting and explaining what the case is about.

Uh, but I hope that both of you will feel free to kind of chime in with questions and comments as we go along. Um, so with that, maybe Colleen, I’ll turn it over to you to start, if you don’t mind. Um, uh. Court at this moment an idea or thought you wanna kind of put on the table or an observation you wanna share?

I’m sorry. I’ll figure out the microphone before I talk again. Uh, can people hear me? Great. Okay.

Hello? Oh, can you hear me now? Okay, great. Um, uh, I was always too loud as a child, so wearing microphones makes me very self-conscious. Um, anyway, what I was, what I started out saying is that I, I think that the court, that, that there’s a lot to be praised about the court right now. I think this is an incredibly difficult time in our country and I think that the court is functioning and, um, I’m not, I’m not going to say well, but I actually, I think that in a lot of ways it is actually functioning quite well.

So at a time when Congress is not, uh, legislating and the, um, president is doing something, but maybe not exactly what the, um, constitution contemplates in all respects, uh, I think that the Supreme Court is functioning as, um, the Constitution contemplates. I think that it is, it is deciding cases and I think that it is, um, deciding cases and, and, and talking, uh, and, and demonstrating how people can, um, speak to one another with very different views in government in a way that the other branches perhaps are not.

So I think if you, uh, go to an oral argument, um, you would be surprised, uh, because if you read in the newspapers, the, um, court is depicted as this, uh, partisan beast. Um. If you read the Supreme Court decision, sometimes there’s quite a lot of, uh, rhetoric from, um, both sides. If you go to oral argument, you get a very, um, civilized, thoughtful argument about the law.

It’s not just a bunch of people saying what their policy preferences are. It’s not a bunch of people yelling at each other or, um, name calling. It’s actually people trying to have a serious discussion about, um, about the cases and about the principles. And it’s sort of, um, encouraging in this time to see, uh, one area of our government continuing to function.

So that’s what I wanna put on this, on the table. I recognize it’s not the most popular, but that I, I think we, we we can focus, uh, on what the Supreme Court is doing right. And just as a little end piece to say why I wanna focus on this is I think it’s really important to focus on what the Supreme Court is doing, right?

Because I think we’re in a time when the legitimacy of courts is being questioned and the need to adhere to judicial decrees is being questioned. And when we, uh, constantly focus on what’s wrong with the Supreme Court and wrong with courts, I think it actually makes it easier to, to push them aside and to say, why bother? Why bother with them? Anyway, so, um, focusing on the good. There you go.

Can I ask, I’m curious, the last kind of piece you put on the table about the kind of legitimacy of the court and the likelihood of following judicial decrees. What are your thoughts about kind of the Supreme Court’s role in that? Because I think, um, I maybe among others was a little bit surprised to see, for instance, the recent opinion by Justices, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh kind of chastising some of the lower courts. I think I’ve also been surprised to see that in general, um, the Supreme Court majorities have not taken to task behavior.

Um, that does call into question the legitimacy of the decrees, right? So in, you know, for instance, JGD, the kind of Judge Boasberg place case where he says, turn the planes around. Um, and there’s a bunch of, uh, conduct that the dissenters call out as shady. Justice Barrett joins everything but the part characterizing the shady conduct, for instance.

Um, uh, and so I’m curious if you think the court has a role either in buttressing the lower courts, or in calling out some of the behavior that comes close to skirting these sorts of judicial decrees, um, as part of its effort to kind of retain a legitimacy. I mean, I, I think, you know, what you, to, to, to focus on one specific issue.

I think Justice Barrett not joining that particular part was actually an attempt to stay out of what I think she may have perceived as a very, a political dispute. Um, I, I think something that has been tremendously. Useful to me is that, uh, many of my friends are of, of the conservative persuasion. Um, and I think that the way that the Judge Boasberg episode happened seemed very clearly one way.

And then I talked to some incredibly, I think, intelligent principled people who saw it in a different, in a different way. And I think there was some, like how you saw it, maybe did depend more on politics than I had at, at first appreciated. And so I, I think that some of the, like not doing that is trying not to engage.

And I think there are serious questions to be asked about, like, you know, at what point does not engaging is that, you know, abdicating your, your important role in protecting the judiciary and the, the judicial institution. But I, I think that that, that, that’s where that’s coming from.

Um, Jeremy, can I turn it over to you? Any theme, topic, opinion about the Court you wanna put on the table?

Yeah. Theme and topic. Um, first of all, thank you to all the same folks for having us. I know all three of us are excited to be doing this. I think the theme, okay, I might have to move. Oh yeah, I have to move that up. Like Colleen, I also was told I was too loud throughout my life and I am in fact too loud. So this is going to be an unusual experience, um, acoustic of this rule. Yeah, no, no, it’s great.

Um, two thoughts. First is like everything in American society right now, it’s impossible this year to talk about the Supreme Court without talking about the president. The president, President Trump is sort of like the defining figure for our government, for our institutions, for our courts right now. And like all the oxygen in all of our conversations about anything relating to governance, it’s impossible to have a conversation about SCOTUS and review this year without talking about the president and the policies that they’re specifically responding to coming out of the executive branch.

So what that means in a big way is that this was the year of the emergency docket. Some people call it the shadow docket. Some people call it the interim orders docket. I’ll use emergency docket. ’cause that seems to appear the most in the most number of Supreme Court opinions these days. Um, it is the year of the emergency docket, and I think it is the year that the emergency docket proved it’s here to stay. So we can have a big interesting debate about whether the emergency docket is a good idea or whether it’s a bad idea. I happen to fall in a really unhelpful perspective on the, it’s here to stay. It can’t be never. It can’t be always, and we have to figure out how to live with it and when to live with it and what role it’s going to play.

It can’t be never, because there are seismic decisions coming out of individual district courts that prevent a policy, uh, a president from adopting a landmark policy. It can’t be always because if the emergency docket has problems that I think everyone acknowledges, rushed decision making, a lack of oral argument, a lack of detailed briefing, when you don’t have the full consideration, you get from full merits briefing and for full oral argument, you can revert to the mean, you get decisions that don’t fully explain themselves in this posture.

And so I admit some sympathies to the members of the court who basically say, we recognize that this has costs, but it can’t be that we never do this because there are some decisions coming out from the lower courts, from both the district courts and the court of appeals that require our intervention.

And so if it’s here, if we have to live with it, if it’s here to stay, how do we improve its procedural regularity? And I think the court, and I think a lot of the sort of commentators are around the court n. It’s fine to talk about whether it’s good or bad, but it’s time to acknowledge it’s here and it’s time to acknowledge that we should try to figure out what are the best ways to improve it.

When should they have oral argument? What are the benefits of oral argument on these emergency cases? When should they just grant certiorari and turn the case in an expedited way into a merits case right out the gate? They’re trying different options across the board. So we will talk about individual cases later, but in the birthright case, they set argument in the Cook case, the, um, Lisa Cook fed, uh, fed board member case. They set argument in the slaughter case involving the firing and FTC official, they granted cert in most cases. They’re just issuing orders. When should they just issue orders? When should they turn these cases into full cases? How should they think about these cases knowing that we live in a new world with a pretty small merits docket and a pretty big emergency docket.

And that’s gonna define in many ways the success of the court and how people grapple with the court. And so it’s time to pivot ourselves into living with it. Um.

Maybe I’ll actually use my time to ask you a follow up question, which is about, um, my prediction that actually we’re gonna see more oral argument. So here’s my thesis and I’ll be curious to hear both your reactions. So, um, we know there’s sort of one fairly consistent vote actually for briefing an oral argument, which is Justice Kavanaugh, right? So he is, um, dating back to a case called Labrador v. Doe, which was about Idaho’s ban on gender affirming care. He writes his concurrence, that’s sort of like, you know, I think we should be setting argument a lot more. These, these sort of interim orders have a lock in effect, um, and there’s no reason we can’t do it. And then actually somewhat consistently in the Trump cases, right? So in a A RP, that’s the Third Alien Enemies Act case that sort of turn the buses around in Texas case, in boil the case about firing the kind of purportedly independent head of the consumer product safety commission, both cases, he writes these concurrences saying, I think we should set this for argument one vote.

I’ve kind of understood why to date a bunch of the other justices haven’t wanted to, to be the remaining votes. It’s four votes to grant cert. We got one, the three liberals. Maybe you thought at some point that you could limit the kind of bad law from your perspective that’s being made. Right. The state decisions, um, for a long time were considered not precedential. Right? It was not so long ago that Justices, Alito and Kavanaugh in a case called Merrill v. Milligan about, um, which was one of these redistricting cases where the Supreme Court granted a stay. Um, they would literally write a concurrence that says like, please no one mistake this for precedent. To reiterate, this opinion is not precedential, right?

And so maybe you’re one of the three liberals you think, I don’t wanna force a grant ’cause that’ll convert this from an emergency docket, uh, order that is not precedential. To read it, not precedential, um, to something that that’s got real force that’s in the US reports. Um, you know, we’ve heard skepticism from some of the other justices.

Justice Gorsuch in the TikTok case, which was one of these kind of expedited cases, writes, you know, because it was so expedited, I can’t profess the kind of certainty I would like to have. Justice Barrett, um, in a case that where the court granted cert early in the lifecycle of a case, um, about, um, Idaho’s abortion ban, when the court has to dismiss the case, she writes, you know, facts on the ground are changing, I think it was a bad idea to do this early. So if you’re the liberals, if you are Justice Gorsuch, who wants to have this kind of certainty, if you’re Justice Barrett, who’s worried about facts on the ground changing, I think I understand why to date you have not wanted to be votes 2, 3, 4 for a cert grant, full argument and briefing.

Um. That’s changed, right? So in recent months we’ve seen, uh, case after case where the court has treated prior emergency docket orders as squarely precedential. Um, so for instance, in the kind of removal cases, we saw kind of an initial case, um, about the firing of the, uh, MSPB and NLRB heads, uh, where the court doesn’t even really reach the merits, right?

It sort of says, uh, we think that the government’s likely to prevail on part of the analysis, but we don’t have any opinion about whether this falls into an exception. And yet the follow-on cases come up and they’re just citing back to that case. Um, there’s a series of cases about whether funding challenges go to district court or have to go to the court of federal claims.

Um, the Supreme Court not only cites back to emergency docket opinions and their reasoning, but in one instance, justices, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh even chastised the lower courts for not kind of squarely following that earlier precedent. So I guess my, my prediction is. Why hold back now? I think that we’re gonna see a lot more oral argument ’cause whatever your worries are about the difference between these emergency docket orders and what’s in the US reports, um, whether it’s because of bad law or certainty or whatever other values you have, it seems like that difference is getting erased.

So I’m curious if, if you think that’s right as a predictive matter or that pendulum’s gonna not gonna swing the other way.

I, I share Easha’s prediction that we’re likely to see more cases where they grant either cert immediately upon the emergency application or set additional briefing and argument.

I don’t know. I’m ready to say we’ll see it in sort of like the modal way that they handle these emergency applications. But I think we’re gonna see significantly more. We’re already seeing an increased number of this term. We’re already seeing. In two cases this year, they’ve already granted in these removal cases, one, they granted right from the emergency application for the removal of an FTC member. And then in the Lisa Cook case I was mentioning before, they set that for additional briefing and argument. So I think we’re gonna see the emergency docket as a way to tee up full briefing and oral argument a little more. I have to say, I think partially because of what Easha is identifying, I think in some respects it’s a welcome development.

If these orders are going to be precedential and if they’re going to bind the country for a couple of years before the US Supreme Court returns to the issue on the merits, then they’re effectively final. A great example is what we call the agency dismantling cases. I’m gonna try to avoid using like pejorative language. I’ve litigated some number of these cases, so I may have some strong feelings at various times. I’m sure there’s a better framing than agency dismantling cases. I think you can probably call them reduction in force cases instead. So call them RF cases, call them agency dismantling cases. Call them what you will. But the, the downsizing considerably of federal agencies. And those were consistently decided by emergency order without more detailed briefing, without more detailed oral argument, uh, and without detailed opinions. And that’s gonna last for a couple years. And it means that some agencies have lost 40% of all employees, 50% of all employees or more.

And so if that has happened and years go by, you can never refill those agencies. So if that’s gonna be effectively the final decision for the country on the validity of the rif slash downsizing slash dismantling of these agencies, it would be good. For the US Supreme Court to be confronted with the full panoply of arguments for the merits and demerits of that position and an oral argument to grapple more with the nuance.

Because one thing I found, and I think this goes to Colleen’s point earlier, oral argument does force courts to grapple more with nuance. It might not change the actual outcome of the bottom line vote, but it forces them to think about how far their rule goes. It forces them to talk to each other in open court about how far different sorts of rules go.

And when you add a little more procedural regularity, you might end up producing opinions that have a little more caveat, a little more, carve out a little more recognition of what makes that case particularly hard. And so it might not even change all the outcomes, but we’ll have more detail, more answers for why certain decisions were reached and may reached, and maybe a recognition on what the kind of cases are that would be different so that all of us as litigants, as states, as federal actors, as nonprofits as, as, uh, law school clinics will have more certainty about why decision X came out a certain way. So trial courts can know how best to follow it, and parties can know how best to litigate that precedent in the next case. So maybe speaking of a high profile case that migrated from the emergency docket to the merits docket, um,

Jeremy, uh, you argued the CASA case about universal injunctions. It was a masterful argument. If anyone has not listened to it yet, um, you offered to recap that case and tell us what you think it, it portends.

Okay. I am hopelessly biased about this case, so I will do everything in my power to check my biases about this case. Uh, the New York Times had a great title, uh, talking about this case that said the case about birthright citizenship in parentheses, but is really about nationwide injunctions.

And I thought that was like the perfect way to encapsulate it because so. Trump v. CASA is ostensibly a case, but is in no way a case about birthright citizenship itself, although it’s certainly looming in the background for this case. The first day of Trump two, President Trump issued an executive order redefining birthright citizenship, and a number of lawsuits were filed by states, by nonprofit organizations and by individuals and putative classes of individuals representing birthright citizens themselves.

And from my perspective, given, uh, 150 years of Supreme Court precedent and a very long, uh, tradition under the Fourteenth Amendment and predating the Fourteenth Amendment of what citizenship has always meant in this country, we all want our cases. And the United States, uh, perhaps recognizing the strength of our merits position did something very different in this case than it did in all the other cases.

In all, in basically every other case, not literally every other case, but close to every other case that it’s taken up to the US Supreme Court in the emergency docket in the last seven months, eight. Nine months, whatever, whatever amount of time it’s been. 10 years. Yeah. Dog months. Um, it, it, it took up the merits and all the other cases, but in this case, it conspicuously said Supreme Court, we are not here to talk to you about birthright citizenship. We are here to talk to you about a different problem. The fact that these individual trial courts across the country have all blocked the president across the nation from adopting his birthright citizenship executive order. And they made a case that this was a particularly good vehicle for the US Supreme Court to consider this question that had been bothering them for some number of years because it came from a presidential executive order.

I’m gonna explain later why that potentially made it a useful vehicle for them. Um, and the Supreme Court treated it very differently than the way it was treating the other applications. Set it for oral argument and invited additional amicus briefing. My one procedural comment here is that these were early days, and this is one of the reasons I’m so bullish on additional briefing in these cases too.

These were early days where it wasn’t yet fully known that, uh, a filing by the president and the US Solicitor General’s office to the US Supreme Court would almost certainly get emergency relief if they agreed with him on the particular argument he was making. And so a lot of that brief has discussions about why on this posture it’s too soon for the Supreme Court to come in.

It has a lot of stuff about the equities of why the public interest or irreparable harm does not support the, the US Supreme Court stepping in at this stage. Now, it’s quite clear when you’re filing these sorts of filings in response to a, an emergency application by the president, you should de-emphasize those points and you should be just emphasizing why ultimately you think that the president does not have the right case on the merits because they have shown that they think the equities in these cases very much warrant early stepping in and allowing the president to.

Um, federal law as the president understands it if they ultimately agree with him. And so, um, we probably briefed seven pages on the question of universal injunctions, which is not the amount of briefing you would want as a party for heading into a US Supreme Court dis, uh, case about the propriety of universal injunctions and incredibly difficult legal question.

I do not think the birthright citizenship merits question is the hardest question I’ve ever had to litigate as a lawyer. But the universal injunctions question is a genuinely difficult question that has long vexed administrations of both presidential parties. And so ultimately we had argument and in my view, because of the increased procedural regularity that we saw in the emergency docket, in that case, we got a much more nuanced opinion that came outta the US Supreme Court.

It did not issue a decision that matched what New Jersey and the other states were ultimately asking for squarely, which was to specifically affirm our nationwide injunction. Instead, the US Supreme Court for the first time, as a majority said that, um, the statutes that govern, uh, jurisdiction in the courts, the equity power of the courts does not actually let, uh, these sorts of orders be issued.

But it had a ton of carve outs, a ton of carve outs, and from my perspective, the import or lack thereof of a case like Trump v. CASA is gonna completely rise or fall with how those questions get answered in the future. So, Trump v. CASA, big headline day of is the universal injunction is over.

But actually there’s tons of questions they note in the opinion that say maybe there are other opportunities to get nationwide relief. So they say sometimes, maybe even the states in this case still have an opportunity to get nationwide relief if we show we need it to protect ourselves from harm.

People move across borders when they’re citizens or not citizens. It harms us in a lot of ways when we’re dealing with our own punitive citizens. Maybe this is a case that meets that. They also said in cases where you’re challenging agency actions as distinct from presidential actions, a separate law, the Administrative Procedures Act may or may not.

They reserve the question entirely allow for this kind of universal relief across the board. So maybe presidential eos are exempt from this, but there’s a whole different statute with a whole different potential legal tradition that applies when an agency is acting instead. And also they said, and it shouldn’t be too hard, maybe to get class actions against a lot of these federal policies and how one answers those three questions, how easy it is for states to sue and when they need these sorts of broad remedies for complete relief.

Whether and when the administrative procedures act separately allows for this sort of universal relief and how easy it is to get class actions against federal policies will either make Trump v. CASA an incredibly seismic, hugely important case about the role of the federal government vis-a-vis everyone else, or a case that seemed a lot bigger than it was until everyone pivoted in the kind of filings that they filed going forward.

And so from my perspective, Trump v. CASA was arguably the biggest case of the term last term, and also arguably not going to make a huge difference on the ground. And I think anyone who tells you they know the answer to that, to how the Court’s gonna answer those three questions in the future is a little bit unknowable.

And all I’ll say is, before CASA there were three nationwide injunctions against birthright citizenship. And after CASA, there were four nationwide injunctions against birthright citizenship. And the United States did not take the injunctions back up knowing I think that they’d gotten everything that they were gonna get out of that case.

And so from my perspective, I think it is a really interesting, meaningful case about how the Supreme Court sees the role of courts writ large and sees its role vis-a-vis the lower courts, if there’s gonna be a big conflict between the executive and the judiciary, the Supreme Court’s making clear it wants to be the one deciding what the judiciary’s posture is, vis-a-vis the executive as much as possible.

It’s why we have an emergency docket, and it’s been so active. It’s why CASA reflects a certain conception about the role of different courts authority and a specific statement that the Supreme Court’s opinions will always be followed by the executive, a concession that the United States truly made during oral argument.

So it’s very much a story about the Supreme Court, making sure it has the authority over the judiciary for these inter branch conflicts, but what that means on the ground for litigation going forward. I, to me, is a big open question.

Yeah, I guess. I guess that is my question from it. I have to say, I read the opinion and I thought. I don’t think this is actually different from prevailing law, uh, in the sense that it seemed to just be saying, you know, remedies should be limited to the parties. And sometimes because of the nature of the particular legal dispute to truly remedy the party’s injury, you’re going to have to give wide relief. And I thought that was the law. Um, so I guess like what, what was added by uh, CASA?

So I think CASA did something very important, I think, um, and important has no value judgment in it. But I think that this part was important, which is I think that before CASA District Courts were all over the place about what were the basis for nationwide relief. So some district courts and in our view, the district court, in the case I had been litigating, thought that nationwide relief, you look for relief for the parties and nationwide relief makes sense here because the parties needed it and Justice Barrett for the majority leaves open that that might have been right and remands the question and says, maybe actually in this case, we’re just not deciding one way or the other. Maybe in this case a nationwide injunction is fine. You did have a series of decisions across administrations and the district courts that were issuing these decisions would vary, but the idea was the same, which would say, for example, uniformity in immigration law is important and therefore a nationwide injunction must follow.

And I think that way of reasoning of saying, like, uniformity of this area of law or of this right is enough to justify the injunction. That’s the kind of stuff I think CASA‘s taking off the table. And so I think CASA itself cites different district court opinions that were in front of it. There were three different district courts that went in front of it and it is saying, one of you looked like you used a test that works.

We’re leaving if you applied it right, but it looks like you used a test like Colleen is describing. That’s fair. Two of you look to us and the dissent disagrees with the reading of the district courts, but what matters is what the majority thought. The majority says. Two of you, you actually just thought like a uniformity or right sort of analysis is good enough to justify nationwide relief and that we’re taking off the table.

Uh, Colleen, I’m gonna kick it to you next. I’m actually excited you’re gonna talk about this case. ’cause I think it’s a challenge to your collegiality theme, maybe a little bit. Uh, that’s the case of Mahmoud v. Taylor. Um, I’ll turn this on.

Uh, yes. Look, no one is collegial all the time. Um, we have to look on balance. Uh. Uh, yeah, I, I, I find Mahmoud v. Taylor a really a tricky case. So just to give you the facts briefly, in case, um, you are not aware of it, this is the case in which the Supreme Court appended the pages of children’s books to its, uh, decision. Um, the actual question presented was whether Montgomery County Public Schools, which is actually the public school system that my children attend.

Um, yep. I’m a graduate of Montgomery County.

Oh, really? Well, we’ll talk later about where, but, um, anyway, uh, it’s about whether Montgomery County Public Schools was permitted to have a program in which they, um, they, uh, included books. And it’s so hard to talk about the facts of this case because the Def Defense dissent and the majority actually disagree strongly on the facts.

So I’m trying to kind of present a, a, a neutral, a neutral, uh, dis, uh, account, but books featuring LGBTQ+ characters arguably, um, encouraging the view that, um, that an LGBTQ lifestyle is okay, exists, um, a great thing and everybody should have to be it. Uh, it really, it kind of depends, um, on how you see these, uh, these particular children’s books.

Um, but Montgomery County introduces them into the curriculum. It originally offers an opt-out, and this is very important. It originally says, parents, if you do not want your children to participate when these books are being taught, you can let us know. And that opt-out was consistent with an opt-out that Montgomery County has for, I didn’t actually know this, but human sexuality classes.

Um, you can opt out, uh, you can say you don’t want your kids to, to, to, to be there for that instruction as well. Then Montgomery County, um, decided that that was not administrable, that the opt-out wasn’t working because too many people were asking for opt-outs. And unlike in the, um, in the human sexuality, uh, lessons, which were a discreet part of the curriculum, where you could say like, you know, next week we’re doing this, do you want your kids to sit out?

They were just using the, the whole point of this program was to just integrate the books into the curriculum throughout. So Montgomery County does away with the opt-out, a number of parents who do not want their children to be exposed to these books object. Uh, and they say that the teachings in the book, uh, that the books are being used to teach values that are contrary to their religion because they are teaching values that celebrate the LGBTQ+ lifestyle that celebrate the idea that, um, humans can have different, uh, can, can, can have different genders from the gender with which they’re born. Did I just use gender wrong? Okay, good. Um, alright, so, uh, um, so they, uh, object these v the this and they say that it is a burden, a First Amendment burden on their rights to, um, force their children to be, uh, getting public education, uh, with it without an opt out.

So the case comes to the Supreme Court, and interestingly, I really do think this is as I was an English major and a high school English teacher. And this is one of the few cases that seems to turn, to turn heavily on, um, on, on the interpretation, the, uh, of, of children’s books because Justice Alito writes this majority opinion saying that, yes, of course this is a First Amendment burden, an intolerable First Amendment burden, because he reads these children’s books as, um, ipar as as, as requiring, uh, as a message of like, uh, celebrating the LGBTQ plus lifestyle, celebrating, uh, the idea that you can have different genders over the course of your lifetime. And that, and, and he reads the instructive material accompanying these texts as, as, as, as essentially requiring teachers to say that these are values that our community has. Um.

Justice Sotomayor in dissent has a completely different reading of these children’s books. So her understanding of the children’s books is that these are books that simply treat LGBTQ+ people as existing, that they are just having char, they’re just characters. So, you know, there’s a, the, I, I’m gonna try to be brief on this, but the maj, the story that’s kind of at the, at the centerpiece is about a little girl who’s upset because her uncle is getting married. And Justice Alito reads this story as a sort of coy reference to the little girl being upset that her uncle is getting married because she’s upset that he is a gay man, marrying another man. And the lesson is she shouldn’t be upset. She should learn to celebrate it. And at the end, she does in fact celebrate the wedding. And Justice Alito reads this story as a story of a, a child learning, you should celebrate gay marriage.

I have to tell you, as a former English teacher, I actually think it’s just a story about a little girl who’s upset ’cause her beloved uncle is now maybe gonna spend more time with his husband and not with her. And I think the story, I think it would’ve been exactly the same if it was, uh, a, um, woman that he was marrying. Um, that so, so that story, I think Justice Sotomayor has the better of the, uh, literary interpretation.

There are other stories where I actually think that Justice Alito has the better of the literary interpretation, where I think it is hard to read the stories as, as saying anything other than like, these are values that we should have. Um, you know, books are great because you can have lots and lots of different interpretations of them.

Um, but it’s really tough when you have a Supreme Court case that turns on this because, um, I don’t quite know what the holding of Mahmoud really is at the end of the day because I think. There’s one way of reading Justice Alito’s opinion to just say like, look, you can’t have a bunch of lessons in school where you tell everyone that they have to be happy about gay marriage.

Like, right. Like that’s one way of understanding it. And, and I think at the end of the day, we could probably all say like, okay, that’s, that’s pretty, pretty reasonable. Just like, you know, you can’t have a bunch of lessons at school saying that everybody has to believe that Jesus Christ was our Lord and Savior.

You know, like, fine, fine, that’s what’s going on. But if you read it actually as him saying, you know, people have to be able to opt out of being exposed to books that have, uh, LGBTQ+ people in it, that’s a much bigger statement. And that would be a decision that has much, much bigger effects. You know, again, as a former English teacher, I taught lots of books.

I was teaching in high school. I taught lots of books that had a lot of, um, characters of all different sorts in them that I’m sure you could have lots of objections to the messages of those books and the, and what was going on. And like, you know, the point is they, they, they just kind of existed and we were using them and we were talking about them and we were having open discussions and I’m genuinely not sure reading Mahmoud whether I would have to allow opt-outs for a lot of the books that I was teaching, what my responsibilities would be.

And, and that’s, that’s really tough. So I find Mahmoud an interesting and really tough case. I actually looked online to see the California Public Schools has put out, um, public school system has put out guidance on Mahmoud that kind of says what I said I just said, which is like, we don’t really know what it means. Don’t do anything dramatic because no one’s quite sure exactly what that decision is going to stand for in the end.

Uh, well, I, I have a lot of thoughts about the case as a Montgomery County Public School graduate, as the owner of both Uncle Bobby’s Wedding and Pride Parade. I’ve read them both to my kid.

Yeah. Um, uh, but in the interest of kind of getting through a few more cases before we turn over to Q&A, um, and we, I’ll bring up the rear and talk a little bit about another blockbuster case from last term, uh, United States v. Skrmetti. So I’ll be brief about the background of this case, ’cause I think it’s one that’s familiar to a lot of people.

Um, about half the states have passed partial or total bans on gender affirming care for minors. This is treatment that’s lifesaving for a lot of children and their families. Um, and so both United States, this is during the Biden administration and the individual families represented by the ACLU sue to enjoin one of these bans in Tennessee.

Um, uh, Sixth Circuit upholds it so they lose the Sixth Circuit. They seek certiorari. Quick note at the outset. So both the United States and the ACLU seek certiorari, um, and the United States petition contains one question. It asks just does this law violate the equal protection clause? The ACLU petition has two different questions.

It’s the equal protection clause piece, and then it’s also a question about the substantive due process rights of the parents. Um, I think sort of, uh, puzzlingly to a lot of observers, the Supreme Court just takes the United States petition and not the ACLU petition puzzlingly because, um, at that point it was clear that there was some chance that the administration was going to change, right?

The United States position on this issue was going to change. We were in an election year, and, uh, lo and behold, come January, um, uh, the Trump administration comes in and says, we think actually Tennessee’s law is totally constitutional. Puzzling also because, you know, the Supreme Court has been raring, or at least some of the justices have been raring, um, to deal with this kind of substantive due process parents’ rights question. So we see, um, justices, uh, Alito and Thomas in a couple of different cases, writing these dissents from denial of certiorari. So cases where the Supreme Court says, we’re not taking this case, these two justices say, would like to take this case, um, about that issue. They, the cases that they’re interested in arise from, um, school districts that have a policy that says, um, uh, if a child doesn’t want you to, you don’t tell their parents what pronouns they’re using at school.

And, uh, this has been challenged on the kind of substantive due, substantive due process, parents’ rights front. So that’s at the outset of the case. Okay. So what are the arguments that get made within this equal Protection Clause framework? Um, so remember, right, 1L Con Law, um, uh, most laws just get what’s called rational basis review, right? So laws just dripping with animus or wholly arbitrary. We trust the democratic process. Certain laws that classify on so-called suspect characteristics, things like race, sex, national origin, get what’s called heightened scrutiny. So you have to look a little bit more into whether there’s an actual problem being solved and that this law is kind of a good way to do it, because otherwise you’re worried about kind of rank discrimination.

So challengers make two sets of arguments, right? They say first this bill classifies on the basis of sex. If you were assigned male at birth and you want to take, um, uh, uh, puberty blockers or hormone therapy to deepen your voice or get facial hair, totally okay? If you are assigned female at birth and you wanna take the same drugs, uh, to deepen your voice or to develop facial hair, not okay. Under Tennessee’s law, that’s a sex classification.

Second, they say this bill also classifies, uh, people on the basis of their transgender status, right? Um. And, uh, even though the Supreme Court has not ruled on this yet, that is a suspect characteristic akin to, um, uh, uh, sex or race or these other, uh, characteristics that trigger heightened scrutiny.

So after argument, um, was clear the challenges were gonna lose, and the question was, how are they gonna lose? So possible path number one, which would’ve been kinda the best case scenario for the challengers, would have been the court holding or accepting for the sake of argument that this law did classify in the basis of sex or transgender status, um, and doing the kind of heightened scrutiny analysis, right? And the court could have said, um, again, in this world where the challengers are losing, look, this is about minors. It’s about medical care. It’s about from what our perspective is still evolving science, uh, and therefore this law is okay, even under heightened scrutiny. And that would’ve been the best possible outcome, I think, for the challengers, because it would’ve been devastating for a lot of families on the ground today. It would make clear that these sorts of laws are subject to some sort of scrutiny, and it would leave open the possibility that if the medical consensus changed these sorts of laws could be revisited.

The Court didn’t take that off ramp. I think it took the second least bad option from the challenger’s perspective, um, which was to basically say, um, uh, look, this law does not classify in either of those bases. We don’t have to address whether transgender status gets this kind of heightened protection. Um, instead we’re gonna say, this law classifies on the basis of medical condition.

Right? So they say neither a boy nor a girl can get, uh, puberty blockers to treat gender dysphoria. Transgender boy cannot get puberty blockers to treat gender dysphoria, but can get puberty blockers to treat premature puberty. Um, uh, I’d sort of commend folks to the def descent written by my former boss, justice Meyer, which I think takes apart this logic, um, uh, pretty effectively.

Um, the path is in terms of practical consequences, I think still far worse than the first outcome, right? It puts, um, state could pass a law outlawing this kind of treatment for adults and, uh, uh, that would classify in the basis of medical condition. And so it be subject only to rational basis review. Um, but it would, it’s not as bad for the challengers as the path the three of the Justices, justices, Barrett, Alito, and Thomas.

So Barrett, again, people always talk about kind of the 3, 3, 3 court and sort of put her squarely in the middle. Um, on this issue at least, she’s certainly not in the center of the court. It’s the Chief Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh that take this kind of middle path. Um. The path that Justice Barrett articulates says I would address right now the question of whether transgender status is suspect, um, and I would say no. So I would say laws that classify on the basis of transgender status don’t trigger any form of heightened scrutiny. Um, now the majority reserves that question, so who knows where it ends up? Um, uh, but at least for now, I would, I would assess this as the court picked. The second, the second least, the, the, the middle path among the worst in the world where the challenges are losing. The court picked the middle path, um, uh, despite three justices urging them to go further.

Um, with that, I, I guess I’m hoping we can transition to talking about the term coming up, um, blockbuster case in the docket, uh, tariff’s case that Colleen is helping to spearhead litigation about. Um, so we’re very lucky to have you here talking about the case. Tell us what’s going on and what your predictions are, without compromising any client con confidences.

Yes. So I am working on the litigation, so I’m only talking about publicly available information. Um, I am on the team of, uh, people representing a number of small businesses who sued to challenge, uh, President Trump’s Liberation Day, uh, tariffs.

Those were the tariffs that were imposed worldwide, um, on a number of countries, uh, in percentages between 10% and 50% increases. On, on, actually, I think just on, yes, on tariffs, uh, that on the existing tariffs. Um, President Trump introduced these tariffs in, in saying like, this is a, we are overhauling, uh, the tariff system and the American economy. This is going to be a massive change. Um, and the executive orders that he used to impose these new tariffs explained that there have been persistent large trade deficits, which were harming American manufacturing, um, harming Americans, um, national security readiness, uh, in terms of, of our dependence on foreign, uh, military supplies and, um, that, and, and, and overall just creating an emergency and an extraordinary and unusual threat.

Now, he had to say that this was an emergency and extraordinary and unusual threat because he is imposing these tariffs under IEEPA, which is an emergency law, uh, that is for, that allows the president to use a range of economic sanctions, um, in situations that are both a declared emergency and an extraordinary and unusual threat.

So IEEPA has been used in the past, for example, to impose embargoes. Um, the most famous instance of its use was in the Iran, Iran hostage crisis in the seventies when, um, the United States or the President set up a, uh, actually a whole claim claims tribunal system under IEEPA for dealing with, um, for dealing with, uh, Iranian assets, um, in, as part of an effort to get the Iranian hostage, the, sorry to get the hostages back. Um, so IEEPA is an emergency statute. One of the emergency powers that it gives the president is the authority to regulate importation and exportation. President Trump and the government interpret that phrase, that, that phrase to mean, uh, tariffs.

The idea, the, their argument goes regulate importation. What does that mean? Well, one of the most obvious ways to regulate importation is to impose tariffs. And, um, yes, the statute does not in any other way refer to tariffs. There are no limits, for example, on, uh, the tariff authority. There’s no minimums, there’s no none of that.

But, um, the idea is there’s lots of other major powers being given under IEEPA, including, and this is undisputed, the authority to impose embargoes on trade altogether. And so the, the theory goes regulate importation is a broad power for use in these emergency situations. The challengers allege a number of things, a number of problems with this.

One of the problems is that regulate is a word that is actually used over, uh, a thousand times in the US code, and it is not used to refer to taxation. So you all remember from back in the day, by back in the day here, I mean the American Revolution. Um, we fought, uh, a whole war about taxation and therefore, um, the framers treated taxation differently from regulation.

So the very first clause that imposes that, that grants powers to Congress, grants Congress, the power to tax and the power to impose duties, which are like tariffs, right? So, um, separately you have to go down three more clauses before you get to the power to regulate. Okay? So separate, separate regulation is separate from taxing.

It’s separate from tariffs. So a statute that says regulate importation and the views of the challengers does, uh, including me, does not mean, um, does not give the, the authority to impose, uh, tariffs. Uh, there’s a number oth of other arguments if you, even if you don’t buy that one, is that this is not an emergency or an extraordinary and unusual threat.

I think that actually on a kind of common sense level, a lot of people have that intuition. While like the president needs broad powers and emergencies, maybe he needs the, the power to impose tariffs. But, you know, if he’s saying there’s a large and persistent trade deficit, maybe that’s not really an emergency.

But the Supreme Court has been understandably nervous about second guessing when the President says something is an emergency because, uh, the Supreme Court doesn’t know anything about foreign affairs. They’re wisely in this one area, aware of their own, um, their own fallibility. Uh, they’re also really afraid about telling, um, district courts that they can, uh, second guess the president’s emergency authorities, because, you know, in a legitimate emergency, if the president needs to do something, what you would not want is some, is a district court immediately stepping in and, and, and barring it.

And again, you have to, to imagine a, a, a genuine emergency. So that’s probably the most common sense argument, but probably has practical problems. We also point to a range of other specific tariff statutes that control here. And, um, if you’re law students, you’ve probably learned many times about the specific controls, the general canon.

So even if you think that IEEPA gives some general tariff authority, the more specific statutes, um, that that control in these particular circumstances and have actual limits on the tariff power, those should control. Plus, if you just look at those tariff statutes and they’re all specific, and if you look at any tariff statute in the, in the statute books, you’re gonna see specific limits put on it.

It starts to suggest that maybe IEEPA, this general statute that doesn’t refer to tariffs and doesn’t in fact put any limits on, isn’t really be, shouldn’t really be used for tariffs. And then finally, the nondelegation doctrine. That great doctrine that the, was probably, is probably dead, but who knows, um, which says that you, the, the, that Congress cannot give away all of its legislative authority.

The argument is if you interpret IEEPA to give away this tariff power, um, without any limits, then you’re basically giving the president the power to impose tariffs and taxes, which is Congress’s authority alone. So that would be a non delegation problem, the government’s main response, other than to say, come on, regulate importation.

That sounds like tariffs is to say this is foreign affairs. In the foreign affairs context, we have always interpreted the statutes broadly. We’ve always thought that the president should enjoy broad powers and you, this shouldn’t be any different. I expect to kind of hear, uh, a lot of sounding on the, you know, implicit sort of, this is Trump derangement syndrome.

Don’t look at, don’t, don’t kind of make a decision that’s going to impose limits. On, uh, the president, the, the, the powers the president needs in real emergencies based on your view that this president is abusing it in this particular circumstance. But I am hoping that, you know, we can, um, carry the day with plain text.

And then I should also mention major questions, doctrine, the idea that like no president has ever used IEEPA to impose tariffs before. And, um, the court has been very fond of late of saying that Congress doesn’t hide, uh, elephants in mousehole. And, um, this really looks like, um, an elephant in a mouse hole if you find the power to over to rewrite the entire current economy, um, in this statute that’s supposed to be for foreign affairs emergencies.

I mean, one question I have for you, Colleen, on this because, uh, it’s what you brought up right at the end there where I was wondering if major questions was gonna come up in the discussion. I mean, one interesting thing going on at the court right now is what is the major questions, doctrine, when do you apply it?

And Justice Kavanaugh has, I think, the most interesting recent concurrence. On when he thinks the major questions doctrine should apply and when it should not, and when he thinks Congress would naturally think it is giving the executive untrammeled power and when you would think that they wouldn’t think they’re giving the executive that sort of sweeping power and trying to key the major questions doctrine to substantive areas of law.

And it seems like in his archetype, taxing would be the kind of thing that would be a major question because that’s not the sort of thing you would think that the executive can do in a plenary sense without Congress, but foreign policy and interrelationships with other nations is Brett Kavanaugh’s, number one thing that he thinks the executive is being given broad grants of authority to do so.

I’m curious how you think, you mentioned major questions, but I’m curious how you think tariffs will or will not teach us things about how to think about the major questions doctrine going forward. Yeah, I mean I do think that not Justice Gorsuch, who, I think Justice Gorsuch has a view of the major questions doctrine as a functionally nondelegation doctrine.

So it’s kind of, it would be unconstitutional for, um, Congress to grant large amounts of power. So if we think that like a statute is granting these large amounts of power, it’s as a constitutional matter. It just can’t, so we won’t, you know, the statute is unconstitutional to the extent it does that. I think that the, the, the kind of Justice, Justice Barrett, Justice Kavanaugh, and Justice, and the Chief all think of major questions as a statutory interpretation, canon as, as, as exactly as you’re describing it.

Kind of like where would it make sense to think that Congress delegated tons of power? And in that sense, you know, I, I, I think that that’s the role it, it has to play here. And it does depend whether they are thinking of this as a taxing case or a foreign affairs case, and whether they really buy into the idea that, um.

Even when we’re talking about taxes, if you’re talking about taxes on imports, whether that actually, like, it doesn’t even matter that it’s taxing because, because foreign affairs taxes still implicate that broader power. So Curtiss-Wright, which, um, I recently heard someone describe as Curtiss-the government is always right– in, uh, foreign affairs context. Curtiss actually refers to tariffs in part of, uh, as part of that. And so, you know, I think it depends, to me it’s very obvious that, that because the first clause is giving Congress that power and is expressly referring to tariffs, not just taxes, not just, you know, domestic, the domestic realm. It has to be that Congress wouldn’t just give away those, that power.

But, you know, the Supreme Court has disagreed with me before.

Um, uh, well, thank you. Uh, we will all be tracking that case.

Uh, Jeremy, do you wanna take a minute and talk about the, the, I guess the, the couple of cases about presidential removals? And I’ll flag for folks that we’re gonna cut off wherever we are at 6:10. I have been told we are cutting things off so we have time for questions.So start to think about what you wanna ask because we’re gonna, uh, have at least 20 minutes of questions.

Yes, we are most interested in your questions and it will make for fun back and forth. We’ll be really off the cuff. Uh, two thoughts.

So one, as you’ve already discovered, I am your friendly neighborhood emergency docket man, and so I’m back to the emergency docket and back to the new ways to think about the emergency docket.

Thankfully, for the first time since I’ve spoken, I’m not talking about a case that I have litigated in any way. So I think, I think biases are less likely to creep in here. So, uh, there are two thus far, major removal cases at the US Supreme Court for this term. There is the question in Trump v. Slaughter about whether the president can remove members of the Federal Trade Commission, and that squarely presents an issue that the US Supreme Court has been thinking about taking about for a very long time. Maybe not since the American Revolution, but you know, back in a more recent day, it has been thinking about whether and when to overrule the seminal decision Humphrey’s Executor that allows for removal protections for members of multi-member boards in the executive branch.

And, uh, I I, I’m probably not gonna like fully predict everything that happens in all of these cases, but there are, you know, if we think of like four major, uh, Trump cases so far at SCOTUS are about to be at scotus, I think tariffs is hard to predict. We’ll talk about Lisa Cook, which is hard to predict. I do not think the other two are that hard to predict.

Um, I think the Trump administration is very clearly going to lose birthright citizenship on the merits and very clearly going to win Trump v. Slaughter. And I don’t think I get any points for those predictions ’cause I think basically everyone agrees. So on Trump v. Slaughter, I think it shows two interesting things.

One, this US Supreme Court has been very willing to overrule precedents that it thinks are sufficiently wrong, and that the main check on whether and when it will overrule precedents is whether it grants cert in the first place. Because once it grants cert, most of the other stare decisis factors have become overcome by the sense that the decision was truly wrong enough.

And so I think there are a number of precedents likely to be safe for some extended period of time because the court is unlikely to wanna return to the question and just isn’t gonna grant cert. But once the court grants cert on a question of whether to overrule it and you can feel confident that they strongly wouldn’t have decided it the first way, I don’t think the other starry decisis factors in any way hold them back from making that decision.

And so once they granted Trump v. Slaughter, and they granted certiorari before judgment. I think the writing is very clearly on the wall for how that one’s gonna come out. I will also say from a procedural perspective, it makes total sense that it was a, uh, before judgment in the way that they granted here, because there’s binding us Supreme Court precedent, no one else is able to hold that Humphrey’s Executor is no longer good law. So if someone’s going to hold Humphrey’s Executor is no longer good law. It has to be the US Supreme Court. They have to take it, they have to confront the question. Again. We can have a, you can have years of discussion about the merits and, and the costs of stare decisis.

I’m not gonna run through all of it here, but I think it is very clear that they’ve taken this for one reason and one reason only. I think the Cook case is very different. I think the Cook case is very interesting, very challenging and shows the way advocacy is shifting on the emergency docket, even in just the months since January and February of this year.

So the Cook case is interesting because this is about removals for the Fed and. The, uh, Supreme Court, I’m gonna forget the name of this particular order ’cause there were a series of removal related Supreme Court orders, but in the, the Supreme Court made very, very clear in an unrelated case about removal from another agency that they thought the rule would be different for the Fed.

They just said it, no one was debating it. And that particular case, and that’s how you know, the Supreme Court really cares about this. And the, the dissent makes fun of it and sort of calls it a bespoke exception for the Fed. But I strongly doubt the dissent. Once, uh, Slaughter comes out the other way, I strongly doubt the dissent will resist going along with the bespoke exception for the Fed.

Um, it’s, it’s a device for pointing out the problems with the decision in slaughter rather than, uh, a desire for the liberals to allow for removals from the, uh, Fed Governors. And it’s interesting because Advocacy’s really shifted as that case has gone on to Easha’s earlier point about, uh, shifts in cases on the ground, the Trump administration as in birth.

Has decided not to like, stake the end-all, be-all fight on whether there’s like plenary removal, vis-a-vis the Fed. Instead, the United States says we are accepting for these purposes. We can only remove Fed Governors for cause, but we think we have for cause here. And also we basically think you have to be completely deferential when we think there’s cause which gets you kind of to the same place, which is if you could ever review the president finding their cause, it’s not exactly what you would normally think of in the corporate setting as for cause removal obviously.

Um, but they say we’ll accept that it’s for cause removal. Then the challengers respond and the DC circuit and a concurring opinion by Judge Garcia accepts that. Okay, well if you’re accepting that, then we have a narrower thought too. Yes, we have an argument that you can review for cause even when the president finds it.

And that, um, to Colleen’s point about tariffs earlier, you should review the president’s fact finding, which is something the court has been openly quite nervous about. For many years. So yes, you can do that, but also you don’t have to, you can just say, well, if you need fact finding, then you need process.

Because if the president’s gonna find facts, you need to give process to the person that’s being fired to explain why he’s about to make the wrong factual call. And so everyone in interesting ways recognizes there’s a really sensitive area for the court. It’s clear both parties are not sure how it’s ultimately gonna come out.

And so the United States is making its narrowing pivot and the challengers are responding with their narrowing pivot. And it shows the way the emergency docket, everyone realizes you’re gonna get some seismic holdings. You’d better if you’re gonna try to win out in an area, you know, the court’s uncomfortable with, give them the path they think they can do the least damage in an area they’re nervous about.

And that’s, I think, what Cook is showing us in real time. Uh, so interesting. I agree. That’s a, uh, I’m very, very curious to see how that argument goes. Um. I thought I’d just take the five minutes at the end to review one of the huge cases on the docket that is not a “versus Trump” case. Um, but that is gonna have pretty seismic implications for kind of the way politics is done in America.

Um, so Louisiana v. Callais starts as a pretty traditional kind of section two of a Voting Rights Act case. So section two, uh, prohibits election practices that result in the denial or abridgement of the right to vote on account of race. Um, layered atop that over the past few generations, courts have kind of constructed a series of tests to figure out when this is happening, specifically in the redistricting context, cases to come to court. The challengers typically say some version of, uh, when you were drawing your sort of congressional district, let’s say. Um, you either tried to pack a bunch of, uh, voters of a particular race into one district, so they couldn’t have influence over more than one congressional representative.

Or you tried to what’s called crack the voters. That is you try to spread them out across so many districts that they don’t have sufficient electoral influence anywhere to elect the representatives of their choice. Um, and the court has said that the way you make out these claims is you first do what’s called the jingles factors, which is basically figure out, uh, whether there’s kind of racially polarized block voting.

Then you look at what are called the senate report factors, which is sort of a totality of the circumstances inquiry, where you look at kind of a history of discrimination, um, uh, uh, through to kind of the use of racial appeals and current politics. Um, so there’s this whole kind of apparatus that’s grown up around this, this kind of super statute.

Uh, so Louisiana loses one of these section two cases and so it has to redraw its map when it redraws the map. Non-black voters, that’s sort of the term that they use for themselves, come into court and say the redraw map, right? The one that was drawn to comply with section two of the Voting Rights Act over indexes on race and therefore violates the equal protection clause and comes to the court, court hears argument, and then somewhat ominously over the summer.

They ask for reargument ominously because the court basically does this in two situations. Situation one is where there’s a four four court. So, um, you know, after Justice Scalia passed, there was an interim before Justice Gorsuch got on the court. They ordered some rearguments when Justice Gorsuch got on the court, uh uh, because they were tied four-four, and he’d be the swing vote.

Sometimes it doesn’t for that reason. The other reason it does it is because it, uh, has a theory, uh, often a, a theory that no one is raising in the litigation that it really, really, uh, thinks is the right one. Uh, so Citizens United famous example of reargument, right? Um, so, uh, question is re argued on basically whether the Voting Rights Act, uh, violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution.

Um, dominant theme and argument. Um, I think it’s dominant. It could just be the Justice Kavanaugh asked this question like seven different times, so it seemed very dominant. But I think the dominant theme and argument was, um, basically the question of expiration date. So Court sort of says, uh, uh, you know, in cases like Shelby County about a different provision of the Voting Rights Act, uh, kind of says, you know, this is relying on stereotypes about what the South was like many generations ago, so it’s unconstitutional.

In Students for Fair Admissions, which was a case that struck down the affirmative action programs at Harvard and the University of North Carolina. Um, uh, oral argument is dominated by this talk of, you know, 23 years ago there was an opinion that said that in 25 years, we hope the race, the use of race conscious admissions will end.

Um, so Justice Kavanaugh kinda asks over and over again, both the NAACP Legal Defense fund lawyer and the various folks saying that this is unconstitutional. Like what’s the end date? Um, and you know, the NAACP lawyer basically says three things. She says, um, first look, section two, this whole analysis. Um, it relies on facts on the ground today.

So. It will sunset when racially polarized block voting sunsets, right? The first thing you have to show is this prima facie case. People are segregated on the basis of race, on our, uh, uh, that minority voters are unable to elect the candidate of their choice. So when that stops happening, this will sunset automatically.

Second thing she says is, look, when you prove the violation of section two of the Voting Rights Act, all you’ve said is that this map is no good. Section two doesn’t tell us anything about what kind of map the state has to draw in response to that. Um, and so, you know, a state can redraw a map without taking race into account just so long as it doesn’t engage in these forbidden practices to try to dilute the votes of minority voters.

Um, uh, and the third thing she says is, look, Students for Fair Admissions is quite different because they’re the compelling government interest, right? The reason you were allowed to be race conscious in the admissions process was this idea of diversity in the class. Here, the basis on which we’re allowing race consciousness in some instances has to do with remedying specific racial discrimination.

And even in Students for Fair Admissions, the Supreme Court told us that that’s okay, that’s an okay use of race. Um, so we shall see what happens. I think that the, the stakes of this are quite big. So whether or not you think that section two of the Voting Rights Act is a good idea, whatever you think of the court’s current redistricting jurisprudence, um, the way that, you know, our House of Representatives is comprised turns to some extent on this case.

Uh, so an argument, the NAACP pointed out that every uh, uh, black elected representative, including the justices of the Louisiana Supreme Court in the state of Louisiana comes from a district that was drawn specifically to comply with the Voting Rights Act. Right. Some analysts say that we’re talking about 19 seats that would shift from Democratic to Republican control.

If, uh, voting Rights Act compliance wasn’t mandated in the same way, um, and, you know, in a lot of years that’s control of the house. So, uh, even though this is not a case about the president, I think it’s one we should all kind of be watching because it will have big implications for our politics and for the upcoming elections, whatever the outcome with that ballot day would do.

Okay. On time. Okay. With that, we’ll turn it over to the audience to, for questions, please line up at these two microphones and then we can go one by one.

Come on down.

Thank you so much for being here today. Very interesting. The question I have relates to the tariffs, uh, case and in particular, the justification of the administration is partly based on emergency and partially. Based upon the traditional deference, I guess, of the courts to the presidency as, for example, in Curtiss-Wright.

But as an emergency, it’s something that’s kind of dragged out and the whole process is taking a long time. And part of this is also based upon negotiations with other countries. And of course the treaty power is one that’s given to the president as well, but subject to the ratification of Congress. So my question is, in this context, if the Supreme Court seems to be inclined to disapprove, either in part or in large measure what the administration has done, what do you assess the probability that they might stay the action of the Supreme Court, uh, stay the action of the court for a period of time to permit Congress to ratify the decisions of the presidents as, for example, uh, the Supreme Court did in 1982 in the Northern Pipeline case about the constitutionality of, uh, judicial powers, uh, in, in that case.

Yeah, that, that’s a, that’s a great question. And I have to say that, um, remedy is not, uh, an issue that we had focused on very much, in part because, um, just, just of a, the procedural of a procedural court, the federal circuit, which re, which issued the only merits decision we have from a court of appeals, it agreed with us on the merits, but it remanded on remedy because it thought actually that, uh, the nationwide injunction in our case was too broad.

I don’t know why. They just used logic like no uniformity is required. Um, anyway, uh, and actually no one has litigated. Um, what is a really a question that, that is on the minds of a lot of people, which is what about refunds? So the, the short answer is that’s not really, you know, um, that just has not really been a piece of the case.

Certainly, I think one, like the government would, would they consider that, uh, you know. I, the a 45 day stay, I don’t know. Nobody so far has been talking about it. Um, the, the government actually said they would pay refunds. Um, uh, I, I think, you know, it’s not a part of the public case, so maybe I’ll, I’ll let you two.

Yeah, I’ll jump in. Just to say, you know, in the, in the birthright context, it was super interesting. One of the things that the US represented in that case was they would, if they won, be willing to wait 30 days to avoid chaos on the ground. And you could see the US Supreme Court asking similar questions.

Like in casa last term, we said our, uh, our opinion would not take effect for 30 days, so things could play out in the ground. As Professor Goldsmith has pointed out, that is a universal injunction, even from the Supreme Court. Uh, it doesn’t have more authority to issue universal injunctions than others.

So when it said it won’t take effect on representation for 30 days, it was a form of universal injunction, but you could easily see given how disruptive, like if, if all tariffs went away tomorrow with, with no warning, you, you could see the court having some practical concerns. I think it’s quite possible that the US has promised to pay refunds to show that it would be disruptive to take away their authority at this point.

Um, so it wouldn’t shock me to see some questions and argument trying to explore what would happen in that case, although that argument has so many. Hard merits questions that everyone is going to get that using your, your scarce argument, time and oxygen on, how long it should take after is something that probably only comes up late in the argument ’cause they’re gonna have their work cut out for them and asking all the many questions on the many topics Colleen had to work through in just summarizing the case while we’re waiting for the next question, which I hope is forthcoming, oh, we’ve got, okay, go ahead.

Sorry, I was hiding. I didn’t mean to, uh, I have a question about CASA and I almost think you shouldn’t answer it happily. Absolutely. Not necessarily for like confidentiality purposes, but because like, I feel like, you know, it, it, it’s, I just, I was in the position of having, uh, to read that through and I find that opinion endlessly confusing and I’m not quite sure what’s going on and I’m interested in the role that history is playing in it, those sorts of things. But I was wondering, you, uh, you mentioned one, like a bunch of caveats that need to get answered in the next few years that are gonna determine its scope. And I was thinking about how many, uh, equitable decisions aren’t enforced under the judicial act too. Like, uh, one of them is that, uh, like for example, the Clayton Act allows you to enforce, uh, antitrust statutes, uh, like outside of the jurisdiction of, of, of the particular district court judge.

And I wanted to know what the fact that those, uh, other statutes don’t seem to be affected by stat, uh, by CASA, seem to tell us about CASA, about it’s, uh, I think one thing that’s dubious about cost is it feels as if it feels like it’s a solution for this presidency or for the particular moment in front of us.

And I think that tension between, uh, its ruling on that statute and on others, um, might lend themselves to that sort of suspicion. But I know, I probably know what you think about CASA is what I’m trying to say, or what the other people, I want all the people to answer. I, I guess what I’m trying to say, uh, feel cold called.

You wanna go first and we can uh, I, I, I’ll go first briefly. Which, which is to say I actually think that the timing in the case in which the Supreme Court chose to issue this ruling has all sorts of complications because of what the merits is of birthright and how quickly they did it into the new administration.

But I don’t think this came just from Justices thinking this as a bespoke solution for President Trump. Like Justices Gorsuch and Barrett and Thomas were on record during the Biden years, that they had problems with these reliefs now query why there weren’t more orders in that time, if that reflected their view.

But they were on record previously. And I think, I think Colleen said something about this earlier, but I think they do sometimes think that the challengers are so focused on Trump and they’re trying to write for the presidency for all time. And so I think they think that the cost opinion is not a solution for Trump.

I think they think it is the correct response to the like institution of the executive writ large. Um, but I think a really important point you’re making, which is totally correct, and this this really did come up at oral argument, is that they know there are statutes that adopt universal forms of relief.

The administrative procedures act, certain types of, um, nationwide review schemes, uh, the Clayton Act, et cetera. And they specifically and Conspicuously wanted to avoid that because if you’re gonna strike down those statutes only come up if you’re gonna make a holding on Article three that federal courts lack this authority constitutionally rather than under the Judiciary Act of 1789.

But if you do that, Justice Kavanaugh can’t sign on because he is on record with an opinion that you can do this under the Administrative Procedures Act. So he can’t agree with the article three constitutional holding, and no one knows what the chief thinks. And so it is quite possible there isn’t a majority of even five.

Certainly there isn’t of six. To say that the constitution forecloses it, so then you just have to work with the statute in front of you and you have to leave for another day. Those other questions, so it’s a little bit path dependent in that they can’t resolve the APA question. They have a footnote saying, we’re not gonna get to the APA question.

But if you’re not gonna solve the APA question, you can’t decide it as a constitutional matter. So you have to leave other statutes for another day. But I’m curious for other folks takes on this too. Uh, yes. I’m gonna totally plagiarize one of my colleagues, Mila Sohoni, who is sort of, as Jeremy knows, one of kind of foremost experts on this.

Um, her take on this is actually that casa is gonna be, it’s gonna not have major repercussions for universal injections specifically. It’s actually gonna have its ripple effects outside of the context of universal injunctions. Part of it is sort of exactly what you’re saying, which is like. Um, I think for a long time everyone sort of said like, well, if it says equitable remedies and statutes, equity changes over time, that’s the nature of equity.

So, of course, like that means basically whatever courts want and the, and the Supreme Court seems to say like, as a textual interpretation matter, when a statute says equity, it means equity at the time of statute is passed. Um, it matters particularly under the kind of the judiciary act, um, because Mila kind of points out that, uh, Ex Parte Young right?

That, or sort of what Ex Parte Young has come to be known as. So Ex Parte Young is sort of the case that says you can, you can’t sue a state directly, but you can sue an official in the state in their official capacity and get them to do something. There is a tradition of what were called anti-suit injunctions.

So that is, you could sue the individual and say, you can’t prosecute me under this law, or you can’t do x to me. There isn’t an equitable tradition of, for instance, you have to take an affirmative step. You have to desegregate the schools, for instance, right. Um, and so if we think that, uh, CASA really means what it says, the equitable powers given to the court are frozen, uh, based on what equitable remedies were available at the time the statute was passed.

Um, I think you have a lot of issues in a lot of other areas, partly under other statutes, but even under the Judiciary Act, um, you know, like a lot of the business of civil rights litigation of the last two generations has centered on the assumption that a set of remedies are available to courts and they’re kind of equitable powers That CASA really calls into question.

I mean, I, I, I, I definitely do not think this is a bespoke solution. I think that like the, I mean, you know, having worked in the government for the last six years, you know, like, it doesn’t matter, the administration, they never like, uh, universal injunctions and I, and, and so I, I, I, I, I think this doesn’t have that valence.

Um, the other piece that I’d say is like, I think that that opinion’s hard to follow too. I’ll say that. Um, I, because of my knee-jerk government attorney reaction, I was like, obviously, uh, universal injunctions are, they’re going down. And my husband, um, who’s also a lawyer, uh, and I were in the car, he was also a government lawyer, and we were, we’re talking about this and we’re like, yeah, they’re going down.

And then we start talking about like, oh, but what about this? Oh, well, they’d have to be okay in that situation. And then we’re like, well, and what about in there? We’re like, yeah. Then they’d be okay. Then they’d be okay. And we just kept coming up with. Why they couldn’t actually have the blanket rule. And at the end of the conversation we were both like, Ooh, this is kind of like hard.

And I kind of wonder if the Supreme Court went through the same process where they thought like, finally we have a vehicle and we’re just gonna say no more universal injunctions. And then, you know, these, these doubts crept in. And, and, and it became really hard to write a clean opinion because it’s just a messy, messy issue.

So about that, and just to go to my theme, that only happens because of procedural regularity. You get full briefing on the question, you grapple with what’s hard. You hear all argument. You ask all these questions, you write an opinion and then write an opinion. And you’re like, God, this is hard. And, and I, well, Mike, small counter on that is that I think we have to be careful about fake procedural irregularity.

Like I do think when you have a full oral argument. On an, in an emergency posture, often what you are still getting is, is briefing that was written in like two weeks and, uh, judicial clerks who’ve been thinking about it for like three weeks. And, but now they are saying, well, I mean, it’s just true. That’s not a knock on anyone.

It’s just like these cases come up, they have to be decided right away and people want full process. But once you have the full process, I think it does, it does become like this is, this is like a fully measured and thought out decision. Um, and, and I just think a lot of the time because of, because of the, the need for speed, it’s not, and it makes me nervous.

To have like the oral argument and say like, now we did it, we did all of this. When, when really there’s so much more that people just haven’t had a time to think about. I think universal injunctions, that is an issue that’s been kicking around for, you know, just years and years and people have been thinking about it for years.

But a lot of the questions that the court is facing right now are huge and they’re novel and they’re difficult and like, I’m just not, I really feel for the court because I don’t know how they, how they can decide these in a way that is, you know, fair and equitable, but also respects the need for speed.

I think it’s really difficult. Can’t be always, can’t be never. And this is right, this is Justice Gorsuch, and it’s to TikTok concurrence. That is a case where they do expedited briefing, the whole argument and at the end it’s sort of nine zero to uphold the law. But Justice Gorsuch writes this concurrence.

It’s like, I mean, I guess, but I really would’ve liked to have some time to think about this. Right. Thanks for answering the question. I just wanted. We went very far afield from the question, but hopefully it’s an answer somewhere in there. So, so I thank you so much for, for the discussion. I have a question about a case that you guys have not discussed that is about, is in the doc in the emergency docket thing.

So a bit of background. So I’m a naturalized citizen and I voted for Trump few times, and yet I’m deeply concerned about the case that originated here in California that actually essentially you can be racially profiled if you’re speaking a certain way or something. And it wasn’t. So, actually it’s the first time that I feel a need to have my copy of my US passport just in case I, so the question is, we’re always carrying that with you, right?

No, yeah, yeah. Going around. Right. So is this something that is a one-off for that particular case in LA or is, uh, sets a precedent for right now it’s okay to essentially profile in the context of immigration enforcement. I’ll take a crack and then I’m curious to hear your thoughts. Um. I think that this is a case that, uh, shows some of the dangers of the emergency docket, and in particular, this is a case that shows some of the dangers of the Supreme Court doing its own kind of fact finding.

Right. So if you read the kind of Kavanaugh concurrence mm-hmm. It maybe sounds like it’s something specific to LA, sort of has all this rhetoric about things in LA um, uh, but then when you read what the district court found and what the dissenters say, it sounds like there’s really nothing specific to LA about this case.

Right. Um, and it turns out some of the, the, the things that Justice Kavanaugh says are contrary to some of the things that District Court says, even the things Justice Kavanaugh says. Right. Which is basically like, um, there are a, a lot of that’s like he says a lot of, at some point in the opinion. Right.

He says that there are a lot of people who are, um, uh, uh, undocumented in Los Angeles, like, doesn’t give us a numerical threshold. It’s actually, it turns out to be like a pretty small percentage of Los Angeles. Mm-hmm. Um. So I guess I would say I, uh, I think that Justice Kavanaugh thought he was making a ruling about la I don’t know how it gets KA to LA.

Um, and so that’s like n neither, not, not particularly helpful, but just I would not put that away. Yeah. It’s very sad actually. I mean, I, I, that cases, that cases, um, I agree a great example of the perils of the emergency docket, but I’ll, I’ll, I’ll say something different about it. So that case was, was always going to be hard for the challengers because of, uh, a procedural issue, which is that there was well established doctrine around standing that made it particularly hard to challenge law enforcement search policies that you couldn’t show sufficiently were gonna be applied to you prospectively.

That’s been the law for some time in a case called Lyons. And so it was understood, I think that the challengers were gonna have a hard time on standing and on the fact that they got a class action in that case, um, because it kind of turns on the different facts that that might be applied to you. And I think what surpri and, and what surprised a lot of folks was that Justice Kavanaugh could have stopped there and chose to go further and talk about the merits of this policy when, if he’s right, that there’s no standing, there’s no re the court mm-hmm.

Should not be talking about the merits in a case it finds no jurisdiction to reach. Um, and I think it was, it was difficult for a lot of people because among other things, no one knows if he’s means to be speaking for the court and himself is frustrated. The court is not sharing views. I mean, Justice Kavanaugh is one of the justices who is most vocally saying, we should be explaining ourselves active and often, uh, on the emergency docket.

Now, it’s helpful when you’re one of the swing justices to say that because they mostly reflect your views compared to others. Not always, but often. More often. And, um, and so it’s easier to say, we should be explaining ourselves when they’re your views, but no one knows because the court doesn’t explain if it’s just doing a standing only it has issues with the policy, but it thought there wasn’t standing.

Mm-hmm. And there wasn’t an appropriate class and what have you. Or if there are. Five or six justices who agree with everything in that concurrence. And that’s one of the things that I think has frustrated folks about the emergency docket is this weird combination of one justices views and you have no idea who to attribute them to and why it went into the merits when there was a standing issue all along.

I’ll just say that even if it’s just the standing issue, that’s still pretty devastating for kind of checks on police. Um, so it is, as Jeremy said, it has been true for many years. This case, Lyons was a case about a choke hold policy in the Los Angeles Police Department. Supreme Court said, um, you don’t an up standing person who was subjected to a choke hold to challenge this because, um, who knows if this will happen to you again, in this case, the challengers compiled evidence of multiple plaintiffs who had multiple times themselves been arrested, right?

So they could say with some certainty like this has already happened to me twice. I have, I think it’s likely to happen again. And they had some concrete harms, right? So in Lions, this prior case, the court says, well, you haven’t had to change anything about your behavior to avoid being put into a choke hold.

You’re going about your business. And the challengers here said like, no, we’re not. Right? We’re, we’re having to carry around a copy of our passport everywhere we go. Yeah. Um, and so I think even if it’s just a standing opinion, even if nothing else that Justice Kavanaugh said stands for the view of the court, it will change dramatically the ability of civil rights practitioners to try to constrain any sort of law enforcement conduct.

Because I think it goes significantly farther than lions. And I think that alone will mean that there’s more unchecked police and ice enforcement. Thank you all three for the question. Last question. Thank you. Uh, this question may be a little bit different, but I think it’s interesting, especially for the students and the non-lawyers in the room.

You were all, uh, clerks to Supreme Court Justices. Can you talk a little bit about what the role of the clerk is, your interactions with the justices, your. Influence or lack thereof on decisions and just sort of demystify that process for those of us who have never been Supreme Court clerks. Yeah, and actually you’ve got a pretty, I think, a, like, pretty good cross section of the role of the clerks across the three of us.

Um, I would, I would like to say, um, I dunno, Colleen, do you wanna start? We can go online. Um, sure. Uh, so I, I clerked for the chief, um, uh, and uh, the, one of the great things about clerking for the chief was there were no bench memos. Um, the chief did everything, um, orally. Uh, so we spent a lot of our time talking to the chief Justice about, um, all of the cases in front of the Supreme Court at the time.

Uh, and I think, you know, the role of the clerk in the chief’s office is sort of, um, sounding board researcher. Uh, he, you know, I, I think I have always said that the chief is, is an amazing boss. And he really was, uh, he trusted us and gave us a lot of, um, autonomy and he let us know that he was, was listening to us.

At the same time, he made all of his decisions himself. I mean, I think I was seeing, saying earlier, anybody who says that like they were responsible for their justices opinions is, you know, I think suffering from delusions of grand grandeur. Uh, you know, I, I actually, when I was clerking, I remember thinking, why did they hire me?

Because I don’t really know that much about the law. And they could be using like, you know, practitioners who’ve been in, in practice for a long time and actually, you know, would have useful knowledge. But I think that’s the point, right? You’re, you’re taking a young lawyer who, when you’re dealing with them and you’re a justice and you’ve been dealing with the law for, for decades, you’re not gonna be.

Get, get confused and think, oh, let me let this, you know, person who just graduated from law school make all of these important decisions, not me. I trust them. Right. And it’s, it’s a useful check in that sense. But I do think you’re like a, a fresh voice. You are, um, you’re your research, but you’re also, you know, a different take, a different perspective.

Um, you know, I think something I really admired about the, the, the chief, and I think the justice is just, is he, he really listened, he did not always agree, or maybe not most of the time agree with what I had to say, but I felt like he really listened and that, and what I was saying went into his, um, decision making process.

Uh, so I actually agree with, with almost all of that. So maybe I’ll just add three, three observations. The first is probably, actually none of us are a particularly good gauge anymore because, um. The emergency docket I would date. We can have a longer conversation about this. I think it actually sort of like the current in its current form kind of started our term clerking.

Um, but the amount of time that the law clerks now spend on the emergency docket just bears no resemblance to when any of us was clerking. So I actually have no idea what’s happening in that building anymore. How they’re sleeping, when they’re sleeping, what’s happening. Um, uh, uh, so take all this with a grain of salt.

Um, the second thing I’ll say that I think is a little bit different about the Clark and Bridge. So Sotomayor, who’s my former boss, is, um, she views her role as much outside the building as inside the building. So she cares deeply about the cases. Read any one of her impassioned dissent, and you will see that she also recognizes that in some ways her role as an ambassador for the court and an inspiration to young people is a way that she will make change that is different from what, what she writes and what she says at conference.

Um, so again, both in kind of the way she writes her dissents, right? She’s speaking to a much broader audience and the amount of time that she spends on like public appearances, like she would, you know, she’d like get invited to something and she’d be like, ask her judicial assistant to pull out the file of like, anyone who’d like written a letter to her from that town so she could invite them to the event, right?

I had the pleasure of going with her to these events where she’s treated like, like a rock star. Like people cry when they like reach out to touch her. Um, and so it was a really interesting lesson for me in, as someone who thought about a judge, like, your source of power is like what you, your, the votes that you cast in conference to think about, to work for a justice, who really saw her role as much broader than that.

About inspiring people, about being a voice for the court to, to on, on behalf of people who didn’t always have a voice on the court and, and writing and kind of allocating her time in that way. Um, and the final thing I’ll say is, um, here’s the really weird thing about being a clerk is, um, you know, all of us now practice before the court where we clerked.

Um, and it’s like a very, very strangely insular club. So Justice Sotomayor for instance, officiated my wedding, like one of the first people who met my son when he came out of the hospital. Um, and I remember the first case I went up to argue, I was talking to a friend of mine who’s a, a public defender in New York, and she was like, oh my God, if I were in front of a judge where who had officiated the prosecutor’s wedding who didn’t recuse themselves, I would be livid, right?

Um, but that’s just not the vibe. Um, and I don’t know a way to sort of justify or explain that, just to say that. I, I think one thing I hadn’t fully realized until going through the clerkship process is just how small this world is and how many, uh, deeply close ties the justices have to the advocates appearing before them.

I don’t have a ton to add beyond that. Uh, I, I’ll second what everyone is saying, which is the clerks really don’t make the decisions. The justices really do make the decisions. I felt that confidently when I clerked for Justice Kagan, and she very much wanted clerks to push back on her ideas and make them better and find holes and poke holes.

And in a case, like there are some cases that are really 51-49 cases, especially like non-ideological ones, and you can like help shape an opinion or get more caveats or nuance into a take because you’ve pushed back in a certain way. The justices are voting on their cases and the justices know how to figure them out.

And I mean, Justice Kagan is, you know, basically one of the smartest people I’ll ever interact with in my entire life. And I didn’t have a lot that I could tell her that she couldn’t figure out. But justices are also busy people and so I was plucking enough to try to keep pushing back on a variety of cases.

And so it made for like an incredibly intense and incredibly fulfilling year. But I think mostly like the clerks get to learn from the experience more than they’re really teaching the justices and look in a case that’s poorly briefed, clerks can have a valuable role in helping find things that the parties are not presenting so that ",https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/supreme-court-roundup-and-preview-4.png,N,,2026-01-18 10:58:27.181475

Among the many corrosive consequences of Mr. Trump’s actions is a loss of faith in almost anything that his Justice Department does.
The Justice Department was hardly perfect before Mr. Trump took the oath of office a year ago.
As the second year of Mr. Trump’s second term begins next week, there are some modestly encouraging signs of resistance — but not nearly enough.
But the Republican Party has largely been a silent partner as its leader removes all sense of justice from the Justice Department.","President Trump is celebrating the anniversary of his return to power by accelerating his attack on the rule of law. He has spent the week leading up to Jan. 20 using the mighty powers of the Justice Department as an extension of his personal and political interests. The department has started a fabricated criminal investigation of the Federal Reserve chair, searched the home of a Washington Post reporter and created a White House-controlled fraud unit that would streamline partisan prosecution.

Mr. Trump does not attempt to hide his use of law enforcement powers for vengeance. He glories in it. Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported, he hosted federal prosecutors at the White House and complained that they were not moving fast enough to punish the rivals, critics and truth tellers he wished to target. This followed months of pressure by the president on his attorney general to do more to prosecute those who oppose his actions and those who tried to hold him accountable under the law in the past.

These efforts have become a defining feature of Mr. Trump’s second term, and it can be easy to become numb to them. We urge you not to. His usurpation of law enforcement power threatens us all. His meddling with the independence of the Fed undermines the economy. His attacks on members of Congress and the news media threaten people’s right to speak freely and hold the government accountable. His move to control investigation and prosecution from the White House portends an America where the state uses force to promote the political interests of its leaders, rather than uphold the laws passed by our representatives.

One year into his second term, America risks losing a central feature of our democracy: that we are a country ruled by laws, not by one man.

Among the many corrosive consequences of Mr. Trump’s actions is a loss of faith in almost anything that his Justice Department does. Consider the situation in Minnesota that attracted so much of the nation’s attention in recent days. On Jan. 7 an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot to death Renee Good, who was protesting ICE’s raids in Minneapolis. Under any other modern president, the next steps would have been clear. The government would have conducted a sober-minded inquiry about whether the agent had acted appropriately.

Under Mr. Trump, the verdict was preordained. The ICE agents on the scene prevented a bystander who identified himself as a doctor from treating Ms. Good as she sat slumped and bleeding in her car. The ICE agent who shot her sped away shortly afterward, videos suggest. Mr. Trump quickly posted a misleading description of the confrontation on social media. Later that day, the F.B.I. barred state investigators from joining them in collecting and analyzing evidence from the scene.

Senior Trump officials accused Ms. Good of “domestic terrorism,” and the Justice Department made a mockery of itself by opening an investigation into Ms. Good and her partner for their political activism. At least 10 federal lawyers in Washington and Minnesota have since resigned or retired. Their response is honorable, although it leaves even fewer principled officials to stand up to future abuses.

The Justice Department was hardly perfect before Mr. Trump took the oath of office a year ago. Still, between Richard Nixon’s resignation in disgrace and Mr. Trump’s second term, the department under both political parties took steps to remain independent from the White House so that Americans could have confidence that federal law enforcement was nonpartisan. If the government investigated somebody — or decided not to — the reasonable assumption was that it was on the merits. That assumption is in tatters, as the events in Minneapolis demonstrate.

After hollowing out the functions of the federal government’s system of justice that ensure fairness and guard against misconduct, the Trump administration has turned what remains into the agent of Mr. Trump’s personal and political impulses. If you are on the president’s side, you will be protected and even pardoned of crimes. If you threaten his interests, you risk retribution from federal law enforcement.

On Sunday, Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, said the Justice Department had served him with subpoenas in a bogus criminal investigation. The department claimed it was looking into whether he had misled Congress about the cost of renovations to the Fed’s headquarters, but he said he had provided exhaustive details to Congress and had the bank’s internal watchdog examine the construction costs. Mr. Trump’s real motive is obvious. He wants to replace the Fed’s leadership with officials who betray its tradition of independence from partisan politics and rapidly cut interest rates to goose the economy before midterm elections this year. The targeting of Mr. Powell, who will leave his role in May, serves to remind his successor that there is a cost to independence.

Three days after Mr. Powell’s announcement, federal agents took the extraordinary step of searching the home of Hannah Natanson, a reporter for The Washington Post, and seizing her phone as part of a leak investigation. This violates traditional government policy and appears designed to chill valuable reporting by making sources nervous about talking to journalists. Ms. Natanson had helped expose some of the negative consequences of the Trump administration’s policies.

The list of Trump critics and opponents who face or have faced legal action by the administration also includes another Fed governor, Lisa Cook; the former F.B.I. director James Comey; Attorney General Letitia James of New York; Senator Adam Schiff, Democrat of California; and Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California. This month Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he would begin administrative proceedings against Senator Mark Kelly, Democrat of Arizona — which could result in the reduction of Mr. Kelly’s military retirement rank and pension — after the senator participated in a video urging military service members to resist illegal orders. The five other Democratic lawmakers who participated in the video said they are also under federal investigation. On Monday, Mr. Kelly sued Mr. Hegseth and the Pentagon on free-speech grounds.

At the same time, a parade of actual criminals who curry Mr. Trump’s favor receive clemency, and investigations into suspicious behavior by his cronies are canceled or never opened. Many of the president’s uses of the pardon power seem partly aimed at diminishing confidence in legitimate past prosecutions — and trying to make previous administrations look as unethical as the current one.

Janet Yellen, a former Fed chair and Treasury secretary, summed up this inversion of the basic principles of American justice: “If you can bring charges for no reason whatsoever against your enemies, we’re no longer living in a society governed by the rule of law,” she said.

More than 200 of the department’s career lawyers have been fired, and thousands more have resigned. “I wouldn’t even call it the Justice Department anymore,” Dena Robinson, a lawyer who formerly worked in the civil rights division, said last year. “It’s become Trump’s personal law firm.”

The administration crossed another line last week when Vice President JD Vance announced that the White House would run an unnecessary new Justice Department division on fraud. The department already has an anti-fraud section, but it has been depleted by administration cutbacks; what’s different about this new division is that the White House controls it directly. The new outpost is particularly suspicious, given Mr. Trump’s loose and expedient definition of fraudulent behavior as occurring only in states run by Democrats. The announcement suggests it will be another piece of his partisan use of legal powers. For now, the new division is centered on the social-service fraud that has occurred in Minnesota, though he has his eyes on other Democratic states as well.

The Minnesota fraud is real, and the people who perpetrated it deserve to face charges. Many already have; one of the prosecutors who resigned Tuesday over the response to the ICE shooting had overseen the sprawling investigation. But Mr. Trump’s interest in fraud is selective, applying exclusively in jurisdictions that have opposed him. As KFF Health News reported, he gave pardons or commutations to at least 68 people convicted of fraud-related crimes during his first and second terms. And he fired or demoted more than 20 inspectors general responsible for rooting out fraud.

As the second year of Mr. Trump’s second term begins next week, there are some modestly encouraging signs of resistance — but not nearly enough. Several Republicans in the House and Senate have said they do not believe Mr. Powell is a criminal, and Senator Thom Tillis said he would oppose the confirmation of any Fed governor until the investigation is concluded.

But the Republican Party has largely been a silent partner as its leader removes all sense of justice from the Justice Department. Some seem to grasp the danger to the economy of having Trump control the Fed, but they need to see the larger picture and grasp the danger to democracy of controlling law enforcement, too. On behalf of Americans who are now living without a functioning system of federal law and order, Congress should step up and end this self-interested destruction.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/17/opinion/17vengeance-editorial-image/17vengeance-editorial-image-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 01:58:09.869115

Still, Trump for years has created enthusiasm among white supremacist groups, who see his nationalist and anti-immigrant stance as validating their own.
The president has complained that immigrants are “poisoning the blood of our country” and spoken favorably about white immigrants compared to other immigrants.
The administration’s history has led to claims that it’s using white supremacist language even when there is no evidence for it.
Hannah Gais, a senior researcher with the SPLC, has long tracked white supremacist groups and said she thinks the administration knows what it’s doing with its messaging slogans.","As its immigration crackdown in Minneapolis intensifies, the Trump administration is leaning into messaging that borrows from phrases, images and music about national identity that have become popular among right-wing groups.

On Jan. 9, two days after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent’s shooting of Renee Good sent tensions in Minneapolis to a fever pitch, the Department of Homeland Security posted to social media an image of a man on a horse riding through a snowy, mountainous landscape with the words “We’ll have our home again.” That’s the chorus to a song about ousting a foreign presence by a self-described “folk-punk” band that the Proud Boys and other far-right and white supremacist groups have used.

The next day, the Department of Labor posted on X: “One Homeland. One People. One Heritage. Remember who you are, American.” Several Trump critics on the social media site drew a parallel to a notorious Nazi slogan, “One People, One Realm, One Leader.”

And this past week, as President Donald Trump stepped up his pressure campaign to claim Greenland, the White House posted an image on X that showed a dog sled facing a fork in the trail, one that leads to an American flag and the White House and another that leads to the Russian and Chinese flags. Above the image was the phrase, “Which way, Greenland Man?”

The post refers to a meme that riffs off the title of a notorious white supremacist book titled “Which Way Western Man?” The administration had already used the framing in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement recruiting post last year, which asked, “Which way, American Man?”

The flurry of posts has renewed criticism about a recurring pattern in Trump’s second term — the sometimes cryptic use of imagery popular with the far right and white supremacists in the administration’s campaign to rally the nation behind its immigration crackdown, which it frames as a battle to preserve Western civilization.

Administration tells critics to ‘get a grip’

The administration says it’s tired of criticism that its messaging is framed around white supremacy or Nazi slogans.

“It seems that the mainstream media has become a meme of their own: The deranged leftist who claims everything they dislike must be Nazi propaganda,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said. “This line of attack is boring and tired. Get a grip.”

Referring to the “We’ll Have Our Home Again” post, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said it “was a reference to 20-plus million illegal aliens invading the country.”

“I don’t know where you guys are getting this stuff,” she added, “but it is absurd.”

César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, a law professor at Ohio State University, said the administration’s references are a choice.

“You don’t have to dip into white supremacist sloganeering to promote immigration regulation,” he said, noting that former President Bill Clinton signed two bills toughening penalties on immigrants who were in the country illegally in the 1990s without doing so.

He added that the administration seems to calibrate its references.

“The imagery is not simply a reproduction of common white supremacist imagery or text, but a play on that imagery — and that gives them the breathing room they want,” Garcia Hernández said.

Trump won his second term with robust support from Latino voters and increased his backing among both Black and Asian voters, all while running on pledges of tough border enforcement and mass deportations.

Still, Trump for years has created enthusiasm among white supremacist groups, who see his nationalist and anti-immigrant stance as validating their own.

The president has complained that immigrants are “poisoning the blood of our country” and spoken favorably about white immigrants compared to other immigrants. In his first term, he bemoaned the number of immigrants coming from what he called “shithole countries” such as Haiti or ones in Africa, while wondering why the U.S. doesn’t draw more people from Norway. Last month, he called Somali immigrants “garbage.”

Trump changed immigration policy to favor whites in one area by shutting down the admission of refugees except for white South Africans, whom he contends, against evidence, are being discriminated against in their home country.

Online appeal for the far right

Some of Trump’s most prominent supporters have openly embraced the cause of white nationalists.

Elon Musk, who was Trump’s biggest donor during the 2024 presidential campaign and ran the president’s Department of Government Efficiency for the first part of last year, recirculated a user post on X, the social platform he owns, that called for “white solidarity” to prevent the mass murder of white men and added a “100” emoji indicating agreement.

The administration’s history has led to claims that it’s using white supremacist language even when there is no evidence for it.

In the aftermath of the Good shooting in Minnesota, a sign that appeared on Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem’s lectern during a news conference — reading “One Of Ours, All Of Yours” — drew widespread attention on social media, with many commentators suggesting it was a Nazi phrase. The Southern Poverty Law Center, however, could not trace the words to any Nazi slogan.

McLaughlin, the DHS spokeswoman, said it was a reference to the subject of the press conference: “a CBP officer who was shot — he was one of our officers and all of the country’s federal law enforcement officer,” she wrote in an email.

Hannah Gais, a senior researcher with the SPLC, has long tracked white supremacist groups and said she thinks the administration knows what it’s doing with its messaging slogans.

“They know their base is this overly online right-winger who they know will go nuts if they say ‘Which Way, Western Man?’” Gais said. “I don’t think it’s a tenable strategy for the long term because the stuff is incomprehensible to most people. And if it is comprehensible, people don’t like it.”

Their outcome will ultimately determine the extent of long-term damage by the most unpopular re-elected president in U.S. history.","Since returning to office, President Donald Trump's administration has shredded the economic safety net for millions, rolled back a half-century of civil rights advances, threatened the long-term health of Americans and unsettled U.S. allies.

In the public's view, he failed to resolve one of the two major issues that elected him, the increasing unaffordability of day-to-day life. And he created grave doubts about his methods to curb illegal immigration.

As president, Trump bears ultimate responsibility for his administration's misdeeds, many of which face legal challenges.

But three top appointees — Stephen Miller, Russell Vought and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — are, along with the president, the architects of the most damaging aspects of Trump 2.0. Most other top officials are primarily enablers.

Here is a rundown:

› MILLER. Miller has been the main architect of Trump's anti-immigration policies and efforts to curb civil rights programs and other so-called ""woke"" policies, both within the government and beyond it.

He set numerical targets for deporting illegal immigrants that led to detention and deportation of some legal residents and citizens.

Though descended from Jewish immigrants who fled Eastern Europe, Miller encouraged policies ending asylum for victims of repression and eliminating most legal immigration.

He was also a principal architect of the legally questionable effort to send federal and National Guard troops into major cities in the name of reducing crime and assisting deportation efforts.

Miller also urged overthrowing Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and threatening Greenland's independence.

› VOUGHT. As director of the Office of Management and Budget, Vought picked up where Elon Musk left off in slashing federal personnel and programs, especially those that helped the poor.

The mastermind behind many of the conservative Project 2025 recommendations that form the basis of Trump's second-term policies, Vought has long believed the executive branch can refuse to spend funds appropriated by Congress. A Supreme Court test looms.

Vought contends the president has total authority over the executive branch and can fire members of semi-independent commissions and others who oppose his policies.

He encouraged the sharp cutback in federal health and food programs, emergency and foreign aid programs. He also unilaterally blocked funds for environmental projects in Democratic-run states.

› KENNEDY. As secretary of health and human services, he implemented an array of damaging policies reflecting his long-held contrarian beliefs after promising senators he would weigh scientific expertise.

His appointees at the Centers for Disease Control encouraged those who contend without evidence that many vaccines are unsafe and may jeopardize long-term health for millions.

This year has already seen the first two significant outbreaks in a generation of measles, likely exacerbated by Kennedy's refusal to support anti-measles vaccinations.

More recently, his department revised guidelines for what American should eat, against eating processed foods and sugary drinks and reversing decades of warnings that over-consumption of red meats, butter and whole milk contribute to heart disease.

Kennedy also canceled billions of dollars for research, including hundreds of clinical trials, but Congress is reversing his actions.

Trump, himself, initiated many questionable policies, from seeking to end birthright citizenship to imposing import tariffs, ordering prosecution of longtime critics and encouraging fossil fuels while dismantling projects using alternate fuels.

His campaign of breaking norms and imposing his own instinctual views has inspired a spate of lawsuits. Their outcome will ultimately determine the extent of long-term damage by the most unpopular re-elected president in U.S. history.",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/img/2026/01/18/103909884_OPED-LEUBSDORF-COLUMN-GET--2-_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2026-01-18 10:58:32.056223

Abigail Spanberger signed 10 executive actions that broadly targeted affordability and pushed the commonwealth away from former Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin's approaches to education, immigration and race.

She also signed an action that delegates broad emergency and day-to-day authority to Bonnie Krenz-Schnurman, her longtime chief of staff, hours after taking Virginia's high office.

The orders also put the risks to Virginia's economy and budget posed by federal funding cuts from Congress and President Donald Trump in the public discussion more so than under the previous administration.

""Today, we are responding to the moment. We are setting the tone for what Virginians can expect over the next four years: pragmatic leadership focused on lowering costs and delivering results,"" said Spanberger in a statement.

While governors do not have the power to appropriate funds, Spanberger's executive orders also reflected her and top Democrats' apparent preference to avoid using Virginia's general fund to lower costs and raise wages, arguing that raising taxes is another cost for families.

Spanberger, who is also the first woman to be elected Virginia's governor, did not take questions from the press after signing all 10 actions.

The directives on affordability were to identify cost savings for families, which state-facilitated services are most at risk due to federal policies, and finding housing regulations that may be cut in order to spur new home and apartment construction.

The executive order named housing, health care, energy, education, child care and living expenses like groceries as areas of particular concern. Health care and identifying potential ways to loosen housing regulations got their own executive orders.

In the order on health care funding, Spanberger created an ""Interagency Health Financing Task Force"" to coordinate health care financing and sort out all the various funding risks posed by the congressional passage of HR1. Hundreds of thousands of Virginians are at risk of losing their health care or being priced out due to the bill's provisions.

It also includes a review of Managed Care Organizations, a key part of Medicaid services in the commonwealth. Recently, a forecast from the Department of Medical Assistance Services said that MCOs would need an additional $3.2 billion in state funds to maintain current services for the 1.6 million Virginians enrolled, according to December data from DMAS.

The underlying challenges for Spanberger and Virginia's tight spending plan, given rising education and health care costs, compound the limitations of state government according to Terry Clower, director of George Mason's Center for Regional Analysis.

""Saying that 'we are going to make affordability better for you in the short run' is really hard for government to do, and particularly state government,"" Clower told VPM News in an interview Friday.

Virginia normally conforms to federal tax law on a ""rolling"" basis, with some exceptions. However, state lawmakers paused that conformity in 2025 in light of the federal cuts to taxes that could have trickle-down effects on Virginia's tax collections — to the tune of billions of dollars.

Democrats said during the opening of the General Assembly session they would not look to conform to many of new federal tax law's provisions.

Spanberger directed Virginia's agencies to identify what risks the federal government's policies will have in one order. Clower noted that tariffs have an inflationary effect, immigration crackdowns could affect labor costs and availability, and jobs connected to the federal government are affected.

""We've also seen a trend now for professional business services jobs that are declining,"" he said. The effects ""are crossing different levels of households, so you're creating some pressures in the economy.""

Higher education governance also got special attention. Executive Order 6 requires recommendations for legislative or policy changes to how board of visitor members are appointed or selected. It follows tumult at University of Virginia (Spanberger's alma mater) and resignations of at least three board members shortly before Saturday's inauguration.

In the order's wording, Spanberger cited federal interference as the need for the changes: ""These pressures underscore the urgent need for the Commonwealth to reevaluate how governing boards are appointed, ensuring they are composed of individuals dedicated to upholding the quality, independence, and reputation of our institutions.""

That is but one of a few departures from the approach of Youngkin's administration to university governance.

The new governor's Day 1 EOs also give specific mention to diversity and opportunity. Executive Order 4 mentions ""inclusive"" education and closing ""opportunity gaps,"" while EO 9 tells agencies to take ""affirmative measures … to emphasize the recruitment of qualified minorities, women, disabled persons, and older Virginians to serve at all levels of state government.""

It heavily contrasts with the tone of Youngkin's administration, which praised the closure of DEI offices. In 2023 Martin D. Brown, Youngkin's chief diversity officer (whose title did not include the word ""equity""), declared that ""DEI is dead"" during a talk at Virginia Military Institute.

Spanberger also is rescinding a controversial executive order of Youngkin's that directed state and local law enforcement to pursue immigration-related enforcement duties. Executive Order 10 does not withdraw from existing 287(g) agreements, according to Spanberger Communications Director Libby Wiet.

It solely rescinds Youngkin's issued mandate — which directed Virginia's law enforcement agencies to become federally deputized for immigration enforcement and opened up Departments of Corrections facilities for immigrants' federal processing and detention.

Spanberger also issued orders that outline expanded powers for her chief of staff; Krenz-Schnurman has served as the newly installed governor's chief of staff since her first term in Congress.

Those EO- designated powers include budgetary and administrative roles (EO 8), as well as the limited ability to call forth the Virginia National Guard (EO 7) or declare a state of emergency if Spanberger is ""unable to be reached.""

Ugarte said that El Paso County will be entering into the warrant services officer model, which will check the federal system for inmates entering the El Paso County Jail to see if the individual has a warrant related to immigration and detain them.
""If we do immigration enforcement out in our community, that will create a divide between law enforcement and our community.
The sheriff told the El Paso Times that these new requirements could strain his already underfunded and short staffed office.
Fears in El Paso immigrant community Residents spent more than an hour asking Ugarte questions related to ICE operations in the county.","El Paso County Sheriff Oscar Ugarte met residents at a townhall meeting to explain an agreement to work with expanding U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations.

Dozens of residents attended the meeting on Saturday, Jan. 17, at the Socorro Ramírez Community Center in Sparks to hear Ugarte explain what will happen now that El Paso County is required by Texas state law to join the national 287(g) program to cooperate with ICE enforcement operations.

Ugarte explained that he was given three options for what type of agreement that his office could enter. Ugarte said that El Paso County will be entering into the warrant services officer model, which will check the federal system for inmates entering the El Paso County Jail to see if the individual has a warrant related to immigration and detain them.

""We picked this model because we believe that it will have the least affect on our community,"" Ugarte told residents. ""If we do immigration enforcement out in our community, that will create a divide between law enforcement and our community. We don't want that. We don't (want) our community to be scared.""

The townhall was organized by the Border Network for Human Rights, an El Paso-based immigrant advocacy group. There was no way for El Paso to avoid being forced to participate, Samantha Singleton, the policy director for the BNHR, told attendees, because the county could be sued if they do not ""comply.""

The county must now join the 287(g) program with ICE after SB 8 went into effect on Jan. 1. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed the bill into law in June 2025 requiring all counties that operate a jail or contracts with a private vendor to operate a jail in Texas to sign one of three types of agreements with ICE: the Warrant Service Officer, the Jail Enforcement Model and the Task Force Model.

Over 225 counties in Texas already have signed agreements with ICE, according to the ICE's 287(g) program website. Only one county in New Mexico is participating in the program, the Curry County Sheriff's Office in Clovis.

ICE agents already had access to inmates detained in the El Paso County Jail due to a 2017 law that required them to work with federal agents.

Ugarte — a first generation American and Democrat who just completed his first year in office as sheriff — expressed his opposition to being forced to sign any new agreement throughout the townhall. The sheriff told the El Paso Times that these new requirements could strain his already underfunded and short staffed office.

""As local law enforcement, we have enough issues to deal with already,"" Ugarte said following the event. ""We don't have the resources, we don't have the manpower, we don't have the budget. Do I believe that local law enforcement should be focused on federal immigration laws? Absolutely not.""

Fears in El Paso immigrant community

Residents spent more than an hour asking Ugarte questions related to ICE operations in the county.

The questions from residents ranged between how his office had received emergency calls reporting federal agents, how would his office address racial profiling and what to do if federal agents leave a child behind after detaining their guardians, among many other questions.

Ugarte said that any emergency calls will be treated as any other call, but if the person identifies themselves as a federal agent, there isn't much deputies can do. He requested that residents do not protest at a close distance and not interfere with federal agents. He also pointed out that these policies were the result of the 2024 elections, and reminded residents to show their anger through voting.

The questions reflected the concerns of many residents of the Borderland, many of whom are immigrants and still have loved one who cross the border regularly.

There is fear in the community, Alfredo Agüero, a resident of El Paso, said after the townhall. The 68-year-old U.S. citizen was born in Juárez and was one of about 20 people to ask a question of the sheriff, asking how can residents have confidence that these masked individuals are actual federal agents when they do not identify themselves or present identifications and how the community can have confidence in the sheriff.

The sheriff's answer that there was nothing he could do did not ease his concerns, he said.

""I feel like we are in the same spot,"" Agüero said. ""The answers we received is that they can do whatever they want. It is not fair.""","https://www.elpasotimes.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/17/PTX1/88236521007-lt-sheriff-oscar-ugarte-10.JPG?crop=3999,2250,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-18 02:57:07.141749

A group of local unions in Minnesota, meanwhile, has endorsed a planned statewide economic blackout in response to ICE actions in the state.

The Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation, which is affiliated with the AFL-CIO, first announced its endorsement alongside other regional bodies on Friday.

""The Minnesota labor movement is united against the violent ICE occupation of our beloved cities that has directly impacted union members, our workplaces and our families,"" the group said in a press release.

Dozens of community, faith, and union groups are organizing the Day of Truth and Freedom, a call to action asking Minnesotans to avoid work, school, and shopping on January 23 to pause the economy. There will also be a rally and march in downtown Minneapolis at 2 p.m. local time.

""We will gather with family, neighbors, and community to show Minnesota's moral heart and economic power,"" organizers said in a Facebook post.

Organizers listed several demands, including that ICE leave Minnesota and that federal funding for ICE be scrapped in the upcoming congressional budget.

The Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation told Business Insider that ICE's presence is disrupting residents' daily lives.

""Working people from across sectors — hospitality, healthcare, education, custodial, construction, public works — are being targeted,"" the group said in a statement.

Thousands of ICE officers have descended on Minnesota as part of Operation Metro Surge, launched on December 1. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a press release earlier this month that the operation was targeting criminal activity among immigrants in the state.

""Under President Trump, we will expose and deliver accountability for the rampant fraud and criminality happening in Minnesota. You won't steal from Americans or break our laws and get away with it,"" she said.

The Trump administration has criticized cities like Minneapolis that have passed so-called ""sanctuary"" laws preventing city resources and police from supporting federal immigration agents. In a statement shared on Friday, the White House said sanctuary cities create ""a climate of hostility that endangers federal officers and incites violence."" Earlier in the week, the administration said it would cut federal funding to sanctuary cities.

Business Insider reached out to ICE, the Department of Homeland Security, and the White House for comment.

Many residents, meanwhile, have criticized the tactics that federal agents are using to locate and detain individuals. Tensions in the state skyrocketed after ICE officer Jonathan Ross fatally shot Renee Good, a 37-year-old American citizen from Minneapolis, on January 7, leading to a wave of protests and outcry.

Days after the shooting, Minnesota's attorney general filed a lawsuit on behalf of Minneapolis, St. Paul, and the state against Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, seeking to end the operation.

""As a result of this surge, municipalities have been forced to divert local law enforcement resources away from their normal public safety duties, emergency responder resources have been strained, schools have been forced into lockdowns and closures, businesses have been forced to close, and the rights of Minnesotans have been violated time and time again,"" a press release from the Minnesota Attorney General's Office said.

Homeland Security said officers have arrested over 2,500 individuals during Operation Metro Surge so far.

Business and Legal Community Mobilize Against Immigrant-Visa Freeze

Within hours of the State Department’s announcement, business coalitions, immigration lawyers and civil-rights organizations began crafting legal and lobbying strategies to overturn or narrow the new immigrant-visa suspension. In an editorial titled “Echoes of 1924,” the Economic Times argued that framing the freeze as an anti-welfare measure masks a broader attempt to slash lawful immigration levels. Advocacy groups likened the policy to the National Origins Quota Act, warning of talent shortfalls in STEM fields.

Several multinational employers told reporters they are exploring emergency L-1 intracompany transfers and E-2 treaty visas to keep high-value employees on projects scheduled to launch in Q2. The American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) confirmed it is assembling plaintiffs for a potential injunction, citing due-process violations and harm to U.S. businesses. Meanwhile, diversity-visa (DV-2026) winners from Sudan, Sierra Leone and Laos have organized online forums to crowd-fund litigation before their visas expire on September 30.

For individuals and corporations scrambling to adjust their plans, VisaHQ can be a practical lifeline. The platform (https://www.visahq.com/united-states/) offers real-time embassy updates, customized document checklists, and step-by-step assistance for alternative visa routes such as L-1 or E-2, helping HR teams and foreign nationals keep projects on track while the courts decide the fate of the suspension.

Corporate response: Global-mobility teams are reassessing succession plans and may shift onboarding centers to Canada or Mexico to await adjudication. Recruiters note that prolonged uncertainty could push foreign graduates of U.S. universities to competitors in the U.K. and Australia. HR leaders are urging Congress to clarify that employment-based immigrants with employer affidavits of support should be exempt from the ""public-charge"" rationale.

Next steps: Observers expect the first lawsuits to be filed in federal district courts within the next two weeks. If an injunction is granted, consular processing could resume temporarily, but practitioners caution that injunctions may apply only to named plaintiffs or limited jurisdictions.

VisaHQ's expert visas and immigration team helps individuals and companies navigate global travel, work, and residency requirements. We handle document preparation, application filings, government agencies coordination, every aspect necessary to ensure fast, compliant, and stress-free approvals.

Tim Walz to mobilize the state's National Guard on Saturday.

The National Guard units were not deployed as of Saturday evening but eventually are expected to help state and local police to maintain peace in Minneapolis and elsewhere.

Walz urged protesters and others to ""stay safe and stay peaceful today"" amid the protests and continued federal immigration law enforcement activities by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies.

""Our public safety team has the resources, coordination, and personnel on the ground to maintain public safety and respond if needed,"" Walz said. ""Thanks to local law enforcement for keeping the peace.""

The governor on Jan. 9 ordered the state's National Guard members to be ""staged and ready"" for a potential deployment after an ICE officer shot and killed anti-ICE activist Renee Good as she tried to flee as federal officers tried to arrest her for obstructing them on Jan. 7.

A second ICE-involved shooting in Minneapolis that did not cause a fatality happened Wednesday night when a Venezuelan who ICE said had illegally entered the United States fled during a targeted traffic stop.

That man and two others assaulted the ICE officer with a snow shovel and a broom handle, and the officer shot the primary suspect in the leg to end the attack.

National Guard units on Saturday were ""staging to support local law enforcement and emergency management agencies,"" the Minnesota Department of Public Safety said in a social media post.

A federal judge on Friday restricted ICE's use of crowd-dispersal tools, such as tear gas and pepper spray, to protect peaceful protesters and banned ICE from initiating traffic stops of protesters who have not broken any laws.

This all comes after the Portland mayor confirmed to CBS13 that he was warned by someone at the federal level of a possible ramp up of enforcement.

Lisbon Street, a major hub for businesses in Lewiston, felt unusually quiet on Friday. The door to an African supermarket was locked, even though online it says they are open until 8 p.m. A sign on the door read, “ICE is coming. Be prepared.”

The owner of Soya on Lisbon Street in downtown Lewiston says right now, it’s rare to find stores like hers open.

She’s limiting her hours, but remaining open, so her customers can buy groceries.

“Some customer called me that they are going to come in to get something to eat because they are staying home,” she said.

Ever since the rumors of increased ICE enforcement, many shop owners on Lisbon Street are afraid to leave their homes.

The shop owner says she sought asylum in the U.S. several years ago. Now she’s worried about herself and her two children.

“They are afraid,” she said.

""Whether or not they are residents, visitors, federal agents. Anyone that comes into our state is subject to our laws,” Cumberland County District Attorney Jacqueline Sartoris said.

Sartoris sent a firm statement Friday to ICE, saying while they can't arrest federal agents, they will investigate any agent that breaks Maine law.

""We are all watching this and saying this is not appropriate and necessary,” Sartoris said.

The Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office says that when ICE arrests somebody in Maine, they will go to the ICE facility in Scarborough, where they will be booked. From there, they could be transported to the ICE facility in Massachusetts or the Cumberland County Jail.

L.A. County Dist. Atty. Nathan Hochman called the incident “unacceptable” in an office-wide memo sent out on Friday evening.

“A member of our Office was wrongfully detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). I can thankfully report that, shortly after, our employee was released and is safe,” Hochman wrote. “This incident is unacceptable. Our employee is a dedicated public servant who serves the people of Los Angeles County with professionalism and integrity. This troubling situation caused great distress to our colleague, our co-worker’s family, and our entire Office family.”

The reason for the person’s detention was not immediately clear. A spokesman for Hochman declined to comment further and referred questions to ICE. Representatives for ICE did not respond to inquiries from The Times. .

Two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the incident, speaking on the condition of anonymity in order to talk candidly, said the employee was not a prosecutor. The employee was also not engaged in protest activity, the officials said.

In the e-mail, Hochman said he personally reached out to federal authorities on Friday to make them aware of the situation and “urge them to be more respectful of the rights of those who reside in our community and ensure this wrongful conduct does not occur again.”

In the months since ICE and Border Patrol agents began carrying out President Trump’s sweeping immigration raids in U.S. cities, civil liberties groups have repeatedly sued the Department of Justice alleging agents are making stops based on race rather than reasonable suspicion.

After ICE and Border Patrol agents spent months raiding car washes and Home Depot parking lots around L.A. County, a federal judge in October found sufficient evidence that agents were violating the 4th Amendment by relying on the race, language and vocation of targeted individuals to form “reasonable suspicion” for arrest.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5d131c2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7929x4163+0+548/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8d%2Fe7%2F73c28b53419a828579bb0b64f29b%2F1511530-me-nathan-hochman-portrait-cmh-05.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 21:58:13.619836

Crowds began to gather, and a clash soon broke out, ending with tear gas.","MINNEAPOLIS(AP) — Work starts around sunrise for many of the federal officers carrying out the immigration crackdown in and around the Twin Cities, with hundreds of people in tactical gear emerging from a bland office building near the main airport.

Within minutes, hulking SUVs, pickup trucks and minivans begin leaving, forming the unmarked convoys that have quickly become feared and common sights in the streets of Minneapolis, St. Paul and their suburbs.

Protesters also arrive early, braving the cold to stand across the street from the fenced-in federal compound, which houses an immigration court and government offices. “Go home!” they shout as convoys roar past. ""ICE out!”

Things often turn uglier after nightfall, when the convoys return and the protesters sometimes grow angrier, shaking fences and occasionally smacking passing cars. Eventually, the federal officers march toward them, firing tear gas and flash grenades before hauling away at least a few people.

“We’re not going anywhere!” a woman shouted on a recent morning. “We’re here until you leave.”

This is the daily rhythm of Operation Metro Surge, the Trump administration's latest and biggest crackdown yet, with more than 2,000 officers taking part. The surge has pitted city and state officials against the federal government, sparked daily clashes between activists and immigration officers in the deeply liberal cities, and left a mother of three dead.

The crackdown is barely noticeable in some areas, particularly in whiter, wealthier neighborhoods and suburbs, where convoys and tear gas are rare. And even in neighborhoods where masked immigration officers are common, they often move with ghostlike quickness, making arrests and disappearing before protesters can gather in force.

Still, the surge can be felt across broad swaths of the Twin Cities area, which is home to more than 3 million people.

“We don’t use the word ‘invasion’ lightly,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, told reporters this week, noting that his police force has just 600 officers. “What we are seeing is thousands — plural, thousands — of federal agents coming into our city.”

Those agents have an outsized presence in a small city.

It can take hours to drive across Los Angeles and Chicago, both targets of Trump administration crackdowns. It can take 15 minutes to cross Minneapolis.

So as worry ripples through the region, children are skipping school or learning remotely, families are avoiding religious services and many businesses, especially in immigrant neighborhoods, have closed temporarily.

Drive down Lake Street, an immigrant hub since the days when newcomers came to Minneapolis from Norway and Sweden, and the sidewalks now seem crowded only with activists standing watch, ready to blow warning whistles at the first sign of a convoy.

At La Michoacana Purepecha, where customers can order ice cream, chocolate covered bananas and pork rinds, the door is locked and staff let in people one at a time. Nearby, at Taqueria Los Ocampo, a sign in English and Spanish says the restaurant is temporarily closed because of “current conditions.”

A dozen blocks away at the Karmel Mall, where the city’s large Somali community goes for everything from food and coffee to tax preparation, signs on the doors warn, “No ICE enter without court order.”

The shadow of George Floyd

It’s been nearly six years since George Floyd was murdered by a Minneapolis police officer, but the scars from that killing remain raw.

Floyd was killed just blocks from where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Good, a 37-year-old American citizen, during a Jan. 7 confrontation after she stopped to help neighbors during an enforcement operation. Federal officials say the officer fired in self-defense after Good “weaponized” her vehicle. City and state officials dismiss those explanations and point to multiple bystander videos of the confrontation.

For Twin Cities residents, the crackdown can feel overwhelming.

“Enough is enough,” said Johan Baumeister, who came to the scene of Good’s death soon after the shooting to lay flowers.

He said he didn’t want to see the violent protests that shook Minneapolis after Floyd’s death, causing billions of dollars in damage. But this city has a long history of activism and protests, and he had no doubt there would be more.

“I think they’ll see Minneapolis show our rage again,” he predicted.

He was right.

In the days since, there have been repeated confrontations between activists and immigration officers. Most amounted to little more than shouted insults and taunting, with destruction mostly limited to broken windows, graffiti and some badly damaged federal vehicles.

But angry clashes now flare regularly across the Twin Cities. Some protesters clearly want to provoke the federal officers, throwing snowballs at them or screaming obscenities through bullhorns from just a couple feet away. The serious force, though, comes from immigration officers, who have broken car windows, pepper-sprayed protesters and warned observers not to follow them through the streets. Immigrants and citizens have been yanked from cars and homes and detained, sometimes for days. And most clashes end in tear gas.

Drivers in Minneapolis or St. Paul can now stumble across intersections blocked by men in body armor and gas masks, with helicopters clattering overhead and the air filled with the shriek of protesters' whistles.

Shovel your neighbor’s walk

In a state that prides itself on its decency, there’s something particularly Minnesotan about the protests,

Soon after Good was shot, Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat and regular Trump target, repeatedly said he was angry but also urged people to find ways to help their communities.

“It might be shoveling your neighbor’s walk,” he said. “It might mean being at a food bank. It might be pausing to talk to someone you haven’t talked to before.”

He and other leaders have pleaded with protesters to remain peaceful, warning that the White House was looking for a chance to crack down harder.

And when protests do become clashes, residents will often spill from their homes, handing out bottled water so people can flush tear gas from their eyes.

Residents stand watch at schools to warn immigrant parents if convoys approach while they're picking up their children. They take care packages to people too afraid to go out, and arrange rides for them to work and doctor's visits.

On Thursday, in the basement of a Lutheran church in St. Paul, the group Open Market MN assembled food packs for more than a hundred families staying home. Colin Anderson, the group’s outreach director, said the group has seen a surge in requests.

Sometimes, people don’t even understand what has happened to them.

Like Christian Molina from suburban Coon Rapids, who was driving through a Minneapolis neighborhood on a recent day, taking his car to a mechanic, when immigration officers began following him. He wonders if it's because he looks Hispanic.

They turned on their siren, but Molina kept driving, unsure who they were.

Eventually, the officers sped up, hit his rear bumper and both cars stopped. Two emerged and asked Molina for his papers. He refused, saying he’d wait for the police. Crowds began to gather, and a clash soon broke out, ending with tear gas.

So the officers left.

They left behind an angry, worried man who suddenly owned a sedan with a mangled rear fender.

Long after the officers were gone he had one final question.

“Who’s going to pay for my car?”

The patrols in Minneapolis mirror tactics that have emerged in other Democratic-run cities amid stepped-up immigration enforcement.","MINNEAPOLIS — Standing outside his son’s elementary school, a father heard a warning crackle over his walkie-talkie: a suspicious car nearby.

At another school, volunteer Joe Dirkswager stood watch, nodding at passing vehicles. Miles away in St. Paul, Matthew Kearns was questioning unfamiliar individuals near the school he graduated from decades ago.

The three are among the volunteers who have begun patrolling streets around elementary and high schools in the Twin Cities, using walkie-talkies, Signal group chats and whistles to warn families and school staff of immigration enforcement activities. The informal patrols have emerged amid a sharp surge of federal immigration personnel in Minnesota and the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an ICE officer last week.

On Thursday afternoon, about two dozen adults lined the perimeter of Green Central Elementary School in central Minneapolis, just blocks from where Good was killed. Patrol volunteers scanned nearby streets and relayed updates in real time.

The father, Greg, a 42-year-old who asked that his last name not be published because of safety concerns for his family, said the patrols have forced families into impossible decisions on a daily basis.

“Every morning I feel like I’m forced with the choice of ‘Do I try to do patrol to protect my daughter and her preschool or do I come to my son’s kindergarten to do patrol here?’” he asked.

“Those are the kind of choices that the community is being faced with.”

Greg and eight other volunteers who spoke with NBC News said the patrols are especially aimed at protecting parents and school staff who are not U.S. citizens and fear being detained while coming and going from schools.

More than 3,000 federal immigration personnel have descended on Minnesota in recent weeks, and more than 2,500 undocumented immigrants have been apprehended in Minneapolis since November, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The enforcement push — dubbed Operation Metro Surge — follows renewed scrutiny of a state fraud investigation involving a number of individuals of Somali descent, a link that community leaders say has fueled fear beyond those accused.

The heightened enforcement has coincided with clashes between teachers, parents and federal law enforcement officers.

On Wednesday, a parent was detained by ICE at a school bus stop in Robbinsdale, a Minneapolis suburb, according to a statement from Robbinsdale Area Schools Superintendent Teri Staloch. And last week, on the day Good was killed, U.S. Border Patrol agents clashed with teachers and protesters at the nearby Roosevelt High School. At least one educator was detained and released, according to the teachers union.

In response to the disruptions, the Minneapolis Public School District said last week it would offer online classes to its roughly 30,000 students until Feb. 12. St. Paul Public Schools, which serves more than 30,000 students, said Thursday it would offer a similar online option and will close school several days next week to prepare.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that “ICE is not going to schools to arrest children — we are protecting children,” and that “criminals are no longer able to hide in America’s schools to avoid arrest.”

“Our officers are highly trained and in the face of rioting, doxxing, and physical attacks, they have shown professionalism,” she added. “They are not afraid of loud noises and whistles.”

Bearing witness

Kearns, 56, said the heightened enforcement has been visible beyond the schools where organized patrols first appeared. On Friday afternoon, he drove around Riverview Elementary School on Minneapolis’ west side — which has a large Latino population — watching sites he said have become flashpoints in recent weeks.

“We have basically a Gestapo coming in and infiltrating our neighborhood and just doing whatever they feel like they want to do,” he said.

The sightings pushed Kearns to begin patrolling the area around his former school.

“I grew up, born and raised here, went to this school, played football here, kissed my wife when I was a little boy,” he said, pointing to a field on the school’s property. “We protect our kids in our community. I mean, that’s what every other community would do in this situation or any situation.”

As NBC News spoke with Kearns, a handful of volunteers — most of them parents — watched nearby. Several appeared visibly shaken, declining to discuss how the patrols were organized or how volunteers communicate, citing safety concerns about publicizing their plans. St. Paul Public Schools expressed gratitude for the “care and concern” from the community but noted the patrols are being organized independently. The Minneapolis Public School District did not immediately return a request for comment.

The patrols in Minneapolis mirror tactics that have emerged in other Democratic-run cities amid stepped-up immigration enforcement. In recent months, volunteers in cities including Chicago and Los Angeles have deployed similar patrols.

Leah Hood, 42, an instructor at a nearby university, said she started patrolling Green Central Elementary School this week after hearing from her friends who were already volunteering. She said the presence of observers feels crucial in a moment when families fear encounters could happen without witnesses.

“I mean, how horrifying that you would be kidnapped off the street while coming and going from school at all?” she asked. “But how much more horrifying and terrifying is it to think that that could happen and no one would see it, and no one would be able to attest to the fact that this is real, and they did this to you?”

Hood pointed to directives from state and local officials in recent days. Prosecutors have asked the public to submit videos related to Good’s killing, as much of the evidence gathered by the FBI remains inaccessible to local authorities. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz this week encouraged Minnesotans to “peacefully film ICE agents as they conduct their activities.”

Kids scared and confused

Parents and teachers who spoke with NBC News said children have been fearful and confused amid the heightened enforcement.

Desiree, who has patrolled Green Central Elementary School for weeks and asked that her last name not be published due to safety concerns, said her son has repeatedly asked about law enforcement sightings nearby.

“It’s not a mystery to them that something terrible is happening and that it’s happening right around them,” she said.

Greg said the community, shaped by past trauma over George Floyd’s killing, has responded with solidarity.

“You get on this corner and all day long it’s just cars passing by, and everyone’s waving and saying ‘thank you’ because we’re all looking out for each other,” he said.

They do not interfere or intervene in any way.

NBC 10's Nicole Moeder reports that an ICE chase caught on camera leads to calls for more options for people who need to visit courthouses.

On Friday morning, observers outside the Superior Court bulding in Newport spotted what they believe were ICE vehicles.

Last week, a man previously arrested by ICE outside the Portsmouth Police Department was due in Newport Superior Court but did not show up.

Advocates say ICE agents were outside court on that day as well.

The arrest was caught on surveillance cameras outside the station and released to the public from Portsmouth police.

A warrant for the arrest of 29-year-old Josue Perez Gomez was later issued.

Across the country, some immigrants have been skipping their court hearings out of fear that ICE agents will arrest and detain them.

""I've had some that don't want to pursue claims because they would have to show up at court,"" Dennis said when asked if he has clients who are concerned about showing up to court out of fear of ICE agents.

Advocates are asking the Rhode Island court system to allow people to hold their hearings virtually so that they don’t have to worry about showing up at court and finding ICE there to detain them.

""They have an absolute right to be heard in these proceedings. In workers' comp cases we don't make a distinction whether you're a documented or an undocumented. So they're entitled to it,"" Dennis said. ""I think it's ridiculous and immature that we don't allow it.""

Some Rhode Island Republicans are staunchly against the idea of virtual court hearings.

""For me that would feel a bit obstructionist for the judiciary to do that,"" Senate Minority Leader Jessica de la Cruz said.

""It's not just bad policy. It's deliberate. It's dangerous. And it's a calculated attempt to shield criminal illegal aliens from deportation,"" Anthony d'Ellena said.

""These people have nothing to fear if they're here legally,"" he said when asked about ICE agents detaining immigrants with legal status. ""If you're here illegally, you deserve to be deported. You broke the law coming into this country and you need to leave.""

The discussion around state immigration policy comes as there are renewed concerns about federal funding being withheld from Rhode Island.

In August, the Department of Justice released a memo threatening to cut off federal funding from ""sanctuary jurisdictions"" who they ""identified as having policies, laws, or regulations that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.""

Rhode Island is on the list.

""I certainly don't think that the administration would look at the judiciary here in Rhode Island and say, oh, well, that's okay. They would look at it just the same as the cities and towns who count themselves as sanctuary cities,"" de la Cruz said. ""It's like you know, don't play cute games. The administration has said if you try to obstruct us we will halt funding and if we don't want funding halted to our state then we need to comply with federal law.""

""Rhode Island refuses to follow federal law and should not receive a dime federal funding if we do not comply,"" D'Ellena said, adding, ""President Trump's Feb. 1st cut off on funding to sanctuary states is exactly what we need"" to compel the Rhode Island state legislature to adjust the state's sanctuary city policies.

""Rhode Islanders pay federal taxes to participate in federal programs, and we fully expect those dollars to flow back to Rhode Island through those federal programs,"" Gov.

Anti-ICE protesters force back small group of far-right activists

No injuries reported, but influencer says vest blocked stabbing attempt

Thousands of ICE agents deployed to Minneapolis

MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Hundreds of anti-ICE protesters in Minneapolis chased off a small group of far-right activists who had vowed to march on a neighborhood where many immigrants live on Saturday, stoking tensions in a city on edge after the killing of Renee Good by a federal immigration agent 10 days ago.

Waving signs and screaming chants that called for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol agents to leave Minneapolis, the anti-ICE protesters gathered downtown near City Hall. Scores of them moved forward, forcing about 10 far-right demonstrators against the outside of the municipal government center within minutes. Some in the crowd tossed water balloons that soaked the right-wing demonstrators as temperatures hit -4 degrees Fahrenheit (-20 Celsius) with the wind chill.

Police maintained their distance as the dueling protests played out. About an hour after the rallies began, the tiny contingent of right-wing activists quickly walked a few blocks away to a hotel, hounded by hundreds of anti-ICE protesters who screamed obscenities and told them to get out of the city. A few scuffles broke out, but Reuters did not observe any serious violence.

ONLINE INFLUENCER REPORTS STABBING ATTEMPT

Jake Lang, an online right-wing influencer and one of more than 1,500 people pardoned by President Donald Trump after their criminal convictions related to the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, organized what he called an “anti-fraud” rally. At no point could Lang's voice be heard by the crowd.

Later, Lang posted on X that he was stabbed during a scuffle but that his protective vest blocked the attempt. Reuters could not verify his account.

Minneapolis police said in an email to Reuters they were aware of Lang's social media post, but no official report had been filed with the department. Police had received no reports of injuries related to the protests from victims.

Camera feeds showed some people who appeared to be injured, police said, but those individuals left before officers could contact them.

The anti-ICE protest was organized by the People’s Action Coalition Against Trump.

Trump has repeatedly invoked a scandal around the theft of federal funds intended for social-welfare programs in Minnesota as a rationale for sending thousands of immigration enforcement agents into Minnesota. The president and administration officials have repeatedly singled out the state's community of Somali immigrants.

""We're here to support our Somali neighbors; they asked for their white allies to show up for them,"" said Laura, 56, who, like all protesters interviewed, asked that their last name not be used for fear of retribution by the federal government. ""I'm here to exercise my First Amendment right because my neighbors can't, they're too afraid to leave their house.""

Lang, who has made anti-Muslim and antisemitic comments, has said he wants to secure the U.S. for white Christians. He has been present at small pro-ICE rallies in Minneapolis this week and has targeted Somali immigrants, most of whom are Muslim.

Some 3,000 agents from ICE and Border Patrol have descended on Minneapolis and St. Paul in recent weeks. An ICE agent fatally shot Good, a U.S. citizen and mother of three, after she drove away after being ordered by ICE agents to exit her vehicle. The officer who shot Good was positioned in front of her car on the left. DHS has said he was hit by the car and feared for his life, though videos show the agent remaining on his feet and raise questions about how much contact the car made with him.

The situation has set Minnesota’s Democratic leadership at odds with Trump, whose Justice Department has opened an investigation into Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.

As with the earlier court rulings that reaffirmed the right to record ICE agents, however, those decisions provided little deterrent for them to use a thin pretext to target immigrants and neighborhood volunteers.","The suddenness, scale and violence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids over the last year have prompted neighborhoods and volunteers to either record raids in progress or preemptively stand guard near areas where raids might take place, such as schools with immigrant children. This accountability led to the numerous videos that captured the moment when ICE officer Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis last week, sparking a nationwide outpouring of anger and grief.

Good had been monitoring an elementary school as students were being dropped off before Ross stepped in front of her vehicle and shot her. Human and civil rights advocates who spoke to Salon have called this a classic example of law enforcement foisting on their victim a “deadly dilemma,” forcing the person to appear as aggressive or insubordinate and giving agents an excuse to react violently.

Before Good’s death, other civilians across the country who were recording or watching ICE had been threatened, physically assaulted and arrested, amplifying the sense among critics that ICE officers, the broader law enforcement establishment and the Trump administration view themselves as above the law and capable of getting away with it.

Nevertheless, critics say that ICE, Customs and Border Protection and other institutions have followed a similar playbook used by police states, maintaining the thinnest pretexts to justify their behavior in a way that gives, in theory, plausible deniability, and signals to critics that they’re too powerful to need a perfect alibi.

“They typically cite these vague concepts of obstruction, interference with an investigation, incitement in protest cases, entirely inapplicable statutes, presumably to sound official,” Seth Stern, advocacy director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, told Salon. “Let’s say somebody is following an ICE vehicle to record what the officers are doing, which does not actually fall under a stalking statute, to state the obvious. It is not stalking to follow a law enforcement officer to document what they’re up to — that’s constitutionally protected conduct. But more often than not, ICE officials on the ground, and higher-ups alike, will cite those loose concepts to intimidate and later justify their actions on social media or unofficial statements.”

“If anything, I’ve seen people reaffirm their commitment to continue documenting ICE and CBP activity because they see it as an essential form of holding on to whatever justice and democracy still exists.”

Federal court rulings have reaffirmed the right of citizens to observe and record police activity in public areas under the First Amendment. Civilians with little knowledge of statutes and court rulings or experience in dealing with law enforcement have proven, in many documented cases, to be fairly resilient against those kinds of tactics. But generally, they still operate with fewer defenses than professional journalists, and might, due to uncertainty over repercussions, put away their camera or delete their footage when confronted by an armed officer.

Organizations like Carolina Migrant Network and the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) have been working to not only educate people about their rights when filming or watching ICE agents, but train them on how to effectively document the evidence while avoiding personal injury and unlawful arrest.

In one video, LULAC advises recorders to keep their camera focused on agents rather than their victims, verbally narrate the facts, strategically capture key information like badges and street signs, and potentially limited themselves to note-taking and other support roles while someone less at risk handles the recording. While some people might find themselves as unexpected witnesses of an ICE raid, other volunteers, such as those working with the Carolina Migrant Network, have formed or joined rapid-response text groups to coordinate movement and to be able to arrive on-site soon after an alert goes out.

“What happened in Minneapolis could have happened here in Charlotte, could have happened in Chicago, could have happened anywhere. It wasn’t shocking to folks who have been doing the work for a long time, because they’ve witnessed firsthand what ICE is capable of doing,” Stefania Arteaga, co-founder and co-director of the Carolina Migrant Network, told Salon. “If anything, I’ve seen people reaffirm their commitment to continue documenting ICE and CBP activity because they see it as an essential form of holding on to whatever justice and democracy still exists.”

The widespread protests over Good’s death are an example of just how far people have been pushed, but Arteaga expressed her wish that such outrage could be found earlier.

“There was a prevailing attitude that everything was good and dandy again until we found ourselves once again under a Trump administration where we’re being forced to confront the history of the United States and their treatment of immigrants and other minority groups,” she said. “More than before, white America is reckoning with the fact that ICE and the Department of Homeland Security didn’t start under Trump. But the fact that it took this long really shows the lack of humanity that is given to immigrants, immigrant voices, immigrant stories and immigrant life.”

During the Obama and Biden administrations and the first Trump administration, ICE used family separation, raids and physical and verbal aggression against immigrants, but were more prone to brush off witnesses as mere annoyances. The second Trump administration has overseen a marked increase in permissibility for particularly brazen actions, with the Department of Homeland Security making it official policy to prosecute those who videotape ICE agents and post the content on social media. While federal courts have usually ruled against newer or intensified ICE policy as unconstitutional or in violation of existing statutes, ICE has found ways to continue forcefully handling any perceived threats to their mission.

In the case of Good, ICE has maintained the narrative that they were acting in self-defense, even though they had surrounded her vehicle and threatened her before she attempted to drive away. The tactics ICE used against Good are recognizable across the country against people who may have narrowly avoided her fate. Sometimes, agents would issue contradictory orders which would force someone to risk serious danger either way; other times, they might trap cars, snatch people’s phones, and otherwise escalate the intensity of a confrontation, hoping, critics say, to make their victim panic.

“I had a scenario where an agent called the police on me. They are intentionally trying to frame the situation in ways that are completely disingenuous,” Arteaga recalled.

Meanwhile, state legislatures across the country have passed bills designed to codify limitations on the ability of civilians to hold ICE and law enforcement accountable. One popular proposal has been to ban recording police activity within a certain distance — usually around 25 feet. Those laws, which go far beyond punishing actual obstruction and interference, have largely been struck down by the courts as unconstitutional. As with the earlier court rulings that reaffirmed the right to record ICE agents, however, those decisions provided little deterrent for them to use a thin pretext to target immigrants and neighborhood volunteers.

“Law enforcement agencies are all public institutions, and allowing the wider public to see what they’re doing and potentially object to what they’re doing and recognize that what they’re doing is wrong is not legally actionable interference,” Stern said. “That’s the purpose of good journalism, to expose wrongdoing and alert the public that their officials are not behaving as they should.”

“To the extent that officers consider journalism in and of itself to be obstruction,” he continued, “those are probably officers who should be obstructed.”",https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2026/01/ice-immigration-and-customs-enforcement-GettyImages-2255783416.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 17:57:08.166633

This year threatens to be the one that makes or breaks the unique moral commitment to human rights that has underpinned, even when flawed, the global order for the past 80 years.

Instead, the message sent around the world by bombastic leaders, acted out by mobs, armies and militias and embedded into the technology that shapes daily life, is that some people are less than human, deserve less empathy, compassion, opportunity or even physical safety.

This is potentially even more dangerous than the implosion of the “international rules-based order”. It normalises heinous behaviour towards other human beings in a world that has never had greater capacity for self-destruction.

You hear it everywhere. The tone is set when the US President declares some people are scum or a Cameroonian “freedom fighter” succinctly says his opponents, “don’t see us as human. Likewise we don’t see them as [human]”.

Australia, thanks to the work of Labor party leader Doc Evatt, was one of the midwives of the UN Declaration of Human Rights. But Australia remains the only liberal democracy not to have adopted its own constitutional or statutory bill of rights. Instead there is a patchwork of local laws and international agreements.

For all the talk about Australian values this absence is a telling reminder of the fragility of our rights as citizens and human beings.

This has come into sharp focus in the debate after the Bondi attack, and the implosion of the Adelaide writers’ week.

In the rush to blame, the principle is lost. When the threat feels existential, pluralism is attacked and tolerance as a virtue derided.

The Australian commitment to human rights is always subject to political whim. Legislation protecting rights has been voided to allow racially charged laws to pass, including the Northern Territory intervention. States that have legislated to recognise rights, readily vacate the legislation to remove them from some groups – most frequently First Nations people.

After years of work, legislation asserting the rights of artists – something that had been promised in the last South Australian election campaign – was introduced in 2025. But the parliament ran out of time to pass it. Among the principles outlined in the bill was that “all artists, makers and creatives in South Australia have the right to freedom of artistic and creative expression.” If this had been enacted, would it have changed the ground rules, and meant the conundrum played out differently?

Last year, in recognition of the increasing fragility of the international commitment to human rights, the government appointed former attorney general and sitting MP Mark Dreyfus as an International Human Rights envoy.

It would be good if he started his advocacy at home.

Given that the consensus is that Australian constitutional change is just too hard, a statutory bill of rights could have symbolic as well as practical impact. It would also strengthen Australian advocacy in a world where human rights are increasingly derided.

This is not just a legal debate: human rights and empathy touch everything.

In the tick-box world mediated by AI, it is likely to become even more pervasive. We know that the selection biases of technology are increasingly excluding people, ensuring that the world order as it exists in the minds of technocrats is imposed on us all. They generally don’t do empathy or pay attention to people not like them.

Much of the time we can work around this, but sometimes it is accentuated.

Over the summer break I had two experiences that threw this into stark relief. Not the grand infringements of human rights that capture the headlines, but mundane encounters that point to the banal cruelty of a data-driven world in which empathy has evaporated and shades of grey no longer exist.

In response to one of those slightly threatening Robodebt-inflected Centrelink letters I waited until I had the time to sit on a call – last time it took three hours – and was pleasantly surprised that after 38 minutes a human answered.

I provided the required case number and then said, “But the person has died.”

The operator proceeded, “Can you spell his name again … and the birth date … the reference number.” I did this, and then added, “I know you are working to a script, but when someone tells you the client has died, it would be appropriate to pass on your condolences.”

“Oh yes,” he replied, “You are right. I am working to a script, we don’t have that option.”

“Well in the interests of training and quality control I hope this call is recorded and that is fixed,” I said.

“I’m sorry,” the operator replied, and without missing a beat we continued to populate the form with the details the script required.

A few weeks earlier a brilliant young colleague, educated to the highest level in the Stem disciplines, said with unnerving clarity when discussing whether to appeal a questionable driving fine: “I don’t like to rely on human intervention.”

If we give up on human intervention, the technocrats have won. There will be even less room for human rights in the world they are crafting in the name of efficiency and profit, under a cover of bombastic rhetoric. It’s not a fight we can afford to lose.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e848919432d279e7f9dc018c50d5274afb17b49/0_0_3804_3044/master/3804.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=7063f166142a8219f493d8d1ad6460c4",N,,2026-01-17 17:57:12.441872

As protests escalated following the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, the Trump administration defended the agent and doubled down on its efforts in the Minneapolis area, sending in more resources.

Trump has also threatened to the extreme step of invoking the Insurrection Act to clamp down on the protests and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has suggested people may be asked to “validate their identity” in some cases.

Here are some of the most common questions, answered.

What is the Insurrection Act?

The law that Trump is threatening to invoke would allow him to deploy active-duty US troops to Minnesota as “necessary to enforce (US) laws or to suppress the rebellion.”

The law says the president can send troops to control situations they consider to be “unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of the United States.”

A state governor or legislature can also request troops — as was the case the last time the law was invoked in 1992 — but Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has openly rebuked the surge of federal activity in Minneapolis.

There is precedent of a president invoking the act without the support of a governor.

Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy both invoked the Insurrection Act against the wishes of governors in order to facilitate school integration after the Supreme Court’s landmark Brown v. Board of Education ruling.

On Friday, Trump said there’s no reason to use the Insurrection Act “right now,” but that he’d invoke the law if he felt it were necessary.

“I don’t think there’s any reason right now to use it, but if I needed it, I’d use it. It’s very powerful,” the president told reporters.

Read CNN’s Zachary B. Wolf’s analysis of the Insurrection Act here.

What authority has the Trump administration given to federal agents?

Immigration agents can use deadly force against someone who poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury, according to a DHS policy. Historically, federal law enforcement agencies have spent weeks or even months conducting exhaustive investigations before deciding whether an agent’s use of force was appropriate.

But Trump administration officials have rushed to offer full-throated defenses of immigration agents after high-profile use of force, raising questions about whether mechanisms meant to hold law enforcement accountable for wrongdoing have been abandoned in Trump’s second term, writes CNN’s Josh Campbell.

The administration has argued agents are immune to prosecution by state or local officials. And any federal prosecutions seem unlikely, Campbell writes, due to Trump’s installation of political loyalists atop the Justice Department and FBI.

In August, during the federal takeover of the Washington, DC, police department, Trump effectively gave law enforcement a green light to use force that may far outpace the severity of the circumstances, according to Campbell.

While lamenting images he claimed to have seen showing protesters spitting on officers, Trump said in August, “I said, ‘You tell them, “You spit, and we hit,”’ and they can hit real hard,” Trump said. “And they’re standing there, and people are spitting in their face, and they’re not allowed to do anything.”

“But now,” he added, “they are allowed to do whatever the hell they want.”

A similar carte blanche signal is being sent to ICE officers and other federal agencies assisting in Trump’s immigration crackdown, DOJ insiders have told CNN.

Read more of Campbell’s analysis on federal agents’ powers here.

Can federal agents ask to see proof of citizenship?

Noem said Thursday that federal agents may also ask people around someone they’re targeting to “validate their identity.”

“If we are on a target and doing an operation, there may be individuals surrounding that criminal that we may be asking who they are and why they’re there, and having them validate their identity,” Noem said. “That’s what we’ve always done.”

Is this legal? CNN’s senior legal analyst Elie Honig said, “It’s illegal and it’s unconstitutional to require people to show their citizenship papers without some other basis to make a stop.”

“What you cannot do is just go arbitrarily up to people or set up a checkpoint or go door to door and say, ‘Hey, you need to prove to us that you’re a US citizen,’” Honig added. “The immigration officer needs to have some reasonable suspicion. You cannot just arbitrarily approach people and make them prove that they are in fact here legally.”

Cori Alonso-Yoder, an associate professor at University of Maryland law school, told CNN federal agents can ask for proof of citizenship, but people can resist showing their documents under the Fifth Amendment.

“ICE certainly can ask and then the question is, then, how does an individual in that circumstance respond,” Yoder, who is also the director of the law school’s immigration clinic, said. “Because there are protections under the Fifth Amendment, regardless of immigration status, to not incriminate oneself or to again assert one’s right to remain silent when engaging with law enforcement.”

What is the 10th Amendment, which Minnesota has invoked to block federal agents?

On Monday, Minnesota filed a lawsuit seeking to curb the Trump administration’s ongoing immigration crackdown in the state, arguing that it violates the 10th Amendment.

Illinois has also filed a similar lawsuit.

Michele Goodwin, professor of constitutional law at Georgetown University, told CNN the 10th Amendment established that states retain sovereign power to make local laws and govern within their borders, and the federal government cannot impose its will over a state, unless that authority has been granted by Congress or the Constitution.

In its lawsuit, Minnesota emphasized strains on local police resources, asserting that Minneapolis and Saint Paul have been forced to divert officers from their usual duties to respond to incidents involving federal immigration enforcement, undermining local efforts to protect the community.

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said earlier this week that the state’s lawsuit is aimed squarely at what he described as unlawful federal overreach, not at blocking immigration enforcement itself.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2255776689.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-17 17:57:40.243693

The ruling by U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez prevents the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement from arresting or detaining people who are engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest including observing Operation Metro Surge, which is the feds’ name for the incursion of 3,000 immigration officers and agents here. The Reformer talked to a protester who was detained for hours on Sunday and never charged.

The federal agents can no longer use pepper spray or other nonlethal munitions against people engaged in peaceful protest. They cannot stop or detain drivers where there is no “reasonable, articulable suspicion” that they are interfering.

ICE observers are frequently following cars they suspect are being driven by federal officers, tracking them, entering vehicle descriptions into a database and discouraging them from making immigrant arrests. The judge declared this legal and a protected activity: “The act of safely following (federal agents) at an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop.”

The ruling comes out of a December lawsuit filed by six plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU.

The six named plaintiffs were all observing ICE last year as the agency ramped up raids in Minnesota, especially in the state’s large Somali community.

Susan Tincher, one of the named plaintiffs, pulled up to the scene of a reported ICE raid in north Minneapolis on Dec. 9 and exited her car. According to the lawsuit, she stood on the sidewalk six feet away from the nearest officer and asked the agents on the scene if they were ICE. The officers moved towards her, ordered her to “get back,” then pulled her to the ground. Officers handcuffed Tincher while she was face-down in the snow, according to video of the event reviewed by the Reformer.

“I was genuinely afraid I was being kidnapped,” Tincher said at a press conference last year.

The agents took Tincher to the Whipple Federal Building at Fort Snelling; shackled her legs; cut off her wedding ring, bra and boot laces; and held her in a cell for five hours before releasing her.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260107_661-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 18:58:10.364417

Lamentably, it is an historical fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily. Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us, groups tend to be more immoral than individuals. We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.” – Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., “Letter from a Birmingham Jail,” April 16, 1963

""Sometimes, we were learning, we had to hold hands and walk forward into the darkness, even when we didn't know what the next step would bring. Walking by faith wasn't easy. But it was taking us places where the rules of organizing had not allowed us to go. No one knew just what we were becoming, but we knew one thing for sure: there was no turning back.""

— Rev. Willam J. Barber, The Third Reconstruction

“I have told the clergy…that we may be entering into that same witness. And I've asked them to get their affairs in order—to make sure they have their wills written, because it may be that now is no longer the time for statements, but for us with our bodies to stand between the powers of this world and the most vulnerable. And it may mean that we are going to have to act in a new way…to put our faith in the God of life, of resurrection, of a love that is stronger than death itself.” – Bishop Rob Hirschfeld, Episcopal Diocese of NH, at a Concord vigil for Renee Nicole Good, January 9, 2026

January 17, 2026

Welcome to Martin Luther King weekend! Let us ground ourselves in the wisdom, courage and examples – past and present – of nonviolent and life-affirming movements for justice and peace. It will be nourishment for our spirits to be together at one or more of the many MLK community celebrations throughout the state. Here’s a good list (NHPR), and scroll down to the Events section for some highlights. We thank our friend Arnie Alpert for sharing the story with the NH Center for Justice & Equity of how NH people organized over decades (!) to establish this important holiday.

Read more about the statewide MLK Coalition’s celebration on Monday, January 19 in Manchester, where former NH Senator Melanie Levesque will receive the Martin Luther King award for her tireless leadership for voting rights, public education, and racial justice (read more here). NH Representative Alice Wade, a courageous champion for the rights of transgender people and civil rights for all, will receive the Vanessa Johnson Youth Award.

We were sad to learn last week of the passing of Claudette Colvin at the age of 86. At 15 years old, and already a student of active nonviolence, Claudette refused to give up her seat on the bus, nine months before Rosa Parks’ act of dignified defiance would launch the Montgomery bus boycott. “I felt like Sojourner Truth was pushing down on one shoulder and Harriet Tubman was pushing down on the other – saying. ‘Sit down girl!’ I was glued to my seat.” Read more about Claudette here. We at AFSC-NH have fond memories of welcoming Claudette to NH for our annual celebration back in 2009.

Strong opposition to death penalty bills

While last week’s public hearings on death penalty bills began in a chaotic fashion – due to an overscheduled daily calendar in the House Criminal Justice Committee, and outrageous speeches by bill sponsors – the messages delivered by members of the public to lawmakers were sacred testimonies of compassion, courage, and love. The most powerful voices were those of the family members of murder victims and other victims of violence – including the sisters and daughter of the late and beloved Renny Cushing, New England Yearly Meeting secretary Noah Merrill, NH Council of Churches executive director Lisa Beaudoin, and many others. Committee members also heard from Paul Hildwin, who was wrongfully convicted of murder and spent three decades on death row in Florida. Hear some of his story here (WMUR).

In addition, compelling testimony was provided about the extraordinary financial cost and complexity of the infrastructure and procedures for capital punishment, and the lack of deterrent effects. No one except bill sponsors spoke in favor of the bills.

You can listen to the hearings here: January 14 (starting at 5:48:30), and January 15. And you’ll find news coverage at NHPR and InDepthNH. We also want to lift up an op-ed from our NH Program Associate, Ophelia Burnett: “The death penalty is inhumane - the ultimate form of slavery.”

In related news, the NH Attorney General argued last week that the death penalty sentence in Michael Addison’s murder conviction is “not excessive, nor disproportionate.” Read more here. Michael Addison, an African-American man convicted in the 2006 shooting death of police officer Michael Briggs, is still on death row in NH despite the 2019 repeal.

ICE activity expands in NH

Approximately 45 people gathered at the Strafford County jail in Dover on Friday in a vigil of solidarity with the family of Oscar Gutierrez Cardona, an immigrant who is being sent to Honduras this week, a place he fled many years ago in order to save his life. Oscar’s deportation leaves his wife and children without a beloved husband and father, and leaves the Manchester community he called home to mourn his absence and the injustice of his removal. Read more here and here. We are heartbroken, angry, and committed to continuing our resistance to the cruelty and violence of detention and deportation.

We’re frustrated to report that another NH town – Auburn – has signed a 287g agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), enabling more law enforcement collusion with the violent and often lawless actions of ICE. Auburn’s decision brings the number of NH law enforcement agencies with 287g agreements to 13, and to 14 in all of New England, a shameful tally. Read more here, and learn more about the efforts of our indefatigable colleagues at ACLU-NH to obtain the training materials 287g participants. New Hampshire people have a right to know how our locally funded law enforcement agencies will be ‘prepared’ to participate in the federal government’s mass deportation machine.

And one more bit of grim news on the immigration front – it appears that a site may have been secured for the rumored ICE “processing center” planned for Merrimack, NH, although local officials are still unwilling to confirm the news. Read more here. As many who testified last week in support of HB 1609, a commonsense bill that would prohibit the use of state or local funds for immigration detention, explained, there’s no good reason for local or state dollars to support a massively over-funded federal operation, especially in a state facing a “grim” budget picture. Read more here. Not to mention the moral arguments against our participation.

Friday, January 23 - Protect Death Penalty Repeal!

This means we have more time to sign in to oppose these bills, contact the committee, and share testimony. Here are the details for how to take action: Show up in person to sign-in in opposition and submit your written testimony, or sign-in remotely, no later than midnight on January 23, to OPPOSE the three bills – HB 1749, reinstating the death penalty for murder offenses; HB 1413, reinstituting the death penalty in cases of capital murder; and HB 1737, relative to reinstating the death penalty for certain offenses against minors under 13 years of age.

There is also a strong and inspiring wave of resistance. Come learn more about the work in NH to disrupt ICE activities and how you can help. Presenters are Maggie Fogarty, AFSC-NH, and Megan Chapman, World Fellowship Center.

“A House of Dynamite” film discussion – 7 PM, on Zoom. Hosted by NH Peace Action and Back from the Brink. The current administration's plans to renew nuclear weapons testing is one alarming reminder that the threat of nuclear war is still a very real concern. “A House of Dynamite” is an apocalyptic political thriller that gives us a view of the devastating anticipation of a nuclear attack. Get drawn into the nerve-wracking decision rooms as this unsettling picture shows us what could become our future if the right choices are not made today. Watch the film (on Netflix) and then join us on zoom for a discussion about this film and what actions we can take now. Jeremy Love of Back from the Brink will lead the discussion to help us find a sense of purpose instead of hopelessness. Before watching the movie, we recommend you take a look at Back from the Brink's Beginner's Guide to Nuclear Weapons. Accessing the film: If you are not able to access this movie on your own, but would like to be a part of this discussion, let us know (info@nhpeaceaction.org). If there are enough people who need access to the movie, we will attempt to connect people to watch the movie together. As you watch the movie, think about how you feel about the threat of nuclear war, what you think is realistic considering the actions of current world leaders, and how you feel life would change after a nuclear attack.

Wearing a neon green vest and equipped with a whistle and walkie-talkie, Brown, an 81-year-old retired lawyer who lives nearby, kept his head on a swivel. His eyes were taking in each passing car and pedestrian near the campus as he stood ready to sound the alarm should federal immigration personnel approach the school, which teaches in English and Spanish and is around the corner from the spot where Good died.

""I never did like bullies, and that's what the federal government has become,"" Brown said, explaining why an octogenarian stood outside for four hours in -2 degrees Fahrenheit with wind chill (-19 Celsius). ""What's happening in my city is nothing more than authoritarian intimidation, and me and my neighbors are not going to put up with it.""

PARENTS PATROL SCHOOLS

The Trump administration has deployed about 3,000 federal agents across the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, making it the latest region targeted by the president's mass deportation program. People who normally might be organizing parent-teacher association meetings are arranging security patrols at their kids' schools to watch for immigration agents.

Some parents not on patrol are escorting foreign-born teachers or staff members, driving them to and from their homes and schools to make them feel safer. Others are delivering groceries and prescription medicines to immigrant families who are too afraid to leave their homes or send their kids to class.

U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat representing Minnesota, said on Friday she had met with school principals from her state ""and heard horror stories of kids and parents 'under siege' by ICE.""

""Little kids scared. Dangerous encounters. This is no longer about a fraud investigation,"" Klobuchar wrote on social media, as she urged residents to remain peaceful.

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE and the Border Patrol, said this week more than 2,500 people have been arrested during the effort that officials have dubbed Operation Metro Surge. DHS has repeatedly said its agents are not targeting schools.

“ICE is not going to schools to arrest children — we are protecting children,"" said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement. ""Criminals are no longer able to hide in America’s schools to avoid arrest. The Trump Administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement and instead trusts them to use common sense. If a dangerous illegal alien felon were to flee into a school, or a child sex offender is working as an employee, there may be a situation where an arrest is made to protect public safety. But this has not happened.""

But parents and school leaders say otherwise.

A spokesperson for Saint Paul Public Schools said in a statement that two of its contracted student transportation vans were pulled over by ICE agents this week. Several schools and daycare centers have emailed parents to notify them of teachers and staff who have been detained, according to school leaders and parents.

SOME STUDENTS LEARNING ONLINE

Schools have notified the public that some parents have been detained at bus stops after dropping off kids. Border Patrol agents clashed with protesters on the grounds of Roosevelt High School in Minneapolis as classes ended, just a few hours after Good was shot and killed. DHS said the clash followed agents' pursuit of someone who had rammed one of their vehicles several miles away and fled to the school grounds.

Several school districts — including those in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the state's two largest — have cancelled classes some days and are allowing students to learn online instead of attending classes in person for the next several weeks in response to the immigration operations.

“Many families in my area are afraid to send their kids to school because ICE is staking out our bus stops,” state Representative Carlie Kotyza-Witthuhn, a Democrat and co-chair of the Minnesota House of Representatives' Children and Families Finance and Policy Committee, told the Star Tribune newspaper.

Nate Byrne, a spokesperson for Kids Count on Us, a coalition of 500 community-based childcare centers in Minnesota, said it is receiving daily reports about ICE officers on or near childcare center grounds, and that such centers in immigrant-heavy neighborhoods have seen a 50% reduction in attendance.

Kids Count on Us has received reports of childcare workers taken into ICE custody, Byrne said, though he did not have specific figures.

PARENTS DELIVER FOOD, RAISE MONEY

""Parents who are not fearful of being detained by ICE — typically because they are white — are forming teams to patrol outside their childcare centers during drop-off and pick-up and when staff need to come and go,"" Byrne said. ""Parents who are fearful of being detained by ICE due to the color of their skin are being extremely cautious.""

St. Paul parent Kelly, who spoke on the condition that her last name not be used, citing fears of retribution from the federal government, said she was helping deliver food to immigrant families that attend her children's school but were afraid to leave their homes. Parents are also raising money to help pay rent for the families across the metro area, as the parents are missing work, according to Kelly and other parents.

Kelly, who was attending a Friday night protest against ICE with her husband and two children, ages 6 and 9, said she was bewildered by what has become of her city amid the immigration raids. In years past, she volunteered for parent-teacher association events. Now, she carries a whistle everywhere she goes and said she is ready to confront federal agents if they approach her kids' school.

""There's no parenting handbook for this,"" Kelly said. ""My parents never had to sit me down and explain that my classmates who are suddenly missing from school aren't there because their parents are afraid of being snatched by the government.""

Local advocates say they're working to balance the need for an urgent response to good-faith reports of ICE activity, with making efforts to verify initial reports when possible.
The increase in Rapid Response reports indicates ""there’s heightened interest in protecting our neighbors,"" Roberts said.
""I'd rather falsely assume someone is ICE than falsely assume that they’re not ICE,"" said Maggie Carswell, a Tucson community organizer.
Carrasco said she's been heartened by the swell of support for Derechos Humanos and groups working to monitor and observe ICE activity here.","The phones at Sunnyside High School were ringing with calls from concerned parents on Thursday afternoon, as false reports of immigration agents on campus spread on social media, school officials said.

In fact, Sunnyside High and Los Amigos Elementary went into a precautionary ""soft lockdown"" Thursday — with the perimeter gates locked, but classes still in session — due to a nearby law enforcement operation on Tucson's south side.

Immigration agents were never on campus, and students were not at risk, said Marisela Felix, school district spokesperson.

The incident was one of several incorrect social-media reports of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity in Tucson in recent weeks.

Amid the federal government's violent crackdown in Minneapolis, and reports of an impending escalation of ICE enforcement in Phoenix, anxiety is surging among Tucson's immigrant and advocacy communities, advocates say.

Some false rumors have circulated online, and there's been an increase in reports of ICE sightings — some valid, some false alarms — to the local ""Rapid Response"" network, which sends trained observers to bear witness to potential ICE arrests.

Local advocates say they're working to balance the need for an urgent response to good-faith reports of ICE activity, with making efforts to verify initial reports when possible.

It's hard to say if there's been a true surge in ICE activity here this month, or if heightened awareness is leading to more reports, some volunteers say. But likely it's both, said Sarah Roberts, an immigrant-rights advocate and volunteer with Tucson's Coalición de Derechos Humanos, or Human Rights Coalition.

ICE is definitely active in Tucson, Roberts said, noting the hotline got a call Tuesday from a woman who said her husband had just been arrested by ICE and was seeking legal help.

Photos shared Friday by a Facebook user show three agents, wearing green vests that say, ""POLICE/ICE,"" at the Tucson Spectrum shopping center on West Irvington Road.

The increase in Rapid Response reports indicates ""there’s heightened interest in protecting our neighbors,"" Roberts said. ""That's a good thing.""

Immigration agents carry out arrests quickly and are often gone before observers with Rapid Response can arrive; advocates don't want community members to hesitate to report possible ICE activity for fear of making an incorrect report.

""I'd rather falsely assume someone is ICE than falsely assume that they’re not ICE,"" said Maggie Carswell, a Tucson community organizer.

Still, there's a real risk of burnout for activists and members of the immigrant community, who are often in a sustained state of hyper-vigilance, Roberts said. There's also a risk of ""secondary trauma"" from witnessing enforcement actions, she said.

Sunnyside officials are encouraging members of the public to be prudent about what they share online, as unverified rumors can cause unnecessary stress and confusion.

""False rumors have been circulating on social media claiming that 'ICE was at Sunnyside High School.' This is not true,"" Felix said in a Thursday email. ""We ask parents and our community to be part of the solution, and to be aware of the serious consequences of resharing information on social media that is not reliable and from a verified source.""

Local officials have been trying to prepare the public for a possible deployment of National Guard or other federal authorities to the area, though no such deployment has been announced.

ICE's media team has not responded to the Arizona Daily Star’s query about whether more ICE agents will soon be sent to Phoenix or Tucson.

Tucson Mayor Regina Romero directed city staff to create a website to help members of the public know their rights and prepare for potential encounters with federal agents.

Pima County Attorney Laura Conover urged Tucson residents to stay calm during interactions with federal agents and during protest activity.

""Here in Pima County, we expect our community members and our own local police to be safe from recklessness,"" Conover said in a written statement Monday. ""And to that end, I am urging our community not to meet recklessness with more recklessness. We must be smart and fight fire, not with more fire but with water. ... We must move in ways that are wise and pray that keeps us all alive.""

Operation on the south side

The law-enforcement operation near Sunnyside Thursday was led by the U.S. Marshals Service, part of the Arizona ""Wanted"" Task Force that targets violent offenders, U.S. Deputy Marshal Mindy Miller told the Star. The task force comprises local, state and federal agencies.

Border Patrol agents were present at the scene, near the intersection of South Campbell Avenue and Drexel, Miller said.

The Jan. 15 operation targeted Jorge Cardenas-Valencia, who is in the U.S. illegally and was wanted in Pima County on multiple criminal counts: transport of narcotic drugs for sale, misconduct involving weapons in the commission of a drug offense, use of wire communication in the commission of a drug offense, conspiracy, illegally conducting an enterprise and misconduct involving weapons of a prohibited possessor, Miller said in an email.

Maria Carrasco, a leader in Derechos Humanos and Rapid Response, was among those who responded to the scene of the south-side operation before details were known.

Rapid Response has been receiving dozens of calls each day, and Carrasco said she's trying to personally respond to as many reports as she can.

""We are all stressed like crazy. There's 10 of us answering the phone. I had more than 20 calls on my phone today,"" she said Thursday.

Carrasco said she's been heartened by the swell of support for Derechos Humanos and groups working to monitor and observe ICE activity here.

A recent training session for new volunteers was ""a full house,"" Carrasco said. That's good news, she said, because current volunteers are stretched thin.

""We have to be careful because we’re going to get burned out,"" she said. ""I'm very proud the community is coming together with one voice to protect our families and our community. ... I'm very hopeful that we’re going to change this government to the right side.""

Since the Jan. 7 fatal shooting of Minneapolis mother Renee Good by an ICE agent, some advocates are newly fearing for their own lives and safety, said Lucia Vindiola, a volunteer with the Coalición de Derechos Humanos.

""There is that concern: If I continue, am I going to die? How far are Trump and ICE and immigration (authorities) going to go with all of this?"" said Vindiola, a seventh-generation Tucsonan, who said her family lived here before Arizona was part of the United States.

ICE's actions, such as wearing face masks, undermine trust in law enforcement broadly, harming public safety by discouraging people from reporting crime, advocates say.

""They don't know who to trust,"" Vindiola said. ""ICE covers up their faces like criminals. Why is that happening? Why are they not behaving like law enforcement agents, with their name tags and actual badges?""

Vindiola leads the emotional-support committee within Derechos Humanos, which holds art therapy sessions for kids and adolescents and offers therapy for adults.

The group is organizing a series of ""healing circle"" events, starting this weekend. The event — invite-only, for now — aims to help volunteers cope with the pressures they're facing, and find ways to manage stress in a sustainable way, she said.

""We are stressing out so much, and we need to be able to have a way to heal our own psyche, to heal our own energy,"" she said. ""We're trying to take care of our emotional health, as well.""
