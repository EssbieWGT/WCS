Last month, 50 people rushed to a church, where the congregation was trapped, having got word that there were ICE agents waiting outside.
Earlier this month, the Protect Rogers Park group got 1,500 calls in a day.
But I only know about Rogers Park from Criminal, a true-crime podcast.
Bizarre as that is, it’s not why the story of Rogers Park, and the storytelling of Protect Rogers Park, is universally relevant.","Earlier this year, the Trump administration reversed the convention that nobody would be snatched by immigration and customs enforcement, or ICE, by a school, church or hospital. Since then, teachers have reported classrooms a third empty, as parents are too scared to send their kids in – volunteers walk them there and back.

In the Rogers Park area of Chicago, a group of citizens are organising to resist such immigration raids. Sometimes, it’s simple non-violent tactics, such as slowing officers down by walking in front of them. Last month, 50 people rushed to a church, where the congregation was trapped, having got word that there were ICE agents waiting outside. Maybe their most evocative tactic is whistles – coded blasts for when a convoy is suspected to be ICE agents, a different code when it’s confirmed. They have numerous accounts of undocumented migrants warned off driving right into a raid, which is galvanising, but they also see and hear dismaying things all the time: vehicles standing empty, one door open, not robbed, merely relieved of their drivers; landscape gardeners arrested off ladders. Earlier this month, the Protect Rogers Park group got 1,500 calls in a day.

This isn’t unusual; people don’t like it when their neighbours are disappeared. Similar stories could be told about Kenmore Street, Glasgow, or Peckham, in London, where neighbours surrounded Home Office vans until they were forced to release their cargo and head home.

But I only know about Rogers Park from Criminal, a true-crime podcast. It’s been running for more than a decade, and covers crimes that range from the macabre to the peculiar – always introduced with the same disconcerting intonation, the host announcing “I’m Phoebe Judge” with the kind of pride and pizzazz you might use for “I’m Mr Invisible”. But who, in this episode, is the criminal?

It’s plain from the start that she is not talking about the whistleblowers, and yet it still takes a while for your brain to catch up: she has got to mean the federal government. This is a huge thing to imply, only secondarily because Trump is notoriously litigious, particularly against media organisations. First and foremost, it’s a terrifying thing to articulate: if your government is breaking the law, what do laws mean? Can any be relied upon once some are breached? How do you tell the difference between living in such a society and hiding in it? In this, and a number of other episodes, Criminal is forensic, sober, but also quite unusual: a norm has settled over the reporting of ICE, where all the facts are laid out – raw numbers, painful details, the state of detention centres – except the central one, that people are being kidnapped.

Hannah Arendt discussed the term Gleichschaltung, roughly translatable as “coordination” or “synchronisation”. It came from the Nazi justice minister Franz Gürtner to mean, broadly, that all political, social, cultural and civic institutions had to fall in line with the totalitarian state. Such a thing can only be achieved with the complicity of everyone: the minute-by-minute decisions of people who will do anything, personally or professionally, to stay with the majority. It might mean turning a blind eye to unacceptable state actions, or it might mean insisting, with the logic of your arguments, that things are still the same when they plainly are not.

This is the trap many Democrats are currently in – they produce pie charts to show that the majority of immigrants snatched off the streets are not criminals, but they do not say that to detain 65,000 people is an authoritarian act. And this is partly a boiling-frog effect: ICE has been in existence since 2003, introduced by George W Bush after 9/11; Barack Obama was no stranger to deportations; that uptick of detainees may break records, and the sheer activity of ICE across the US is running communities ragged, but there were nearly 40,000 migrants in detention when Donald Trump took office in January. Nobody gets a memo when democracy tips into something else.

But it’s not all avoidance: most people prefer to synchronise, to stick with the majority. The anthropologist Michael Maccoby, writing in The Leaders We Need almost 20 years ago, drew on the research of Erich Fromm from 1930s Germany, and summarised quite bluntly that, as Fromm predicted, only about 15% of people resisted nazism. It wasn’t because they were fervent supporters, or even, at the outset, because they were scared, but because that’s where the herd was.

The US is currently trying to export its anti-migrant agenda. The New York Times reported on a bizarre set of documents in which Marco Rubio tells diplomats in Europe to “regularly engage host governments … to raise US concerns about violent crimes associated with people of a migration background”. Bizarre as that is, it’s not why the story of Rogers Park, and the storytelling of Protect Rogers Park, is universally relevant.

Don’t wait until your government is so racist that it’s lifting people off ladders while they are trying to work, or seizing kids as they are trying to get to school, before you protest. Every time you hear aggressive xenophobia and racist insinuation from those in power and check in with how it polled before you say it’s disgusting, you are building the herd that will suffocate opposition when it matters.

In an event this autumn, Olly Knowles from Led By Donkeys said “The time to fight fascism isn’t five to midnight”, going on to say that he didn’t think we were at five to midnight in the UK. Someone in the audience said “What time is it?”, and it was funny because, really, who can say? It’s quite impressionistic, this metaphor, it’s not what you would call digital. But it’s the question to ask with each fresh wave of anti-migrant policy, and rhetoric, and kite-flying, and debate: what time does that make it? Because five to midnight is too late.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7ac510825001e5bfe7c54ab6f590c6c31139f5d/511_0_4503_3602/master/4503.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=c4833d2f320374dc340a77a95a28dc91",N,,2025-11-29 15:56:52.124072
,Human Rights,2025-11-29 20:31:57+00:00,Los Angeles Times,School enrollment drops amid ICE raids. 'We just don't know what happened to them.',"Howard Blume, Kate Payne, www.latimes.com, howard-blume",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-11-29/school-enrollment-plummets-lausd-amid-trump-immigration-raids,"The drop also reflects the lack of non-U.S.-born students, or “newcomers,” entering the nation’s public school systems.
How Los Angeles Unified is affected In the L.A. Unified School District, enrollment overall is down just over 4% compared with last year.
Newcomers are defined as non-U.S.-born students enrolled for three or fewer years in any U.S. school.
Widespread effect on newcomer students In San Diego, Principal Fernando Hernandez has enrolled dozens of newcomer students from across Latin America over the last couple of years.
Outside Chicago, Waukegan Community Unit School District 60 signed up 100 fewer new immigrant students.","Last school year, this Roybal Learning Center junior was doing well and making excellent grades. This year, as a senior, she’s almost dropped out several times and has talked of leaving the U.S. and reuniting with her mother, who was deported over the summer to Guatemala.

So far, the girl has remained in school, says teacher Guadalupe Carrasco Cardona. But many students in similar situations have not.

Across the nation, immigration raids and border restrictions have led to a drop in K-12 enrollment that appears to number in at least the tens of thousands, affecting Los Angeles, San Diego, Miami and elsewhere, based on figures provided by school district officials. The drop also reflects the lack of non-U.S.-born students, or “newcomers,” entering the nation’s public school systems.

For students who had already been attending U.S. schools, the decline is an indicator of disrupted learning — and, in some school districts, financial shortfalls.

“These declines reflect a climate of fear and instability created by ongoing immigration crackdowns, which disrupt family stability, housing and mobility,” said L.A. schools Supt. Alberto Carvalho. “When families are afraid to be seen, or when they cannot afford to remain in their communities, they are less likely to enroll, reenroll, or stay in public schools.”

At Roybal, just west of downtown L.A., there are at least 200 fewer students than anticipated, said Cardona, who teaches ethnic studies and serves as coordinator for a film and television magnet program. Before this year, she said, programs at the school had a waiting list.

“We’re not too sure if some students are sheltering in place, if they’re working, or if they got deported or self-deported,” Cardona said. “We’ve done our best to help them with resources but with a lot of the kiddos, we just don’t know what happened to them.”

Neither the U.S. Department of Education nor the Department of Homeland Security — which are charged with enforcing Trump administration education and immigration policy — responded immediately to a request for comment.

How Los Angeles Unified is affected

In the L.A. Unified School District, enrollment overall is down just over 4% compared with last year. This it is about 2% more than a projection based on factors other than immigration enforcement.

Carvalho said fears in immigrant communities “are now exacerbating preexisting factors that were already driving statewide enrollment declines — including falling birth rates, rising housing costs and broader economic pressures.”

In a school system with nearly 400,000 students, the difference this year between the anticipated decline and the actual decline is more than 7,000 students.

An indicator that speaks to the effect of immigration enforcement is the number of “newcomer” students.

Newcomers are defined as non-U.S.-born students enrolled for three or fewer years in any U.S. school. This is an educational category, not an indication of whether a student resides legally in the country. California schools do not collect information about legal status — and a 1982 Supreme Court decision protects the right of immigrant children to receive a public education.

In 2023-24, L.A. Unified had 21,997 newcomers by the end of the school year, accounting for 5.2% of students. The end-of-year total for last year was 19,110 students — 4.7% of total enrollment and a decrease of 2,887 from the previous year.

At that point, President Trump had been in office for about six months — with a surge in immigration raids in Los Angeles spiking in June.

The enrollment trend continued this fall, with recent data showing an additional decline of 1,768 newcomers, bringing their enrollment to 17,342 and reducing newcomers to 4.4% of total enrollment.

“While newcomers have historically been a vibrant and growing part of our school communities, their enrollment has declined significantly over the past three years, with year-over-year decreases that mirror the uncertainty many families are living through,” Carvalho said.

The mother of the Roybal student was detained during a summer raid at the Vernon factory where she worked and then quickly deported, Cardona said. The student is staying with relatives and, with support from the school, remains in classes. But she also has to help care for two younger siblings and feels pressure to get a job.

“It’s distressing to us when she says that she’s going to have to drop out of school,” Cardona said. “It’s obvious that she is good at it and works hard at it, but she’s just preoccupied with ensuring that there’s funds so her siblings can reunite with her mom.”

District data suggest that many newcomers who were expected to return have not done so.

At the end of the 2024–25 school year, after accounting for graduates and families known to have relocated, 18,232 newcomer students were enrolled and expected to return this fall. Of these, 16,668 returned, 8.5% lower than anticipated.

Widespread effect on newcomer students

In San Diego, Principal Fernando Hernandez has enrolled dozens of newcomer students from across Latin America over the last couple of years. Many made the treacherous journey through the jungles of the Darien Gap before setting up camp in a park near the Perkins K-8 school.

About a third of students at the school are homeless. Staffers have become experts on supporting kids who are facing adversity.

But so far this school year, he hasn’t enrolled a single newcomer. Other families did not return when the new school year began. Overall, the district’s enrollment is on par with last year’s, according to a spokesperson. But at Hernandez’s school, the change is noticeable.

In Florida’s Miami-Dade County Public Schools — formerly led by Carvalho — about 2,550 students have entered the district from another country so far this school year — down from nearly 14,000 last year, and more than 20,000 the year before that. School board member Luisa Santos, who attended district schools, said the trend is “a sad reality.”

“I was one of those arrivals when I was 8 years old,” Santos said. “And this country and our public schools — I’ll never get tired of saying it — gave me everything.”

Collectively, the enrollment declines in Miami-Dade erased about $70 million from the district’s budget, forcing administrators to scramble to cover the unexpected shortfall.

In northern Alabama, Albertville City Schools Supt. Bart Reeves said the district’s newcomer academy at a local high school hasn’t been enrolling any new students. Reeves’ district is home to one of Alabama’s largest Latino student populations, about 60% of all students.

Reeves said he expects the hit to his budget from enrollment declines will cost him about 12 teacher positions.

Denver Public Schools enrolled 400 new-to-country students in the summer, compared with 1,500 during the previous summer. Outside Chicago, Waukegan Community Unit School District 60 signed up 100 fewer new immigrant students. The Houston Independent School District shuttered the Las Americas Newcomer School, a program dedicated to children who are new to the U.S., after its enrollment fell to 21 students from 111 last year.

In California, the financial effect of enrollment decreases are expected to hit hardest in later years. But unexpected enrollment losses can immediately force schools to reduce their teaching staff and combine classes a month or more into the school year.

Missing 200 students in Inglewood

At the Inglewood Unified School District, about 200 of the newest newcomers did not show up as anticipated, a drop of more than 50% in a school system with about 6,000 students.

In 2023-24, Inglewood Unified enrolled 391 students living in the U.S. a year or less. The following year that number was 312. This year the number is 109.

As with L.A. Unified, the Inglewood district had planned for declining enrollment, but the drop was steeper than expected.

“I’m really worried about those 200 kids who aren’t here,” said Inglewood Supt. Jim Morris. “That really is alarming data.”

For the students in school, overall district attendance has improved slightly, part of a districtwide push to get all students to class more often.

“It’s critically important that students and families know that the school is a place that they can trust, that the school is a place where they’re safe, and that the school is a place where whatever needs they have — we’re going to do our best to meet those needs,” Morris said.

In L.A. Unified similar efforts are underway, including at Roybal, where a few students are being picked up by bus directly from home to quell fears over ongoing immigration enforcement.

“Our responsibility is to ensure every child — regardless of where they were born — feels safe in our schools,” Carvalho said. “We will continue to stand firmly with our immigrant communities and protect every student’s right to a welcoming, stable and supportive education.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c2b81a1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3528+0+476/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb3%2F75%2Ff1f0558b4cce9a5f4e7c9c0e8798%2Fla-photos-1staff-464309-me-0829-csu-math-10-cmc.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 16:57:09.348333

The initiative was in place for around one year before shifting to a longer-term program called Operation Enduring Welcome.
Flores said the system has worked across administrations: ""You may hear people say, 'Well, he was granted asylum under Trump.
However, he says it is now unclear if their application will move forward or if their interview will take place.
He said he thought he could use his experience working as a defense attorney in Afghanistan to contribute to American society.","The Trump administration is promising an even tougher anti-immigration agenda after an Afghan national was being charged in the shooting this week of two National Guard members, with new restrictions targeting the tens of thousands of Afghans resettled in the U.S. and those seeking to come, many of whom served alongside American soldiers in the two-decade war.

But those still waiting to come were already facing stricter measures as part of President Donald Trump's sweeping crackdown on legal and illegal migration that began when he started his second term in January. And the Afghan immigrants living in the U.S. and now in the administration's crosshairs were among the most extensively vetted, often undergoing years of security screening, experts and advocates say.

The suspected shooter, who worked with the CIA during the Afghanistan War, ""was vetted both before he landed, probably once he landed, once he applied for asylum,"" said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute. ""But more importantly, he was almost certainly vetted extensively and much more by the CIA.""

Haris Tarin, a former U.S. official who worked on the Biden-era program that resettled Afghans, predicted that ""as the investigation unfolds, you will see that this is not a failure of screening. This is a failure of us not being able to integrate — not just foreign intelligence and military personnel — but our own veterans, over the past 25 years.""

The program Operations Allies Welcome initially brought roughly 76,000 Afghans to the United States, many of whom had worked alongside American troops and diplomats as interpreters and translators. The initiative was in place for around one year before shifting to a longer-term program called Operation Enduring Welcome. Almost 200,000 Afghans have been resettled in the U.S. under both programs.

Among those brought to the U.S. under the program was the alleged shooter, 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who now faces a first-degree murder charge in the death of 20-year-old Specialist Sarah Beckstrom. The other National Guard member who was shot, 24-year-old Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, remains in critical condition.

Those resettlements are now on hold. The State Department has temporarily stopped issuing visas for all people traveling on Afghan passports, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced late Friday on X.

The shooting sparks anti-immigrant rhetoric

Trump and his allies have seized on the shooting to criticize gaps in the U.S. vetting process and the speed of admissions, even though some Republicans spent the months and years after the 2021 withdrawal criticizing the Biden administration for not moving fast enough to approve some applications from Afghan allies.

CIA Director John Ratcliffe said Lakanwal ""should have never been allowed to come here,"" Trump called lax migration policies ""the single greatest national security threat facing our nation,"" and Vice President JD Vance said Biden's policy was ""opening the floodgate to unvetted Afghan refugees.""

That rhetoric quickly turned into policy announcements, with Trump saying he would ""permanently pause all migration"" from a list of nearly 20 countries, ""terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions,"" and ""remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States."" Many of these changes had already been set in motion through a series of executive orders over the past 10 months, including most recently in June.

""They are highlighting practices that were already going into place,"" said Andrea Flores, a lawyer who was an immigration policy adviser in the Obama and Biden administrations.

Lakanwal applied for asylum during the Biden administration, and his request was approved in April of this year after undergoing a thorough vetting, according to #AfghanEvac, a group that helps resettle Afghans who assisted the U.S. during the war.

Flores said the system has worked across administrations: ""You may hear people say, 'Well, he was granted asylum under Trump. This is Trump's problem.' That's not how our immigration system works. It relies on the same bedding. No asylum laws have really been changed by Congress.""

Afghans in the US fearful for their status

Trump and other U.S. officials have used the attack to demand a re-examination for everyone who came to the U.S. from Afghanistan, a country he called ""a hellhole on Earth"" on Thursday.

""These policies were already creating widespread disruption and fear among lawfully admitted families. What's new and deeply troubling is the attempt to retroactively tie all of this to one act of violence in a way that casts suspicion on entire nationalities, including Afghan allies who risked their lives to protect our troops,"" Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Global Refuge, said in a statement Friday.

This has left the nearly 200,000 Afghans who are currently living across the U.S. in deep fear and shame over the actions of one person in their community. Those in the U.S. are now worrying about their legal status being revoked, while others in the immigration pipeline here and abroad are waiting in limbo.

Nesar, a 22-year-old Afghan who arrived in America weeks after the fall of Kabul, said he had just begun to assimilate into life in the U.S. when the attack happened on Wednesday. He agreed to speak to The Associated Press on condition that only his first name be used for fear of reprisals or targeting by immigration officials.

""Life was finally getting easier for me. I've learned to speak English. I found a better job,"" he said. ""But after this happened two days ago, I honestly went to the grocery store this morning, and I was feeling so uncomfortable among all of those people. I was like, maybe they're now looking at me the same way as the shooter.""

Two days before the shooting, Nesar and his father, who worked for the Afghan president during the war, had received an interview date of Dec. 13 for their green card application, a moment he said they had been working toward for four years. However, he says it is now unclear if their application will move forward or if their interview will take place.

Another Afghan national, who also spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, said that after fearing for his life under Taliban rule, he felt a sense of peace and hope when he finally received a special immigrant visa to come to the U.S. two years ago.

He said he thought he could use his experience working as a defense attorney in Afghanistan to contribute to American society. But now, he says the actions of an ""extremist who, despite benefiting from the safety and livelihood provided by this country, ungratefully attacked two American soldiers,"" he and other Afghans will once again face scrutiny.

""It seems that whenever a terrorist commits a crime, its shadow falls upon me simply because I am from Afghanistan,"" he added.

David Bier:

Well, first of all, this was a horrific attack. No one condones it. This is an individual who should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

Unfortunately, what the president has taken away from this attack is that all of 53 million, as he says, immigrants to the United States, legal or illegal, are now seen as suspicious, as people who should be driven out of the United States, even denaturalized.

If you look at the rhetoric in that post, he can't find a single good thing to say about any of the immigrants from any country in the world. And that's really what's different.

But this was really the broadest attack that I can remember on the immigrant population overall, both legal and illegal, even the naturalized citizens who have taken the oath to the Constitution of the United States.

Liz Landers:

Trump's post had a series of pledged reforms, including, but not limited to a permanent pause on migration from all Third World countries. We heard that a few moments ago.

Remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States. End all federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens and denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility.

How much of that can he follow through on?

David Bier:

Well, certainly, he's already trying to carry out the largest mass deportation campaign in the history of the United States. He wants to deport millions and millions of people who are here illegally.

So now he's just adding to that campaign promise with trying to deport people who are in the country legally. Now, taking away someone who has illegal permanent residence, their status, is quite difficult. You have to prove your case against them. You have to bring that before an immigration judge and layout exactly what immigration law they violated.

And what he's talking about here, net asset, all this stuff, there is some ambiguity in the law, but there's not that much ambiguity, and it will be difficult for him to actually follow through on that promise and effectively deport most of the legal immigrants in the United States.

Liz Landers:

The treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, is saying that his agency is going to issue proposed regulations clarifying that the refunded portions of certain individual income tax benefits are no longer available to illegal and other non-qualified aliens.

What benefits do those without legal status receive? And do we know whether what Bessent posted about will have any substantial impact?

David Bier:

Usually, these benefits are based on the Social Security numbers that are available to them. So, you submit your application for benefits along with your income tax return, checking that box that you have a Social Security number that is work-eligible, which is the basis for the refund or otherwise.

So I certainly support this type of proposal in terms of policy. Unfortunately, Congress is the one who sets the rules for this, and they just went through this tax reform bill that they put forward and they didn't go all the way with this idea effectively barring most noncitizens from those.

And so really what he's advocating for is Congress to change the law. We will see if that happens.

Liz Landers:

What trends have we seen in immigration recently? And what impact could these changes that we're seeing from the president being proposed, what could those have — impact on these immigration trends we're seeing?

David Bier:

Well, ultimately, the president's proposals from day one have been to restrict legal immigration. He's come out with a number of different ideas on those lines, including the total shutdown of the refugee program, a ban on most immigration from 19 different countries, restrictions on the H-1B high-skilled visa.

So, across all the different categories of immigration that we have, he's looking to restrict. This is the first time he's said an outright ban. And when you think about who gets most legal immigrant visas to come to the United States, it is spouses of U.S. citizens.

That's going to be the number one category that's targeted by a broad-based absolute ban on legal immigration to the United States. And that's really cutting at the heart of family values and a lot of the other things that conservatives like to talk about.

In those cases, the United States has no basis to assume the risk at all.
These are hybrid-threat network-driven movements that the United States cannot map, measure, or vet.","A day after two National Guard soldiers were shot, one fatally, in a “barbaric terrorist attack” in Washington, DC, President Trump declared that the United States will “permanently pause migration from all Third World countries”. The announcement landed just days after the US State Department issued an unprecedented statement, explaining that “mass migration poses an existential threat to Western civilization and undermines the stability of key American allies.”

Under new guidance, US embassies must now report the human-rights impacts of mass migration on receiving nations. These include crime waves, terror attacks, sexual assault patterns, community displacement, political retaliation against citizens who oppose mass migration, and two-tiered justice systems emerging for illegal immigrant offenders. This is a historic reframing. For the first time, mass migration is formally recognised as a human-rights issue for host societies, and sovereign governments are acknowledged to have the right — and obligation — to protect their people.

The suspected DC attacker, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, arrived in the US during the 2021 Kabul evacuation under Operation Allies Welcome and was granted asylum in April 2025 after claiming he had served alongside American forces in Kandahar. That credential was accepted as sufficient proof that he posed no threat.

Clearly, he did. As National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) Director Joe Kent put it: “It is true that the terrorist who conducted the attack in D.C. was ‘vetted’ by the intelligence community, however he was only vetted to serve as a soldier to fight against the Taliban, AQ, & ISIS IN Afghanistan.” Kent went on: “He was NOT vetted for his suitability to come to America and live among us as a neighbor, integrate into our communities, or eventually become an American citizen.”

After Afghanistan collapsed, true vetting was impossible. Civil registries were unreliable even before Kabul fell. Afterwards, the US lost access entirely. Tens of thousands of evacuees were processed using fragmented or outdated data systems incapable of verifying identity, criminal history, or network affiliation. Inspector-general reports later confirmed that individuals with security flags nonetheless entered the United States.

The Trump administration has now announced a nationwide halt on all asylum decisions, and has instructed officers to apply “country-specific factors” for nationals from 19 high-risk nations. Beyond those 19 nations, the administration will almost certainly replace the informal term “Third World” with a defined list grounded in national-security findings. The issue is not income level or geography — it is whether a country can provide reliable identity, criminal, and security data. Many cannot. This is especially true for states dominated by cartels, transnational criminal organisations (TCOs), jihadist networks, or foreign intelligence proxies. In those cases, the United States has no basis to assume the risk at all.

Mass immigration flows deepen the challenge. Cartels, CCP-linked triads, Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua, and foreign intelligence services increasingly control migration pipelines, using debt bondage and coercion to compel illegal immigrants into labour, sex trafficking, and revenue generation. Illegal populations become sub-governed communities, extensions of the networks that moved them. Every illegal immigrant is a financial asset and operational tool for these organisations. These are hybrid-threat network-driven movements that the United States cannot map, measure, or vet.

However, US law is built for moments like this. Under §212(f), a president may suspend “any class of aliens” whose entry is detrimental to national interests — a power upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018’s Trump v. Hawaii. And so the question before the country is simple: how can a state protect its citizens when it cannot verify who is entering or which foreign adversarial networks they belong to?

When a nation can no longer see, the first duty is to stop moving forward blindly. Recent US immigration policy has been misguided and far too lenient. Under such conditions, a pause is not a political statement: it is the minimum threshold of national security.",https://unherd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2247361430.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 13:57:21.174311

Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national who worked with the CIA during the Afghanistan war, is facing first-degree murder charges in connection with Wednesday’s shooting. The suspect arrived in the U.S. as part of a program to resettle those who had helped American troops after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Trump’s latest posts threaten a new wave of severe consequences for people his administration deems illegal, including to “remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States.”

The president also vowed to “denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility” and “deport any Foreign National who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization,” before claiming, without evidence, that “hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia are completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota.”

“Somalian gangs are roving the streets looking for ‘prey’ as our wonderful people stay locked in their apartments and houses hoping against hope that they will be left alone,” he wrote.

There were roughly 80,000 Somali nationals living in Minnesota in 2023, according to Minnesota Compass, out of a population of nearly 6 million people in the state.

Trump’s remarks about Somalis in Minnesota come after several instances of fraud were uncovered in state programs, including by Somali residents.

Republican members of Congress highlighted those claims in a letter last week seeking an investigation into the funnelling of “taxpayer dollars into the hands of the Al-Shabaab terrorist network in Somalia.”

Khalid Omar, an organizer with the interfaith group ISAIAH, said to the Guardian: “Collective punishment is wrong and racist, and using the actions of a few people to attack an entire community is un-American.”

“If anyone, regardless of their race, religion, or ethnicity, committed fraud, they should be held accountable under the law as individuals,” he continued.

Trump’s remarks also drew criticism from UN agencies.

Asked to respond to Trump’s remarks about immigrants, UN human rights office spokesperson Jeremy Laurence told a Geneva press briefing: “They are entitled to protection under international law, and that should be given due process.”

UN refugee agency spokesperson Eujin Byun echoed those sentiments.

“When people who need protection arrive in their territory, they have to have a due process of asylum. And then they have to have access to territory,” she said, adding that the overwhelming majority of refugees are law-abiding members of the host community.

Since Trump took office in January, his administration has deployed ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents to multiple American cities and have detained tens of thousands of foreign nationals.

In his recent post, Trump claimed — again, without evidence — that “most” of the 53 million foreign nationals currently living in the United States are “on welfare, from failed nations, or from prisons, mental institutions, gangs, or drug cartels.”

As of Nov. 16, there were 65,135 people in ICE detention, 73.6 per cent of whom have no criminal record, according to Trac Immigration.

In 2023, the most recent year with complete data, 33 million immigrants were in the U.S. workforce, including about 23 million lawful immigrants and 10 million unauthorized immigrants, the research centre says.

Unauthorized immigrants are those without full legal status, including people with temporary protection from deportation and those with various forms of legal work permits.

Among the unauthorized immigrants with some deportation protections were 2.6 million asylum applicants; 700,000 people who entered the U.S. legally after receiving parole; 700,000 victims of crime and violence; 650,000 people with Temporary Protected Status and 600,000 immigrants protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Afghan man accused of shooting two National Guard members will face first-degree murder charges for an attack that prompted President Donald Trump to declare he would freeze migration from “Third World Countries” to the U.S.

U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., Jeanine Pirro, said on Friday that there will be other charges as well against 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who she said ambushed the National Guardsmen from West Virginia near the White House on Wednesday.

In a Thanksgiving call with U.S. military service members on Thursday Trump called the shootings a “terrorist attack” and officials have said they were conducting a terrorism probe into Wednesday’s shooting.

“What happened at that crime is unmistakable. It is a premeditated murder,” Pirro told Fox News’ “Fox and Friends” program. “We are upgrading the initial charges of assault to murder in the first degree,” she said.

Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died of her wounds on Thursday. Pirro told Fox that Beckstrom’s fellow Guardsman Andrew Wolfe, 24, was in critical condition.

On his Truth Social platform late Thursday, Trump escalated his rhetoric on immigration. Since taking office this year he has stepped up arrests of immigrants in the U.S. illegally, cracked down on unlawful border crossings and stripped legal status from hundreds of thousands of people.

“I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden’s autopen, and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States,” Trump said on Truth Social, referring to his predecessor.

After taking office in 2021, Biden reversed many of Trump’s restrictive immigration policies from his first term, saying they blocked people in need of humanitarian protection and were unfairly discriminatory.

Trump did not name any countries. Asked about “Third World” countries, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Friday referred Reuters to 19 countries listed in a June travel ban.

Earlier, Homeland Security officials had said Trump ordered a widespread review of asylum cases approved under the Biden administration and green cards issued to citizens of the 19 countries, which include Afghanistan.

SHOOTING PROMPTS SWEEPING MIGRATION REVIEWS

Lakanwal entered the U.S. in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden-era immigration program to resettle thousands of Afghans who helped the U.S. during the war and feared reprisal from Taliban forces who seized control after the U.S. withdrawal.

More than 70,000 Afghans have been resettled in the U.S. under the program. Officials said Lakanwal was part of a CIA-backed unit in Afghanistan before coming to the U.S. He was granted asylum this year under Trump, according to a U.S. government file on him seen by Reuters.

Investigators said Lakanwal drove across the country from his home in the state of Washington and shot the two Guardsmen with a powerful revolver, a .357 Magnum, before being wounded in an exchange of gunfire with other troops.

The shootings may give Trump an opening to argue that even legal pathways like asylum pose security risks for Americans.

Less than 24 hours after the shooting, Trump officials began ordering widespread reviews of immigration policies.

Lakanwal lived in Washington state with his wife and five children, according to investigators. Asked whether he was planning to deport the suspect’s wife and five children who live in Washington state, Trump has said, “We’re looking at the whole situation with family.”

INTERNATIONAL GROUPS DEFEND ASYLUM SEEKER RIGHTS

U.N. agencies appealed to Washington to continue allowing asylum seekers access to the country and to be given due process.

“We expect all countries, including the United States, to honour their commitments under the 1953 Refugee Convention,” Farhan Haq, the deputy spokesperson for the U.N. secretary general, told Reuters.

U.N. human rights office spokesperson Jeremy Laurence told a Geneva press briefing: “They are entitled to protection under international law, and that should be given due process.”

Jasmin Lilian Diab, director of the Institute for Migration at the Lebanese American University, said freezing Afghan applications or reconsidering thousands of approved asylum claims would disrupt families and local communities and erode the integrity of the migration system.

“While the recent incident is tragic, using an isolated incident to justify mass restrictions is inconsistent with evidence showing no link between refugee arrivals and increased crime,” Diab told Reuters.

California estimates that nearly 1.5 million undocumented workers call the state home.
But since ICE officers frequently violate immigrants’ rights, Madera alleged, people who adopt a corner can help workers in a more immediate way.
“It’s a new sort of reaction to us … Garment Worker Center is a workers’ rights organization, and often employers are not that receptive to that,” Gonzalez said.","A lot of undocumented immigrants — and their employers — remember when the siege began. Federal immigration agents equipped with tactical gear and rifles descended on downtown Los Angeles in armored trucks on June 6, arresting dozens of workers at an apparel factory. Within hours, another group of agents raided a Home Depot a few miles away, arresting day laborers who were looking for work.

Those operations quickly became a flashpoint, sparking spontaneous large-scale street protests. But President Donald Trump’s administration doubled down, and more high-profile raids followed as the White House sought to make good on the president’s promise to conduct the largest mass deportation program in the nation’s history.

Immigration agents have since conducted sweeps at construction sites, restaurants, factories, car washes, and farms, upending life for undocumented workers nationwide. California estimates that nearly 1.5 million undocumented workers call the state home.

As militarized crackdowns have become more common in many parts of the country, employers and unions alike have taken new steps to protect their workers. In industries ranging from farmwork to garment production to food service, they have begun organizing defenses to make it harder for ICE to identify, detain and deport unauthorized immigrant employees who help keep their workplaces in business.

While the strategies vary, they share common goals: to find ways to inform immigrant workers about threats and, when possible, to shield them from detainment and deportation.

Adopt a Corner

On Aug. 6, day laborers gathered in front of the same Home Depot in Los Angeles that had been raided two months earlier. Tensions were still high in the city with ongoing ICE and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) actions, but the workers needed some income.

Suddenly, the back door of a Penske rental truck slid open from the inside to reveal nearly a dozen CBP agents in body armor lying in wait. They surged toward unsuspecting laborers, many of whom scattered in fear.

The raid, dubbed “Operation Trojan Horse” by the Department of Homeland Security and captured on camera by a Fox News reporter embedded with the agents inside the truck, resulted in the arrests of more than a dozen undocumented immigrants.

Similar raids earlier in the year inspired the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, a labor group that advocates for improved working conditions, to create the “Adopt a Corner” campaign.

Jose Madera, the director of the NDLON-affiliated Pasadena Community Job Center, said that the campaign encourages volunteers to go to places where immigrants regularly gather in search of work, to teach people about their rights. So far, volunteers have visited more than 100 locations across the country, Madera said.

The group’s volunteers hand out “Know Your Rights” materials like red cards, which are pocket-sized cutouts that explain what anyone — regardless of immigration status — can do when confronted by an immigration officer. But since ICE officers frequently violate immigrants’ rights, Madera alleged, people who adopt a corner can help workers in a more immediate way.

The Pasadena Community Job Center also tells people in the community to record actions by authorities on cell phones so that when there is a raid, “there can be someone documenting the abuse, the violence, people’s constitutional rights being violated,” Madera said.

Organizers hope that documentation can serve both as evidence in lawsuits or in immigration courts, and as proof to show the public how the Trump administration is conducting immigration enforcement operations.

“Many Americans do not want to see this type of violence — masked men in unmarked cars, armed to the teeth, going into communities and causing this terror,” he said.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to Capital & Main’s requests for comment.

In the Fields

Federal agents staged massive immigration raids on a pair of California cannabis farms in the cities of Carpinteria and Camarillo on July 10, blocking roads with armored vehicles, launching tear gas and firing crowd control munitions at protesters.

Amid the chaos, Jaime Alanis Garcia — who had worked at Glass House Farms for a decade — was fleeing from immigration officers when he fell 30 feet from the roof of a greenhouse, fracturing his neck and skull, according to NBC. Two days later, he died.

At those raids, federal agents arrested 361 people including American citizen and U.S. Army veteran George Retes.

More than a quarter of the state’s large agricultural workforce is undocumented — and nearly two-thirds are immigrants, more generally — leaving hundreds of thousands of laborers vulnerable to immigration crackdowns at work.

Since even before the Glass House Farms raids, the United Farm Workers union has been reaching out to employers to suggest ways to protect their employees.

Elizabeth Strater, vice president of UFW, told Capital & Main that one of the simplest things farmers can do is put up gates and fences to keep intruders out. For large fields that are too difficult or costly to encircle, Strater recommends a more impromptu tactic that, ironically, is sometimes used by law enforcement.

“If you’re out in flat, open fields where you can’t put a gate, what you can do is have the foreman, or whoever, park their vehicle so that it prevents access (by) someone who may not have your workers’ best interest at heart,” Strater said.

Such physical barriers are critical, Strater said, because while undocumented workers are legally protected by constitutional and statutory rights, federal agents have repeatedly been recorded ignoring basic protections.

Undocumented workers “have a right not to answer questions, but what happens when they assert that right is these absolutely unhinged, untrained, uncontrolled agents smash their windows and drag them out of their cars,” Strater said. “The utter lawlessness on behalf of these agencies is just extreme.”

Beyond providing employers with resources, UFW has taken legal action against the DHS, which Strater said has helped reduce the number of indiscriminate raids on farmworkers in certain areas of California.

Still, federal agencies can obtain criminal warrants to go after workers at specific sites, according to Strater.

Not all farm owners are taking action in response to workplace raids, but Strater said that most, including nonunionized operations, have been receptive to UFW’s recommendations. Some have even hosted community meetings to develop plans that could lessen the impact of immigration enforcement on workers and, by extension, the businesses that employ them, some of which have been hit by labor shortages triggered by the raids.

The Factory Floor

Many clothing manufacturing businesses in Los Angeles have also been open to outreach aimed at protecting employees, according to Daisy Gonzalez, campaign director at the Garment Worker Center.

“It’s a new sort of reaction to us … Garment Worker Center is a workers’ rights organization, and often employers are not that receptive to that,” Gonzalez said. “But I think information about what to do in this moment, employers understand it’s a resource for both their workers and themselves.”

Since the high-profile raids in June, many of the Garment Worker Center’s members have been worried about being detained on the job. Some have opted to stay home from work — for months.

In response, Gonzalez said, the Garment Worker Center has significantly ramped up its mutual aid programs, providing financial assistance to affected employees and even delivering resources to home-bound workers.

One middle-aged undocumented worker in Los Angeles, who spoke to Capital & Main on the condition of anonymity for fear that immigration officials would detain him, said the garment factory where he was working closed permanently after immigration raids began. If it were not for the Garment Worker Center’s financial support, he added, he would not have been able to pay for food or rent.

“The raids have deeply affected me, both psychologically and economically,” he said in an interview in Spanish. “There’s panic in the streets. I try to leave the house as infrequently as I can. I speak for myself, but there are thousands of people just like me, many in worse situations…this is a national emergency.”

Undocumented immigrants aren’t the only ones potentially impacted by raids.

In September, the U.S. Supreme Court concluded that DHS officers could detain people based on their race, their use of Spanish or accented English, their occupation or their presence at locations such as car washes, agricultural or day labor sites.

The result is that many immigrants with residency, U.S. citizens and their American-born children can get caught up in aggressive raids. To Gonzalez, “Anyone who has a darker skin tone, or speaks a different language, or works in an industry that might be where certain people expect undocumented immigrants to work, are all targets.”

Serve and Protect

On a busy street in L.A.’s Los Feliz neighborhood, customers line up to order tacos and burritos outside of a small hut. Yuca’s is a modest operation with no inside seating, but it has been in business for nearly half a century, becoming a staple of the city’s Mexican-food scene and even winning a prestigious James Beard Foundation Award.

Dora Herrera, the restaurant’s co-owner, delights in being able to serve her local community, but since the Trump administration’s ramped-up immigration raids began, she has worried intensely about Yuca’s customers, vendors and workers, whom she considers “family.”

Herrera sought advice from organizations like the Latino Restaurant Association about how to protect her staff, regardless of their immigration status, as she has seen reports of federal agents arresting U.S. citizens, green-card holders and immigrants with work permits.

She has provided her employees with Know Your Rights materials like red cards and, for the first time since the restaurant opened in 1976, installed signs on the outside of the building declaring it private property. The law requires officers to produce a warrant to gain access to private property.

“We haven’t been around for 50 years for nothing. You learn something, you adapt, and you keep adapting to make it work,” Herrera said.

Such measures are far from foolproof but, according to Herrera, it is incumbent on people like her to do what they can to keep vulnerable workers as safe as possible.

“We want to make sure everybody’s taken care of, protected, educated,” Herrera said. “As an employer, I believe you have to do everything, absolutely everything you can, to protect your people, even the smallest thing.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2232800116-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 11:57:17.457946

The initiative was in place for around one year before shifting to a longer-term program called Operation Enduring Welcome.
The State Department has temporarily stopped issuing visas for all people traveling on Afghan passports, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced late Friday on X.
Flores said the system has worked across administrations: “You may hear people say, ‘Well, he was granted asylum under Trump.
However, he says it is now unclear if their application will move forward or if their interview will take place.","The Trump administration is promising an even tougher anti-immigration agenda after an Afghan national was being charged in the shooting this week of two National Guard members, with new restrictions targeting the tens of thousands of Afghans resettled in the U.S. and those seeking to come, many of whom served alongside American soldiers in the two-decade war.

But those still waiting to come were already facing stricter measures as part of President Donald Trump’s sweeping crackdown on legal and illegal migration that began when he started his second term in January. And the Afghan immigrants living in the U.S. and now in the administration’s crosshairs were among the most extensively vetted, often undergoing years of security screening, experts and advocates say.

The suspected shooter, who worked with the CIA during the Afghanistan War, “was vetted both before he landed, probably once he landed, once he applied for asylum,” said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute. “But more importantly, he was almost certainly vetted extensively and much more by the CIA.”

Haris Tarin, a former U.S. official who worked on the Biden-era program that resettled Afghans, predicted that ""as the investigation unfolds, you will see that this is not a failure of screening. This is a failure of us not being able to integrate — not just foreign intelligence and military personnel — but our own veterans, over the past 25 years.”

The program Operations Allies Welcome initially brought roughly 76,000 Afghans to the United States, many of whom had worked alongside American troops and diplomats as interpreters and translators. The initiative was in place for around one year before shifting to a longer-term program called Operation Enduring Welcome. Almost 200,000 Afghans have been resettled in the U.S. under both programs.

Among those brought to the U.S. under the program was the alleged shooter, 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who now faces a first-degree murder charge in the death of 20-year-old Specialist Sarah Beckstrom. The other National Guard member who was shot, 24-year-old Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, remains in critical condition.

Those resettlements are now on hold. The State Department has temporarily stopped issuing visas for all people traveling on Afghan passports, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced late Friday on X.

The shooting sparks anti-immigrant rhetoric

Trump and his allies have seized on the shooting to criticize gaps in the U.S. vetting process and the speed of admissions, even though some Republicans spent the months and years after the 2021 withdrawal criticizing the Biden administration for not moving fast enough to approve some applications from Afghan allies.

CIA Director John Ratcliffe said Lakanwal “should have never been allowed to come here,” Trump called lax migration policies “the single greatest national security threat facing our nation,” and Vice President JD Vance said Biden’s policy was “opening the floodgate to unvetted Afghan refugees.”

That rhetoric quickly turned into policy announcements, with Trump saying he would ""permanently pause all migration” from a list of nearly 20 countries, “terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions,” and “remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States.” Many of these changes had already been set in motion through a series of executive orders over the past 10 months, including most recently in June.

“They are highlighting practices that were already going into place,” said Andrea Flores, a lawyer who was an immigration policy adviser in the Obama and Biden administrations.

Lakanwal applied for asylum during the Biden administration, and his request was approved in April of this year after undergoing a thorough vetting, according to #AfghanEvac, a group that helps resettle Afghans who assisted the U.S. during the war.

Flores said the system has worked across administrations: “You may hear people say, ‘Well, he was granted asylum under Trump. This is Trump’s problem.’ That’s not how our immigration system works. It relies on the same bedding. No asylum laws have really been changed by Congress.”

Afghans in the US fearful for their status

Trump and other U.S. officials have used the attack to demand a re-examination for everyone who came to the U.S. from Afghanistan, a country he called “a hellhole on Earth” on Thursday.

“These policies were already creating widespread disruption and fear among lawfully admitted families. What’s new and deeply troubling is the attempt to retroactively tie all of this to one act of violence in a way that casts suspicion on entire nationalities, including Afghan allies who risked their lives to protect our troops,” Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Global Refuge, said in a statement Friday.

This has left the nearly 200,000 Afghans who are currently living across the U.S. in deep fear and shame over the actions of one person in their community. Those in the U.S. are now worrying about their legal status being revoked, while others in the immigration pipeline here and abroad are waiting in limbo.

Nesar, a 22-year-old Afghan who arrived in America weeks after the fall of Kabul, said he had just begun to assimilate into life in the U.S. when the attack happened on Wednesday. He agreed to speak to The Associated Press on condition that only his first name be used for fear of reprisals or targeting by immigration officials.

“Life was finally getting easier for me. I’ve learned to speak English. I found a better job,” he said. “But after this happened two days ago, I honestly went to the grocery store this morning, and I was feeling so uncomfortable among all of those people. I was like, maybe they’re now looking at me the same way as the shooter.”

Two days before the shooting, Nesar and his father, who worked for the Afghan president during the war, had received an interview date of Dec. 13 for their green card application, a moment he said they had been working toward for four years. However, he says it is now unclear if their application will move forward or if their interview will take place.

Another Afghan national, who also spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, said that after fearing for his life under Taliban rule, he felt a sense of peace and hope when he finally received a special immigrant visa to come to the U.S. two years ago.

He said he thought he could use his experience working as a defense attorney in Afghanistan to contribute to American society. But now, he says the actions of an “extremist who, despite benefiting from the safety and livelihood provided by this country, ungratefully attacked two American soldiers,” he and other Afghans will once again face scrutiny.

“It seems that whenever a terrorist commits a crime, its shadow falls upon me simply because I am from Afghanistan,” he added.

But McHenry County Assistant State’s Attorney Troy Owens, who manages civil litigation for the county, said the lawsuit against the county should be dismissed.

McHenry County has filed suit against ICE, trying to get the federal government to pay for potential liability for allegedly making immigrant detainees do forced labor.

The court battle pits conservative McHenry County, which once fought in court for the ability to hold accused immigrants in the U.S. without legal permission in its jail, against the agency that once paid it millions of dollars every year to do so. Both county and federal officials have denied liability.

The case comes as the U.S. Supreme Court is considering whether private prisons can immediately appeal their claim of immunity against a rash of similar lawsuits across the nation.

Northwestern University professor Jacqueline Stevens, founding director of the Deportation Research Clinic at the Buffett Institute for Global Affairs, said the Supreme Court seemed skeptical of Geo Group’s claims regarding a prison it runs in Colorado. That might not bode well for a public jail like McHenry County as well.

But McHenry County Assistant State’s Attorney Troy Owens, who manages civil litigation for the county, said the lawsuit against the county should be dismissed.

“This is an absurd lawsuit,” Owens said. “The Trafficking Victims Protection Act is being grotesquely misused.”

County attorneys have argued in court that the courts have established housekeeping duties as an exception to the 13th Amendment prohibition against slavery. Prosecutors also argue that the county is immune from such lawsuits because no court has found that a government-run detention facility violates the law by requiring detainees to perform housekeeping.

“It’s not asking too much to ask them to clean up their cells and common areas,” Owens said.

About a dozen class-action lawsuits have been filed nationwide, including in Colorado, Georgia and New York, against ICE and its contractors, such as CoreCivic and the GEO Group, which run private prisons. Geo Group reported revenue of $2.4 billion last year, 41% of it from ICE contracts.

The suits generally claim that inmates were forced to clean, do maintenance and perform kitchen duties for little or no pay, in violation of minimum wage laws or the Trafficking Victims Protection Act.

The Supreme Court recently took GEO Group’s case, in which it claims it should have “derivative sovereign immunity,” similar to immunity that protects the government from certain liability, because it had a contract to work for the government.

The McHenry County state’s attorney’s office also is arguing that ICE, acting through its contractor, The Nakamoto Group, should cover any liability in the case because the jail was merely following ICE guidelines.

While the McHenry case, filed in 2022, remains in the early stage of gathering evidence to determine its scope, other such cases have involved millions of dollars. In Tacoma, Washington, a jury awarded plaintiffs $17 million in back wages, and GEO was ordered to pay the state nearly $6 million in unfair compensation, known as unjust enrichment. They pay detainees as little as $1 a day for duties that could otherwise be done at normal wages by public workers or private employees.

“My takeaway is that the kind of get-rich schemes some entities might have through mass detention might not work out as well as they planned,” Stevens said.

McHenry County’s detention of noncitizens for ICE while their cases were decided had been a point of contention for years. Activists had pressured the county to stop the practice, but the county board voted in 2021 to continue, saying it generated revenue and kept detainees closer to home. ICE paid the county $95 per day per detainee, for an average of 240 inmates a day from 2016 to 2021, which the suit stated generated more than $41 million.

But effective in 2021, Illinois lawmakers prohibited detention contracts with local authorities. McHenry County appealed in court but lost. Since then immigrant detainees have been held in facilities out of state or at the ICE processing facility in west suburban Broadview, where federal immigration agents recently clashed with protesters over its arrests of hundreds of immigrants during the Trump administration’s Operation Midway Blitz.

In 2022, six detainees filed suit against McHenry, claiming they were forced to clean and maintain the jail without pay or face discipline. Some of the plaintiffs were released, while others returned to the countries they left. While convicted felons can be forced to do work as part of their punishment, immigrant civil detainees waiting for a hearing cannot. McHenry officials said detainees weren’t forced to work, but were responsible for keeping their own cells and day areas clean.

Ultimately, the courts must decide whether entities operating under the direction of the federal government receive governmental immunity from litigation, or whether the federal government assumes liability.

McHenry County officials declined to comment on the litigation, but told the Tribune that before the state prohibited its ICE contract, it was receiving nearly $10 million a year for housing ICE detainees. While the county has temporarily contracted with neighboring counties to house their inmates, the agreements generate about half as much revenue as the ICE contract.

The Trump administration’s solicitor general argued in the Supreme Court case that if an agency delegates authority to perform an unlawful action, the contractor is still liable. The administration has also requested a record $45 billion over the next two years to expand immigrant detention capacity to more than 100,000 people, much of it through private prisons, which are prohibited in Illinois.

In other words, Stevens said, if ICE misinterprets laws Congress passes, its contractors are not immune from lawsuits.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ctc-l-detained-immigrants.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-11-29 10:57:19.472945

Why it matters: ICE has signed 1,100+ agreements this year for local law enforcement to cooperate on immigration arrests and detentions. The agency is dangling financial incentives from President Trump's ""big, beautiful bill.""

The big picture: Almost 650 counties across the country are now covered by some form of the 287(g) agreement, a formal partnership between ICE and non-federal law enforcement, including sheriff's offices and state police, according to the latest data.

The surge in agreements is fueled by red states and new state laws mandating cooperation.

The Homeland Security Department recently announced that these local partners will also start aiding with vetting sponsors of migrant children with whom the Biden administration lost contact.

Zoom in: As of October, ICE is offering to reimburse for ""each eligible trained 287(g) officer"" their full salary, benefits and 25% of overtime pay.

There's also a merit-based bonus to the agencies based on ""successful location of illegal aliens provided by ICE and overall assistance."" The highest tier pays out $1,000.

Between the lines: There are three types of 287(g) agreements, named after a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as Axios wrote in June.

For agencies to identify and process immigrants subject to removal from the country following arrests.

For ICE to train and authorize law enforcement to serve and execute immigration warrants in jails.

For local agencies to enforce immigration laws in the community. It was phased out by the Obama administration and renewed by Trump.

Zoom out: ICE has been struggling to meet its hiring goals — aiming for 10,000 new agents — as new recruits fail the fitness assessments and immigration law tests.

The partnerships with already-trained local law enforcement have quickly brought more staff onto the immigration mission.

""ICE is not only supercharging our hiring, we are also multiplying partnerships with state and local law enforcement to remove the worst of the worst including murderers, gang members, rapists, terrorists, and pedophiles from our country,"" ICE's deputy director Madison Sheehan said in a statement.

The intrigue: Taxpayers in Maricopa County, Arizona are still footing the bill from a 2013 verdict that found Sheriff Joe Arpaio was racially profiling Latinos under a 287(g) agreement.

Community organizers have, in isolated cases, successfully pushed back against these agreements, including the ouster of a Bucks County sheriff over the issue in an election this November.

""Really the local cost is a huge issue,"" said Christine Sauve, of Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, who helped organize a successful pullback of two agreements in Michigan.

When residents first heard about the agreements, ""there was a real fear that their local police officers would become agents of a lawless immigration enforcement system,"" she added.

The bottom line: Florida has signed the most agreements at 337, as of Nov. 24, followed by Texas's 231.

Both states signed laws this year to require broad participation.

In nearly all of the examples Judge Ellis cited in her 200-plus page opinion, she says the Department of Homeland Security narrative contradicts the reality of what can be seen on agents' body-worn cameras.

The following are just a few examples from her ruling.

On September 26 outside of the Broadview ICE facility, video from an agent's body-worn camera shows a line of agents standing at least 30 feet away from protesters. Despite this distance, the agents start yelling ""move back, move back"" to the protesters and then shoot pepper balls and tear gas at them, all without any apparent justification, according to Judge Sara Ellis's 233-page opinion.

She said an agent wrote in his use of force report about this incident that protesters were ""becoming increasingly hostile."" However, Judge Ellis wrote in her opinion the video shows protesters were simply standing there when agents first deployed any force.

On October 4 in Brighton Park, footage shows an agent pushing a protestor to the ground. Then, tear gas and pepper balls are released. Judge Ellis wrote that only after tear gas, pepper balls and a protester was pushed to the ground by agents did protesters throw items, which ""does not support agents' use of force.""

In an incident the ABC 7 I-Team covered in Albany Park on October 12, Judge Ellis wrote that agents said in reports, and DHS publicized, that a bicyclist threw a bike at agents. But in a video, provided with no sound to start, she says it ""makes clear"" that agents first throw tear gas, then take a protester's bike throwing it and multiple other protesters to the ground after deploying tear gas.

Ellis also noted an agent is seen in redacted and blurred video from his body-worn camera in at least one instance using ChatGPT to write a use of force report, saying ""to the extent that agents use ChatGPT to create their use of force reports, this further undermines their credibility..."" Judge Ellis went on to say ""...it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to believe almost anything that Defendants represent.""

The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals stayed Judge Ellis's initial order while the Trump administration's appeal is heard.

Many of the legal challenges to Trump immigration policies have been successful.","WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump threatened a slew of aggressive actions to curtail legal migration to the U.S. in response to one National Guard member dying after being ambushed near the White House, though the scope of those moves and what legal or congressional mechanisms he may pursue remain unclear.

Trump, who has amplified his anti-immigration rhetoric in the wake of the shooting attack by an Afghan national, said late Thursday he would permanently pause migration from “all Third World Countries,” “terminate” what he called “illegal admissions” under former President Joe Biden and end federal benefits for noncitizens. The president also said he would deport foreign nationals deemed a security risk and “denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility.”

The comments signal a renewed effort to sharply curtail even legal migration to the U.S. and scale up deportations of those already in the country. Trump’s administration, however, remained largely silent Friday on how any of those changes would be made, which countries would be targeted or how sweeping the actions could be – for instance, whether the president aims to deport significant numbers of people with legal status or even citizenship by denaturalizing them, as he put it.

On Friday, Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow said in a social media post that the U.S. is halting all asylum decisions “until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.”

The agency earlier announced it would review green cards of people from “countries of concern,” potentially widening efforts to remove legal permanent residents. Those countries are the 19 listed in a travel ban from earlier this year but whether the “third world” nations Trump cited match that list is not clear.

The travel ban imposed in June restricted travel by foreign nationals from 12 countries, mostly in the Middle East and Africa, from entering the U.S., citing the need to counter the threat of terrorist attacks and safeguard the public. Those countries include Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Another seven countries faced partial restrictions.

Federal authorities have identified the suspected shooter as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, an Afghan national who previously worked with U.S. forces and the CIA before arriving in the U.S. in 2021, intensifying scrutiny on the more than 190,000 Afghans admitted to the U.S. since the fall of Kabul to the Taliban. Most of those comprise people who assisted U.S. forces during the war and their families.

Since the shooting, the president has claimed Afghan evacuees received no vetting, waving a photo of one departure flight while speaking to the media Thursday. He’s also said Lakanwal simply “went cuckoo” even as the investigation into the gunman’s motives continues.

While the Trump administration has cast blame on the Biden team, Lakanwal was granted asylum by the Trump administration, according to AfghanEvac, a nonprofit group, and would have undergone vetting, including for his work alongside U.S. forces fighting the Taliban. Advocacy groups have called on Lakanwal to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law and without his case negatively affecting other Afghans in the U.S.

Even before this week’s shooting, the administration aggressively moved to slash legal migration or travel to the U.S., offering some insight into their priorities. Trump has dramatically lowered the refugee cap, ended temporary protected status for migrants from several countries, imposed a $100,000 application fee for H-1B visas used by high-skilled workers and revoked thousands of visas.

The administration is also planning to review the cases of all refugees resettled under Biden.

“If you’re not someone who loves this country, if you’re not any benefit to this country, then we’re going to send you out of this country,” top Trump adviser Stephen Miller said on Fox News Wednesday.

The June travel ban reinstated one of the most controversial measures from Trump’s first term, which went through numerous iterations and a protracted court fight before ultimately being upheld by the Supreme Court as “squarely within the scope of Presidential authority.”

Trump said the latest ban protects the nation from terrorist attacks and public safety threats. The administration has said the 12 countries on the new list facing full bans were chosen because they pose a “very high” terrorism or national security risk to the U.S. and had deficient screening and vetting processes. The seven countries where travelers face a partial ban were chosen because they posed a “high” risk.

Officials over the holiday weekend sought to quickly signal they were acting on Trump’s threats, adding to confusion over what new steps the administration was taking.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday said his department would issue regulations clarifying that refunds for certain income tax benefits were “no longer available to illegal and other non-qualified aliens,” a plan the agency already announced the previous week, before the shooting.

Trump on Thursday night also called for “reverse migration,” but without detailing what that would entail.

Any new immigration moves by the president are likely to draw legal challenges.

The administration is already facing claims it is removing migrants in violation of court orders and other legal protections. Multiple lawsuits in federal court allege wrongful deportation, including a transgender woman sent to Mexico despite an immigration judge’s order blocking the move because of her risk of being tortured or killed, and the ongoing case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a migrant from El Salvador who sued to challenge his mistaken deportation to his home country.

The Justice Department has admitted authorities made mistakes in several deportation cases, which could hinder future removal attempts. A federal judge is pressing ahead with an inquiry into whether Trump administration officials willfully defied his orders to turn planes around that were en route to a notorious prison in El Salvador.

Many of the legal challenges to Trump immigration policies have been successful.

Moreover, as immigration rates have risen in the past few decades, crime rates across the country have fallen dramatically.
During the same period, the overall crime rate dropped by 60.4%, from 5,900 crimes per 100,000 people to 2,335.
This includes a 34.5% decrease in violent crime and a 63.3% reduction in property crime.
“A migrant earning $30,000 with a green card will get roughly $50,000 in yearly benefits for their family,” Trump added.","Donald Trump’s hateful, falsehood-filled rant on Thursday blaming immigrants for crime, “social dysfunction” and economic hardship is refuted by a wide range of immigration statistics, which show clearly that immigrants dramatically bolster the US economy and commit crimes at far lower rates than people born in the US.

On Thursday evening, Trump condemned immigrants in a broad and vicious invective, painting them as “illegal and disruptive populations” and attacking “those that hate, steal, murder and destroy everything that America stands for”. He vowed to block all migration from “third world countries” to allow the “US system to fully recover”.

The president’s post follows a deadly shooting in Washington DC on Wednesday in which one National Guard member was injured and another killed by a 29-year old Afghan national who assisted the US military effort in Afghanistan and was evacuated to the US after the American military withdrew.

The shooting has sparked even more anti-immigration rhetoric from Trump’s administration, which has indicated it will further intensify its crackdown on immigrant communities - already a focal point of fierce opposition from civil rights groups, Democratic lawmakers and the public.

Since the shooting took place, Trump has vowed to conduct a comprehensive review of asylum cases and green cards issued to people from certain countries.

The unprecedented post from a US president – spiteful even by Trump’s standards contradicted extensive research showing irrefutably that immigrants to the US commit fewer crimes than people born there, and have done so for more than a century.

Despite Trump’s post, in which he claims incorrectly that 53 million people in the US – “most of which are on welfare, from failed nations, or from prisons, mental institutions, gangs, or drug cartels” – are contributing to “high crime”, economists have found that the immigrants are 60% less likely to be incarcerated compared to individuals born in the US. This trend has remained consistent for the past 150 years.

Moreover, as immigration rates have risen in the past few decades, crime rates across the country have fallen dramatically. According to an analysis by the American Immigration Council (AIC), the immigrant share of the US population has more than doubled since 1980, rising from 6.2% in that year to 13.9% in 2022. During the same period, the overall crime rate dropped by 60.4%, from 5,900 crimes per 100,000 people to 2,335. This includes a 34.5% decrease in violent crime and a 63.3% reduction in property crime.

In his post, Trump also claimed that immigrants and their children “are supported through massive payments from patriotic American citizens who … put up with what has happened to our country, but it’s eating them alive to do so”.

“A migrant earning $30,000 with a green card will get roughly $50,000 in yearly benefits for their family,” Trump added.

His claim is flatly contradicted by data showing that immigrants are significant contributors to the US economy. In 2023, undocumented immigrant households contributed $89.8bn in federal, state and local taxes, while holding $299bn in spending power, according to the AIC.

The organization also found that the vast majority of immigrants are not dependent on state governments to guarantee housing. Instead, in 2023, immigrant households paid more than $167bn in rent in the housing market and held over $6.6tn in housing wealth.

Trump, who also asserted that “this refugee burden is the leading cause of social dysfunction in America”, singled out with particular malice what he described as “hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia [who] are taking over the once great state of Minnesota”.

“Somalian gangs are roving the streets looking for ‘prey,’” the US president said.

He added, with open racism, that Ilhan Omar – a member of Congress from Minnesota – was “always wrapped in her swaddling hijab” and suggested she had married her brother.

Home to the largest Somali population in the US, many of whom arrived as refugees fleeing famine and civil war, Minnesota was labelled a “sanctuary jurisdiction” by the justice department in August . According to the department, this designation applies to states, cities or counties with laws that “hinder the enforcement of federal immigration laws”.

Trump has previously accused immigrants of “poisoning the blood of our country”, but despite repeatedly claiming that his immigration raids are targeting criminals across the country, a new study from the Cato Institute found that 73% of people detained by ICE have no convictions.

It also found that nearly half had no criminal conviction nor even any pending criminal charges and that only 5% had a violent criminal conviction.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f44a49cbed72353a210739d4c2d98273a2b44a96/62_0_4298_3438/master/4298.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=edea911811e5d76982f3ded219ab51e8",N,,2025-11-29 08:56:44.630304

""Such narratives cause real harm, inflame tensions, and overlook the truth: one individual does not represent millions.","Advocates for refugees in the United States continued to raise alarm Friday after President Donald Trump moved quickly to exploit the murder of one National Guard soldier and the wounding of another—allegedly shot by a national from Afghanistan who worked for the US military and CIA during the war there before seeking asylum in the US—by issuing a sweeping ban against asylum-seekers and halting all immigration from what he termed ""all Third World countries"" in response to Wednesday's shooting in Washington, DC.

“Regardless of the alleged perpetrator’s nationality, religion or specific legal status,"" said Matthew Soerens, a vice president with the faith-based World Relief, speaking with the Associated Press, ""we urge our country to recognize these evil actions as those of one person, not to unfairly judge others who happen to share those same characteristics.”

Shawn VanDiver, president of the San Diego-based group AfghanEvac, a group that helps resettle Afghans who assisted the US during the war in Afghanistan, explained to the AP that many people in the Afghan refugee community that he knows are terrified by the tone which has been set by Trump after the shooting, afraid to leave their homes for fear of being snatched up by federal agents or otherwise targeted.

“They’re terrified. It’s insane,” VanDiver told AP. “People are acting xenophobic because of one deranged man. He doesn’t represent all Afghans. He represents himself.”

""The perpetrator should face accountability, but the entire Afghan community must not be punished due to the actions of one individual."" —Richard Bennett, the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan

On Thursday, it was announced that Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, deployed with the National Guard under orders from Trump, had died from her injuries while Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remained in critical condition in a local hospital.

While heartbreak and mourning were widely shared for the victims of the shooting, Trump's xenophobic response to the violent assault, including his racist social media posts on Truth Social that critics said echoed white nationalist rhetoric, proved, for many observers, once again his shortcomings as a national leader during times of crisis, but also as a human being.

""The perpetrator should face accountability, but the entire Afghan community must not be punished due to the actions of one individual,"" said Richard Bennett, the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan, on Thursday. ""That would be terribly unjust and complete nonsense. Cool heads must prevail.""

Arash Azizzada, co-director of Afghans For A Better Tomorrow, which long-opposed the US war in Afghanistan in the wake of 9/11 and continues to advocate on behalf of the Afghan-American community, condemned Trump for ""using this tragedy as a pretext to demonize, criminalize, and target an entire community. Exploiting a single incident to cast suspicion on Afghans—people who have already endured decades of displacement and America's forever wars—is both irresponsible and cruel.""

Azizzada also pointed out how the alleged gunman now in police custody, identified as 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, ""worked alongside US Special Operations forces and served in a CIA-backed covert paramilitary group known as 'Zero Units' that functioned outside the purview of any accountability and has a documented history of widespread human rights abuses against Afghan civilians over two decades.""

""We both condemn the violence by one individual on the streets of Washington, DC, as well as the violence perpetrated by the US in Afghanistan and elsewhere,"" said Azizzada. ""America must confront the decades of violence it inflicted on Afghanistan and acknowledge that its forever wars are a major reason why Afghans seek safety here. Blaming refugees for the consequences of those actions is unjust, and we call for the promises to Afghans to be honored, not abandoned.""

Journalist Ryan Grim, co-founder of Drop Site News, put it this way: ""The idea that we should freeze all migration because one of the CIA’s death squad recruits went on a rampage is absurd. Smarter would be to stop training death squads.""

Evacuate Our Allies, a group that advocates on behalf of Afghans who helped the US during the war and now seeking to resettle, expressed deep sympathies for the victims of the shooting and their families and condemned the ""reprehensible attack."" The group also denounced the ""alarming vilification of an entire community based on the actions of a lone individual.""

""No community, Afghan or otherwise, should be judged, demonized, or collectively punished for the behavior of one person,"" the group said. ""Such narratives cause real harm, inflame tensions, and overlook the truth: one individual does not represent millions. Collective blame is not only unjust but dangerous.

Obtaining court transcripts can cost thousands of dollars for a single day of proceedings, but the documents can contain errors, missing text, and even wrong attribution, frustrating legal practitioners who say the flaws impede justice.

Justice is being obstructed by inaccurate court transcripts — including some where potentially prejudicial comments by judges were missing, according to a slew of legal practitioners interviewed by the ABC.

The prohibitive cost of obtaining transcripts also meant some appeals were not even being considered, lawyers warned.

There are now calls for change, including the cancellation of a lucrative contract with the foreign company that provides the transcripts, and for the raw audio files to be provided to litigants as a matter of course.

The ABC spoke to nine legal practitioners for this story but four declined to go on the record — some saying they feared that speaking out could lead to reprisals from judges in ongoing or subsequent court cases.

Four practitioners said erroneous transcripts in cases they had worked on affected how their cases progressed.

Some said inappropriate or biased comments from the judge were missing from the transcript, making it impossible to lodge an appeal on those grounds.

Transcripts seen by the ABC attributed dialogue to the wrong person, named the wrong legal practitioners, contained an abundance of typographical errors, and one transcript had more than two hours of proceedings missing entirely.

The court later included the missing hours of dialogue, which totalled 29 pages, after a parent in the matter raised it with the judge's associate.

According to the parent, more than one transcript in their case contained errors, forcing them to repeatedly raise it with the court, and ultimately, hindering their case.

Family law barrister Brian Kelly said in his 18 years of practice he had worked on several matters where he believed the court transcripts were wrong.

""There have been times I have reviewed transcripts I have ordered and found that they did not line up with my recollection or my notes,"" he said.

""During an interim hearing some time ago the judge made comments that I felt demonstrated an error.

""I found that the relevant section [of the transcript] I required to base an appeal on was missing.

""Without going around the loop of having the transcript reviewed, for which the client had no funds … the appeal prospects dropped markedly.""

Mr Kelly said he decided not to make a formal complaint to the court or the Attorney General. Colleagues who experienced similar issues told him they were ""hesitant to make a formal complaint because of retribution"".

""Colleagues have told me they've been aware of transcripts that haven't lined up with what they thought was in there or what their notes have said, and they haven't made any complaints either because often you have to worry about the repercussions on your client and also on the lawyers themselves,"" he said.

""If a case is still ongoing and someone has challenged the veracity of a transcript and made a complaint about it, there might be repercussions in how that case continues.""

Former New South Wales Court of Appeals judge and chair of the Centre for Public Integrity, Anthony Whealy KC, said the issue threatened to undermine the administration of justice.

""If there's an example of a judge deliberately arranging to omit material in some form of self-preservation, then I think I would describe it as an unpardonable breach. It's totally contrary to the oath the judge takes and it's absolutely contrary to every principle of judicial correctness, and to me, deplorable,"" he said.

""If there are errors and omissions then the whole system is threatened and undermined and you could encounter a serious flaw in the administration of justice.""

'I'm deeply troubled'

If the contents of a transcript are disputed, a request can be made to review it against the audio file, but recordings ""are only available in exceptional circumstances"", according to the Federal Circuit and Family Court (FCFC) website.

The court uses a transcription company called VIQ Solutions — a prominent agency that provides services to hundreds of bodies around the world including media outlets, law enforcement, government agencies and insurance companies, according to its website.

VIQ Solutions also provides transcripts for the family court in the United Kingdom, where similar concerns have been raised regarding the quality and accuracy of transcripts.

UK family law barrister Charlotte Proudman said in order for justice to be done, and to address inaccuracies, courts must allow access to audio files of proceedings — not just written transcripts.

""It is absolutely imperative that transcripts and the audio of court hearings are made available to the parties in proceedings … and I do not think there is any legal justification for refusing parties having access to effectively their own data,"" Dr Proudman said.

""To deny them the opportunity to receive that audio, I would say is hindering justice.

The Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) highlighted the call for access to audio files as part of their 2021 report into judicial impartiality.

It stated, ""stakeholders suggested that transcripts often do not pick up the subtle ways in which bias can manifest in the courtroom. For example, the transcript does not pick up facial expressions, long pauses, inflexion, or tone"".

Dr Proudman agreed, saying without the audio it was difficult for parties in a family law matter to prove if a judge had ""crossed the line"".

""You need the audio in order to understand the tone as well as the volume, the way that it's said. We know that things can be said in a very sarcastic way,"" she said.

""I had a case recently where a mother on the transcript was saying to the judge, 'I just don't think you understand coercive and controlling behaviour' … and she said he was getting quite irate and his volume was raised … she said, 'you're not letting me finish, you're cutting me off. I can see from your facial expression you're not happy'.

""He was saying, 'I'm not cutting you off, I'm not raising my voice', so batted it back. So, without the audio there is no objective, neutral or impartial observer to be able to decide whether in fact he had crossed the line to a perception of bias.""

In a matter in the family court of Australia in 2020, the appeal court relied on the audio files in a case where the primary judge's conduct was found to be ""cruel, insulting, humiliating and rude"".

""Having listened to the audio version of the transcript we are struck by the stark difference in the primary judge's tone and terms of address,"" the appeal judges stated.

The appeal court found the conduct of the judge warranted a retrial on the grounds of apprehended bias ""lest the integrity of the judicial system be undermined"".

Mr Whealy said while appeal courts relied almost entirely on transcripts, audio files allowed a better understanding of the ""atmosphere"" of the courtroom.

""The audio file will … give you a much better picture of the whole atmosphere of the courtroom, you know, was the judge shouting at one of the witnesses? What may appear on paper to be just a quite banal comment might sound very different when listened to in real life.""

Why is it so hard to access audio files?

Legal practitioners told the ABC the process of seeking a review of the transcript against the audio file was too complicated, too costly for litigants, and requests to access the audio files were rarely granted.

The ABC is aware of a case in which a self-represented parent requested that transcripts be reviewed due to alleged inaccuracies but was denied.

The parent claimed the judge had repeatedly yelled at and spoken over the top of them.

One of the transcripts showed the judge threatened to ""strike out the proceedings"" when the parent raised issues of procedural fairness in what was a complex and long-running case.

An ABC journalist in the court room on one of the days this matter was heard witnessed very tense interactions between the judge and the parent which included raised voices, interruptions, speaking over, and allegations of eye rolling.

During the course of the proceedings the parent applied for the judge's recusal on the basis of bias but the application to have the case heard by another judge was refused.

""Transcripts are the backbone of accountability in any legal matter. They capture the truth of what occurred in court and are vital for ensuring fairness, especially in appeals and recusal applications,"" the parent said.

""In my case, being denied access to both the transcripts and the audio recordings took away my ability as a self-represented litigant, to present my case effectively or fairly.

""It denied me the ability to properly challenge judicial conduct. The weight of that injustice is something I carry every day, with no avenue for recourse and no means to restore what was lost both legally, and for myself and my child.""

Calls for judicial commission to 'protect the courts' reputation'

In 2021, the Australian Law Reform Commission recommended the establishment of a federal judicial commission as part of its report into ""Judicial Impartiality and the Law on Bias"".

The commission would be an independent body that could examine complaints about the court system and the judiciary, similar to what already exists in some states and territories.

The federal attorney general agreed in principle to setting up the commission, but so far no action has been taken. The attorney general's department told the ABC it ""remains under consideration"".

That's not good enough, according to Greens Senator David Shoebridge, who sits on the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee.

""It's been three years now since the ALRC made the recommendation. Three years on and we haven't even seen a consultation paper or a draft bill from the federal government. Pretty much every state and territory have a judicial commission,"" he said.

""At the end of the day a judicial commission is not only good for members of the public or lawyers who have complaints, it's good for judges too because matters get resolved, unmeritorious complaints get dealt with, and the courts are able to protect their reputation.""

Mr Whealy agreed.

""It's not just a matter for the courts. It's a matter for the community who are exposed to the processes of the courts and the administration of justice. Every member of the community wants to make sure that there are no miscarriages of justice occurring in the court system,"" he said.

The price of justice

A transcript for a single day of family court proceedings can set a parent back anywhere between $3,000 and $5,000 depending on the length of proceedings and deadline for turnaround.

The exorbitant cost has been a topic of contention for some time, with several government inquiries calling for change.

The Law Council of Australia highlighted the cost of transcripts as a barrier to justice in a 2018 report called the ""Justice Project"" — which included input from legal centres around the country.

""Exemption categories and court discretion to grant [fee] exemptions should also be reviewed and broadened in certain jurisdictions,"" the report stated.

In 2021, the ALRC's inquiry into ""Judicial Impartiality and the Law on Bias"" stated:

""Consideration should be given by courts to amendments to their rules and commercial arrangements that would enable greater — and more affordable — access to transcripts or recordings.""

The report also stated easier access to audio recordings should be considered, especially in cases where issues of bias had been raised.

Four years later, transcript fees are still ""absolutely ludicrous"", according to Hayder Shkara, the director of Justice Family Lawyers — a national network of 12 legal practices.

He said the cost of court transcripts was ""prohibitive"".

""It's a complete monopoly, which is also very concerning. Why is it dominated by one company? It's completely unfair,"" he said.

Mr Shkara said the court needed to catch up with advances in technology which would allow for ease and speed of transcription as well as verification.

""You would think with the improvements of technology, the workflows, streamlining different things, AI for goodness sake, all of these things have come out in the last 10 years and there has not been a decrease in costs,"" he said.

""These are everyday people [in court] who have low budgets.""

Mr Kelly agreed, saying the cost of transcripts was ""scandalous"".

""How can [the cost] be justified? It locks people out of their appeal rights.

""I have advised many people that they shouldn't proceed because they can't afford to pay for the transcripts. It makes consideration of an appeal very difficult. So people have to accept a decision that they believe is wrong.""

VIQ Solutions Australia Pty Ltd is a private subsidiary of VIQ Solutions, which is a public company based in Ontario. The parent company made a gross profit of $US19.2 million in 2024.

Mr Shoebridge said the optics of a foreign entity making profits from Australian family court proceedings was concerning.

""When you privatise essential public services like transcriptions in courts you create a lot of awkward incentives because obviously if this is a company that has a contract with the courts they don't want to get the courts offside.""

How are transcripts managed?

Transcripts are meant to be a true and correct record of court proceedings.

Any significant edits or changes to transcripts should occur with the knowledge and consent of all parties.

A spokesperson for the family court said: ""All equipment used to record hearings is owned and managed by VIQ Solutions, and no court staff member has access to the equipment, nor do staff members or judicial officers directly edit or alter transcripts"".

Upon further questioning, the spokesperson later clarified that ""court staff can correct typographical errors"" in transcripts.

However, in documents obtained by the ABC under Freedom of Information (FOI) it was clear transcripts could be edited and altered at the discretion of judicial officers.

The court's ""Transcript Style Guide"" states ""a presiding judicial officer may direct that scandalous or otherwise objectionable remarks in a proceeding not be recorded in the transcript"".

The document also states that editing can occur to make the transcripts more ""readable"" including the removal of ""matters of no substance to the case"" as well as ""administrative"" matters.

Mr Kelly said it was important that judicial officers had the ability to edit transcripts, but it should be done in an open and transparent way.

""I recall times where a judge has said, 'look I'll have that removed from the transcript' if something scandalous has been said. And that should happen…but it's the controversial things where somebody is alleging something was or wasn't there or is slightly different.""

The documents released to the ABC under FOI also revealed that transcripts were sent to the court in an editable word format and that audio files were accessible by judges, registrars, judges associates and ""other authorised staff"".

Judges can retrieve and play back audio from the audio portal of any recorded proceeding from within 30 minutes of the dialogue being spoken.

The court can also request VIQ Solutions staff ""reproduce a transcript that does not accurately reflect the underlying recording"".

The contract between VIQ Solutions and the court states that VIQ must provide access to their premises, records and information and that the court can copy relevant documentation.

All ownership of the recordings and the transcripts are held by the court ""from the date of creation"", according to the contract.

Each month VIQ must provide the court with a quality report detailing any complaints made about the transcription service or audio recordings, the number of errors in transcripts and any instances where a non-authorised person has listened to a recording, according to the Statement of Requirements.

However, a court spokesperson told the ABC they could not provide any data about complaints associated with transcripts.

Documents released under FOI revealed the court set a target of no more than one error per 100 words and it conducted performance tracking on individual transcribers.

What about other jurisdictions?

In 2022, the Court of Appeal found a trial judge in a matter in the ACT Supreme Court unilaterally edited a transcript without the knowledge of the parties.

Loading...

The court found the judge had, ""listened to the audio recording … for the purpose of revising the trial transcript … without first inviting the parties' submissions not only as to the revision, but as to the consequences of the revision"".

The appeal on the basis of apprehended bias was successful, but the judgment made no mention of consequences for the judge's actions.

The ACT courts use a company called EPIQ Transcription Services to produce documents in that jurisdiction.

In May, a Federal Court judge raised concerns about the quality of transcripts in a matter between Ergon Energy Queensland and the Australian Energy Regulator.

Justice Cameron Moore stated:

""the preparation of this judgment has been hampered by the extremely poor quality of the transcript of the proceedings, which has not managed to record in any accurate way the exchanges in the course of oral submissions that elucidated the parties' positions on construction.""

The Federal Court also uses VIQ Solutions. The Federal Court did not answer the ABC's questions about how the transcript had become corrupted but a spokesperson said the court was working with VIQ Solutions to address ""inefficiencies"".

""On this occasion, the transcript was not of an acceptable quality. We take all issues relating to transcript quality and delivery seriously,"" a spokesperson said.

The ABC put detailed questions to VIQ Solutions about how the transcription service operated, what processes were in place to address errors and who had access to audio files and transcripts.

VIQ Solutions declined to comment.

The attorney general's department said any issues were a matter for the courts.

""The federal courts are each responsible for their own operation and management, and for making rules of court. This includes responsibility for transcription services and associated contractual arrangements,"" a spokesperson said.

Mr Whealy said it was the attorney general's responsibility to address any concerns regarding the legal system.

""The attorney general, as the first law officer, has the obligation to face up to problems that are there and to help solve them with the cooperation of the courts,"" he said.

""There's been a call for many years now for there to be a federal judicial commission. We don't have one and it defies description or any rational explanation as to why that should be so.""

Courts have given more leeway in determining who gets legal status in the country in the first place, but tend to be more strict on stripping that status away.","Federal immigration officials are reexamining green cards issued to people from 19 countries considered “high-risk” at President Donald Trump’s direction.

The decision, announced Nov. 27 by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, comes in light of the deadly shooting of two National Guard members by a suspected gunman who is an Afghan national.

“At the direction of @POTUS, I have directed a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern,” USCIS Director Joseph Edlow said on X.

USCIS said it issued new guidance for “negative, country specific factors” to be considered when vetting people from 19 countries.

In other words, the government could try to remove legal status of people with green cards from those countries for reasons related to their country of origin rather than anything they personally have done.

Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, said the agency guidance appears ambiguous on how it will make those determinations other than that USCIS officials is getting more discretion.

While details are forthcoming, and legal challenges are likely, here’s what to know on the guidance.

Which countries are included?

The new guidance applies to immigrants from Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.

These countries were previously listed in Trump’s June 4 proclamation seeking to restrict entry of people from them.

The Trump administration had previously halted Afghan refugee settlement and travel on the president’s first day in office, according to Tricia McLaughlin, secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security. The new USCIS announcement referred to “the status of those *previously* brought into the U.S.,” she said in an X post, meaning those already here would face additional scrutiny.

When does the policy go into effect?

USCIS’ Policy Alert says it took effect immediately.

How is the Trump administration conducting this review?

The changes appear to now take a harder look at people's origin countries to justify removal from the United States.

Trump’s past proclamation, cited by the USCIS guidance, included considering activities of terrorist groups, rates of nationalities overstaying their visas in the United States, and whether a country can issue secure identity documents.

Who’s affected?

Anyone from the affected countries who’s applying for permanent residency and anyone with existing green cards from the 19 nations.

The USCIS Policy Alert says it will consider ""relevant country-specific facts and circumstances."" It applies to people applying for certain adjustments of status, like for a green card, as well as extending stays or changing status for nonimmigrants, which is typically people in the country on a temporary basis.

What are the possible outcomes?

Officials could try to remove someone from the country.

USCIS says the change will allow its officers to better determine whether a person is a “threat to public safety and national security.”

But, Selee said, it would be difficult for the government to remove people with permanent residency status unless officials can prove to an immigration judge that they pose a national security threat. The administration has tried to remove pro-Palestinian student activists on those grounds, resulting in legal fights.

Courts have given more leeway in determining who gets legal status in the country in the first place, but tend to be more strict on stripping that status away.

This may signal that people looking at permanent residency in the future may be more affected than those already with green cards.

Is it going to face legal challenges?

Almost certainly.

USCIS based its policy on a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that gives the president powers to suspend or restrict the entry of ""all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants"" into the United States by proclamation if their entry would be detrimental to national interests.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/28/USAT/87510117007-usatgraphics-greencards.png?crop=6498,3655,x830,y433&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-29 01:56:27.612370

“Congress has just simply done nothing about immigration for years,” Skerry said.
“One of the problems with foreseeing the legal outcomes of these initiatives, should they come to pass, is the United States has two almost opposed legal doctrines that govern immigration,” Skrentny said.
“There will be negative impacts if we curtail immigration,” Skerry said.
So, it’s a difficult world we live in where people have different sets of facts.”","In a pair of lengthy social media posts, President Donald Trump said he’ll pause migration from “third world countries” and strip citizenship from migrants who “undermine domestic tranquility.” The president’s comments come in response to the deadly shooting of members of the National Guard in Washington, D.C. by an Afghan national who was granted asylum.

Trump’s statements

The president wrote at length in the two posts about immigration in the U.S.

“This refugee burden is the leading cause of social dysfunction in America, something that did not exist after World War II (Failed schools, high crime, urban decay, overcrowded hospitals, housing shortages, and large deficits, etc.),” Trump wrote. “As an example, hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia are completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota.”

There is no evidence Somalians are overtaking Minnesota despite the president’s claims.

Trump’s response came after it was revealed the shooter in Washington is an Afghan national and refugee.

“One can appreciate the kind of shock and concerns that Americans have, witnessing something like that on the day before Thanksgiving, and the president responding to it,” Peter Skerry, professor of political science at Boston College, told Straight Arrow News. “As is his habit, he tends to overdramatize and make the argument too strong and in much too broad in general terms.”

Curbing immigration

“I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden’s Autopen, and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States, or is incapable of loving our Country, end all Federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our Country, denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility, and deport any Foreign National who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization,” Trump wrote.

When it comes to those statements as actual policy, there are several variables.

“They’re very vague, and it’s hard to see exactly how they would translate into national policy,” John Skrentny, sociology professor at University of California, San Diego, told SAN. “So trying to assess the legality of these moves is not the easiest thing in the world, because terms such as third world, that’s not a legal term, and it’s hard to know who’s in and who’s out of that.”

It’s not the first time Trump has used broad terms to describe foreign nations negatively including famously questioning why America would allow immigrants from “s—hole countries” during his first term.

“The American people have lots of reasons to be concerned and anxious about our immigration policies, but he pushes it to the limit, and I think that’s not very helpful,” Skerry said.

The Department of Homeland Security said they have indefinitely suspended processing immigration requests from Afghan nationals and plan to review all pending asylum cases approved under the Biden administration.

“Effective immediately, I am issuing new policy guidance that authorizes USCIS officers to consider country-specific factors as significant negative factors when reviewing immigration requests,” Joseph Edlow, USCIS director, said in a statement.

The ongoing influx of immigrants to the U.S. remains a concern for many Americans.

“Congress has just simply done nothing about immigration for years,” Skerry said. “I think that’s the relevant point here. Congress has to step up to the plate.”

Legality

Putting a halt on immigration from numerous countries would be a difficult task and would likely be challenged by members of Congress and the court system.

It could be similar to Trump’s so-called “Muslim ban” in 2017, which ended in a Supreme Court decision that allowed the ban to go through.

“One of the problems with foreseeing the legal outcomes of these initiatives, should they come to pass, is the United States has two almost opposed legal doctrines that govern immigration,” Skrentny said. “One of them is called the plenary power, and that’s the idea that in the case of immigration, the executive branch and Congress can pretty much do what they want.”

The other legal doctrine Skrentny pointed to is the 14th Amendment, which guarantees people, not just citizens, the due process of law.

“Having said that the law is whatever the judges say it is,” Skrentny said. “So, a lot of folks thought that Roe v. Wade was settled law. Turns out that it wasn’t.”

The Trump administration has taken unprecedented actions on immigration, such as invoking the Alien Enemies Act earlier this year.

“One would have to be concerned that they do it in a way that follows the law and does it in a systematic and fair way,” Skerry said. “The way they’ve been going, I have real doubts about that.”

The Trump administration has not always abided by laws or court rulings.

“Judges are just people sitting behind [a desk] and they’re just making pronouncements,” Skrentny said. “They don’t have an army, they don’t have a security force, they can’t enforce their opinions. And so, I don’t know what’s going to happen. I don’t think anyone who will tell you that they know what’s going to happen is being honest. Really, we’re in uncharted territory.”

Meanwhile, revoking people’s green cards is a possibility.

“It’s clear that green cards are revocable, have been revoked in specific instances, and they can and will do that,” Skerry said. “The question is, will they do it fairly following procedures, or do it in the kind of slipshod way that they seem to be doing most things when it comes to immigration policies.”

Stripping a person of citizenship is a much different process and can be very complex.

Impact of immigration change

The president’s immigration policies have had several implications on the country, including a reduction in the workforce, GDP loss and some have even pointed to added cost of living.

“There will be negative impacts if we curtail immigration,” Skerry said. “There already are negative impacts. The president himself has acknowledged that at various points.”

Immigration is a topic that continues to divide Americans at a time where many Americans believe the country is more divided than ever.

“If everyone was getting their news from Straight Arrow News, then maybe we wouldn’t have that problem,” Skrentny said. “But that’s not the case at this time. So, it’s a difficult world we live in where people have different sets of facts.”",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2247918723_Pete_MarovichGetty_Images_clean.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 00:56:21.911167

Olivia Vivanco was born and still lives in Mexico City, but the path that led her to photograph migration, she likes to say, “arrived almost by coincidence.” In the late 1990s, while working on projects about childhood, she began visiting schools attended by the children of migrant farmworkers—families from Guerrero, Oaxaca, or Chiapas who traveled north to Nayarit or Sinaloa following the agricultural seasons. She remembers her surprise at seeing entire families working side by side: “Parents, children, siblings—all part of the same labor force.”

The topic reappeared years later, around 2012, when Central American migration dominated public attention—La Bestia, kidnappings, assaults, and the San Fernando massacre. A friend from the Jesuit Migrant Service encouraged her to volunteer at shelters, and that is how she arrived at La 72 in Tenosique, Tabasco.

“At first, I didn’t go as a photographer, but as a volunteer. But being there I realized that this space—which hardly appeared in migration narratives—was also part of the story. Until then, I had seen many images of train tracks, accidents, pain, but in the shelters I found something different: an everyday life where bonds are built, where you can chat while washing dishes or sweeping the patio. I realized that things also happened there, but from a more intimate, more human place.”

Photography entered her life early. At seventeen she tagged along with a friend to a class and was the one who stayed. A cousin later gave her an enlarger and lab equipment, and she taught herself black-and-white photography. Though she abandoned it for a time, the desire for personal, thematic projects never left. When she returned to photography, she began again from scratch—this time with purpose. She cites Lewis Hine for his ability to expose child labor and provoke real social change. But a decisive encounter was with photographer and curator Javier Ramírez Limón, who helped her understand that “formal decisions had to be at the service of the subject, not at the service of a personal style.”

Migration remained her central subject because it never stopped changing. “No year is like the previous one,” she explains. The south differs from the north; a first crossing differs from a second or a tenth. In the south she saw people already harmed by their first contact with Mexico; in the north she met travelers who had endured months of uncertainty, violence, and fear. Over time she came to realize that photography alone could not capture the entire story.

“That constant transformation has kept me interested in the topic and has also transformed my way of narrating: There were moments when I understood that photography could not contain everything, especially what is not seen —the disappearances, the waiting, the uncertainty. That’s when I started incorporating video, interviews, objects, and records of empty spaces. I am interested in speaking about migration through its silences and its material traces.”

Her encounters with migrants map out the shifts in global movement. In the early years most came from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. There were occasional Nicaraguans, Cubans, or Africans. But today the landscape is vast: Venezuelans, Colombians, Ecuadorians, Haitians—many of whom lived for years in Brazil or Chile before moving north. She recalls meeting Haitian workers who built stadiums for the 2014 World Cup and later found themselves stranded in Tijuana. In recent years she has met Ukrainians and Russians fleeing war or conscription. “Every year, nationalities become more diverse and the stories more complex.”

People share with her a wide range of reasons for leaving. “From domestic or gender violence to extortion, protection rackets, loss of property, or generalized impoverishment. There are also those who flee due to disagreement with their governments or simply because they cannot find conditions for a dignified life. There are very painful stories of people crossing the Darién and losing companions along the way; women who are assaulted; children who carry memories of scenes no child should witness. But deep down, all of these stories share the search for a better life. Yes, for economic prosperity, but mainly for peace.”

Some stories, though, remain particularly painful. “In Mexicali I met several elderly Mexican men who had been deported. They had spent most of their lives in the United States. They migrated when they were young, formed families there, had children and grandchildren, and suddenly, for a minimal infraction —sometimes a traffic violation— they were sent back to a country they no longer recognized as their own. Here they have no family ties, no access to work or social security. Age leaves them out of the labor market, and a technological gap even separates them from their loved ones.”

As Olivia explains, these are men aging in a territory that feels foreign, without support networks, without a clear future. “Many fall into depression or illness, without access to medical care. It is a silent form of uprooting. Their stories hurt me deeply because they are rarely told, but they are also migration: stories of forced return and loss of belonging.”

One of her most emotional photographs came from her series Reliquias, made at La 72. She was drawn to the tiny backpacks migrants carry, curious about the objects important enough to accompany someone across continents. She asked migrants to show her something they considered a personal treasure. Fredy, from Honduras, wanted to show her a photograph of his daughter, but discovered he had lost it. Heartbroken, he surprised her by asking to proceed anyway. “He told me to write his daughter’s name—Astrid—on his hand,” she remembers. “Even though he no longer had the image, she was still with him.”

Olivia works primarily in shelters across Mexico—Tecún Umán, Tapachula, Tenosique, Ixtepec, Hidalgo, Tlaxcala, Mexico City, Tijuana, Mexicali, Altar, Ciudad Juárez, Saltillo, Piedras Negras, Nuevo Laredo. “I do not accompany migrants on their routes,” she explains. “My work happens in shelters, where they stop for hours or days and it’s possible to build bonds of trust. There, we coexist, share tasks, converse. From these spaces I have also developed a project parallel to photography: Collecting objects migrants leave behind on the road. I do this together with migrants who, based on their own experience, help validate that these objects belonged to other travelers. It is a different way of narrating transit, through the material traces left behind.”

In recent years I have also worked in improvised camps in Mexico City. Faced with the lack of shelter capacity, many people —especially Venezuelan or Haitian families— have been forced to remain on the street, in very precarious conditions, without access to basic services or safety. These places have also become part of the current migratory landscape.

“Unfortunately, many of the areas migrants travel through are also territories controlled by organized crime or networks linked to drug trafficking. In the north of the country I have had a couple of difficult experiences; situations of threat and surveillance that at one point made me reconsider the topic,” she explains.

But in those contexts, Olivia’s priority has always been collective safety. “I adhere to the recommendations of shelter coordinators, not only for my own protection but above all to avoid putting migrants at risk. Many are already fleeing violence or direct threats; the last thing I can allow is for my presence or work to worsen their vulnerability.”

Rather than learning to prepare for danger, Olivia has learned to recognize limits. “I know when it’s time to leave, and to trust those who know the terrain. Prudence and respect, I believe, are the best forms of care.”

Ethics guide everything she does.

“In my work in migrant houses, I decided years ago to avoid photographing people. This choice came from my disagreement with how the media often portrayed migrants: extremely close-up, in moments of exhaustion, hunger, or sadness. It made me uncomfortable how those representations could revictimize or even criminalize them. I thought that, if I were in such a situation —far from my country, in transit, without access to basic necessities— I wouldn’t want to be portrayed that way. That’s why I chose to speak about migration through spaces: shelters, objects, the material traces people leave as they pass. In those traces their presence is there, in a respectful way, showing without exposing.”

When conducting interviews or more personal conversations, Olivia always introduces herself and clearly explains what she is doing and why. “I ask if they want to share their name or prefer to remain anonymous, and I absolutely respect their decision. I am not interested in exposing, but in accompanying. For me, their trust is invaluable.”

Olivia is interested in making visible the spaces where migration happens “beyond the route or the train, and also other moments of migrants’ lives.” She believes documentary photography remains necessary precisely because it does something that artificial intelligence or media discourse cannot: “be present, listen, observe, and transform that experience into a visual testimony.”

Defining her work ethic, she says, “My responsibility is not to put people at risk, but rather to protect their identity, and to ensure they maintain agency within the narrative.” Olivia thinks of photography as an act of co-creation. “It is a process in which my work does not stand on its own without the collaboration of the other.”

In the case of migration, Olivia is interested in reaching as many people as possible, “broad audiences, not only specialized ones.” Her images and projects have been shared in academic spaces, civil society media and exhibitions, “but something I value especially is when the work sparks conversations, generates questions or produces shared knowledge.” As she explains, “Photography alone doesn’t tell everything; that’s why I think it’s important to also speak, to convey what migrants share with me during my stays, their vulnerabilities and their resilience.”

Oliva hopes that her images serve as a starting point for reflection about human rights, the needs of people in transit, the absence of governmental attention or institutional abandonment in the search for missing migrants. “My work is only the tip of the thread: behind every image there is a complex weave of stories, violence, resistance and hope that is not seen by those far from the topic.” Projects like MigraPalabra, a zine created with Pablo Landa and Mi Valedor, expand this purpose by centering migrants’ own voices and creativity.

“In places like Mexico City, where there are strong prejudices toward migrant camps, it is evident how media discourse often stays at the surface. There is talk of overcrowding or dirt, but rarely is it mentioned that the lack of basic services —water, toilets, minimum care— is the responsibility of the State, not of those forced to live in those conditions. I want my work to open those conversations, to allow migration to be seen from its complexity and not from misinformation or fear.”

Her projects have received a generous international reception. Reliquias has traveled across the Americas, Europe, and Africa, published widely, and awarded in Colombia and Mexico. Her work in shelters, part of the De Paso project, has appeared in Colombia, Chile, Mexico, and is included in the XV IBERO Puebla Biennial of Contemporary Art 2025. Her exhibition Pausas en el Camino at the Sonora Museum of Art has resonated deeply, especially with young viewers who value seeing migration “from another perspective—places where sometimes nothing happens, or through objects that speak of everyday transit without showing people.”

She is now reviewing twelve years of work, planning a publication where her photographs dialogue with voices from architecture, literature, human rights, and shelter coordinators. She envisions a broader conversation in which images are just one thread. She is also preparing a traveling exhibition to reach new audiences.

Looking ahead, she intends to continue exploring migration, visiting shelters she has yet to know, documenting spaces with distinct challenges and dynamics. “I deeply respect all the migrants I have met; men, women, children who have left their country, their home, their family, and who have traveled dangerous routes and endured extremely harsh experiences with the hope of a better life. That decision —to leave, to try despite everything— is in itself worthy of respect.”

Olivia is also grateful for the volunteers, religious women and men, human rights defenders, “people who have made this work their way of life,” she says. “Many of them not only care for people in the shelters; they also remain attentive to their journeys, even when the people are already in other countries.”

Working in shelters has taught her valuable lessons, including the value of presence and accompaniment. “Every shelter, every migrant house, has its own dynamics and rhythms, very delicate stories and being received there is an act of generosity.” Volunteer work is very fulfilling, she says. “I believe what people most appreciate is daily accompaniment. And although I do not have professional training for emotional support, I can listen and offer time. I have learned not to impose my needs on theirs, to adapt myself, and to be there only as far as I am allowed.”

As for what transit countries must do, she is clear. “I believe they must assume the responsibility of guaranteeing the safety and free transit of migrants. They should not be harassed, assaulted or exploited. Unfortunately, in Mexico violence affects the entire population, but in the case of migrants it is often doubled, from organized crime and, many times, also from authorities. Those who should protect them —immigration institutions, police, security forces— too often become those who extort, threaten or abuse.”

As Olivia remarks, “countries have the obligation to protect all people on their territory, even temporarily. It’s not only about allowing them to pass, but ensuring that passage is safe, dignified, without violence, and with full respect for human rights. Migrants should be treated like any citizen in terms of basic rights: access to services, protection, emergency attention. Essentially, it’s about recognizing their humanity.”

Ultimately, Olivia Vivanco’s work is a sustained act of witnessing—one that listens to what migration leaves unsaid and shines light on the resilient lives crossing Mexico in search of peace.

He said he thought he could use his experience working as a defense attorney in Afghanistan to contribute to American society.","The Trump administration is promising an even tougher anti-immigration agenda after an Afghan national was being charged in the shooting this week of two National Guard members, with new restrictions targeting the tens of thousands of Afghans resettled in the U.S. and those seeking to come, many of whom served alongside American soldiers in the two-decade war.

But those still waiting to come were already facing stricter measures as part of President Donald Trump’s sweeping crackdown on legal and illegal migration that began when he started his second term in January. And the Afghan immigrants living in the U.S. and now in the administration’s crosshairs were among the most extensively vetted, often undergoing years of security screening, experts and advocates say.

The suspected shooter, who worked with the CIA during the Afghanistan War, “was vetted both before he landed, probably once he landed, once he applied for asylum,” said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute. “But more importantly, he was almost certainly vetted extensively and much more by the CIA.”

Haris Tarin, a former U.S. official who worked on the Biden-era program that resettled Afghans, predicted that ""as the investigation unfolds, you will see that this is not a failure of screening. This is a failure of us not being able to integrate — not just foreign intelligence and military personnel — but our own veterans, over the past 25 years.”

The program Operations Allies Welcome initially brought roughly 76,000 Afghans to the United States, many of whom had worked alongside American troops and diplomats as interpreters and translators. The initiative was in place for around one year before shifting to a longer-term program called Operation Enduring Welcome. Almost 200,000 Afghans have been resettled in the U.S. under both programs.

Among those brought to the U.S. under the program was the alleged shooter, 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who now faces a first-degree murder charge in the death of 20-year-old Specialist Sarah Beckstrom. The other National Guard member who was shot, 24-year-old Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, remains in critical condition.

Those resettlements are now on hold. The State Department has temporarily stopped issuing visas for all people traveling on Afghan passports, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced late Friday on X.

Trump and his allies have seized on the shooting to criticize gaps in the U.S. vetting process and the speed of admissions, even though some Republicans spent the months and years after the 2021 withdrawal criticizing the Biden administration for not moving fast enough to approve some applications from Afghan allies.

CIA Director John Ratcliffe said Lakanwal “should have never been allowed to come here,” Trump called lax migration policies “the single greatest national security threat facing our nation,” and Vice President JD Vance said Biden’s policy was “opening the floodgate to unvetted Afghan refugees.”

That rhetoric quickly turned into policy announcements, with Trump saying he would ""permanently pause all migration” from a list of nearly 20 countries, “terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions,” and “remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States.” Many of these changes had already been set in motion through a series of executive orders over the past 10 months, including most recently in June.

“They are highlighting practices that were already going into place,” said Andrea Flores, a lawyer who was an immigration policy adviser in the Obama and Biden administrations.

Lakanwal applied for asylum during the Biden administration, and his request was approved in April of this year after undergoing a thorough vetting, according to #AfghanEvac, a group that helps resettle Afghans who assisted the U.S. during the war.

Flores said the system has worked across administrations: “You may hear people say, ‘Well, he was granted asylum under Trump. This is Trump’s problem.’ That’s not how our immigration system works. It relies on the same bedding. No asylum laws have really been changed by Congress.”

Trump and other U.S. officials have used the attack to demand a re-examination for everyone who came to the U.S. from Afghanistan, a country he called “a hellhole on Earth” on Thursday.

“These policies were already creating widespread disruption and fear among lawfully admitted families. What’s new and deeply troubling is the attempt to retroactively tie all of this to one act of violence in a way that casts suspicion on entire nationalities, including Afghan allies who risked their lives to protect our troops,” Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Global Refuge, said in a statement Friday.

This has left the nearly 200,000 Afghans who are currently living across the U.S. in deep fear and shame over the actions of one person in their community. Those in the U.S. are now worrying about their legal status being revoked, while others in the immigration pipeline here and abroad are waiting in limbo.

Nesar, a 22-year-old Afghan who arrived in America weeks after the fall of Kabul, said he had just begun to assimilate into life in the U.S. when the attack happened on Wednesday. He agreed to speak to The Associated Press on condition that only his first name be used for fear of reprisals or targeting by immigration officials.

“Life was finally getting easier for me. I’ve learned to speak English. I found a better job,” he said. “But after this happened two days ago, I honestly went to the grocery store this morning, and I was feeling so uncomfortable among all of those people. I was like, maybe they’re now looking at me the same way as the shooter.”

Two days before the shooting, Nesar and his father, who worked for the Afghan president during the war, had received an interview date of Dec. 13 for their green card application, a moment he said they had been working toward for four years. However, he says it is now unclear if their application will move forward or if their interview will take place.

Another Afghan national, who also spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, said that after fearing for his life under Taliban rule, he felt a sense of peace and hope when he finally received a special immigrant visa to come to the U.S. two years ago.

He said he thought he could use his experience working as a defense attorney in Afghanistan to contribute to American society. But now, he says the actions of an “extremist who, despite benefiting from the safety and livelihood provided by this country, ungratefully attacked two American soldiers,” he and other Afghans will once again face scrutiny.

“It seems that whenever a terrorist commits a crime, its shadow falls upon me simply because I am from Afghanistan,” he added.

VANESSA ROMO, BYLINE: Hi, Scott.
She was an Army specialist with the National Guard, and she joined the service just a couple of years ago in 2023.
She was just 20 years old and was from Summersville, West Virginia.
What is the Trump administration saying and doing in response?","SCOTT DETROW, HOST:

West Virginia held a moment of silence this afternoon for the National Guard members who were shot in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday. One of the two has died. A second remains in critical condition. And here to give us the latest on the shooting and the investigation is NPR's Vanessa Romo. Hi, Vanessa.

VANESSA ROMO, BYLINE: Hi, Scott.

DETROW: What do we know about the Guard member who died yesterday?

ROMO: Her name is Sarah Beckstrom. She was an Army specialist with the National Guard, and she joined the service just a couple of years ago in 2023. She was just 20 years old and was from Summersville, West Virginia. Obviously, her family is devastated by the tragedy. And in a post on Facebook, Beckstrom's father called her his baby girl and said that she had passed to glory.

Also, West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey said in a statement earlier today that Beckstrom had made, quote, ""the ultimate sacrifice in service to her state and the nation."" He added that both Beckstrom and Sergeant Andrew Wolfe, the second victim who remains in critical condition, had actually stepped forward and volunteered for the mission in D.C.

DETROW: What is the latest on the investigation? What do we know about the suspect at this point?

ROMO: His name is Rahmanullah Lakanwal, and he's an Afghan national. And he's himself hospitalized after the shooting. He is 29 years old, and he was just 5 when the war in Afghanistan started. He immigrated to the U.S. in 2021, when the U.S. withdrew from the country and the Taliban toppled the government there.

According to a nonprofit that works with Afghan refugees, Lakanwal actually served in an elite counterterrorism unit that was called Zero Unit that was operated by the CIA. And Human Rights Watch reports that these specialized units, which were recruited and trained by the CIA, were used to carry out extremely violent clandestine missions. And CIA director John Ratcliffe confirmed that it's because of the work that Lakanwal did fighting against the Taliban for the U.S. that he and his family were allowed to flee here.

And U.S. officials say he's been living with his wife and children in Bellingham, Washington. After about four years, he was granted asylum just this past April. And as far as the investigation goes, that is ongoing. Officials are looking for leads in the U.S. and abroad. And at the moment, there's no clear motive in terms of what prompted him to drive nearly 3,000 miles across the country and launch the ambush.

DETROW: And this attack is playing out in our politics already. What is the Trump administration saying and doing in response?

ROMO: So the administration has already halted the processing of any immigration request from Afghan nationals. Plus, the head of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Joe Edlow, announced a, quote, ""full scale, rigorous reexamination of every green card for every alien from every country of concern."" In a statement, USCIS referred to 19 different countries that the administration already declared required extra vetting. A proclamation earlier this year restricted travel from immigrants and nonimmigrants to the U.S.

And we should also note that the Trump administration halted refugee resettlement from Afghanistan on the very first day of his second term. And late last night, Trump wrote on Truth Social that, quote, ""refugee burden is the leading cause of social dysfunction in America."" And then he went on to blame immigrants for crime and using federal benefits. And he called out legal green card holders for getting support. Trump also said that he's going to, quote, ""permanently pause migration from all third world countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover."" But it's not clear if this goes further than what has already been announced, or if additional policy changes are coming.

DETROW: That is NPR's Vanessa Romo. Thank you so much for the latest.

The case was assigned to U.S. district court Judge Paula Xinis, and on April 4, she issued an order granting the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.
The government asked the Fourth Circuit to stay Judge Xinis’s order, noting in its Emergency Motion: “The United States does not have control over Abrego Garcia.
Both the criminal case and the case before Judge Xinis remain pending.
As I explained above, statutory withholding is country specific, but no minute order appears in the record in his federal court case.","Politico reported last week from the ongoing hearings in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt, Md., on the government’s attempts to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an alleged MS-13 member whose removal to El Salvador in the spring triggered a national firestorm. Apparently, 30 weeks later, the judge hearing the case realized something I reported on in early April – though the implications may not be quite what she thinks they are.

The Kilmar Abrego-Garcia Saga

This case became national news on April 1, the New York Times reported: “A Maryland man who was in the United States legally was deported to El Salvador and imprisoned there because of an ‘administrative error.’”

The “Maryland man” is Abrego, a Salvadoran national alleged by both local authorities and the federal government to be a member of MS-13.

He entered illegally in March 2012, and but was only taken into custody by ICE in March 2019, based both on his illegal status and purported evidence linking him to MS-13, a violent criminal organization with its roots in Los Angeles and a significant presence in El Salvador and elsewhere.

In April 2019, an immigration judge (IJ) in Baltimore denied Abrego’s bond request, finding the evidence in the case “shows that he is a verified member of MS-13”. He appealed that bond denial, but the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) adopted and affirmed what it referred to as the IJ’s “danger ruling” eight months later.

While in detained removal proceedings, Abrego through counsel filed an application for asylum, “statutory withholding” of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).

That application was assigned to a second IJ, who on October 10, 2019, granted Abrego’s statutory withholding application but denied his applications for asylum and CAT.

Abrego Garcia was released following that grant, but rearrested by ICE on March 12, 2025, and sent to an ICE detention facility in Texas.

Thereafter, he was removed to the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) in El Salvador sometime around March 16 under an agreement (the terms of which are still undisclosed) the administration struck with the government of that country.

On March 24 – nine days after he arrived in El Salvador – Abrego, his wife, and child, through counsel, filed a “Complaint for Injunctive Relief and Declaratory Judgment” in federal district court in Maryland.

The case was assigned to U.S. district court Judge Paula Xinis, and on April 4, she issued an order granting the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. That order formed the basis of DOJ’s later appeal to the Fourth Circuit, and ultimately its application to the Supreme Court.

Specifically, Judge Xinis directed the government to “facilitate and effectuate the return of ... Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to the United States by no later than 11:59 PM on Monday, April 7, 2025”.

By ordering the government to “effectuate” the return of Abrego Garcia, the judge was demanding the administration to engage in expedited diplomatic negotiations with El Salvador and requiring that those negotiations result in the return of Abrego Garcia – again, a Salvadoran citizen – to the United States before April 8.

The government asked the Fourth Circuit to stay Judge Xinis’s order, noting in its Emergency Motion: “The United States does not have control over Abrego Garcia. Or the sovereign nation of El Salvador.”

A three-judge circuit panel denied that motion on April 7, forcing DOJ to quickly file an application to vacate Judge Xinis’s order with Chief Justice John Roberts, the circuit justice for the Fourth Circuit.

The chief justice issued an administrative stay of the district court order to give the Court the chance to consider the government’s application, and on April 10, all nine justices weighed in.

The Court noted Judge Xinis’s order “properly requires the Government to ‘facilitate’ Abrego Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador”.

Nonetheless, the justices remanded the case to Judge Xinis to “clarify” her demand that the government “effectuate” the alien’s return, “with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs”.

While Abrego was in El Salvador, on May 21, a grand jury in Tennessee handed down an indictment in U.S. v. Abrego Garcia, charging him with conspiracy to transport aliens under section 274(a)(1)(A)(v)(I) of the INA and “unlawful transportation of illegal aliens” under section 274(a)(1)(A)(ii) of the INA.

That indictment was unsealed by order of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee on June 6, the same day Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Abrego had been returned to the United States to answer those charges.

Both the criminal case and the case before Judge Xinis remain pending.

Back to the Beginning

Remember, Abrego – through counsel – was the petitioner in the Maryland case, and as such bore the burden of showing that he had been improperly removed from the United States to El Salvador.

To establish that he had been improperly removed, Abrego submitted a 14-page decision issued by the second IJ to hear his case on October 10, 2019. That was the only proof of that fact he offered, but as I explained on April 4, having read that order it appeared the IJ had granted Abrego statutory withholding to Guatemala, not El Salvador.

Notably, in the “conclusion” paragraph in that decision, the second IJ explained:

DHS has not shown that there are changed circumstances in Guatemala that would result in the Respondent’s life not being threatened, or that internal relocation is possible and reasonable under the circumstances. Therefore, the Respondent’s application for withholding under the Act is granted. [Emphasis added.]

Guatemala and El Salvador are two different countries, and while no transcript of the hearings before Judge Xinis appears in the record, I assume that the attorney representing DOJ admitted that Abrego was removed from the United States due to administrative error.

Lawyers owe a duty of candor to the court, and perhaps that lawyer knew some extrinsic facts that aren’t in the record. If, however, the DOJ lawyer relied on the October 10, 2019, decision from the second IJ, that admission may have been in error.

Statutory withholding is “country-specific”, in that it prevents the government from deporting an alien granted that protection to the country or countries from which the IJ or BIA withheld removal.

In fact, the regulation governing statutory withholding, 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16, states in its final subsection (f): “Nothing in this section . . . shall prevent [DHS] from removing an alien to a third country other than the country to which removal has been withheld or deferred.”

“An Immigration Court Error 6 Years Ago Could Lead to Release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia”

Which brings me to the Politico article, headlined “An immigration court error 6 years ago could lead to release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia”.

The article quotes Judge Xinis as stating in open court on November 20:

There is no order of removal in the docket, in the record . . .. You can’t fake it ‘til you make it. You got to have it. … You have to have the order. It’s got to be an order memorialized somewhere and I don’t have it.

The “order” Judge Xinis is apparently referring to is what’s commonly known as a “minute order”, a preprinted document the second IJ would have (or should have) issued when he issued his October 10, 2019, decision.

As I explained back on April 4:

While the judge’s memorandum of decision and order is enlightening, it conveys no legal authority in and of itself. At the time he issued it, the immigration judge should also have issued a separate preprinted form referred to as a “minute order”, which does have legal authority.

On that form, the immigration judge would have checked boxes showing he denied asylum and CAT, but granted statutory withholding, which Abrego Garcia would have needed to present to prove that he had lawful status in the United States.

That minute order, however, would also have shown that Abrego Garcia was ordered removed and listed the country to which removal was ordered but withheld. As I explained above, statutory withholding is country specific, but no minute order appears in the record in his federal court case.

Abrego was represented by counsel in his removal proceedings before the second IJ, and if the second IJ failed to issue a minute order it was up to that lawyer to ask the court to prepare and serve one.

This isn’t a mere “paperwork” issue: Abrego needed that document to prove he was here lawfully and to apply for work authorization. He had every reason to request one, and again that minute order – not the October 10, 2019, decision – was the proof Abrego needed when he filed his complaint with Judge Xinis in March to prove the government had unlawfully removed him to El Salvador.

Faking It Until Making It

Respectfully, everybody in this case has been faking it until they can make it in this case, or nobody is. And in my opinion, nobody is; they are just a little unclear on the law.

By precedent, an order of removal was a “condition precedent”, a crucial step the second IJ was required to take before he could grant Abrego statutory withholding.

The precedent in question is the BIA’s 2008 opinion in Matter of I-S- & C-S-, where the Board held: “When an Immigration Judge issues a decision granting an alien’s application for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the [INA], without a grant of asylum, the decision must include an explicit order of removal.”

It’s possible the second IJ never issued a minute order in Abrego’s case (I had plenty of other issues with his decision), but I doubt it and if there is one, it’s in his alien file (A-file) and in the immigration court Record of Proceedings (ROP) -- and it will clarify whether withholding was granted to El Salvador or Guatemala.

Somebody may want to check out Abrego’s A-file and ROP, but considering that precedent and the second IJ’s decision, I’d argue that even absent a minute order, the second IJ de jure had to have ordered Abrego removed to grant him statutory withholding, and that he granted withholding to Guatemala.

But respectfully, Judge Xinis could have spared everyone a lot of drama and court time if she had simply asked Abrego – who again bore the initial burden of proof in the case – for the minute order in his case before she did anything else.

Not that I blame her for failing to do so. Section 242 of the INA governs judicial review in immigration cases, and Congress therein largely cut district courts out of the process. Cases like this are terra incognita for most trial-level federal court judges (which is why they may want to be circumspect when they do consider them).

In April, I noted two key defects in Abrego v. Noem: an IJ decision that appeared to withhold Abrego’s removal to Guatemala, not El Salvador; and the absence in the record of a minute order, a legal document that would clarify the issue.

I’m dumbfounded that only now – after this case was considered by 13 different federal judges (one district, three circuit, and nine justices) and thousands of gallons of ink were spilled examining every aspect of Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s life – has Judge Xinis identified the same issues I did 30 weeks ago. But the ultimate result may not be what she thinks it is.",https://cis.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/kilmar-tattoos.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 20:56:48.520538

In a fiery post on Truth Social, Trump vowed to terminate millions of immigration cases approved under the Biden administration and deport any foreign national deemed a security risk, public charge or ""non-compatible with Western civilization.""

THE LATEST | President Trump says one of two National Guard members shot on Wednesday has died

The Trump administration has already suspended all immigration applications from Afghan nationals. On Friday, the State Department also immediately paused issuing visas to those traveling on Afghan passports.

""Afghans are terrified that they're going to be held accountable for this one deranged gunman's actions, and they don't know what to do. They know that it's not their fault. They know they didn't do this. They know that. That Afghans don't wish to cause Americans harm,"" Shawn VanDiver, founder and President of AfghanEvac, told Scripps News.

While Trump did not identify which specific countries would be targeted in his plan, the head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Joseph Edlow said the agency has been ordered to take enhanced steps to screen migrants from ""high-risk"" countries.

The agency pointed to a June proclamation that listed countries from which the U.S. banned and restricted travel, including nations across Africa, the Middle East, the Caribbean and parts of Asia.

Trump said on Truth Social an influx of refugees is the ""leading cause of social dysfunction in America"" and appeared to blame migrants for higher crime. However, this claim has been increasingly debunked by migration policy experts.

According to an annual review of criminology report, ""high concentrations of immigrants are not associated with increased levels of crime and delinquency across neighborhoods and cities in the United States.""

Sumith Gunasekera was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers on Nov. 12 in Detroit, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a press release.

Gunasekera is an assistant professor of marketing at Ferris State, in Big Rapids, Michigan, according to the university's website. He holds a bachelor's degree in physics from the University of Colombo in Sri Lanka and a Ph.D. in statistics from the University of Nevada.

""Ferris State University leaders on Tuesday became aware of accusations regarding professor Sumith Gunasekera,"" said Dave Murray, FSU associate vice president for Marketing and Communications Dave Murray said in a statement. ""He has been placed on administrative leave while the university gathers more information. This is a personnel issue and it would be inappropriate for the university to further discuss the matter.""

Federal authorities said Gunasekera entered the U.S. in February 1998, then went to Canada. In August 1998, he was arrested by police in Brampton, Ontario, and accused of making death threats.

Three days later he was arrested again in Canada on charges of invitation to sexual touching and sexual interference. DHS said Gunasekera admitted to officers that this case involved a minor. He was convicted in November 1998 and sentenced to one month behind bars and one year of probation.

He was also arrested in September 2003 by law enforcement in Las Vegas and accused of open and gross lewdness, DHS said. He was convicted in January 2004 of disorderly conduct.

“It's sickening that a sex offender was working as a professor on an American college campus and was given access to vulnerable students to potentially victimize them,” said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “Thanks to the brave ICE law enforcement officers, this sicko is behind bars and no longer able to prey on Americans.""

Authorities said Gunasekera had been in the U.S. on a student visa. When he applied for a change of status with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, authorities realized he had been convicted of crimes in Canada.

""Over the years Gunasekera repeatedly attempted to manipulate our immigration system between applications, denials, and appeals despite the convictions in Canada that made him ineligible for legal status in the United States,"" DHS said in the release.

Officials said he remains in ICE custody as he awaits immigration proceedings.

“Justice works very differently in Turkey if you’re Kurdish,” Gurtovaia said.
A U.S. immigration judge did not find him to be a high-risk individual, and the couple was waiting for his next immigration court date in January, she said.
Those and other plans shattered after immigration agents detained Abak Tuesday, just a day before her naturalization ceremony.","UPTOWN – When Eva Gurtovaia walked into the hallway of the Dirksen Federal Building Wednesday afternoon, a few neighbors and a local alderman cheered and embraced her.

She had just become a U.S. citizen. With a soft smile and teary eyes, she hugged her newly met Uptown neighbors, thanking them for being there.

Ald. Angela Clay (46th) and staffer Eleana Molise gave her a colorful bouquet of flowers and a card. Neighbors greeted her with signs that read “Go, Eva! You’re so courageous” and “Yay, Eva.”

But the celebratory mood was clouded by the detention of her husband, Enes Abak. “Her soulmate, her everything,” was not there to celebrate the long-awaited date.

That is because on Tuesday, at least six immigration agents detained him at the couple’s home in the 4600 block of North Kenmore Street, said Eleana Molise, director of housing and community services for the 46th Ward.

Molise arrived at the block after neighbors and members of the local rapid response group reported the presence of four unmarked vehicles and agents wearing ICE vests early Tuesday.

According to a neighbor, Abak walked out of his house around 7:30 a.m. Tuesday carrying coffee and cigarettes when he was detained in what appeared to be a targeted operation, Molise said.

Abak, 29, is Kurdish, the largest and most discriminated-against minority group in Turkey, according to the Minority Rights Group. Since the 90s, hundreds of thousands of Kurdish people have been internally displaced or left the country to escape violence. The group estimates up to 3 million Kurdish people have been displaced.

Speaking Kurdish is forbidden in Turkey, as is naming children with Kurdish names, according to Gurtovia and media reports. And the State Department said there were credible reports of human rights issues and persecution of Kurdish people in a 2023 report.

Fearing for his life, Abak fled Turkey and arrived in the United States in 2022. He was paroled into the country and had a pending political asylum application, Gurtovaia said.

“We never missed a court date. We were very responsible. We were following every letter of the law,” she said.

Earlier this year, he attended an immigration court hearing where he shared why he had fled the country.

He was persecuted by local authorities, had spent time incarcerated and feared for his life, Gurtovaia said.

“He’s a wonderful young man, but unfortunately, because of his nationality, he faced very difficult times in Turkey. He was followed by [authorities] and that’s why he even served time in jail,” she said.

When he was released, he feared he could be detained without reason again and without money, he and his family would have no means to defend him.

In recent years, human rights watchdogs have denounced the unjust incarceration of Kurdish people. Last year, Turkish authorities sentenced 24 Kurdish politicians to nine to 42 years of prison on bogus charges of crimes against the state, according to the nonprofit Human Rights Watch.

“Justice works very differently in Turkey if you’re Kurdish,” Gurtovaia said.

Abak has no criminal history in the United States, she said. A U.S. immigration judge did not find him to be a high-risk individual, and the couple was waiting for his next immigration court date in January, she said.

Yet, it appears immigration authorities detained him over his arrest in Turkey, Gurtovaia said. While seeking information about his whereabouts, an immigration officer told a family member he had been detained “because he had an open case in Turkey,” related to his arrest, she said.

“I don’t understand how you can grab a person for that, because that’s why this person is afraid of his life and that’s why he’s asking the American government to protect him,” she said.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to Block Club’s request for comment.

‘We Both Have A Dream’

Abak and Gurtovaia met in 2023 on a dating app and “fell in love immediately,” she said, smiling through her tears.

Abak works as a manager in auto body shop and Gurtovaia is a teacher in a Russian-speaking educational center. On the side, they both work as rideshare or delivery drivers to earn additional income, desperately needed to pay fees and legal expenses for both of their immigration cases and to build a family together.

“We both have a dream. I have dreams that I have a son who will be like his father and he has a dream that he will have a daughter who will be like me,” she said.

Gurtovaia was born in Russia and is half Ukrainian and half Belarusian. She moved to the U.S. in 2017 after receiving a green card through the immigration lottery. Once she was eligible, she applied for citizenship, she said.

The couple got married about a year ago and lived together in Uptown with their two cats. This December, they planned to continue with a costly fertility treatment. Once a U.S. citizen, she had planned to request permanent residency for Abak through a family-based application, she said.

Those and other plans shattered after immigration agents detained Abak Tuesday, just a day before her naturalization ceremony. He was going to join her for the special day, cook traditional food and celebrate with friends Wednesday night.

“Now I’m just worried because I have heard about the conditions in detention centers and I am not even sure that he has access to water,” she said Wednesday.

Abak was transferred to a detention center in El Paso, Texas Wednesday after being taken to ICE’s processing facility in suburban Broadview Tuesday. He remained in detention in Texas as of Friday morning, according to ICE records.

On Thursday, Gurtovaia was able to speak to him after he called briefly. She had worried after not hearing from him for over a day. They both told each other I love you so much, she said. She promised she’d do anything to help him.

Showered with support from neighbors and officials, Gurtovaia has pledged to fight for her husband’s release.

She was referred to a lawyer and has launched a GoFundMe to raise funds for his legal defense, which could cost thousands of dollars between filing fees and attorney costs. Without Abak’s income, she is facing “crushing” financial pressure, according to the GoFundMe page.

“The process is long, painful, and shockingly expensive. I’m giving everything I have—every hour, every ounce of strength—but I cannot do this alone,” the GoFundMe reads.

Abak’s detention unveils the reality of the country’s broken immigration system, Clay said.

“We don’t have a perfect process that people can follow. And even if they do follow that imperfect process that we have, they’re still being targeted and their lives are in jeopardy,” she said.",https://bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/11/IMG_2851-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-11-28 17:56:32.441938

Valerie Brown doesn’t personally know her two classmates at Western International High School who were detained Thursday morning by federal immigration officials and sent to Texas, but that didn’t stop her from helping organize a press conference that became a rally for bringing the students home.

“I have friends who have told me they are afraid to go to school. You shouldn’t be afraid to come to school,” Brown told Chalkbeat after speaking during the press conference, saying the fear is magnified by rumors of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents taking kids “whether they have papers or not.”

“They’re scared to be outside, to be with their friends. They’re kids.”

The press conference was organized to support the two 16-year-old students, who are cousins and attend Western International High School in Southwest Detroit. Outlier Media and Chalkbeat reported Monday that students were born in Venezuela and arrived in the U.S. in 2023. They were taken into custody along with two of their parents when agents raided their home on the Eastide in search of a different migrant.

Brown and others spoke in front of a backdrop at Detroit’s Clark Park. Dozens of people were there, some of them holding signs and shouting “for shame” whenever a speaker brought up something they thought was particularly egregious. All of them called for the release of the teens and the parents.

Some of the speakers, including Valerie, called on school, city, and state officials to be more involved in ensuring the safety of students who fear moving throughout the community because of immigration actions. Some called on the Detroit school district to have an immigration attorney on retainer to assist students who’ve been detained and to ensure students know their rights.

“Instead of the (students) chilling with their friends, they got to be stuck in a detention center with ICE,” Brown said during her speech. “We don’t even know where they’re going. We don’t even know if they’re going to a country that’s theirs or is even safe for them or even if they have family anymore.”

One of the speakers, attorney George Washington, said ICE agents entered the home while the occupants were sleeping. “Suddenly, ICE appears at the door, busts into the place, and tells them that they’re all being arrested.”

All four who were detained had pending asylum petitions, Washington said.

“We have a tremendous immigration lawyer from Detroit who did everything he could,” to assist the four while they remained in Michigan. But, Washington said, they were sent to Texas “too quick.”

“He’s going to continue representing them and we’re going to get them out,” Washington said.

After the event, Sen. Stephanie Chang, a Democrat from Detroit, issued a statement about the detentions:

“I am standing with Detroit teachers, friends, family and community members of these two students in urging their immediate return home to Michigan,” Chang said. “I understand that they have been following the asylum process and have upcoming immigration court dates. ICE should release them and allow them to proceed with the asylum process.”

Many of the youth attending the event were from Western International, located across the street from Clark Park. Others came from schools such as Southeastern, Cass Technical, and Detroit International Academy for Young Women.

Kenneth Russell, who attends Southeastern, was among the speakers.

“It’s better for us to all be connected than apart,” Russell said.

“It’s awful what’s happening,” said Theo Edwards, who’s attended Western for nearly a month. He was holding a sign that said “People are not illegal,” with the “not” underlined. “It’s scary, especially for those who are Hispanic.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ICE-courthouses.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 18:57:00.207699

Zbur, who was among the law’s authors, said the new Office of Civil Rights and the antisemitism coordinator are not intended to punish teachers.
Individuals who feel they’ve been discriminated against can file complaints with the state’s Civil Rights Department or with their local school district.
Still, he’s happy to see the office get off the ground, particularly in light of the federal cuts to civil rights enforcement.","At a time when the federal government is dismantling civil rights protections in K-12 schools, California is expanding them — although some wonder how far the state will go to combat discrimination in schools.

A new law, signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom last month, creates an Office of Civil Rights within the California Department of Education. The office will have a staff of at least six, including an antisemitism coordinator, who will educate school districts about the harms of bias and investigate discrimination complaints.

“I think it’s a good idea and the state of California will pull it off. The risks are small and the possibility for good is large,” said Gary Orfield, co-director of the Civil Rights Project at UCLA. “But for it to be successful, it has to have real responsibility and real power.”

The new law stems from a surge in antisemitic incidents in California last year following the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks in Israel and the ensuing war in Gaza. Authored by Assemblymember Rick Chavez Zbur (D-Los Angeles) and Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay), the law is intended to eliminate anti-Jewish and other bias in the classroom and ensure that students of all ethnicities and religions feel protected.

But the road to Newsom’s desk was not smooth. The bill faced tough opposition from the California Teachers Assn. , the state’s largest teachers union, which argued that the law would limit teachers’ right to free speech by curbing their ability to discuss the conflict in Gaza or other topical issues. The union declined to comment for this article.

Zbur, who was among the law’s authors, said the new Office of Civil Rights and the antisemitism coordinator are not intended to punish teachers. The idea, he said, is to help schools stamp out bullying, discrimination and other acts targeting specific groups of students.

“The idea that this law is about policing is hogwash,” Zbur said. “It’s intended to be productive, to provide districts with resources so they can prevent students from being harmed in school.”

Federal layoffs and closures

Discrimination has long been illegal in California schools. Individuals who feel they’ve been discriminated against can file complaints with the state’s Civil Rights Department or with their local school district. But much K-12 anti-discrimination enforcement has fallen on the federal government’s Office of Civil Rights. Created in the mid-1960s, the office investigates complaints about a range of issues, such as school segregation, unfair discipline practices and whether students with disabilities or English learners are receiving the services they’re entitled to.

In March, the Trump administration announced it was laying off nearly half of the U.S. Department of Education workforce and closing numerous branches of the Office of Civil Rights, including the one in California. That’s meant a steep decline in the number of cases and long delays for those the office investigates. In the three months after the Department of Education cuts, for example, the office received nearly 5,000 complaints but investigated only 309.

On Tuesday, the Department of Education went even further, spinning off some of the agency’s largest responsibilities to other federal departments — including much of the administration of elementary and high school funding. Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s conservative vision for the country that so far Trump has followed, calls for the Office of Civil Rights to become part of the Department of Justice and for it to “reject gender ideology and critical race theory.”

The U.S. Department of Education didn’t respond to a request for comment.

‘Cutting off funding, that’s what works’

California’s new Office of Civil Rights will have a director and several coordinators who will oversee anti-discrimination cases based on race and ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation and religion. The director and anti-discrimination coordinators will be appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Legislature, likely after Jan. 1.

The office will provide schools with materials about preventing discrimination, and work with districts that have been the subject of complaints from students, families or the public. In serious cases, the office will recommend more intensive assistance to the state Department of Education to correct problems. For districts that persistently flout anti-discrimination laws, “the department may use any means necessary to effect compliance,” according to laws already in place. That may include cutting funding for textbooks or other materials found to be discriminatory.

The office will also submit an annual report to the Legislature on the overall picture of discrimination in schools, including the number of complaints, how they were resolved, and their outcomes.

But to be successful, the office will have to be nonpartisan, transparent and fair, Orfield said. Cases against a school should include strong evidence, and schools should have the opportunity to defend themselves and appeal a verdict if they believe it was wrongly issued.

And the office should not shy away from cutting funds to schools that don’t comply, he said. In the 1960s and ‘70s, the federal Office of Civil Rights cut funds to more than 100 schools in the South that refused to desegregate — a move that may have been the only way to force compliance, Orfield said.

“Cutting off funding, that’s what works,” he said. “Although if you’re going to have sanctions, there must be due process.”

Photo ops and reports?

Mark Rosenbaum, senior special counsel for strategic litigation for the public interest law firm Public Counsel, agreed that enforcement will be the key to whether the new office is effective.

“If the office just issues reports and does photo ops, we don’t need another one of those,” Rosenbaum said. “The issue is whether or not they can enforce these rights across the board.”

He’d also like to see the office take a more proactive approach instead of only responding to individuals’ complaints. Education itself, he said, is a civil right, and too many students are not receiving the high-quality lessons in safe, well-equipped schools that they’re entitled to.

Still, he’s happy to see the office get off the ground, particularly in light of the federal cuts to civil rights enforcement.

“There’s an urgency for California to fill a void,” Rosenbaum said. “It should have happened decades ago, but it’s a good start.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9d4a733/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x2671+0+360/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F08%2F5d%2F507d868e474f9c83d1da2dde55b6%2F1522997-me-0920-newsom-immig-bills-gem-003.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 16:56:48.050249

After the Trump administration rewrote ICE policy on July 8 to cut off bond hearings for most locked-up immigrants, emergency lawsuits exploded nationwide.

They came from people who’ve spent years, even decades, in the U.S. with clean records while pursuing asylum or other legal status, who were seized at workplaces, courthouses, and routine check-ins.

In more than 700 cases, at least 225 federal judges have found the change to be likely illegal and a due-process violation—including 23 selected by Trump, 79, according to Politico.

Judges across at least 35 states have bristled at the government’s attempt to treat long-time U.S. residents as if they were still “seeking admission,” triggering mandatory detention once reserved for new arrivals, in a reading that breaks with three decades of practice.

Before July 8, most people in deportation proceedings remained free while their cases wound through immigration courts, an executive-branch system that routinely weighed bond.

One judge likened the logic to insisting a movie-theater gatecrasher is still at the door—an interpretation that dozens of courts have rejected as defying common sense.

Joining the chorus blasting the policy, Clinton-appointed U.S. District Judge Christina Snyder wrote on Nov. 21, “The Court is unable to remain current on all new case authority… given the continued onslaught of litigation.”

In Michigan, Trump appointee Hala Jarbou described more than 100 individual petitions landing in her courtroom before another 97 detainees filed a joint case seeking release, illustrating their sheer volume.

And in Idaho, Clinton-appointed U.S. District Judge Lynn Winmill wrote that “dozens of district courts across the nation—with more each day—have rejected DHS’s expansion of… mandatory detention,” freeing 17 people seized in an Oct. 19 raid, Politico reported.

Broader relief is now taking shape. Federal judges in Massachusetts and Colorado have certified class actions, while a California judge has approved a nationwide class that could force bond hearings for those held under the July policy, according to Politico’s review.

Appeals courts in the 5th and 8th Circuits are being asked to move quickly. At the same time, the administration has urged slower timetables elsewhere—setting up conflicting clocks and a likely sprint to the Supreme Court.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), ICE’s parent agency in charge of migration in the U.S., argues it’s enforcing the statute.

“President Trump and Secretary Noem are now enforcing this law as it was actually written to keep America safe,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Politico in a statement.

McLaughlin told the Daily Beast that Trump and Noem were focused on enforcing the law.

“The Board of Immigration Appeals’ recent ruling vindicating DHS on holding aliens without bond was the final nail in the coffin for Biden’s catch and release policies that dangerously unleashed millions of unvetted illegal aliens into American communities—and they used many loopholes to do so,” she said.

Posted on Truth Social on Thursday after an Afghani national who had worked with the US military shot two National Guard members in Washington, DC, the announcement promised a sweeping freeze on admissions from vast stretches of the Global South.

This is in addition to the cancellation of ‘millions’ of Biden-era approvals. It also vowed to strip non-citizens of federal benefits and subsidies and even denaturalise migrants deemed ‘non-compatible with Western civilisation’.

But behind the headline-grabbing language, some experts say nothing has legally changed, arguing that Trump’s vow is still just rhetoric, with no executive order, no proclamation and no use of the powers needed to make it real.

That, they say, leaves the administration’s earlier actions as the operative policy, which already cast a long shadow over African migration.

But that assertion is countered by Federico Manfredi Firmian, a foreign policy expert and research fellow at the Italian Institute for International Political Studies, who argues that the absence of a formal law doesn’t prevent “rapid administrative action”.

Africa already on the front line of Trump restrictions

In June, the White House reinstated and expanded a nationality-based travel ban that fully blocks most entry categories for 12 countries, seven of them in Africa: Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Libya, Somalia and Sudan.

For nationals of these states, consular officers have minimal discretion. A second tier of states – Burundi, Sierra Leone and Togo – face partial restrictions affecting certain visa classes. Refusal rates have since surged, and even routine applications have become mired in administrative hold.

This new ‘pause’ is another clear signal that migration to the United States from the Global South is getting harder

Then came the leaked State Department memorandum signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The document lists 36 countries flagged for potential escalation if they fail to meet security and document-verification benchmarks – 25 of them are African.

They range from the continent’s largest economies, including Nigeria, Egypt and Ethiopia, to smaller states such as Cabo Verde, Uganda and Zambia. Although the memo stops short of imposing bans, it explicitly signals the possibility of visa restrictions or full travel suspensions. For many African governments and diaspora groups, it has functioned as a de facto blacklist.

Against this backdrop, Trump’s rhetoric about a ‘Third World’ pause lands less as an entirely new threat than as an intensification and possible widening of a framework already under construction.

However, Trump's latest announcement is more than political theatre, according to Firmian. “This new ‘pause’ is another clear signal that migration to the United States from the Global South is getting harder, with several pathways now being frozen or effectively shut off,” he tells The Africa Report.

What a ‘Third World’ pause might actually mean

If the administration treated ‘Third World’ as shorthand for ‘developing countries’, almost the entire African continent would fall under a single catch-all label. But the White House doesn’t need a sweeping ban to achieve the same political effect.

Politically, the ambiguity gives the administration maximum room to escalate without the diplomatic blowback that a formal proclamation would trigger. It lets officials quietly widen restrictions across the 36 ‘at-risk’ states while insisting they haven’t imposed a continent-wide freeze.

Rather than an outright prohibition, which would almost certainly be struck down as arbitrary and discriminatory, officials are expected to replicate the June 2025 playbook: country-specific dossiers alleging vetting gaps, security risks and bureaucratic failures, dressed up with narrow waivers to signal restraint.

That pathway allows Washington to tighten the screws on African and other migration through rising refusal rates for students, visitors, professionals and family-based applicants, shrinking legal pathways while preserving the appearance of a rules-based process.

Voiding asylum

Trump’s most sweeping promises – shutting down asylum or cancelling African protections en masse – run straight into statutory guardrails Congress built into the system. Under law, anyone on US soil or at its border has the right to seek asylum, reinforced by the non-refoulement rule that bars Washington from sending people back to places where they face persecution.

Those limits were brought into sharp focus in July 2025, when a federal judge halted Trump’s bid to ‘completely shut down’ asylum at the southern border after the administration declared an ‘invasion’ and froze the US Customs and Border Protection One system.

Many Africans with pending applications or existing status could face delays, denials or even removal

That makes it virtually impossible for the White House to void African asylum claims wholesale. Legal experts say it can make screening more onerous, expand detention and slow cases to a standstill but cannot legally erase claims in bulk.

The real vulnerability lies outside US territory. Trump’s January 2025 orders, though partially blocked, have already stranded thousands in northern Mexico, shut down refugee flights and frozen the US Refugee Admissions Programme.

For African refugees in camps in Kenya, Rwanda or the Sahel, the pipeline has collapsed. A formal ‘Third World’ pause would lock that closure in place and raise the political cost of reversing it, even if courts later curb the administration’s reach.

Can African green-card holders or US citizens lose their status?

Trump’s latest escalation – abruptly announcing an end to legal protections for Somali residents in Minnesota and urging authorities to ""send them back to where they came from"" – has sent shockwaves through African communities across the US.

In his Truth Social post, he claimed Minnesota was a “hub of fraudulent money laundering activity” under Governor Tim Walz and announced the immediate termination of the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) programme for Somalis in the state. Walz dismissed the move as predictable scapegoating, saying the president was “broadly targeting an entire community” to shift attention.

Minnesota hosts the largest Somali population in the country, with roughly 79,000 residents, though only 705 Somalis nationwide currently hold TPS, according to Congressional data. Many in the community fear that the president’s rhetoric presages something more sweeping, including threats to green-card holders and even naturalised citizens.

It is part of ongoing efforts to unduly politicise migration and unfairly blame migrants for many of the negative things happening in these countries

But the legal firewall protecting permanent residents and citizens remains substantial. Green-card holders can only be removed through individual proceedings based on defined statutory grounds, such as certain criminal convictions or demonstrable immigration fraud.

Naturalised citizens can be stripped of citizenship only if the government proves they lied about material facts during naturalisation. Political views, activism or national origin are not grounds for denaturalisation, no matter the campaign language.

Where the administration does have greater freedom is in temporary humanitarian protections and parole programmes, which can be narrowed, paused or terminated — as the Minnesota decision illustrates. But even the most aggressive use of executive power cannot deliver Trump’s promise to ‘cancel millions’ of admissions.

However, the government has broad authority to slow or suspend visas and refugee processing, review existing green cards and revoke benefits, Firmian says. “Once implementing guidance is issued, many Africans with pending applications or existing status could face delays, denials or even removal.”

Efforts to unduly politicise migration

Uche Igwe, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), says Trump’s rhetoric fits a wider pattern, describing it as “a very myopic oversimplification” of migration, which has become “far more complex”.

“It is part of ongoing efforts to unduly politicise migration and unfairly blame migrants for many of the negative things happening in these countries,” he tells The Africa Report, pointing to the UK, where the Labour government has also moved to tighten immigration rules.

“I hope that this new wave of hostilities will force African countries to look inwards and allow the leaders to develop their countries such that their citizens will stop believing that their salvation and prosperity lie somewhere in the West where they are not wanted,” Igwe says.

Seaside city councilors clashed Monday over whether the city should issue a written statement acknowledging recent federal immigration enforcement activity that residents say disrupted businesses and frightened families, leaving councilors deadlocked after a tense and lengthy debate.

The discussion followed a work session in which councilors agreed the city should publish clear information explaining what it can and cannot do under Oregon law in response to federal actions.

Councilors directed staff to issue a social media post and add prominently placed information on the city’s website— including in the Community Spotlight section— outlining residents’ rights, the role of local police and steps people can take to ensure who is pulling them over.

City Manager Spencer Kyle said the social media post should address what the city can and can’t do, along with informing the public that it is not city police officers conducting immigration enforcement.

Councilors also agreed to notify the public when the city receives its next shipment of “red cards,” wallet-sized rights-information cards soon to be available in City Hall.

“Letting people know these are accessible is important,” Councilor Tita Montero said.

But members sharply disagreed over whether the city should go further and issue a written statement addressing the impact of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity itself.

Several councilors argued silence would send the wrong message.

“I think not saying something at this point would be a sign of cowardice,”

Councilor Seamus McVey said. “They upset a lot of people. They shut down businesses. They gave us no warning. We were as blindsided as everyone else.”

He added that acknowledging those effects was a matter of transparency, not politics. “It is not partisan to say people were hurt and businesses were hurt,” McVey said. “That’s a fact.”

Others pushed back, warning that the city risked overstepping its authority.

“I don’t want Seaside to get in the middle of a federal immigration debate,” Council President Seth Morrisey said. “Our jurisdiction is local. We should stick to what the law says we can do and avoid statements that pull us into something outside our lane.”

Tensions rose as councilors pressed each other to explain that stance.

“At no point has anyone suggested we interfere with federal operations,” McVey said.

Councilor Heidi Hoffman acknowledged that what happens in Seaside is well within the city’s responsibility.

“They (ICE) upset a lot of people. They shut down businesses, and they didn’t give us any prior warning, and so the city was as blindsided as everybody else was,” Hoffman said. “There was no professional courtesy given; they just came in and started doing these things. So I think we can acknowledge that and say we were surprised, too.”

Councilor Christine Binnicker questioned how detailed such a statement would need to be to remain factual.

“If we’re saying businesses shut down, are we prepared to list which ones?” Binnicker asked. “If we’re going to make claims, we need to be able to back them up.”

McVey dismissed that as unnecessary. “There’s a difference between acknowledging some businesses shut down and doxing them,” he said. “We’re not naming people. We’re acknowledging an impact.”

The debate continued for nearly 30 minutes as councilors disagreed over whether acknowledging community disruption constituted political messaging.

“If it’s not written down, it doesn’t exist,” McVey said. “We keep saying these things aloud, but residents need something they can see and point to.”

Others insisted spoken statements and informational posts were enough.

By the end of the discussion, the council appeared split 3–3, with no clear path to consensus.

Mayor Steve Wright said the council is going to have to agree to disagree. “We’re not going to get any further.”

Councilors agreed to move forward with providing materials and updates, which have been made public on the city’s website: cityofseaside.us/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=29.

These changes could force more than 170,000 people back into homelessness and disrupt services in communities across the country. Pelosi’s support of all three initiatives underscores the significant stakes for San Francisco, where $55 million in federal CoC grants are central to keeping vulnerable individuals and families housed—supporting over 1,500 housing units in the Bay Area.

Pelosi signed on to three letters led by House Appropriations Committee Ranking Members Rosa DeLauro and James Clyburn, House Financial Services Committee Ranking Member Maxine Waters, and Bay Area Congressman Sam Liccardo. Across these efforts, lawmakers raised alarms about HUD’s abrupt policy shifts, deep funding reductions for permanent supportive housing and a severely delayed FY2025 Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) that together threaten to destabilize homelessness systems nationwide.

Appropriations Committee Letter

Speaker Emerita Pelosi, Ranking Member DeLauro, Rep. Clyburn and 203 House Democrats urged HUD to prevent service lapses caused by the latest NOFO. Their letter notes that the FY2025 NOFO is “the most delayed issuance of a NOFO for the CoC Program over the last 10 years,” and warns that the timing combined with major policy changes will result in “the most prolonged funding gap for this critical homelessness prevention program.”

The lawmakers highlighted that nearly $3.7 billion in FY2024 CoC grants begin expiring on December 31, 2025, raising urgent concerns that communities could face major disruptions through winter and into spring if the administration does not act.

The full letter can be read HERE.(link is external)

Financial Services Committee Letter

Speaker Emerita Pelosi, Ranking Member Waters and 52 House Democrats called on HUD Secretary Scott Turner to rescind a NOFO that “could push over 170,000 formerly homeless individuals back on the streets and exacerbate our nation’s homelessness crisis.” The letter highlights that HUD’s proposal would slash permanent supportive housing from 86% of CoC funding to just 30% and impose an extremely compressed application timeline that could create a half-year gap in critical services.

The lawmakers warned that the NOFO would worsen conditions for people with disabilities, veterans, domestic violence survivors, women with children, and others already disproportionately impacted by the homelessness crisis.

Speaker Emerita Pelosi, Rep. Sam Liccardo, and more than 30 House Democrats pressed HUD for answers on the Administration’s decision to cut billions from permanent supportive housing services in the CoC Program.

Elaine Miles, an Indigenous actor, alleges that she was stopped by four masked men while she was walking to a bus stop in Redmond. She offered them her ID card from the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation in Oregon but was told by an ICE agent that “anyone can make that.”

Miles, who also appeared in The Last of Us, Smoke Signals, The Business of Fancydancing and Skins, told the ICE agents to call the tribal enrollment office number on the card.

According to a report of the encounter by the Seattle Times, the officers refused. Miles called the office herself, whereupon one officer tried to take her phone but failed. Then the men released her and departed in their vehicles.

Miles alleges that a similar thing has happened to her son and uncle – they have previously been detained and later released by ICE officers who would not initially accept their tribal identification.

According to a post on Facebook by the Lakota People’s Law Project, Miles told the group: “Tribal IDs—the government issued those damn cards to us like a pedigree dog! It’s not fake!”

Miles’ account chimes with others of Native Americans being swept up in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Native News Online reports that an Indigenous woman born in Phoenix was mistakenly detained by immigration authorities after being released from jail in Des Moines, Iowa.

“What we’re talking about here is racial profiling,” Seattle-based Indigenous rights attorney Gabriel Galanda told the Seattle newspaper. “People are getting pulled over or detained on the street because of the dark color of their skin.”

Galanda said that the agents’ refusal to accept Miles’ ID points to “a fair amount of ignorance about tribal citizenship generally in society and in government”.

According to the outlet, the actor’s encounter with ICE agents came on the same day that ICE agents made several arrests at Redmond’s Bear Creek Village shopping center, prompting city council to switch off its license-plate-reading cameras.

Earlier this year, the Navajo nation announced it was taking steps to protect its community from federal immigration actions, amid reports that some Indigenous Americans have been swept up in US deportation raids.

After Miles was detained, she said she was now afraid to leave the house alone or at night. Galanda said that the prospect of Native Americans being detained is reminiscent of the country’s troubled history with Indigenous peoples.

“It’s also deeply troubling that in 2025, the first people of this country have to essentially look over their shoulders,” she added.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5728b35ac509c9dc0befd138c07d893636706c39/0_161_6000_4798/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=46ab44c43185c83dd987519f69c0e45d",N,,2025-11-28 15:57:29.262859

“The Court is unable to remain current on all new case authority supporting the Court’s conclusion, given the continued onslaught of litigation being generated by [the administration’s] widespread illegal detention practices,” U.S. District Judge Christina Snyder, a federal judge in California originally appointed by Bill Clinton, said in a comment from last week.

“Dozens of district courts across the nation — with more each day — have rejected DHS’s expansion of … mandatory detention,” U.S. District Judge Lynn Winmill, another Clinton appointee in Idaho. “This court joins the overwhelming majority.”",https://www.alternet.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=60312296&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C83%2C0%2C84,N,,2025-11-28 11:57:26.894856

The EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Kaja Kallas, and the Spanish Foreign Minister, José Manuel Albares, chose not to respond on Friday to the words of US President Donald Trump, in which he announced his intention to “permanently” suspend the entry of migrants “from all Third World countries” and to expel “anyone who is not a net asset to the United States.”

“Immigration policies are a prerogative of each country, so, as far as we know, one thing is the declaration and another will be the legislative proposals. We’ll see what happens,” Kallas declared in Barcelona during the closing press conference of the tenth Regional Forum of the Union for the Mediterranean, held at the Pedralbes Palace in Barcelona.

“President Trump is the President of the United States and, therefore, is perfectly free to decide what the American citizens elected him to do,” Albares declared at the same press conference.

“I can speak on behalf of the Government of Spain, and the Government of Spain has a very clear policy regarding migration policy, asylum, and refugees, a policy that places human rights at the heart of the rights of every refugee, every asylum seeker, every migrant,” he continued.

“Certainly, when you look at the figures year after year, thanks to the cooperation with some of our friends who were here today—Morocco, Mauritania, to name the most important—the entry route for irregular immigration to Spain is the lowest in the entire European Union,” he added.

In a message posted on social media to mark Thanksgiving in the United States, Trump lashed out at “American Patriots who have been so nice in allowing our Country to be divided, disrupted, carved up, murdered, beaten, mugged, and laughed at, along with certain other foolish countries throughout the World, for being “Politically Correct,” and just plain stupid, when it comes to Immigration.”

“The official United States Foreign population stands at 53 million people (Census), most of which are on welfare, from failed nations, or from prisons, mental institutions, gangs, or drug cartels,” he claimed.

“This refugee burden is the leading cause of social dysfunction in America, something that did not exist after World War II (Failed schools, high crime, urban decay, overcrowded hospitals, housing shortages, and large deficits, etc.),” the US president asserted.

For all these reasons, the President of the United States announced his intention to “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover,” to end “the millions of Biden illegal admissions,” and to remove “anyone who is not a net asset to the United States, or is incapable of loving our Country.”

“I will end all Federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our Country, denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility, and deport any Foreign National who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization,” he added. “Happy Thanksgiving to all, except those that hate, steal, murder, and destroy everything that America stands for — You won’t be here for long!” he concluded.",https://thediplomatinspain.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/donald-trump-2-1140x570-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 10:57:38.332554

Trump offered no details on how he would implement these policies or what he considers a “third world” country, an ill-defined and often offensive term for developing nations. Congress for years has failed to pass major immigration reforms, and courts have blocked some of his previous executive orders limiting immigration.

Article content

Earlier in the day, the president had announced the death of one of the guardsman, U.S. Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20. The attack by an Afghan national on the eve of Thanksgiving holiday has led Trump to amplify his anti-immigration policies.

Article content

Trump said he would “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries” and “denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility.” He added that he would terminate millions of admissions under his predecessor Joe Biden and “remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States, or is incapable of loving our Country.”

Article content

After the shooting, the White House halted Afghan immigration proceedings and ordered a review of those already in the U.S. The administration had already planned to review the cases of all refugees resettled under Biden and freeze their green card applications, according to a memo reviewed by Bloomberg this month.

On Thursday, Joseph Edlow, the head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said in a social media post that his agency — under Trump’s orders — is conducting “a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern.”

Article content

The White House in June announced a ban on immigration from 12 countries, including Afghanistan, Haiti, Somalia and Sudan, and restrictions on seven others. In his first term, Trump barred travellers from Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen.

Article content

Trump has also pursued aggressive immigration enforcement, deploying teams to cities over the objections of local officials and amid claims that authorities are wrongfully deporting migrants in violation of court orders and other legal protections.

Article content

The administration has sharply reduced the refugee admissions cap, ended temporary protected status for migrants from several countries, imposed a US$100,000 application fee for H-1B visas used by tech companies and universities, and revoked thousands of visas. It is also challenging the constitutional right to birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment.

Article content

Upon returning to office in January, Trump signed an executive order halting all refugee admissions, which was promptly challenged in court. An appeals court allowed new admissions to be paused as the litigation continues, but ordered the government to provide services to refugees who already had arrived.

Suspect to face upgraded charges of murder in the first degree, says US attorney for DC

Jeanine Pirro, the US attorney for the District of Columbia, this morning announced that charges against the suspected shooter were being upgraded.

Pirro told Fox News on Friday morning: “There are certainly many more charges to come, but we are upgrading the initial charges of assault to murder in the first degree.

“And we are hoping that the more information we can get and the more investigation that is going on 24/7 now, around the clock in Washington, the more we will find out about what actually happened in terms of this individual even being in this country and being in a position to ambush and shoot down an innocent young woman who was doing her duty to the people of this country.”

West Virginia senator Shelley Moore Capito on Thursday defended the deployment of National Guard troops from her state to Washington, DC.

Capito, a Republican, told Fox News that crime in the city had declined and questioned whether Democratic lawmakers criticizing former President Donald Trump’s decision to send troops to Washington had spoken with Guard members on the ground.

The two Guard members shot on Wednesday had been assigned to duty in Washington since August, the West Virginia National Guard said in a statement.

West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey deployed the troops at Trump’s request.

West Virginia governor Patrick Morrisey reaffirmed his support for the state’s National Guard members deployed in Washington, DC.

“When you have these terrorists, when you have these evildoers, you’re not going to back down when they go after our servicemen and women,” Morrisey, a Republican, told CNN.

He said pulling back the Guard’s mission would amount to yielding to those responsible for the attack.

“The last thing we should do is reverse course and let the bad guys win,” he said, calling the perpetrators individuals who had “violated every law and societal norm.”

New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani said he was “devastated” by the death of Sarah Beckstrom.

In a post on X, he asked followers to take a moment to think of those “who have been plunged into unimaginable grief”.

He wrote:

The Guardian’s Washington DC bureau chief David Smith wrote this analysis after the shooting earlier this week:

“Washington DC is considered a safe zone,” Donald Trump declared on Tuesday, veering off topic at the national Thanksgiving turkey pardoning ceremony at the White House. “This was one of the most unsafe places anywhere in the United States. It is now considered a totally safe city.”

A day later, two national guardsmen from West Virginia were shot in a busy area a few blocks from the White House in downtown Washington. The ambush took place outside the Farragut West Metro railway station within sight of the Guardian’s office (I had been in the station three hours earlier and witnessed national guard troops milling around).

In a speech from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Wednesday evening, Trump said the suspect entered the US from Afghanistan in 2021. For the president it was a political opportunity and he was determined to exploit it. Immigration? Check. Law and order? Check. All Joe Biden’s fault? Check.

Trump accused his predecessor of allowing millions of violent criminals into the US and launched a xenophobic attack on Somalis in Minnesota: “Hundreds of thousands of Somalians are ripping off our country, and ripping apart that once great state.” Notably, the previous evening, his aide Stephen Miller had decried “the Somalification of America”, telling Fox News: “Look how powerful the Democrat Party became in Minnesota once they flooded it with 100,000 Somalians!”

Then Trump announced a review of the status Afghan nationals in the US. “We must now reexamine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden, and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country.”

Raising the spectre of a newly aggressive crackdown by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), the remarks came as little surprise from a president who has made illegal immigration central to his political identity. The White House regularly sends out lists and images of undocumented immigrants convicted of crimes and could not resist playing up the suspect’s nationality.

Trump was elected on a promise to crack down on illegal migration and his second term has been characterized by a campaign of mass deportations.

Construction sites and schools have been frequent targets. The prospect of more deportations could be economically dangerous as America’s foreign-born workers account for nearly 31m jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Trump’s late-night Truth Social post was full of anti-immigrant invective.

The president blamed immigrants for problems from crime to housing shortages as part of “social dysfunction” in America and demanding “REVERSE MIGRATION”.

Trump’s threat to stop immigration would be a serious blow to a nation that has long defined itself as welcoming immigrants.

The president asserted without evidence that millions of people born outside the US and now living there were to blame for America’s societal ills.

“Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation,” Trump wrote. “Other than that, HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL, except those that hate, steal, murder, and destroy everything that America stands for — You won’t be here for long!”

One of two US national guard soldiers shot in a targeted attack near the White House this week has died, while the second is fighting for his life, Donald Trump has announced.

As part of his Thanksgiving call to US troops late on Thursday, the US president said he had been informed that Sarah Beckstrom, 20, had succumbed to her wounds.

“Sarah Beckstrom of West Virginia, one of the guardsmen that we’re talking about, highly respected, young, magnificent person … She’s just passed away. She’s no longer with us,” Trump said in his first live remarks since the shooting on Wednesday.

Trump added that the second guard member, Staff Sgt Andrew Wolfe, 24, was “fighting for his life”.

Beckstrom’s father had told the New York Times in a phone call earlier in the day that his daughter was unlikely to recover. “I’m holding her hand right now,” Gary Beckstrom said. “She has a mortal wound. It’s not going to be a recovery.”

Trump steps up immigration crackdown after national guard member dies in DC attack

Donald Trump has said he will “permanently pause migration from all third world countries,” a day after two national guard members were shot in Washington DC in an attack that has become a political flashpoint in the president’s ongoing crackdown on immigration.

In a social media post beginning with “a very happy Thanksgiving,” sent after 11pm on Thursday, the US president said his administration would “end all federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens” and remove “anyone who is not a net asset to the United States”.

It as not clear how the president would enact such a “pause” in migration. Previous bans issued by his administration have faced challenges in the courts and in Congress.

Earlier in the night, Trump announced the death of Sarah Beckstrom, one of the two guard members shot in the attack close to the White House on Wednesday. Authorities suspect the shooting was carried out by Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who entered the US in September 2021 under a Biden-era programme that evacuated and resettled tens of thousands from Afghanistan after the chaotic US withdrawal from the country.

The extended rant came in the wake of the shooting of two National Guard members who were deployed to patrol Washington, D.C., under Trump's orders on Wednesday.

A 29-year-old Afghan national who worked with the CIA during the post-9/11 war in Afghanistan is facing charges for the shooting, which will likely be upgraded after the death of 20-year-old Specialist Sarah Beckstrom of the West Virginia National Guard.

West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrissey paid tribute to Beckstrom.

""Sarah served with courage, extraordinary resolve, and an unwavering sense of duty to her state and to her nation,"" said Morrissey. ""She answered the call to serve, stepped forward willingly, and carried out her mission with the strength and character that define the very best of the West Virginia National Guard.""

The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is accused of driving across the country to Washington in what officials described as an ""ambush."" Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains in critical condition with unspecified injuries from the attack.

The suspect, currently in custody, was also shot and had wounds that were not believed to be life-threatening. He emigrated as part of a program to resettle those who had helped American troops after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Refugee groups fear backlash

Hours before Trump took to social media, the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Joseph Edlow, said the agency would take additional steps to screen people from 19 ""high-risk"" countries ""to the maximum degree possible.""

Edlow didn't name the countries. But in June, the administration banned travel to the U.S. by citizens of 12 countries and restricted access from seven others, citing national security concerns. Afghanistan was among those countries.Trump, who began his social media post by extending Thanksgiving greetings to ""all of our Great American Citizens and Patriots,"" said that even as the U.S. has ""progressed technologically, Immigration Policy has eroded those gains and living conditions for many,"" detailing a list of claims about the effects of migration on employment and crime that have long been disputed.

""Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation,"" Trump said.

Trump cited the example of Somalians who have settled in Minnesota, seizing on a case of alleged COVID-19 fraud involving a Somalian-American group. In the process, the president used a slur for mentally disabled people to describe Minnesota's governor, Tim Walz.

Earlier Thursday, Trump met with reporters at his Florida estate. Asked by a reporter on Thursday if he blamed the shootings on all Afghans who came to the U.S., Trump said: ""No, but we've had a lot of problems with Afghans,"" without elaborating.

It was not not clear what mechanisms the White House might employ to fulfil Trump's stated objectives concerning clamping down on migration to the U.S.

Even before Trump's social media posts, groups that work with refugees worried about a backlash from the shooting incident.

""Regardless of the alleged perpetrator’s nationality, religion or specific legal status … we urge our country to recognize these evil actions as those of one person, not to unfairly judge others who happen to share those same characteristics,"" Matthew Soerens, a vice-president with World Relief, a Christian humanitarian organization that helps settle refugees, told The Associated Press.

Ashraf Haidari, founder and president of Displaced International, which provides resources, advocacy and support to displaced people worldwide, told The Associated Press, ""even as we pursue accountability, one individual’s alleged actions cannot be allowed to define, burden, or endanger entire communities who had no part in this tragedy.""

Ratcheting up anti-migration policies

In his second presidential term, Trump's raids and deportations have disrupted communities across the U.S. The administration promised to focus on those with criminal records and those accused of violence, but many law-abiding residents and even U.S. citizens have occasionally been confronted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Control (CBP).

Several judges have assailed the administration for not appearing to afford due process to those facing deportation. Some who had never been convicted of a crime in the U.S. were deported straight to a notorious prison in El Salvador.

In August, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security urged Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients to leave, saying these U.S. residents who arrived from foreign countries as children don't enjoy ""any form of legal status in this country.""

The DHS spokesperson used the term ""self-deport,"" a term connected to a fraught history.

The Trump administration also wants to end birthright citizenship. Courts have blocked that bid, but the matter could be brought before the Supreme Court.

On the campaign trail that capped his remarkable political comeback, Trump said migrants were ""poisoning the blood of our country.""

Both Trump and Republicans have assailed what they say were lax border policies of Joe Biden's administration, as the U.S. saw an increase in border encounters between 2021 and mid-2024.

But the picture is more complex than the Republicans portray, think-tanks including the libertarian Cato Institute say.

The Biden administration encouraged more asylum claims from outside the country and developed an app for migrants that has been discontinued.

The Biden administration also moved to end Title 42 — a pandemic health measure that had the unintended consequence of encouraging some migrants to make repeat attempts to cross — but the end of the measure did not occur until mid-2023, a year later than planned, as over 20 attorney generals from Republican-led states challenged the move.

Trump's first term as president included several divisive and controversial incidents on the immigration file. That Trump administration in its first week spurred chaos at the nation's airports by announcing a travel ban from Muslim-majority countries, which was met with successful legal challenges until the White House revised the order.

In a departure from precedent, the first Trump administration separated many migrant children from their families arriving at southern border points, and failed to properly track the whereabouts of hundreds of children. That failure, a report later found, was an inevitable outcome of the relevant federal government agencies using different computer systems.

Trump in 2019 also lashed out at four Democratic members of Congress, all women, saying they should ""go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came."" Three of the four women were born in the U.S. and the other, Somalian-American Ilhan Omar, became a naturalized citizen while a teenager in 2000.

On Friday, UN agencies appealed to Washington to continue allowing asylum seekers access to the country.

In response to a reporter's question about Trump's remarks, United Nations human rights office spokesperson Jeremy Laurence told a Geneva media briefing, ""They are entitled to protection under international law and should be given due process.""","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/9aa04b14-27bd-4756-8a65-039d8fb08f59,1764331319902/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C163%2C5743%2C3230%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-11-28 10:57:42.083265

Any Lucia Lopez Belloza was about to board a flight from Boston Logan Airport to Texas to visit her family for Thanksgiving when she was detained by Immigration Custom Enforcement (ICE) on Nov. 20, her attorney Todd Pomerleau confirmed to PEOPLE. Lopez Belloza entered the U.S. from Honduras when she was 8 years old.

Court documents obtained by PEOPLE show that U.S. District Judge Allison D. Burroughs ordered that Lopez Belloza not be deported from the U.S. or transferred outside the state of Massachusetts.

Yet she was transferred to a detention facility on the southeast U.S.-Mexico border in Texas on Nov. 21, according to The Boston Globe. She was deported to Honduras on Nov. 22.

""What they did to her is just so unconstitutional on so many levels, but she was going aboard the plane, so she already went through TSA,"" Pomerleau tells PEOPLE.

""She gets surrounded, gets handcuffed, dragged out of the airport, thrown in a van, taken to the Boston field office,"" Pomerleau alleges. ""She had no idea she had a removal order. I don't even know that she did. And that was why we're going to court. Show us her removal order. Let's say she missed court, her parents missed court, her mom missed court — she might have a removal order, but 11-year-old kids aren't responsible for the conduct of their parents.""

""She had protection from being removed, and she was supposed to get her day in court, and they violated her rights and denied her that opportunity. And we are not stopping until we get an answer, and I'm not stopping until I bring her back,"" Pomerleau tells PEOPLE.

The attorney is the founder of Mass Deportation Defense, serving immigrants in the Greater Boston area.

Lopez Belloza is a business major at Babson College. “I have worked so hard to be able to be at Babson my first semester, that was my dream,” she said in an interview with The Boston Globe from her grandparents’ home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras. “I’m losing everything.”

She had hoped to use her business degree to help her dad open a tailoring shop.

Trump offered few details as he disparaged and vowed to remove millions of migrants in the U.S., in a lengthy social media post late on Thanksgiving that came hours after he confirmed the death of National Guard troop Sarah Beckstrom, 20, in the shooting.

Officials have said that Wednesday’s attack on two troops was carried out by an Afghan national who worked with a CIA-backed group during the long war in Afghanistan. The incident has served as a catalyst for Trump to escalate his anti-immigrant rhetoric into pledges that would likely face court challenges if enacted and further undermine America's global standing as a nation welcoming to immigrants.

""I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden’s Autopen, and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

It was not clear exactly which countries he was referring to, with the phrasing used in the past to refer to poorer nations. The Department of Homeland Security referred a reporter from the Reuters news agency to the 19 countries listed in a travel ban in June, mainly in Africa and the Middle East.

The comments drew swift criticism from two U.N. agencies, which on Friday urged the U.S. to continue to accept asylum seekers.

The president also threatened to ""end all federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our country"" and to ""denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic security.""

In remarks that will cause alarm among migrant advocacy and civil liberties groups, Trump said the government would deport any foreign national who was ""non-compatible with Western Civilization.""

He added: ""Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation.""

The Trump administration also said Thursday that the government would reexamine the status of Green Card holders from 19 countries ""of concern,"" including Afghanistan.

In a subsequent post, Trump said that ""hundreds of thousands"" of Somali migrants were ""completely taking over the once great state of Minnesota.""

Trump has previously threatened action against Somalis and last week said he would end temporary protective status — which prevents deportations to dangerous countries — for Somali migrants in Minnesota, many of whom have fled a brutal civil war in the east African country.

It's unclear how many people this would affect but a report made for Congress in August put the number of people covered by the program nationally at 705. The president also attacked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walk as ""retarded"" and said Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn, who was born in Somalia, ""probably came into the U.S.A. illegally"" and is from a ""decadent, backward, and crime ridden nation.""

Trump's threats, if enacted by legislation or executive orders, are likely to be challenged in the courts. In his first term, Trump banned people from several majority-Muslim countries in the Middle East and Africa from entering the U.S. This was challenged but eventually the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in favor of the ban's legality.

Migrant advocacy groups have called for calm and warned against using the D.C. attack to call for a wider crackdown on immigration or to remove the rights of Afghan residents.

""Using this horrific attack as an excuse to smear and punish every Afghan, every refugee, or every immigrant rips at something very basic in our Constitution and many faiths: the idea that guilt is personal, not inherited or collective,"" the Council on American-Islamic Relations said in a statement early Friday.

U.N. human rights office spokesperson Jeremy Laurence told a Geneva press briefing: “They are entitled to protection under international law, and that should be given due process.”

U.N. refugee agency spokesperson Eujin Byun said: “When people who need protection arrive in their territory, they have to have a due process of asylum. And then they have to have access to territory,” she said, adding that the overwhelming majority of refugees are law-abiding members of the host community.

The term ""third world"" originated in the Cold War era to describe a country that wasn't aligned with the western NATO alliance or the USSR and the Warsaw Pact. This later evolved into shorthand for describing economically underdeveloped nations, particularly ones with high levels of poverty.

The term has been used to describe several African nations, but until the late 20th century was also attached to descriptions of China.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251001-government-shutdown-mn-1100-efa96e.jpg",N,,2025-11-28 10:57:47.177714

Carolyn Kissane, academic director and clinical professor at the Center for Global Affairs at New York University, leads the conversation on the geopolitics of oil. FASKIANOS: Thank you. Welcome to the final session of the Winter/Spring 2023 CFR Academic Webinar Series. I’m Irina Faskianos, vice president of the National Program and Outreach here at CFR. Today’s discussion is on the record. And the video and transcript will be available on our website, CFR.org/Academic, if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates. As always, CFR takes no institutional positions on matters of policy. We are delighted to have Carolyn Kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil. Dr. Kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at NYU’s Center for Global Affairs, where she is also a clinical professor. She also serves as director of the energy, climate justice, and sustainability lab in the School of Professional Studies at NYU. She was named in 2013 by Breaking Energy as one of the top ten New York women in energy, and top ten energy communicator. She’s a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, and serves on several boards. So, Carolyn, thanks very much for doing this. We really appreciate it. I thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed, especially vis-à-vis Russia’s war in Ukraine and OPEC’s recent announcement to cut oil production? KISSANE: Well, first of all, I’d just like to say, thank you so very much for having me. I’m really delighted. I am a big fan of CFR’s Academic Webinars. So, to have the opportunity to participate in this—in this way is very meaningful to me. So, thank you. So, wow. There is so much happening in this space, the geopolitics of oil. This has been a tremendous fourteen months. Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because Russia is a significant producer, one of the top three in the world. And it’s—you know, it’s caused a kind of a reshaping, a kind of a remapping of the—of oil geopolitics. And we’ve seen some, you know, shifts in how countries think about oil security, in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions. And also, on top of that, is the ongoing energy transition, coupled with, you know, climate change, and the need to decarbonize. So, there’s just—it’s been quite a—you know, a year and a half, that has really sort of put energy security, and oil security, very much at the forefront of people’s minds. FASKIANOS: Fantastic. I thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us. And if you could walk us through those—the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life, that would be fantastic. KISSANE: Sure. So, before I do—I have a couple of slides. And before I share my slides, I think it’s really important that, sort of, we understand how interconnected, sort of, the global energy system is, and how interconnected we are, when it comes to the flows of oil. You know, some countries are very well resourced-endowed, so they have oil. And other countries do not, so they need to import oil. There’s really no country in the world that doesn’t need oil for larger national security issues. And I think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about, is the amount of oil that gets produced every day. So, every day, the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day. And every day, that 100 million barrels has to be—has to be moved. It has to be—you know, as part of getting it into the system, getting it to its respective destinations. And what we’re not seeing—which, maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point—is we’re not seeing a reduction in demand, but we’re seeing an expansion in demand. And much of that global demand is coming out of Asia. And we’re also, of course, seeing the—with the reopening of China, lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in China for the 2023-2024 years, whether or not they will—they will, sort of, put extra pressure on global demand. And you know, Irina, just also, you know, it’s—I’m going to share this in my slides. But you know, last week’s decision from OPEC+ to reduce production, of course, had an impact on the price of oil. So when the decision was announced on Sunday, by Monday morning, we saw an uptick in the price. It’s stabilized, but we are sort of looking at $80-plus-a-barrel oil. And again, lots of uncertainty as to what that’s going to mean across economies that are in recessions, experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession, and sort of what does it mean for the global economy, where we may see sort of more energy inflation. So, one of the things that I really like to do when I teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals. Because I think, again, sort of, really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system, but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced, and where in the world are the—are the importers. And also, just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen, just this—you know, in the last week, of course, some of this—you’ll be familiar with, those in the audience—but this decision on the part of OPEC to reduce production by 1.2 million barrels a day—again, happening at a time, not when we have an excess supply, but when we’re seeing a tight supply across the oil market. So, it came as a bit of a surprise to—you know—to even the most, you know, longstanding analysts and OPEC observers. And again, part of this is directed probably toward self-interests on the part of Saudi Arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts. But of course, it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the United States. What does it mean then for prices that Americans pay at the gas pump? So, the Biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed, surprised that OPEC would make this decision. Now, it’s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular OPEC decision. This is part of, now, a larger OPEC+. And OPEC+ does also include Russia, as well as other countries like Kazakhstan and Mexico. So, the OPEC that we have historically known is now different, because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as OPEC+. And these are the countries that are part of OPEC, and really the country that’s considered to be sort of in the driver’s seat of OPEC is that of Saudi Arabia, because Saudi Arabia is the largest producer within the OPEC organization, producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day. Venezuela has the largest reserves, but it is far from being at capacity, in terms of what it can—what it can produce. So, just to kind of put that into perspective, these are OPEC countries and their respective reserves. And then non-OPEC—the United States being a non-OPEC country, but again, this sort of—this chart to the right shows, you know, again, the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day, expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024, question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand. But again, to sort of link this to energy security—energy security, especially when it’s in the context of oil security—is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices. So, when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets, that suggests that we’re also going to see higher prices that’s going to directly hit vulnerable economies. And so, again, just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers: the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. Russia remains in the top three. Canada as well, our, you know, neighbor to the north. And China is also a producer of oil. The United States figure here also includes gas liquefied, so liquid petroleum, which the United States is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas. And then the top oil consuming countries, you have U.S., China, and India. Now, the United States is not the largest importer. That position is now held by China. But as far as consumption goes, we consume over 20 million barrels a day. Again, big question mark about China, in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of China over the next year, two years, with China’s reopening and what is being, you know, discussed as revenge tourism. And more Chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings, 2.1 trillion, how are they going to use that savings and whether or not, after three years of being under lockdown restrictions, whether or not we’ll see impacts to demand. And I think Russia is—there’s lots of questions about Russia. And this is now—we’re fourteen months into, you know, Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine—and I emphasize reinvasion, because oftentimes, we forget that, you know, Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. But Russia is still moving its oil. And up until, you know, a few months ago, its overall production and exports were as high—at some points, even higher—than pre-invasion. Now, you have new countries that are takers of Russian oil, and they’re buying it at discounted prices. We see Turkey, Singapore, China has been a big buyer, as well as India, that they have been buying discounted Russian oil. Lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to Europe. But I think the takeaway from this slide is that Russia continues to produce oil, continues to sell it, selling at a discounted price, but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take Russian oil. And again, I’m not going to go into this, but I just love this slide, to just emphasize the—you know, the world’s pipelines. These are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil. Something also that’s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic, so, the tankers that carry oil around the world. But again, you know, there are a lot of pipelines, so twenty-three—two thousand, three hundred, and eighty-one operational oil and gas pipelines. Again, these are—it’s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day. And then finally, is this—is—you know, one of the things that we oftentimes—we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming, over 75 percent of the world’s oil is controlled, managed by state-owned oil companies. So, Saudi Aramco being one, PDVSA of Venezuela being another. But it’s really important to sort of recognize the position that state-owned companies have. The rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies—ExxonMobil, Chevron, ENI, Total, and a host of other—host of other companies. But again, I think the—you know, to understand that NOCs, as they’re referred to, are very, very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil. And again, what we saw last week coming out of OPEC, this decision, this is also being driven by state budget concerns. This is—again, it’s about the production of oil, but it’s also about, you know, governments and their budgets. And oftentimes, you know, there is a desire to add more, rather than—you know, more revenues rather than less. So, those are the slides that I have. And I hope that they sort of provide some sort of context, and a little bit of, you know, that we can discuss in the questions that I really look forward to answering from the audience. FASKIANOS: Thank you, Carolyn. That was great. So now, we’re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments. (Gives queuing instructions.) All right, so I’m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing. Amadine Hom, go to you first, and please accept the—unmute yourself. (Pause.) You are still muted. (Pause.) OK, I don’t know—are you there? Oh, I think—OK. Let’s go to Morton Holbrook. Q: Yes, good afternoon. Dr. Kissane, what a shocking presentation—(laughs)—a hundred million barrels a day and it’s going up, notwithstanding the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. Is that agreement simply a dead letter, or is it having any effect on oil—on fossil fuel production, particularly oil production? Or what’s the best scenario, in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels, considering the oil market? Thank you. KISSANE: Well—hi, Morton, thank you so much for that excellent question. Yeah, that’s kind of why I emphasize that number, is because a lot of people sort of just aren’t aware of how much oil we continue to consume, and again, what the demand expectations are moving forward. And these demand expectations are, you know, coming out of forecasts from the International Energy Agency. So, I think there’s a big question as to when we see peak demand. And, you know, if you look at BP scenarios, they expect peak demand to happen, you know, before 2030, where, as, you know, others kind of contest that they—that they think that peak demand won’t happen until after 2030. I mean, again, a lot depends on, you know, what we are now experiencing in the energy transition, and how, sort of quickly are we—can we transition away from oil. I think what’s really critical, when we’re looking at oil, is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector. So we’re thinking about cars, we’re thinking about planes, you know, we’re thinking about trucks, and tankers, and all these things. But it’s petrochemicals, you know? There’s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer. So, it really is across our economy, and across economies, across the global system. One of the things that I always tell my students is even during COVID, where you had many countries, right, much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown, we did have a reduction in oil demand, but it wasn’t—it wasn’t like 20 million barrels. It was under ten. So, the fact that now it’s 2023, the world has reopened, it’s really hard to sort of see, or to know with certainty, is when we’re going to see that—see that reduction in demand. Now, I think with the Paris Agreement, what’s also important is—to note is, you know, if you’re—if you’re in the oil and gas space—and I was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation—was, you know, what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production? So, how are they integrating carbon capture, sequestration, you know, how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy—in this case that we’re talking about, oil. And I think one of the things that—I think if you sort of follow oil markets, or a country like Saudi Arabia, they are marketing low-emission oil. Now, we could—you know, we could sort of challenge, well, what does that—you know, what does that really mean? But you are having, you know, countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production—in the production of oil. And that’s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at, in the context of the geopolitics of oil, is to kind of understand the variation across emissions, across different countries, in the production of oil. So, we are—you know, again, we are going to be going into COP-28 this fall. Again, we are not seeing—you know, and we haven’t seen a, you know, reduction in fossil energy demand. Again, lots of people are sort of, you know, hoping that we’ll start to see it sooner rather than later. But for the time being—and again, you know, to Irina’s first question, that, you know, the last fourteen months, and with, you know, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it has both shown us that, you know, Europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition, by building out more renewable energy, and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles. But there’s still big swaths of the world that, you know, are still, and have yet to move towards, you know, really reducing—and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward, as their economies grow. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Jovana Vujanic, who is a graduate student at Lewis University: How big of an—of an impact will the decision of the Saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia? KISSANE: Love the question, thank you so much. Yeah, no, it’s a great one. So, my take is that, of course, this decision came as a bit of a surprise, and it wasn’t something that the United States, you know, wanted. But I would say that the U.S.-Saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years. And as part of that—there are lots of different reasons for that, but this is yet—kind of another thing that Saudi has done. And again, I think it’s also—Saudi has taken a non-alignment policy with relation to its position on Russia and Ukraine. So, it continues to—you know, it continues to have a relationship with Russia. It also has the relationship with Ukraine. As we saw, you know, China just brokered a very significant deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran. You know, again, Saudi Arabia and Iran are two—are two important producers for China. So, China is a large importer of oil. So, if you go back to World War—the end of World War II, that’s when the United States established the oil-for-security relationship with Saudi Arabia. And as we have grown, sort of, more—I wouldn’t say independent, but our—as our own oil production has increased, especially through the shale revolution, our dependence on the Middle East and Saudi Arabia, more specifically, has shifted. So, I think we’re seeing a very different Saudi Arabia today, which I think is going to be a challenge for the United States. I think it’s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds. Last summer, the Biden administration did tap into the U.S. strategic petroleum reserves, the largest—the largest take in the history of the reserves, which started in 1975, you know, taking 180 million barrels out, you know, not because there was massive supply disruptions. But because, you know, as the administration said, it was—you know, it was—it was—it was a war—it was a war-specific decision, because the—you know, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket. And to cushion the American consumer, and to better cushion the, sort of, the global economy, the United States withdrew from the SPR. So I think the summer is going to be very interesting. But I think we’re going to see, definitely, much more attention in the years to come, between the United States and Saudi Arabia. It’s not the relationship of the past. This is a kind of a very new relationship. That’s a great question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. Thank you, let’s go Curran Flynn, who has a raised hand. Q: Hello? FASKIANOS: We can hear you, but we’re getting feedback. So you might have two devices open. Q: Can you hear me now? FASKIANOS: Yes. Q: That’s better. OK. FASKIANOS: That’s better. Thank you. Thank you so much. Q: So, I’m here at King Fahd University in Saudi Arabia, right next to Aramco, here with my class from international relations. And one of my students has a question, Nasser al-Nasir (ph). Here he is. Q: So, thank you, Mrs. Carolyn. My question is: How could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. market, the domestic market, and the role of the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers through their RDIF fund? And thank you to Mrs. Irina. KISSANE: Thank you. And, Dr. Flynn, thank you so much for having your students join this webinar. So, I’m a little—so, the question is about the East Siberian Pipeline? Just could you—would you mind repeating it? I just want to make sure I have it—I’m clear on the question. Q: So, how could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. energy markets, I mean domestically, and the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers to the RDIF fund? KISSANE: Yeah, and that’s a great question. You know, I think that, you know, begs a lot of things that we could be looking at, right, in terms of, you know, Russia’s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around, or find workarounds, to the sanctions that were imposed. And I think we’ve seen sort of new markets—so, this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil, we see that as—kind of in technicolor, right, whereas, you know, a lot of Russian oil would go west, is now going east, you know, China, India, being takers, and of course, you know, other countries as well. You know, what will be its impact on the—on the U.S. market? I think that’s—you know, again, I do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place, so that there wouldn’t be massive disruptions, so we—again, you know, Russia produces over 10 million barrels a day, and about 7 million of those barrels are exported. So, you know, if we lost all of that, that would be a—you know, that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally. We already saw, you know, impacts to sort of grains, grain exports, and food security in many different parts of the world. So, you know, Russia is finding different ways. You have shadow tankers that Russia is using to move—to move its oil—as you pointed out, the East Siberian pipeline. You know, I think there’s only so much the United States can do, or—and European countries that are part of the sanctions regime, can do to curtail Russian exports of oil. But I think that—you know, I think Russia, again, has a—has a desire, and also, you know, revenue needs—they’re funding a very expensive war—that they’re finding ways to get their—to get their oil out. I think an interesting question is, you know, what does this mean in the years ahead, the lack of investment, for example, that’s going into Russian energy infrastructure, a lack of, sort of, any kind of Western investment that is—that is going in, and what that is going to mean. But again, you know, I think, to your question, I think we will see some—you know, we are seeing some impacts, right? There’s a big question as to what—you know, what the next six months to a year will look like, with regards to the reduction from OPEC, and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on Russian oil. And you know, would the United States then tap more into the SPR? We’re now at—you know, we’re down to seven hundred thousand barrels, which, of course, is not insignificant. But we also sort of have to be, you know, judicious about how we use the SPR. But thank you for the question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Michael—let’s see— Trevett, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Southern Mississippi: China and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the South China Sea. What are your estimates of the potential amount there, and has China begun to extract any of this oil? KISSANE: Michael, thank you so much. That’s a great question. So, China already is an oil producing country, so you do have oil production in China. In the South China Sea, I can’t—I can’t say exactly. I know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves. Again, you do have—you know, you do have territorial concerns about sort of where—is this—you know, can China—can China tap those—or seek to explore and tap those reserves, again, if there are—if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located? So you know, China, again—one of the things that’s very interesting about China is that China is an oil producer, but China has seen, over the last, you know, the last decade, they have seen that they have experienced peak demand. So—I mean, sorry. Peak supply. So, they are not producing as much as they used to. And so you’re seeing a year-on-year reduction in the producing capacity. You know, if you go back maybe five or six years ago, there was lots of questions about if China could kind of replicate what happened in the United States around the shale oil revolution. I think one of the big challenges for China is that, of the—you know, where the shale reserves are located, it’s not near water, lots of questions as to—and some of it—basically, some of the tests have shown that it’s—it definitely is proving harder that, you know, they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the United States. So, yeah, no, I think in the South China Sea, again, I think we—it’s potentially possible that we might see it. I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t say it’s soon. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m taking the next question from Rob Warren at the Anglo-American University of Prague. This question also got an upvote: How do you foresee Venezuela’s role in the global oil market changing moving forward? And can it be reintegrated into the global economy? KISSANE: Oh, these are all fantastic questions. Thank you all so much. Yeah, Venezuela is—again, you know, Venezuela has—they have the largest reserves in the world. As part of this webinar, right, you—CFR had a—kind of a primer on Venezuelan, and kind of—you know, you look at sort of where Venezuela is. And one of the biggest challenges confronting Venezuela is both its politics, but it’s also—it basically—you know, you don’t have—you don’t have international oil service providers in the country. I think the only—the only one now that the U.S.—the U.S. has sort of given a sanctions exemption to, is that of Chevron. But I think—yeah, I mean, if you were to see, you know, kind of shifts in the political regime, and you were to see more openness, then I think you could imagine, you know, Venezuela having an opportunity, or a pathway forward, to be more integrated into the global energy system, and the global oil system. You know, I think one of the big problems that Venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point. And it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential. So, you know, Venezuela is one of these countries that’s not producing as much as it could, right? It has the potential to be producing 2 million-plus more barrels per day. But you know, we’ve seen that they really have just—they went into freefall. So, I think that’s a big issue. And another big issue, which—God, it goes back to an earlier question—is that of emissions. So, the oil that comes out of Venezuela is a very, very heavy oil. So, it’s—it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil. So, that, I think, is—again, as we—you know, think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low-emission producers, you know, Venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its—where its oil sector was. Again, it has the capacity, it has the reserves. But getting that—getting that oil out of the ground right now, you have a lot of significant above-ground risks. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to go next to Clemente Abrokwaa. Raised hand, so please unmute yourself. Q: Can you hear me, please? FASKIANOS: Yes, we can. Q: Thank you. Thank you so much for your—for your talk. I was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day. (Laughs.) I didn’t know that. But anyway, I’m from Penn State University. And my question is: You just mentioned about the above-ground, you know, effects. And—so the movement towards, like, electric vehicles and so on, how do you think it is going to affect the African continent? KISSANE: Thank you. Q: I am—I’m thinking, you know, the economies, and then infrastructure. It will be very difficult for them to—(laughs)—move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles, and so on. I just wanted your take on that. KISSANE: Thank you, Clemente. It’s an excellent question. Yeah, I mean, you have countries across the African continent that not only have oil reserves, but are already producing, right? Nigeria is a—is an oil-producing country, also has more capacity, but again, you have some above-ground risks. You also have the need for investment of new infrastructure. I think one of the things that has been very interesting—and I think it’s getting—it’s getting more attention, as it deserves, is how Western governments are—some of—I think a challenge across Africa is that a lot of Western governments have sort of said, listen, we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels—or also, financial institutions, Western financial institutions—we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels, or new projects that are fossil-based. And that—you know, that’s problematic when you look across the African continent, where you still don’t have, you know, 100 percent energy access. You know, the idea of the transition to electric vehicles, which is taking a very, very long time, even here across the—across developed economies—so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into, you know, across the continent of Africa for oil and gas, that’s for their economies and for their own economic growth, I think, is really, really pivotal. And I think this is something that, you know, is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions. And also, you know, is it hypocrisy, right, for Western banks that have, you know, kind of funded the oil and gas industry, or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the United States and many different parts of the world, and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to Africa. And they have the—again, they have the—they have the resources. So you know, is it—you know, the equity of some of these decisions that are being made, I think, is one that’s—is one that’s really important. And again, I—you know, I said earlier in this talk, is that, you know, all—most of the demand for oil is not coming from North America and from Europe. All of the demand that we’re seeing and new demand that we’re going to see, is coming from Asia, and is going to come from Africa. So again, you know, how are we going to make sure that that demand is met, again, going back to that idea of energy security, so there is—there is accessibility, so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices, you know, without sort of thinking about kind of a whole-of-energy approach. So, I think it’s very—it’s a very complex issue. And I think, you know, Western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund, when it comes to new oil and gas projects, are getting sort of challenged as to, you know, what does that mean, then, for, you know, countries across Africa that are still very much in need of more energy, not less. And again, recognizing that, you know, EVs that, again, are still—are—you know, we’re seeing adoption here in the United States and across Europe, but it’s a big, big, big adoption in China. But it’s very uneven. So how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of Africa, I think, is a really critical question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’ll take the next question from Kyle Bales, who is a senior at Lewis University in Romeoville, Illinois: How is the war between Russia and Ukraine having an effect on the progress of the European Green Deal? Maybe you can tell us what the European—define the European Green Deal for us, Carolyn, give us the context for that. KISSANE: Yes, so, again, this is another fantastic question. Yeah, the European Green Deal, it’s—this is—this is great. Yeah, I mean, a lot of people would say that the European Green Deal now is—that the—Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sort of said, hey, this is why the Green Deal is so important. This is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy, because look what—look what happened when we were dependent on Russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas. And look, when Russia, you know, illegally invades Ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas, we are left very energy-insecure. It affects—it affects consumers. It affects industry across the continent. So, I think we’re seeing, not just through the Green Deal, but we’re also seeing through, sort of European green industrial policy—so in some ways, akin to what, you know, we put into effect in—this past summer, is the Inflation Reduction Act. And we’re seeing almost, kind of, this industrial competition around clean energy technologies. And so, Europe is investing—you know, I think it’s about $250 billion, the United States, it’s about 370 billion—towards the—kind of the energy transition, and helping to support domestic industries and companies to—you know, to be able to, you know, develop the technologies, and to have the, you know, the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition. So, I think one thing, though—whenever I talk about Europe, it’s really important, is to sort of recognize that, you know, when you look across Europe, you have very different policies and kind of approaches, to sort of thinking about energy, and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition, whereas others, you know, are probably going to experience a slower transition. So, just really interesting example, as you talked about the Green Deal, is the EU taxonomy, the green taxonomy, that went into effect in the—January of 2022. And there, you had, like, really a lot of contention between France and Germany, because France wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy. Germany was opposed, right, but Germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy. So ultimately, in the end, both natural gas and nuclear—and again, this was—this predated Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But in the EU green taxonomy, you have—you know, you have both nuclear and natural gas, in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy, that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change. So you know, I think you’re seeing this kind of—some people call it a race, a competition. You know, ideally, it’s—you know, we’re kind of working together to—because we’re all sort of going in the same direction—to, you know, support the transition, and to reduce—to reduce carbon emissions, and to bring in more, sort of, cleaner energy technologies into our system. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Dr. Laeed Zaghlami. Q: Yes, good afternoon. This is Laeed—good afternoon, Irina. Good afternoon, Carolyn. I’m very pleased to be part of your program. Just to—want to be back to Africa and particularly to Nigeria, how practical the two projects that Nigeria is advocating for pipelines, one from—through Algeria, and the other one to Morocco through western African countries? How practical are these pipelines to supply gas to Europe and parts of some African countries? FASKIANOS: And Dr. Zaghlami, you are at Algiers University, correct? Q: Indeed, Irina, yes. I am professor at University of Algiers, faculty of information and communication. FASKIANOS: Thank you. KISSANE: Dr. Laeed, can I—can I keep you on for just one second? Can I ask you, what is the—what is the status right now? Is it—it’s planned, under construction? Where is—what is the status of those two pipelines? My understanding is that it’s—they’re proposed, but— Q: Yes, well, actually in—practically, the pipeline between Algeria and Abuja, which means through Niger and so forth, is already in progress, whereas the other project, through thirteen western African countries, they are supposed to be implemented by 2047. But is it—is there any political game or something of strategic—(inaudible)—how practical, how logical, how efficiently will be for Nigeria to have two similar project(s)? KISSANE: Yeah, no, it’s—again, thank you for the question. You know, pipelines, again, that’s why I wanted to show the—(laughs)—kind of the map of pipelines, is because, you know, a lot of pipelines transverse, you know, multiple countries, right? And this is—this requires not just, you know, a lot of cooperation, but it requires technically. It also can be very complex to build—to build pipelines. And when you’re talking about something like, as you—as you point out, these are, you know, crossing many countries. You know, I think one of the—again, one of the issues is whether or not—since, you know, what already is under construction, I think you can, you know, with confidence, that one will be completed. Anything that’s not yet under construction—and again, the timeline, 2047, is way out there—a lot of—a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward, for various reasons, in terms of making sure that the investments are there. Someone I know that studies pipelines, he says, you know, until the steel is in the ground, you don’t have the pipeline, and so until you know that you’ve got that, you know, you’ve got all the OKs, and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it, and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it. I think Algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn’t gotten enough attention, in terms of Algerian gas, that has—that has helped support Europe. Over the last years, we’ve seen an increase in Algerian gas going into Europe. Again, a lot of attention on U.S. LNG and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into Europe, but also Algeria has been, you know, very important for helping to support European energy security, and make up for some of the losses of the—of the Russian gas. And I think we’ll see more attention on Algeria, and Algeria’s role as a—you know, as an important source of energy, especially, you know, gas, going into—going into Europe, moving forward. FASKIANOS: So, I’ll take the next written question from Vincent Brooks, who is at Harvard and Diamondback Energy board of directors: How do you view the purchasing of discounted Russian oil by India, in particular relative to the purchasing by China? How are they using the oil purchased? And are you seeing more internal usage or external profit-making sales in places like Africa? And what are the implications of all of this? KISSANE: Right, great. Great question. So, all of the above—(laughs)—in some ways, right? There is definitely sort of profits that are being made. You know, I was—I was talking about this last week with someone, and you know, if you sort of put your shoe—put yourself in the shoes of India, right, so, India is a—is a rapidly growing economy, 1.4 billion. You know, if you had—if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices, that’s going to have ripples effects across the Indian economy. And so, you know, when you have a kind of opportunity to buy, you know, pretty steep discounted oil, which, you know, they had been able to buy from Russia, you know, for purposes of national security, they’ve been buying the oil. And one of the things that’s very interesting about India is that, actually, India has been building out its refining capacity. So, a lot of that oil is both for domestic, and some of it is being sort of re-exported. But I think what we’ve seen is that they’re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging, refining power in Asia. And we see that in some ways in China, too. So, China, even though oil demand was down in 2022, much of the oil that they were buying from Russia went into its strategic supplies, which, you know, they now have access to. And again, I think, you know, a big question is what we’re going to see moving forward around oil demand in China. Wood Mackenzie just published a really interesting piece, kind of very bullish, on the expectations for oil demand in China, so whether or not they’re going to continue to buy, you know, Russian oil—and again, sort of taking advantage of these lower prices, you know. And I think—I think one of the things that—it’s kind of an inconvenient truth, whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in Europe, so European trading houses were kind of the main—the main points of Russian oil trade. A lot of that has been moved out, so, you know, Russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions, and have set up—in some cases, they’ve set up trading houses. And some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that, you know, that they can sort of, again, bypass the compliance to the sanctions. And you have some—you have some Russian oil traders that are making a lot of money—(laughs)—selling discounted oil, and then reselling it. A really interesting case, a couple of months ago, was out of Malaysia. Malaysia announced—or, in the, you know—that they were—that 1.5 million barrels were produced and sold, but only—Malaysia doesn’t produce that much. So, those were Russian barrels that were sort of being sold under, sort of, the Malaysian—under the Malaysian barrel. So, again, I think China and India have, you know, have taken advantage. Some of this has, again—as I said, has been re-exported. And some of it, you know, has been re-exported through petroleum products, because China and India, you know, both are building and have refining capacity. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Bhakti Mirchandani at Columbia University: What global trajectory do you see for nuclear? The Russia-Ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline, and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy. And so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy? KISSANE: Bhakti, thank you. And I was just at Columbia earlier today for the Center for Global Energy Policy’s conference. Yeah, nuclear is very interesting, right? So when we’re thinking about, you know, decarbonizing our energy systems, you know, nuclear plays a very important role, because it’s zero-emitting. So in certain parts of the world—China being one, Saudi Arabia—you know, you have a lot of new nuclear build. You know, in other parts of the world, you have a lot of contention about nuclear. We saw that even in Germany, which have, you know, three remaining nuclear power plants. And even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year, there was still sort of pushback about, no, those nuclear power plants need to be shut down, whereas you would think, OK, in light of energy insecurity, let’s keep them open. So, you know, France is an interesting country. France had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent. But this past year, they pivoted and they’ve said, no, we’re actually going to build out more nuclear, and we’re sort of—we’re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy. And nuclear is very important for France’s electricity system. Sweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear, and they’re going to increase by, I think, almost 50 percent. Again, part of this is their—to meet their targets of net zero. We also see Japan. Japan, you know, the Fukushima disaster really turned Japanese—the Japanese public off of nuclear. Very, very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants. But this past year, even though there’s still safety concerns on the part of the public, the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices. So, nuclear being a domestic source of energy. So, I think when you look at, you know, net-zero pathways, I have not seen a net-zero pathway that does not include nuclear. So, here in the United States, the net-zero America project out of Princeton, very important place for nuclear. We just have a really hard time—(laughs)—building nuclear at cost, so it’s very expensive. Usually, it’s significant cost overruns. And of course, there is the—I think they have a really significant PR problem. People—there’s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear. So, I think to your point, it’s very, very important for decarbonizing energy systems, but you’re going to see, I think, very disjointed approaches. Some countries are going—are embracing nuclear, and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition, and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system. FASKIANOS: We have so many questions, and we are just not going to get to them all. So, I’m going to take the next question from Christian Bonfili, who’s at Torcuato di Tella University in Argentina. So, do you think, Carolyn, that the landscape resulting from the Ukraine invasion by Russia, vis-à-vis securitization of gas and energy between Europe and Russia, could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy? KISSANE: Great question. I think in Europe, it is. And I think, you know, many analysts would agree that—the IEA, for example—you know, you had the, you know—how does Europe continue—you know, to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on Russia gas? And a lot of that is through renewable energy. You also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen, and the role that hydrogen will play. I think—I think Europe is being cautious, and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas, so as earlier questions, are they getting gas from Algeria, or are they getting gas from Norway? Are they getting more gas from the United States in the form of liquefied natural gas? And then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from Russia. So, we’ve seen an increase in LNG from Russia going into Europe. That said, I think all in, you are seeing that, you know, countries across Europe are saying, OK, you know, how can we enhance our energy security? How do we build more sort of domestic energy sources? Solar, wind, we’re seeing, you know, more rapid deployment. You’ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that, but I think—overall, I think the answer would be that it’s quickening the energy transition. FASKIANOS: So, I will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on. And just to give us your top three—what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil, as you look out over the next five- to ten-year horizon, that you would leave us with, to be looking for? KISSANE: OK. You know, so I think what we saw, right, tensions between Saudi Arabia and the United States. We also have a, you know, a hot war, cold war, depending on, you know, the term you want to use, between the United States and China, and lots of sort of questions as to what that’s going to look like. I think there’s—you know, I think there’s concern that, you know, we’re not reducing demands, but we’re seeing tightening supply. And so that’s going to have, you know, very significant impacts for economies, especially economies that are already very fragile, economically fragile, politically fragile. So that concerns me a lot, in terms of, you know, what happens when, you know, economies don’t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries, that their—that consumers, you know, are able—that the lights can stay on, and you can get—you know, if you’re dependent on cars, you’re depending on trucks, like, all these kinds of things are really, really critical. So, I think we have to be very cautious moving forward, that we don’t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient, and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not—are not—they’re not decreasing. I think they are increasing and becoming even more complex. So, I think there’s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty. And you know, this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead.

,Litigation,2025-11-28 14:02:14+00:00,Raw Story,Judges getting sick of 'illegal' Trump orders flooding courts with challenges: report,"Travis Gettys, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.rawstory.com/immigrant-detention-2674353206/,"More than 200 judges in hundreds of cases have rejected the Trump administration’s attempts to lock up immigrants facing possible deportation, and they're getting sick of hearing challenges to those ""illegal"" efforts, according to reports.
“Dozens of district courts across the nation — with more each day — have rejected DHS’s expansion of … mandatory detention,” wrote U.S. District Judge Lynn Winmill in a Nov. 19 ruling that released 17 people arrested during an ICE raid at a racetrack.
The Trump administration expressed confidence that appeals courts, and possibly the U.S. Supreme Court, would uphold the policy, saying they were forced to impose the detentions in response to Biden-era policies.
“President Trump and Secretary Noem are now enforcing this law as it was actually written to keep America safe,” said Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement.
But judges have overwhelmingly disagreed, according to Politico's review of their rulings.","More than 200 judges in hundreds of cases have rejected the Trump administration’s attempts to lock up immigrants facing possible deportation, and they're getting sick of hearing challenges to those ""illegal"" efforts, according to reports.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement set off a tidal wave of emergency lawsuits July 8 with a policy change that led to their targets being arrested at workplaces, courthouses and immigration check-ins, and at least 225 judges in more than 700 cases have ruled against President Donald Trump's administration – compared with just eight who sided with the new mass detention policy, reported Politico.

“The Court is unable to remain current on all new case authority supporting the Court’s conclusion, given the continued onslaught of litigation being generated by [the administration’s] widespread illegal detention practices,” wrote U.S. District Judge Christina Snyder, in a Nov. 21 ruling.

Judges have noted the sheer volume of rulings against the administration in their rulings, which reflects their growing exasperation with the litigation prompted by a policy that has been rejected over and over as unlawful.

“Dozens of district courts across the nation — with more each day — have rejected DHS’s expansion of … mandatory detention,” wrote U.S. District Judge Lynn Winmill in a Nov. 19 ruling that released 17 people arrested during an ICE raid at a racetrack. “This court joins the overwhelming majority.”

There have been few broad attempts to block the ICE policy, but judges in Massachusetts and Colorado have recently certified class action lawsuits to challenge the detentions, and a California judge approved a nationwide class Tuesday that could immediately force the administration to provide bond hearings for detainees.

The Trump administration expressed confidence that appeals courts, and possibly the U.S. Supreme Court, would uphold the policy, saying they were forced to impose the detentions in response to Biden-era policies.

“President Trump and Secretary Noem are now enforcing this law as it was actually written to keep America safe,” said Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement.

But judges have overwhelmingly disagreed, according to Politico's review of their rulings.",https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/a-child-weeps-as-her-father-is-mistakenly-detained-by-federal-immigration-officers-at-u-s-immigration-court-in-manhattan-in-ne.jpg?id=61135559&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C416%2C0%2C417,N,,2025-11-28 09:59:52.672936

In two Truth Social posts, he wrote that he would stop migration from “all Third World Countries” to enable “the U.S. system to fully recover.” He did not elaborate on which countries he meant or how he would achieve his aim.

Since the attack, which killed one of the soldiers, the Trump administration has issued a series of announcements tightening the immigration system, including pausing immigration from Afghanistan specifically.

Thursday night’s posts also seemed to target migrants who had become citizens. Mr. Trump said he would “denaturalize” migrants “who undermine domestic tranquillity” and remove people from the country who were “non-compatible with Western Civilization,” without detailing whom it would apply to or how.

Hours before the posts were published, Mr. Trump announced the death of U.S. Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, one of the National Guard members who was shot on Wednesday. The other victim was identified as Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, who officials said on Thursday was in critical condition.

Both victims had been deployed to Washington since August as part of what the Trump administration has described as a crackdown on crime.

The suspect in the shooting, whom officials identified as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, was in custody after being shot by other National Guard soldiers during the attack. The authorities said he had driven from Washington State to carry out the attack.

Mr. Lakanwal was once part of a C.I.A.-backed paramilitary group working in Afghanistan and moved to the United States under a Biden-era immigration program for Afghans fleeing Taliban rule.

On Thursday, after Mr. Lakanwal was identified as the suspect, Joseph Edlow, the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, announced new guidance introducing more “negative factors” for officials to consider in immigration cases of people from 19 countries. The change in guidance was under consideration before the shooting.

The administration said it would also re-examine “every Green Card” for immigrants from those 19 countries, which are subject to a travel ban enacted in June.

In the Thursday night social media posts, Mr. Trump singled out refugees from Somalia, who he claimed, without offering evidence, were “completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota.”

The posts seemed to distill remarks the president made earlier on Thursday, in which he used the shooting to cast suspicion on refugees in general and attack Gov.

Donald Trump has said he will “permanently pause migration from all third world countries”, a day after two national guard members were shot in Washington DC in an attack that authorities suspect was carried out by an Afghan national.

The president said his administration would “end all federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens” and remove “anyone who is not a net asset to the United States”. It was unclear how he would carry out such a pause, as his previous attempts have been challenged by the courts and Congress.

Trump’s social media post followed his announcement of the death of Sarah Beckstrom, one of two guard members shot in the attack close to the White House on Wednesday.

US regulators ‘taking seriously’ allegations of bankers’ support for Epstein

US regulators say they are taking “very seriously” allegations that top banks may have facilitated Jeffrey Epstein’s criminal activity, as they faced calls to investigate executives, including the former Barclays boss Jes Staley.

In correspondence seen by the Guardian, officials from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currencyand the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said they had reviewed a letter from the Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren, which raised concerns over bankers’ alleged support for the convicted child sex offender Epstein.

What has Warren said about Staley? She said he allegedly protected Epstein’s access to the banking system while working at JP Morgan in the early 2000s.

Rescue efforts end at Hong Kong tower block fire as death toll reaches 128

The death toll from the Hong Kong apartment complex fire that began on Wednesday has risen to 128, with about 200 missing, officials have said, as rescue efforts ended.

Fire crews combed the complex for survivors after the blaze swept through seven of its eight towers in one of the city’s deadliest fires. The inferno at the site, which housed more than 4,600 people, began during building renovations. The authorities said they believed a highly flammable styrofoam found in every elevator window fuelled the intensity of the fire.

What do we know about the missing people? About 200 people remain unaccounted for, including 89 unidentified bodies. Officials said the fire was extinguished but they needed to wait for the towers to cool before entering, as some areas remained above 392F (200C). Investigators estimate it will take three to four weeks to gather the evidence.

WASHINGTON— In the wake of the shooting of two National Guard service members in Washington, D.C., Wednesday by an Afghan national, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services issued new guidance allowing for negative, country-specific factors to be considered when vetting aliens from 19 high-risk countries. This guidance comes after the Trump administration halted refugee resettlement from Afghanistan and the entry of Afghan nationals in its first year of office.

“My primary responsibility is to ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible,” said USCIS Director Joseph Edlow. “This includes an assessment of where they are coming from and why. Yesterday’s horrific events make it abundantly clear the Biden administration spent the last four years dismantling basic vetting and screening standards, prioritizing the rapid resettlement of aliens from high-risk countries over the safety of American citizens. The Trump administration takes the opposite approach. Effective immediately, I am issuing new policy guidance that authorizes USCIS officers to consider country-specific factors as significant negative factors when reviewing immigration requests. American lives come first.”

The updated guidance, including consideration of country-specific factors such as a country’s ability to issue secure identity documents, will further strengthen USCIS’ implementation of President Trump’s Presidential Proclamation (PP) 10949, Restricting the Entry of Foreign Nationals to Protect the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats. It will allow USCIS officers to more meaningfully assess whether an alien is a threat to public safety and national security.

This policy guidance is effective immediately and applies to requests pending or filed on or after Nov. 27, 2025.

Vermont is one of 22 states arguing that the U.S. Department of Agriculture violated federal law in how it implemented changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known in Vermont as 3SquaresVT.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, targets USDA guidance issued on October 31, 2025, that the states say wrongly strips food benefits from refugees, asylees, and other immigrants who entered the country through humanitarian pathways. The Vermont Attorney General’s Office announced the legal action in coordination with attorneys general from states including New York, California, Massachusetts, and Michigan.

What Is the One Big Beautiful Bill Act?

The dispute stems from the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” a sweeping federal law enacted on July 4, 2025, through the budget reconciliation process. The law, officially designated as H.R. 1, made substantial changes to federal spending programs, including new restrictions on which non-citizens can receive SNAP benefits. The law’s text limits SNAP eligibility to U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, lawful permanent residents (green card holders), Cuban and Haitian entrants, and citizens of nations with Compact of Free Association agreements with the United States.

A key provision of the law requires lawful permanent residents to wait five years after obtaining their green card before becoming eligible for SNAP. The law also introduced what it calls the “State Quality Control Incentive,” which penalizes states financially if their error rates in distributing benefits exceed certain thresholds. According to analysis by Holland & Knight, states with error rates above 6% could become liable for 15% to 20% of benefit costs—expenses the federal government has historically covered entirely.

What the States Are Arguing

The Refugee Eligibility Question

The core of the lawsuit involves how the USDA interprets the law’s effect on refugees and asylees. Under a 1996 federal law, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, refugees and asylees were explicitly exempted from the five-year waiting period for SNAP benefits. That exemption, codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1612, has allowed refugees to receive food assistance immediately upon arrival and to continue receiving it after they adjust to lawful permanent resident status, as they are required to do after one year in the country.

The states argue that this exemption remains in effect because the One Big Beautiful Bill Act did not explicitly repeal it. According to the complaint filed by New York and other states, the USDA’s October guidance omits “former refugees” from the list of individuals exempt from the five-year bar. This omission, the states contend, effectively rewrites federal law through agency guidance rather than congressional action.

The practical effect of the USDA’s interpretation is significant. Under the agency’s reading, a refugee who has lived legally in the United States for one year and then obtains a green card—as required by law—would lose SNAP eligibility for four additional years. The National Immigration Law Center has described this as creating a perverse incentive where gaining permanent legal status results in loss of food assistance.

The Timeline Problem

The lawsuit also challenges the USDA’s implementation timeline as a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Federal regulations at 7 CFR § 275.12 provide states with a 120-day grace period after new rules take effect, during which errors in benefit calculations are not counted against them. This grace period exists because implementing complex eligibility changes requires states to update computer systems, retrain caseworkers, and notify affected recipients.

The USDA’s implementation memorandum, issued October 31, 2025, declared that the grace period had already expired as of November 1—meaning states had effectively one day’s notice. The USDA guidance document asserts that because the law was enacted July 4, the 120-day period ran from that date rather than from when the agency issued its detailed instructions.

The states argue this interpretation is “impossible under USDA’s own regulations.” Without guidance on who qualifies under the new rules, state agencies could not program their eligibility systems or train staff. The late issuance of guidance coupled with the retroactive expiration of the grace period, the states contend, guarantees that errors will occur—triggering the law’s new financial penalties.

Financial Stakes for Vermont

Vermont’s 3SquaresVT program distributes approximately $151 million in food benefits annually, according to Seven Days. Under the new penalty structure, if Vermont’s error rate exceeds 6%, the state could become responsible for 15% of benefit costs—potentially more than $22 million annually.

Larger states face proportionally larger exposure. New York, which distributes $7.35 billion in SNAP benefits, could face penalties exceeding $1 billion annually according to the New York Attorney General’s complaint. Massachusetts has estimated potential penalties of $131 million to $394 million annually based on current error rates, according to state government updates.

The states describe being placed in what the Vermont Attorney General’s office calls an “impossible position”: either terminate benefits for recipients who may be legally eligible under federal statute, or continue providing benefits and risk substantial financial penalties if courts ultimately uphold the USDA’s interpretation.

Related Legal Actions

This lawsuit is one of several legal challenges to federal SNAP policy currently proceeding through federal courts. Earlier in November, New York Attorney General Letitia James obtained a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from attempting to claw back SNAP benefits during a federal government shutdown. That order remains in effect while related litigation continues.

The District of Columbia Attorney General has also filed suit to protect SNAP benefits, noting that more than 320 small retailers in the District depend on SNAP revenue. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced her state’s participation in the coalition lawsuit the same day Vermont filed.

What the Law Says

The legal dispute turns on a principle of statutory interpretation known as the “canon against implied repeal.” Under this doctrine, courts presume that when Congress passes a new law, it does not automatically override previous laws unless it explicitly says so or the two laws directly contradict each other.

The states argue that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the 1996 refugee exemption can coexist: the new law defines who qualifies as a lawful permanent resident, while the older law specifies that refugees who become permanent residents remain exempt from the waiting period. Because the new law does not mention or repeal the 1996 exemption, the states contend it remains valid law.

The USDA’s position, as reflected in its guidance, appears to treat the One Big Beautiful Bill Act as a comprehensive restatement of non-citizen eligibility that supersedes previous frameworks. The Church World Service, a refugee resettlement organization, has published analysis noting that if the USDA’s interpretation is upheld, it would represent a significant departure from 30 years of policy treating refugees as exempt from waiting periods for public benefits.

What Happens Next

The coalition of state attorneys general is seeking an injunction to block the USDA guidance from taking effect while the case proceeds. If a court grants preliminary relief, states would be able to continue administering SNAP under the previous rules while the underlying legal questions are resolved.

The case could take months or longer to resolve at the district court level, with appeals likely regardless of the outcome. If the states prevail, the USDA would be required to issue new guidance consistent with the court’s interpretation of the law. If the federal government prevails, states would need to implement the eligibility restrictions as the USDA directs or face the financial penalties established by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

A final resolution of the statutory conflict between the 2025 law and the 1996 refugee exemption may ultimately require either a Supreme Court ruling or a technical correction from Congress. Until then, the question of whether refugees who become lawful permanent residents retain their food assistance eligibility remains legally contested.

For Vermont SNAP recipients with questions about their eligibility, the Vermont Department for Children and Families administers the 3SquaresVT program and can provide information about current rules and any changes as they occur.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OcQz!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3b2aad5-cb91-450a-8bce-52453804347f_1648x1122.png",N,,2025-11-28 09:59:55.994986

After less than a year spent destroying the federal government, sending troops into Democratic-led cities, violating the rights of immigrants and trying to rig the 2026 elections, momentum is no longer on his side.

The Supreme Court appears poised to axe Trump’s flagship tariffs. His domestic troop deployments and political prosecutions are on shaky legal footing. His plan to gerrymander his way to a GOP victory in the midterms may be backfiring. And his efforts to suppress the Epstein files failed when his usually compliant Republican Party pushed back.

Even Trump’s relationship with the public is fraying. After much talk about the cost of groceries — an “old-fashioned,” “beautiful” word that the president once defined as “a bag with different things in it” — Americans have grown tired of waiting for prices to drop. Instead, it’s Trump’s polling numbers that are falling.

This year, the only ones in the administration having a good Thanksgiving may be Waddle and Gobble, the two turkeys Trump pardoned earlier this week.

The harder they come…

Trump burst into 2025 full throttle. After taking the oath of office in January, he effectively declared war on the federal government, firing civil servants and upending foreign aid as we know it.

The president sought to rapidly change the country and its government largely through decree. In his first 100 days, he signed 142 executive orders or memorandums — more than any other president in U.S. history.

His aim was to reinterpret the Constitution, vastly expand the executive branch’s power over federal elections and cleave full departments from the federal government without congressional approval.

Under the sway of Stephen Miller and other immigration hardliners, the new administration moved quickly to conduct “mass deportations.”

Across the country, masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have detained tens of thousands of people. Despite promises to arrest violent criminals and drug cartels, Trump’s immigration crackdowns have primarily targeted ordinary undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers.

The administration has also run roughshod over due process. In March, the U.S. agreed to pay El Salvador $6 million to imprison hundreds of people — without trial — in its notorious Terrorism Confinement Center. Its illegal removal of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran asylum seeker, became a prominent early example of the Trump administration’s egregious human rights violations.

In June, Trump began to federalize National Guard troops for deployment in major Democratic-led cities, an attempt to integrate the military into routine policing.

That same month, the president moved to secure Republican control over the country for years to come: He urged Republican-controlled states to redraw their congressional districts and engineer a GOP advantage in the 2026 midterm elections. Several states — Texas, North Carolina, Missouri — scrambled to answer the president’s call.

Taking another page out of the authoritarian playbook, Trump also went after his political opponents.

In September, he ousted the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia and appointed his ally Lindsey Halligan to the role. She quickly pressed charges against former FBI director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, two of the president’s longtime perceived enemies.

…the harder they fall

At the worst moments this year, Trump appeared poised to rewrite American governance and engineer a long-term electoral advantage for his party. But over the past several months, his attack on American democracy has encountered a string of setbacks and outright defeats.

The administration is currently tied up in hundreds of court cases over its most extreme actions. Its aggressive immigration raids have provoked intense pushback in cities like Chicago, Illinois and Portland, Oregon.

Some states — Kansas, New Hampshire, and, initially, Indiana — balked at his calls to gerrymander.

Perhaps most importantly, courts have started to hand down rulings blocking and delaying some of Trump’s most egregious actions and executive orders. Those decisions have been particularly important for slowing Trump’s unprecedented drive for nationwide mid-decade partisan redistricting.

Earlier this month, in a case that predated Trump’s redistricting war, a judge in Utah ruled that a gerrymandered congressional map passed by the Republican-controlled legislature violated a voter-approved constitutional amendment forbidding partisan gerrymanders. She ordered the state to adopt a more fair one. Under this new map, Utah Democrats will have a good shot at winning one of the state’s four congressional seats.

A week later, a panel of three federal judges blocked* Texas from using a new gerrymandered map in the 2026 election. In a scathing opinion, Judge Jeffrey Brown — a Trump appointee, no less — wrote that the map likely represented an illegal racial gerrymander.

That ruling was particularly monumental because the Lone Star State’s decision to redistrict and give Republicans five more safe Congressional seats had set off a gerrymandering arms race across the country.

In direct response to the Texas gerrymander, California legislators decided that they too needed to redraw their map to cancel out Texas’ five new GOP seats. Under state law, they were required to get the voters’ approval. During the Nov. 4 elections — which saw Democrats sweep the polls, winning gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey — California voters overwhelmingly approved their plan. And Virginia is also moving to redraw its congressional map.

After Texas’ loss in court, it appears Trump’s redistricting efforts could be backfiring.

Trump is also losing his battles to send in the military for policing. The Supreme Court is currently considering a technical question about the precise language of the archaic statute Trump used to federalize thousands of National Guard troops for domestic deployments. That suggests justices may issue a ruling that will undermine most of these deployments.

Even those launched under other laws appear to be at risk. On Nov. 18, a Tennessee state judge found that a group of local officials challenging Gov. Bill Lee’s (R) decision to deploy Guard troops to Memphis at Trump’s urging would likely succeed in arguing it violated state law.

Two days later, a federal court rejected Trump’s assertion that he had the right to independently mobilize the D.C. National Guard for routine police work. Instead, the judge found that the deployment of more than 2,000 Guard troops to Washington was unlawful and violated the District’s right to govern itself.

His political prosecutions are also failing. On Monday, a federal judge dismissed without prejudice the DOJ’s cases against Comey and James after finding that Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi circumvented vacancy laws in appointing Halligan.

The judge ruled that Halligan was serving unlawfully when she sought indictments against Comey and James — making her the fourth Trump-appointed acting U.S. attorney determined to be illegitimate.

Because the statute of limitations on the charges against Comey had expired, the DOJ is unlikely to be able to resurrect its case against him.

That ruling was not just a loss for Trump, but also an embarrassment. Just days earlier, the DOJ admitted that Halligan — an insurance lawyer who had never before prosecuted a case — never actually presented the final indictment used to charge Comey to the grand jury, a revelation that likely made the charges void.

It’s not over yet

Of course, we’re not anywhere near the finish line yet. The midterms are still a year away, and Trump has three more years in office.

There’s still a lot that he and his allies can do to gerrymander up a congressional majority in 2026 and exact retribution on his foes. And that process is already underway.

After the Republican-controlled Missouri legislature redrew its congressional maps at Trump’s behest, voting rights activists started gathering signatures to organize a state-wide referendum on the gerrymander and let voters decide.

Republicans — including the national Republican National Committee — are fighting tooth and nail to prevent the Missouri voters from having their say. They’re trying to disqualify thousands of signatures, sending out threatening mass text messages, and challenging voters’ very right to override the state legislature. Missouri voters* are also fighting back in court — they’ve filed multiple lawsuits arguing mid-decade redistricting violates the state constitution.

After the federal judges rejected Texas’ illegal racial gerrymander, the state appealed. The Supreme Court may soon overturn the lower court’s decision and let Texas use the new map in 2026 — and potentially earn the GOP five more congressional seats. Republicans are also seeking to block California’s new map.

And while Trump’s political prosecutions may be faltering, the administration appears to have a lot more in the works. John Bolton, Trump’s former national security advisor turned frequent critic, is under indictment.

The administration is slinging allegations of mortgage fraud at numerous prominent Democrats and Trump foes. There are signs that the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida may be preparing to open a special grand jury criminal investigation against officials who have attempted to hold Trump accountable over the past decade.

And the DOJ is targeting other Democratic lawmakers and critics, including six members of Congress who recently reminded soldiers that they are obligated to refuse illegal orders.

But, for the moment, the administration’s court losses are piling up. Some of its designs on American democracy are hitting a multitude of obstacles — chief among them public opinion.

Despite his claims of record-high approval ratings, Trump’s actions over the past 10 months have angered a majority of the American public. Aggregate polling numbers indicate that, since turning negative in March, Trump’s numbers continue to nosedive.

Large-scale protests across the country only emphasize his unpopularity. In fact, the nationwide No Kings demonstrations on Oct. 19 were likely the country’s largest single-day protest ever.

The battle isn’t over. But, this Thanksgiving, the only thing Trump may be gobble-gobbling is a heaping plate of defeats.

Local law enforcement agencies would also be eligible for quarterly monetary performance awards.
In March, Houston officers were directed to contact immigration authorities when they encountered anyone with a deportation order ICE listed in a national database.
We enforce state and city laws, not immigration, not ICE,” Whitmire said at a Nov. 12 City Council meeting.","SAN ANTONIO — When Immigration and Customs Enforcement came calling on Dallas Police Chief Daniel Comeaux months ago to ask his officers to assist in supporting President Donald Trump’s sweeping immigration enforcement operations, the chief of police in the third-largest city in this very red state said no.

On the other hand, in Texas’ largest city, Houston Mayor John Whitmire, a Democrat, has been under fire from residents and officials since he was quoted in the Houston Chronicle acknowledging some cooperation with ICE. The police department there has no formal agreement with the agency, but calls from the city’s police force to ICE, mostly as result of traffic stops, have risen 1000% since President Donald Trump was re-elected, the Houston Chronicle reported based on public records.

The approaches in Dallas and Houston show the quandary some police departments face as they weigh their cities’ public safety priorities against the Trump administration’s pressures to multiply its enforcement forces. Texas’ largest cities, where the majority of its Black and Hispanic populations are concentrated, face a tough choice: partner with ICE and risk blowback from their own communities or take a pass and risk seeing the administration send ICE, Border Patrol or National Guard troops to their cities. Chicago, Los Angeles and Charlotte, North Carolina, chose the latter option, only to see federal immigration enforcement arrive on their streets.

Texas Republican lawmakers and the governor have generally sided with helping the Trump administration by passing laws that require cooperation. Sheriffs’ offices in Texas counties with populations of more than 100,000 are required by law to sign an agreement with ICE by December 2026. Texas’ Department of Public Safety, which includes highway troopers, has also signed an agreement with ICE.

Sheriffs’ offices and other law enforcement departments around the country, including in cities like Las Vegas and Miami, are signing up with unprecedented speed to a decades-old program to partner with ICE, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration think tank that has surveyed departments about the partnerships over the years.

A spokesperson frofor m the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement: “ICE is not only supercharging our hiring, we are also multiplying partnerships with state and local law enforcement to remove the worst of the worst including murderers, gang members, rapists, terrorists, and pedophiles from our country. ... We encourage all state and local law enforcement agencies to become a 287(g) partner and join us in the fight to make America safe again.”

Nonetheless, none of the police departments of the top 10 U.S. cities, which include Houston, Dallas and San Antonio, have signed on as partners with ICE, according to a list the agency posts on its website.

In many cases, not cooperating comes with turning down money that is being offered to local and state law enforcement agencies as an incentive, said Muzaffar Chishti, who directs the New York office of the Migration Policy Institute.

“What has added a whole new wrinkle to this is money, which has placed more and more pressure on ICE officers and these 287(g) officers to arrest and detain more people,” he said. The 287(g) program, whose use has ebbed and flowed under different administrations, gives immigration enforcement powers to state and local law enforcement agencies.

DHS said its program includes reimbursements for each 287(g)-trained officer’s annual salary and benefits, as well as a percentage of their overtime. Local law enforcement agencies would also be eligible for quarterly monetary performance awards.

Comeaux said ICE had offered Dallas up to $25 million in reimbursement for partnering with it.

But he decided, and a joint City Council committee affirmed in a Nov. 6 meeting, that pulling police officers from their current duties and putting them on immigration enforcement arrests would be detrimental to what so far is a trend of lower homicide rates, lower violent crime, fewer traffic deaths and improved police response times, according to Comeaux. The committee voted against partnering.

“It will not make Dallas any safer, because we are aggressively going after those who are committing violent crimes already,” Comeaux said at the time, “so this program would not help us in any kind of way.”

In a statement, Comeaux repeated that he turned down an offer of $25 million from ICE because it would not have covered overtime costs and officers would be reassigned under federal oversight, which could negatively affect response times and erode public trust.

Although the Dallas Police Department does not partner with ICE, the Dallas County Sheriff’s Office does notify it about immigrants in its custody who may have immigration violations. An ICE field office in Dallas that serves North Texas and Oklahoma was the site of a shooting in September, in which two people who were detained were killed and a third was wounded.

Things have been less clear in Houston, where Whitmire, the mayor, has come under fire locally following his statement about cooperating with ICE. In March, Houston officers were directed to contact immigration authorities when they encountered anyone with a deportation order ICE listed in a national database. Whitmire sought to clarify his comments amid uproar in the city, which has a high immigrant population.

“We are the Houston Police Department. We enforce state and city laws, not immigration, not ICE,” Whitmire said at a Nov. 12 City Council meeting.

The department has had to defend its calls to ICE, including one in April when it alerted ICE about a woman from El Salvador after she had dialed 911 to report domestic abuse.

The Houston Police Department said in a statement that it does not ask about immigration status but that officers are “required to contact the issuing agency when they encounter a person with a warrant. After verifying the warrant with ICE, the officer detains the individual and transfers custody to an ICE agent.”

Whitmire’s office said in a statement that while immigration matters fall under federal jurisdiction, “anyone who breaks the law in the City of Houston will be held accountable. When police encounter an individual with an outstanding warrant from another law enforcement agency, they are required to notify that agency.”

ICE has added hundreds of thousands of administrative warrants — which are for civil violations and are not signed by judges — to the National Crime Information Center database, which police officers use to check for warrants when they pull someone over for a traffic stop.

The president of the Houston Police Officers’ Union, Douglas Griffith, told NPR that the warrants are showing up in the database and that “if they pop up with a warrant, then we have no alternative but to take those people into custody.”

But ICE officials who spoke at the Dallas City Council committee meeting this month said assisting the agency with immigration enforcement would be a benefit.

“It’s good for the city, because you definitely have some individuals that fall through the cracks,” an ICE official who identified himself only as an assistant Dallas field office director named Francis said at the meeting. For example, he said, a person released on traffic citations could have been previously deported, re-entered the country illegally and possibly committed offenses.

He also pointed to the arrest by a police officer with 287(g) training in Oklahoma of a foreign-born person who had been flagged by Interpol.

But Comeaux, a former special agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration Houston office, told council members he rejected joining the 287(g) program because the “most important thing right now for us to keep everyone safe and keep the community believing in their police department, that it’s doing the very best to serve them every single day.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-11/251125-houston-dps-immigration-mn-1620-d1d566.jpg",N,,2025-11-28 06:56:17.957758

“They wouldn’t tell her why she was being detained,” Pomerleau told The Boston Globe.
“She didn’t understand it at all.” Lopez Belloza was taken to ICE’s Burlington field office in an unmarked car, according to the lawyer.
“I have worked so hard to be able to be at Babson my first semester, that was my dream,” Lopez Belloza told the Globe from Honduras, recounting her frightening experience.
“She was in a court process that she thought ended favorably, she was then nine or 10-years-old,” Pomerleau told 7 News Boston.","A Massachusetts college student has been deported to Honduras after attempting to fly down to Austin, Texas, to surprise her family for Thanksgiving.

Any Lucia Lopez Belloza, a 19 year-old business major at Babson College in Wellesley who came to the U.S. in 2014 when she was eight years old, was detained at Boston Logan International Airport last Thursday as she was about to board her flight, having already successfully passed through security without incident.

Todd Pomerleau, her attorney, explained that Lopez Belloza had been told there was a problem with her ticket when she scanned her boarding pass and referred to a customer service desk, whereupon she was taken into federal custody.

“They wouldn’t tell her why she was being detained,” Pomerleau told The Boston Globe. “She didn’t understand it at all.”

Lopez Belloza was taken to ICE’s Burlington field office in an unmarked car, according to the lawyer. Then, in a bitter irony, she was flown to Texas on Saturday after all, only to subsequently find herself deported to Honduras, a country to which she has not returned since childhood.

Only after 48 hours was she able to call her frantic parents from her grandparents’ home in San Pedro Sula to let them know what had happened, heartbroken to miss the holidays with her young sisters and fearful for the future.

Speaking to CBS Austin, Pomerleau scathingly characterized the tactics used to detain his client as an “unconstitutional bag job” and Lopez Belloza as “a Dreamer living a draconian nightmare right now.”

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told The Independent: “On November 20, Customs and Border Protection arrested Any Lopez-Belloza, an illegal alien from Honduras, as she was attempting to board a flight at Boston Logan International Airport.

“This illegal alien entered the country in 2014 and an immigration judge ordered her removed from the country in 2015, over 10 years ago. She has illegally stayed in the country since. Lopez-Belloza will remain in ICE custody pending removal.”

The Independent also reached out to ICE for comment.

“I have worked so hard to be able to be at Babson my first semester, that was my dream,” Lopez Belloza told the Globe from Honduras, recounting her frightening experience. “I’m losing everything.”

Nayna Gupta, policy director at the American Immigration Council, has been helping the student’s family since her plight became known and said Lopez Belloza had been the subject of an outstanding removal order since 2017, although she had not been aware of it.

“[Her family] didn’t know to show up somewhere, and she certainly had no idea of any of this,” Gupta said, explaining that immigration courts can issue such orders without the subject being present and that notifications are all too frequently mailed to incorrect addresses.

“People with final orders of removal, like this young college freshman from Babson College, are highly vulnerable under an administration that is pursuing such a cruel and indiscriminate deportation agenda,” she added, alluding to President Donald Trump’s second term crackdown on illegal immigration.

According to court documents ABC News, a federal judge had ordered the government not to remove Lopez Belloza from the U.S. and not to transfer her outside of Massachusetts, instructions that appear to have been ignored.

“She was in a court process that she thought ended favorably, she was then nine or 10-years-old,” Pomerleau told 7 News Boston. “She’s a child under the immigration law. She’s under the age of 21. She’s going to college. She has zero record.

“We believe her constitutional rights were violated, the way she was arrested, not having any notice why she’s arrested, not shown any documents to justify her abrupt, egregious removal from the United States of America.

“You’re supposed to be thankful this time of the year. Just be thankful ICE hasn’t destroyed your family.”

Ricky Soto, a family friend who works with the student’s father Francis at a Texas tailoring business, said that he had arranged the fateful ticket for Lopez Belloza to return to her parents and subsequently helped them to find legal backing.

“It really didn’t feel like it was real life because nothing made sense,” he told the Globe. “I can only imagine how terrifying that was for her… She was so excited, because she wasn’t expecting to come home.”

He added that the family had endured a tough time since settling in the U.S. but were “really proud” when their eldest daughter had been accepted into Babson on a scholarship.

Pomerleau said his client was “really sad” about what had happened to her, missed her family and was concerned that she may never be able to complete her finals, which are scheduled in a matter of weeks.

“I told her, ‘We’re going to fight like hell until we bring you back,’” he said.","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/11/27/16/30/Any-Lucia-Lopez-Belloza.png?trim=39,0,313,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-11-28 07:57:04.005016

Last Wednesday, shortly after 2:00 p.m., 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal opened fire on several National Guard members patrolling the streets of Washington. The attack occurred on the eve of Thanksgiving near the busy Farragut West Metro station, frequented by tourists and federal employees due to its proximity to the White House. Two National Guard soldiers were critically wounded: 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom died last night after being shot twice, once in the chest and once in the head; her comrade, 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe, is still fighting for his life after undergoing surgery.

Lakanwal was immediately arrested by police after an exchange of gunfire in which he was wounded. He is an Afghan refugee who entered the United States on September 8, 2021, as part of a program to repatriate personnel who had worked with U.S. authorities during the war against the Taliban. According to State Department data, Operation Allies Welcome — approved during the administration of Democratic president Joe Biden — helped some 76,000 Afghans travel to the United States to avoid falling into the hands of the Taliban, who seized control of the country after the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. troops. Many of them worked with the CIA or the U.S. military on high-risk security missions or assisted diplomats as translators and interpreters.

Most had to undergo rigorous vetting by U.S. security agencies to rule out concerns about their backgrounds and confirm they had no ties to the Taliban. This process has been one of the main points of criticism from President Donald Trump and his allies, who have repeatedly insisted that it allowed Taliban fighters to slip through. Although efforts were made to provide all necessary security guarantees, the investigation carried out by Republicans in Congress reveals some shortcomings due to the speed of the admissions process.

Refugees who passed the vetting process were granted a permit allowing them to reside in the United States for two years with temporary status. More than 40% of those admitted to the program were eligible for Special Immigrant Visas (SIVs) because they took great risks to defend the United States or were relatives of those who did, the Department of Homeland Security explained to several U.S. media outlets on Thursday.

Upon arriving in the United States, Lakanwal settled in Bellingham, a small town north of Seattle, where he lived with his wife and five children. After his two-year temporary visa expired, he applied for permanent asylum in December 2024. His request was approved on April 23 of this year, three months after Trump took office, according to State Department sources consulted by CNN.

Trump and his team moved swiftly on Wednesday after learning the identity of the attacker who targeted the members of the National Guard. They quickly criticized the Biden administration for allowing Lakanwal into the country and used the case to push for tougher immigration policies. They ordered a suspension of the review of Afghan immigration procedures and a reassessment of the permits of those already living in the United States. According to AP, this raises the possibility that the settlement rights of Afghan allies who worked with U.S. forces could be restricted.

“[Lakanwal] was flown in by the Biden administration in September 2021 on those infamous flights that everybody was talking about,” Trump said Wednesday night in an extraordinary, pre-recorded address following the shooting in the nation’s capital. “Nobody knew who was coming in, nobody knew anything about it. His status was extended under legislation signed by President Biden, a disastrous president, the worst in the history of our country,” he added before a shocked nation on the eve of Thanksgiving, one of the most cherished holidays for families.

“This attack highlights the fundamental national security threat facing our nation. Twenty million unknown and unvetted foreigners from all over the world, from countries that you don’t want to even know about. No country can tolerate such a risk to our very survival,” the Republican president added during his speech, exaggerating the figures.

After the shooting, the government stopped processing all immigration applications from Afghan citizens “pending further review of security and vetting protocols,” U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) said on X. “We must now reexamine every single alien who’s entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country,” Trump added in the video recorded Wednesday.

Some supporters of the repatriation process warned on Thursday of the risks now faced by those who escaped the Taliban. “I don’t want people to leverage this tragedy into a political ploy,” said Shawn VanDiver, president of #AfghanEvac. “We aren’t going to be tricked. One man’s lunatic behavior mustn’t be used to vilify a whole community, especially one that stood by us for so long,” he wrote on social media.

The immigration policy promoted by Trump is one of the most controversial issues at the start of his second term in the White House. He has ordered the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to pursue and deport undocumented immigrants. These enforcement actions have sparked large protests in cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and Boston. So far this year, ICE has participated in more than 60,000 immigrant arrests. In addition, Trump has ordered a review of the cases of 200,000 refugees admitted during Biden’s term and is ending the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) granted to political refugees, affecting tens of thousands of people from Venezuela, South Sudan, Syria, Afghanistan, and other countries.

Trump also ordered a comprehensive review of green card holders from high-risk countries on Thursday, according to a post on X by Joseph Edlow, head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. “At the direction of @POTUS, I have directed a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern,” he wrote on the social network.

Trump went one step further in a post on his Truth Social platform on Thursday: “I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions.”

The National Guard on the streets

The other controversial issue is the presence of National Guard troops on the streets of some U.S. cities, coincidentally all governed by Democrats.

In early August, Trump issued an order to deploy approximately 2,600 National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., in response to what he described as a “crime emergency.” The National Guard is a military force under the command of the governors of each of the 50 states. Its members are reservists — they are volunteers who work or study and are only deployed in specific situations, such as natural disasters or large-scale civil unrest.

Soldiers typically patrol in small groups. They walk the streets and public spaces, especially near subway stations. The National Guard’s role is to deter crime, and while its members cannot make arrests, they have assisted in immigration raids ordered by the White House.

Trump boasts that there is less crime on the streets of Washington, D.C. after the deployment of troops, contrary to official statistics from the city’s police department.

The deployment of these troops has drawn criticism from Democrats and numerous federal officials in the capital. Washington’s Attorney General Brian Schwalb sued the Trump administration over the deployment, according to the Associated Press. A federal judge ordered the troops to withdraw and the mission to be shut down. He has given the government until December 11 to comply with the order and to appeal the decision.

Some army officials have also expressed concern about the risk the deployment could pose to troops, according to the AP. It “presents an opportunity for criminals, violent extremists, issue motivated groups and lone actors to advance their interests, given the prominence of locality, and expected media coverage for the mission,” an internal memo states.

Despite criticism over the deployment of troops in cities, Trump ordered an additional 500 National Guard troops to Washington on Wednesday, following the shooting. The city’s mayor, Muriel Bowser, expressed her opposition to the deployment. “These young people should be at home in West Virginia with their families,” she stated.

In a video recorded on Wednesday, the Republican president also referred to the Somali community in Minnesota — where nearly 90,000 Somalis live, the largest such community in the country — even though they had nothing to do with the incident: “An example is Minnesota, where hundreds of thousands of Somalians are ripping off our country and ripping apart that once great state. Billions of dollars are lost and gangs of Somalians come from a country that doesn’t even have a government. No laws, no water, no military, no nothing, as their representatives in our country preach to us about our Constitution and how our country is no good.”

Trump’s words reflect the White House strategy of toughening immigration policies on any pretext, without sufficient justification.",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/7ITWIIWR6JOHDBIEHP3P4IAYYE.jpg?auth=16578d7bda5a2713ba3ddd08ec678a54405871353e745b8d03b7f23b249b90dd&width=1200,N,,2025-11-28 05:56:23.598748

Pope Leo XIV, an American, has also come out against federal immigration policy, calling it ""extremely disrespectful.""
He urged balance in immigration policy.","Delaware's largest Roman Catholic figure recently joined other bishops in the U.S. in condemning federal immigration policy.

The Most Rev. William Koenig, bishop of the Diocese of Wilmington, runs the diocese for all Catholic parishes of Delaware and Maryland's Eastern Shore. He joined 215 other Catholic bishops in approving a statement advocating for reform of federal immigration policies to ensure human dignity and respect, the Nov. 12 statement said.

The statement said there is a balance to be found between national security and human rights, and it calls for compassion toward immigrants.

""Despite obstacles and prejudices, generations of immigrants have made enormous contributions to the well-being of our nation,"" the statement reads. ""We as Catholic bishops love our country and pray for its peace and prosperity. For this very reason, we feel compelled now in this environment to raise our voices in defense of God-given human dignity.""

Koenig was even featured in a video promoting the statement on the social media of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The statement came from the Fall Plenary Assembly in Baltimore, where the bishops deliberated over this topic and issued this rare statement.

What Delaware's bishop has to say

In an interview with Delaware Online/The News Journal, Koenig said a small group was asked to draft a statement, which was worked on by small groups within the conference. The process took a few days, he said.

Statements like this can be released only when all the bishops are together, which is usually during the twice-annual plenary meetings.

Koenig said he is on board with the statement and hopes to see immigration reform.

""They're vital parts of the community,"" he said. ""Let's help them become naturalized.""

He emphasized that exclusionary treatment of immigrants is not a new phenomenon. The official statement says that the bishops ""are disturbed when we see among our people a climate of fear and anxiety around questions of profiling and immigration enforcement.""

While deportations were common under the Biden and Obama administrations, both Trump administrations have used mass deportations and enhanced border security as key selling points to voters for nearly a decade. The increase of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago has led to protests from locals.

A ProPublica investigation said that more than 170 U.S. citizens have been detained by ICE, and inhumane treatment by ICE agents has been frequently reported over the course of the year.

Growing sentiment toward immigration reform

The statement on behalf of all bishops is pretty rare, but the sentiment is not unheard of recently. Over the summer, the Dioceses of Nashville and San Bernadino excused church members from attending weekly Mass over fear of ICE agents conducting arrests at local churches.

Pope Leo XIV, an American, has also come out against federal immigration policy, calling it ""extremely disrespectful.""

Koenig said everyone is made in God's image and likeness, and that he would like to see additional pathways to citizenship rather than immigrants treated with no respect. He takes a biblical perspective toward the issue.

""I certainly would want to respect someone who doesn't look like us, someone who isn't from our country,"" Koenig said. ""If the person needs more time to get legal status, try to work with that person.""

He urged balance in immigration policy. He understands the need for national security, he said, but wants the country to ""temper justice with mercy.""

""Do what we need to do, but we need to do it with compassion,"" he said.

The reactions to the pope's and bishops' statements from the Delaware Catholic congregation has been pretty quiet, according to Koenig. A study from the Pew Research Center found that 70% of Delawareans were religious, 19% of whom were Catholic. He said the Hispanic community, very often targeted by ICE nationally, have great faith and ""enrich"" the diocese with its enthusiasm.

He said the role the diocese's parishes will continue to play in Delaware is to offer spiritual and pastoral care, on top of the charitable work many parishes already undertake. He also encouraged everyone to read the entire statement.

""People in Wilmington are nice,"" he said.

Outlook The convergence of Delaware fiduciary duty expansion and intensified federal enforcement and regulatory oversight signals a new era of personal accountability, both civilly and criminally.
Effective oversight is no longer just good governance; it is personal risk mitigation.","Courts, regulators, enforcers, and plaintiffs’ counsel used to clearly distinguish between entity-level and individual responsibility. But emerging theories of corporate officer liability are eroding that long-standing separation.

Recent developments in Delaware and federal enforcement policy signal a heightened risk of personal civil and criminal exposure for executives under both state fiduciary duty doctrines and federal fraud and control-person statutes.

Given these changes, as well as the rise of novel exposure points, companies should establish or review safeguards designed to prevent misconduct and create defensible documentation of oversight.

Delaware Litigation

In the landmark In re McDonald’s Corp. Stockholder Derivative Litigation, the Delaware Court of Chancery dramatically extended executive civil legal exposure. The court held that corporate officers (not just board members) owe Caremark-style oversight duties within their respective spheres of responsibility.

For executives, the implications are significant. Failing to act on credible warning signs regarding compliance, workplace conduct, or operational risks can trigger personal derivative liability, even absent direct participation in wrongdoing.

Post-McDonald’s cases have begun applying this reasoning to a range of C-suite positions. For example, in July, the court in Hizkiyev & Barak v. Kaseya, Inc. cited McDonald’s Corp. in concluding that officers and key managerial employees owe the same fiduciary duties as directors.

The broadening of executive legal exposure likely will extend to jurisdictions beyond Delaware, particularly as aggressive plaintiffs’ firms test the boundaries of officer oversight obligations.

Federal Enforcement’s Focus

At the federal level, the Department of Justice continues to make individual accountability a central pillar of its enforcement strategy. This has remained as true during the Biden administration as is in the Trump administration.

For example, federal enforcement officials have linked individual accountability to incentives for self-reporting and cooperation. Biden-era DOJ leadership emphasized that companies seeking cooperation credit must identify all individuals involved in misconduct, regardless of position. They also warned that executives who obstructed or ignored internal warnings could face personal exposure even if their company ultimately avoided prosecution.

These policies have continued under the Trump administration. The June 9 Foreign Corrupt Practice Act guidelines put individual accountability at the center of the DOJ’s enforcement policy.

Similarly, the Criminal Division’s corporate enforcement and voluntary self-disclosure policy and guidance on coordinating corporate resolution penalties in parallel criminal, civil, regulatory, and administrative proceedings—citing Justice Manual 1-12.000—remain focused on holding accountable individuals who are considered most responsible for “corporate malfeasance.”

The Securities and Exchange Commission likewise continues to invoke Section 20(a) control-person liability and the books-and-records provisions to pursue CFOs, controllers, and compliance officers who “caused” inaccurate disclosures or internal control failures. This approach reflects the broader trend toward holding senior leaders responsible not just for what they knew, but for what they purportedly should have known.

Collectively, these developments mark a paradigm shift from corporate to personal culpability.

New Risk Areas

The emerging risk landscape extends beyond traditional financial controls. Enforcers, regulators, and private plaintiffs in the US, Europe, and elsewhere are increasingly targeting environmental, social, and governance disclosures; forced-labor compliance; and artificial intelligence governance as new areas where executives face personal legal exposure.

For example, false or overstated ESG commitments, whether in sustainability reports or SEC filings, can underpin securities fraud or consumer-protection claims. Executives responsible for ESG reporting or data-management programs could be held liable for misrepresentations or for failing to implement adequate oversight mechanisms.

Similarly, supply-chain transparency laws such as the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act and the US Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act have created new obligations that can implicate officers when compliance systems are deficient.

AI-related risks follow the same trajectory. As companies deploy AI tools in decision-making, hiring, and risk assessment, regulators and enforcers are warning that executives can’t delegate accountability to algorithms.

In short, the scope of what constitutes “oversight” has broadened dramatically, requiring senior leaders to anticipate nontraditional risk domains previously viewed as peripheral to their fiduciary duties.

Practical Implications

To navigate this shifting environment, companies and their leadership teams should prioritize structural and procedural safeguards that both prevent misconduct and create defensible documentation of good-faith oversight. Key steps to consider include:

Clarify role definition. Delineate the responsibilities of operational, risk, and compliance executives to reduce role ambiguity and overlapping accountability.

Formalize governance protocols. Establish and document escalation procedures for compliance issues, ensuring that red flags are tracked and resolved at the appropriate managerial level.

Review directors-and-officers insurance coverage. Confirm that Side A/B/C policies extend to officer-level oversight and regulatory claims, and that indemnification provisions remain robust.

Preserve privilege during investigations. Coordinate with outside counsel to structure internal investigations in ways that protect attorney-client privilege while demonstrating diligence to stakeholders and ensuring the integrity of investigative findings.

Document training and oversight. Regularly train senior management on fiduciary and compliance obligations, maintaining contemporaneous records that evidence proactive oversight.

Companies should also reassess their executive onboarding and certification processes, ensuring that officers acknowledge their oversight duties and understand the personal consequences of noncompliance. A well-crafted governance memo or certification statement can help memorialize these expectations and support defense arguments in derivative or regulatory proceedings.

Outlook

The convergence of Delaware fiduciary duty expansion and intensified federal enforcement and regulatory oversight signals a new era of personal accountability, both civilly and criminally. The once-clear gap between entity level, board member, and individual executive liability is narrowing.

Emerging domains such as ESG, supply-chain transparency, and AI oversight have created novel exposure points that require cross-functional awareness. Effective oversight is no longer just good governance; it is personal risk mitigation. Demonstrating a credible, well-documented culture of compliance can mean the difference between defending a more diffuse corporate decision and defending oneself in court.

In this article, we examine the recent judgment of Mr. Justice Mould in the case of Epping Forest District Council v Somani Hotels Ltd [2025] EWHC 2937 (KB) , delivered on 13–15 October 2025. The case involved the use of the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, as accommodation for asylum seekers, and the refusal of the High Court to grant a final injunction under Section 187B of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (TCPA 1990) to prevent this use. We consider the legal issues raised in the judgment, including the application of Section 187B, the criteria for granting injunctions, the role of proportionality and public interest, the consideration of broader societal impacts, and the intervention of the Secretary of State for the Home Department (SSHD).

Statement of Facts

The case concerned the use of the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, as accommodation for asylum seekers. Epping Forest District Council sought a final injunction under Section 187B of the TCPA 1990 to prevent the use of the hotel for this purpose, alleging a breach of planning control. The High Court refused to grant the injunction, finding that enforcement through Section 187B was neither just nor proportionate in the circumstances. The court emphasised the public interest in maintaining asylum accommodation and the importance of fulfilling statutory duties under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 to prevent destitution among asylum seekers. The SSHD sought to intervene in the proceedings but was initially denied intervener status by the High Court. This decision was later overturned by the Court of Appeal.

Law

Section 187B of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990: This provision allows LPAs to apply for an injunction to restrain an actual or apprehended breach of planning control where it is deemed ‘necessary or expedient’. The court has discretion to grant such an injunction if it deems it appropriate for restraining the breach. However, LPAs are expected to consider conventional enforcement measures before seeking injunctive relief, as failure to do so may influence the court’s decision.

Criteria for granting injunctions: In Hillingdon LBC v Guinea Enterprises Ltd, the court outlined three key considerations for granting an injunction under Section 187B:

Whether there is an actual or apprehended breach of planning control;

Whether it is necessary or expedient to restrain such a breach by means of an injunction; and

Which defendants (if any) are the proper persons to be restrained.

Proportionality and public interest: The court must weigh the balance of convenience and assess whether the harm caused by the alleged breach of planning control is outweighed by the public interest. Injunctive relief under Section 187B should only be granted when it is necessary and proportionate.

Broader societal impacts: The court must consider the broader societal impacts of planning enforcement actions, including statutory duties under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, which aim to prevent destitution among asylum seekers.

Intervention by the SSHD: Under CPR 19.2(2), the court may grant permission for a party to intervene in proceedings if it is desirable to do so to resolve the issues in dispute. The Court of Appeal held that the Secretary of state for the Home Department (“SSHD”) had a pivotal constitutional role and could materially contribute to the judicial decision-making process through evidence and legal argument.

Analysis

The judgment in Epping Forest District Council v Somani Hotels Ltd provides significant guidance on the application of Section 187B of the TCPA 1990. The court’s refusal to grant the injunction was based on the principle that injunctive relief should only be granted when it is necessary and proportionate. While the court indicated that the council may have had a reasonable basis to allege a breach of planning control (whilst being critical of the exercise of delegated powers), the court found that the public interest in maintaining asylum accommodation outweighed the planning harm alleged. This aligns with the principle that LPAs should exhaust conventional enforcement measures before seeking injunctive relief.

The court’s decision also reflects the criteria established in Hillingdon LBC v Guinea Enterprises Ltd, particularly the need to assess whether an injunction is necessary or expedient to restrain the breach of planning control. In this case, the court determined that the balance of convenience did not favour granting the injunction, as the harm caused by the alleged breach was outweighed by the significant public interest in providing accommodation for asylum seekers.

The judgment further underscores the importance of considering broader societal impacts in planning enforcement actions. The Bell Hotel’s use as asylum accommodation was deemed critical to fulfilling statutory duties under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, which include preventing destitution among asylum seekers. This public interest consideration was pivotal in the court’s decision to refuse the injunction.

Finally, the intervention of the SSHD in the proceedings highlights the importance of ensuring that all relevant parties are given the opportunity to contribute to the judicial decision-making process. The Court of Appeal’s decision to overturn the High Court’s refusal to grant intervener status to the SSHD demonstrates the necessity of considering the constitutional role and potential contributions of intervening parties in cases with significant public interest implications.

Conclusion

The judgment in Epping Forest District Council v Somani Hotels Ltd provides a clear precedent for the application of Section 187B of the TCPA 1990, emphasising the importance of proportionality, public interest, and the exhaustion of conventional enforcement measures before seeking injunctive relief. The case also highlights the need to consider broader societal impacts and statutory duties in planning enforcement actions which had not been done in this case. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal’s decision regarding the SSHD’s intervention underscores the importance of allowing relevant parties to contribute to the resolution of disputes with significant public interest implications. This judgment serves as a reminder to LPAs to adopt a balanced approach to enforcement and to carefully consider the necessity and proportionality of seeking injunctive relief in planning control cases.",https://www.localgovernmentlawyer.co.uk/images/LGL_Favicon_2025.png,N,,2025-11-28 07:57:17.167294

What does the law say?

Under U.S. immigration law, spouses of American citizens who entered the country lawfully are generally eligible to adjust status, even if their tourist/business visa has expired during the lengthy green-card process.

Despite the law's adjustments, ICE's explanation in many of these cases was “visa overstay.” No allegations of fraud or criminal behavior were cited, and many of those detained had already passed preliminary background and security checks.

According to KBPS, ICE said in a statement that it is dedicated to upholding immigration law while ignoring criticisms regarding the necessity of these green card arrests.

The immigration lawyers whose clients have been arrested are saying that the arrests represent “a drastic policy shift,” one that undermines decades of practice.

Advocates say these detentions undercut promises that serving in the military or being married to a citizen offers security or protection. ICE's current rampant arrests from the green-card interviews disregard humanitarian and moral obligations, especially for long-established families.

Lawsuits being filed

AP reported that a class-action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California on November 25, 2025. It challenges ICE’s detention of immigrants who showed up for routine check-ins or legal proceedings in San Diego.

The lawsuit argued that re-detaining people previously cleared for release, without new crimes or warnings, violates their constitutional due-process rights.

The lawsuit names petitioners who had complied with all prior hearings and court orders, had no criminal record, yet were taken into custody unexpectedly during ICE-scheduled check-ins.

Earlier in 2025, a similar lawsuit was filed against ICE for courthouse arrests in San Diego after agents detained asylum-seekers and other immigrants exiting immigration court, reportedly without giving them proper due process. That suit argues such arrests are “arbitrary” and undermine the integrity of the immigration legal process.

Their joint report, “’You Have Arrived in Hell’: Torture and Other Abuses Against Venezuelans in El Salvador’s Mega Prison,” describes how people who were apprehended or processed by US agencies were sent to El Salvador and placed in the maximum‑security Center for Terrorism Confinement (CECOT), where survivors and witnesses have reported systematic mistreatment, prolonged isolation, and conditions that the researchers concluded amounted to torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.

The report explains that many of the transferred individuals had not been convicted of violent crimes and that the criteria used to identify alleged gang affiliation were unreliable and arbitrary. The report explains that an “Alien Enemy Validation Guide” and other screening tools were applied in ways that assign guilt by association — counting tattoos, clothing, gestures, or social‑media connections as indicia of membership. Experts and family members have described these measures as deeply flawed. Human Rights Watch and Cristosal argue that these procedures produced wrongful classifications and exposed people to foreseeable risks when they were handed over to Salvadoran authorities.

Inside CECOT, the report recounted repeated accounts of physical violence, humiliating treatment, and severe deprivation. Survivors told researchers that guards beat detainees on arrival and throughout their confinement; one detainee said, “They beat us almost every day.” Others described forced head shavings, prolonged solitary confinement in a segregated area known to detainees as “the Island,” and incidents of sexual violence and threats. The report quotes detainees who said that, upon being brought into the facility, officials told them, “You have arrived in hell.”

Human Rights Watch and Cristosal identified patterns of enforced disappearance and incommunicado detention. Families report that they were denied information about relatives’ whereabouts for extended periods; some relatives say they received no official confirmation of detention until months later. The organizations describe cases in which detainees were held without meaningful access to counsel, without consistent medical care, and with severely restricted contact with the outside world. The report emphasizes that secrecy and lack of transparency compounded the risk of abuse and make independent monitoring difficult.

The report examines the bilateral and programmatic context for the transfers. It describes US funding and cooperation with Salvadoran security agencies, noting a grant letter and other assistance that the authors say facilitates the operations. Human Rights Watch and Cristosal have also raised legal concerns about the transfers, arguing that sending people to El Salvador in circumstances where they faced a real risk of torture or ill‑treatment violated the principle of non‑refoulment under international law. The organizations have called for the suspension of any arrangements enabling transfers until independent safeguards and monitoring are in place.

Researchers have also scrutinized the legal authorities and administrative mechanisms used to justify the removals. The report points out that a mix of immigration procedures and emergency proclamations have been invoked, and it questions whether adequate legal review and oversight has occurred. The authors argue that the use of expedited or exceptional authorities without transparent safeguards has increased the risk that people could be wrongly designated as security threats and transferred without meaningful procedural protections.

Human Rights Watch and Cristosal documents the human consequences of those policies through detailed interviews with survivors, family members, lawyers, and medical professionals. The report describes physical injuries consistent with beatings, psychological trauma from prolonged isolation and threats, and the long‑term health impacts of inadequate medical care. It recounts the anguish of families who have been unable to locate loved ones and the frustration of lawyers who have faced obstacles in obtaining records or access to clients.

The organizations conclude that the pattern of transfers and the conditions of detention require urgent remedial action. They recommend that the United States immediately halt transfers of third‑country nationals to El Salvador due to the risk of torture or ill‑treatment; disclose any agreements or understandings governing transfers; condition assistance on verifiable human‑rights safeguards; and rescind emergency proclamations or other measures that circumvented normal legal protections.

On September 30, 2025, Frank Heindel, a freedom-of-information advocate, sued the University of South Carolina (“USC”) in the Fifth Judicial Circuit Court in Richland County, SC to obtain records pertaining to the school’s payments of more than $20,000,000 to student athletes. The lawsuit claims that the school violated the state’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and asks the judge to “either order USC to turn over the records in their entirety or hold a confidential hearing to determine which parts might be exempt from disclosure.”

Following landmark shifts in Name Image and Likeness and collegiate revenue sharing (a result of the House v. NCAA settlement), USC, along with most universities in the United States, have begun to explore the uncharted waters surrounding the disbursement of funds to student-athletes. Schools that opted into the settlement are permitted to utilize $20.5 million to pay their athletes and are subject to FOIA requests for information and records. However, USC has failed to produce responsive documents to FOIA requests for invoices from USC’s NIL Collective, The Garnet Trust. USC has claimed that the information being requested is not in their possession but rather in the possession of private actors and companies like the NIL Collective and Learfield – entities not beholden to the same FOIA laws as the school. On September 4, 2025, USC was sent a FOIA request from Frank Heindel, who is an open records advocate and has sued USC in the past for failing to respond to a previous FOIA request in 2019. Through his request, Heindel is seeking to obtain any “executed revenue-sharing contracts or agreements between the university and its football players.” The university subsequently denied the request, claiming that the information is shielded by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”). Heindel claims USC’s position is “legally untenable” and that when a public university spends tax dollars, their usage of funds should be disclosed. The plaintiff is seeking a court order directing USC to either produce the records or hold a hearing to determine which records are exempt from disclosure.

“I’m not asking for names or grade point averages. I’m asking how a public university spends public money,” said Heindel. The university’s legal representative, attorney Andrew Lindemann of Lindemann Law Firm, P.A. in Columbia, South Carolina, responded, saying the university “had lawfully and accurately responded to Heindel’s records request.” A hearing was set for October 10, 2025.

My office will always fight to protect Americans' SNAP benefits, and I will do everything in my power to shield New Yorkers from this unlawful policy.""","The Trump administration is unlawfully trying to keep Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits away from lawful permanent residents, a lawsuit filed this week alleges.

In July, Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) Act, which amended eligibility provisions for SNAP in various ways.

In late October, during the height of the government shutdown, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) subagency Food Nutrition Services (FNS) issued guidance interpreting the recently-passed omnibus legislation. That guidance purports to limit noncitizen access to SNAP benefits in several significant ways.

The lawsuit filed Wednesday by New York Attorney General Letitia James says the FNS guidance ""errs"" in how it interprets the new law.

At the heart of the litigation are the government's apparent efforts to keep certain categories of noncitizens who become green card holders from ever accessing SNAP benefits, the plaintiffs say.

The 28-page complaint offers a condensed history lesson:

Prior to the OBBB going into effect, non-citizens who entered the United States as refugees or were granted asylum were eligible for SNAP, based on their status at the time of their admission or parole. This was also true for many who were granted humanitarian parole. OBBB eliminated these categories of eligibility in the FNA. However, nothing in OBBB prohibits individuals who once held the status of refugees, individuals granted asylum, or parolees from gaining eligibility for SNAP if and when they adjust their status to lawful permanent residents (LPRs).

To hear the plaintiffs tell it, immigrants who came to the United States as refugees or asylum seekers ""can be eligible for SNAP benefits if they adjust status and become"" green card holders, but the Trump administration is trying to make sure such immigrants ""will never be eligible for SNAP benefits.""

""The Guidance creates a false dichotomy in describing categories of immigration statuses post-OBBB as either 'Not eligible unless an LPR' or 'Not eligible,'"" the lawsuit reads. ""Regardless of the status they once held, any non-citizen who adjusts to LPR status can become eligible for SNAP if they meet other statutory requirements. However, the Guidance incorrectly places many of these individuals in the 'Not eligible' category, rather than the 'Not eligible unless an LPR category'""

The plaintiffs say the government is ""misleadingly"" telling certain groups of immigrants they can never become eligible for SNAP benefits.

""In reality, irrespective of someone's immigration status before becoming an LPR, once they obtain their Green Card, they are eligible for SNAP if they meet other statutory requirements,"" the lawsuit goes on.

A secondary issue is the speed with which SNAP benefits can be conferred on certain non-citizens due to an ancillary law known as the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act (PRWORA).

Under PRWORA, green card holders are only eligible for SNAP benefits if they have lived in the country for at least five years or without the five-year waiting period if they fall into ""approximately a dozen"" enumerated categories — such as being blind, disabled, or a child, the lawsuit explains.

Now, however, the government says those exceptions to the waiting period no longer apply to certain classes of green card holders.

The plaintiffs reject this ""clear"" misreading of PRWORA, the lawsuit says.

""PRWORA excludes individuals who were admitted as refugees, granted asylum, had their deportation withheld, and others, from the five-year waiting period,"" the complaint continues. ""And no provision of the OBBB amended PRWORA's exemptions from its five-year waiting period.""

A tertiary issue identified by the plaintiffs is a new system to identify and account for errors envisioned by the FNS guidance.

That new system, the plaintiffs insist, ""would saddle states with catastrophic financial penalties unless they immediately implement the unlawful restrictions,"" according to a press release issued by James' office.

Under the OBBB, states have 120 days to process new guidance and root out violations, according to the lawsuit. Still, the Trump administration is trying to implement the FNS guidance with only one day of leeway for any such violations, the filing explains.

""The federal government's shameful quest to take food away from children and families continues,"" James said in a statement. ""USDA has no authority to arbitrarily cut entire groups of people out of the SNAP program, and no one should go hungry because of the circumstances of their arrival to this country. My office will always fight to protect Americans' SNAP benefits, and I will do everything in my power to shield New Yorkers from this unlawful policy.""",https://lawandcrime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Letitia-James-Donald-Trump.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 07:57:49.113535

Nasseri stated that five of his clients were taken into custody during Green Card interviews just last week.
MEXICAN NATIONAL DETAINED, HANDCUFFED DURING GREEN CARD INTERVIEW: US ATTORNEY Immigration attorney Tessa Cabrera told ABC 10 that her client, a Mexican national residing in the US since 2002, was handcuffed and taken into custody during his GreenCard interview.","US federal agencies are detaining people, including spouses of American citizens, during routine Green Card interviews at the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) offices in San Diego, according to media reports in the US. An attorney claimed that his client was detained and handcuffed when he appeared for the Green Card interview.

Immigration attorney Saman Nasseri said the federal agencies have begun arresting visa overstays during their interviews. Some couples and their lawyers told The New York Times they had followed the required steps to secure permanent residency.

""ICE and USCIS have started implementing a policy where ICE is now making arrests at USCIS offices during the green card interviews on anyone who is a visa overstay, so if they're out of status, ICE is making that arrest at the interviews,"" Saman Nasseri was quoted as saying by CBS8.

Nasseri stated that five of his clients were taken into custody during Green Card interviews just last week. He said that his clients have no criminal history or arrests.

""None of my clients have any arrests or criminal history that are in this situation. These are just cases where they entered legally, they overstayed their visa. All of my cases right now are people that have been married to US citizens, so these are spouses of US citizens that are going through the normal process, the normal channels, and they're being taken into custody,"" Nasseri added.

Another attorney, Habib Hasbini, also confirmed similar experiences with his clients.

""The first one was November 12, the eve of the memo that came down from ICE. After that, I had four to follow through, but I've been getting a lot of phone calls from people who were arrested from the same facility,"" Hasbini told CBS8.

Attorney Habib Hasbini observed that, so far, these detentions seem to be confined to the USCIS office in San Diego.

Hasbini recommended that those with scheduled GreenCard interviews should still attend, while remaining cautious and prepared for potential detentions.

He suggests making family and work arrangements in case of detention, noting that not attending an interview can result in case denial for abandonment. Additionally, because individuals are out of status, they may still face arrest by ICE regardless, CBS8 reported.

MEXICAN NATIONAL DETAINED, HANDCUFFED DURING GREEN CARD INTERVIEW: US ATTORNEY

Immigration attorney Tessa Cabrera told ABC 10 that her client, a Mexican national residing in the US since 2002, was handcuffed and taken into custody during his GreenCard interview.

The man's US citizen daughter had applied for him to get permanent residency, according to the ABC10 report.

""The officer said, I'll be right back and stepped out. And then, two ICE officers walked in. They asked him what his name was and then put him in handcuffs,"" Cabrera said.

The client was taken to the basement of the federal building and was detained at the Otay Mesa Detention Center, according to Cabrera.

She said that ICE officers gave her a ""Warrant for Arrest"" issued by the Department of Homeland Security.

The warrant states they have probable cause based on statements made to the immigration officer or evidence that the person lacks immigration status or is removable under immigration law, according to the report.

ICE DEFENDS ARRESTS: WE ENFORCE THE LAW AT USCIS OFFICES TOO

An ICE spokesperson told CBS8 that the agency is ""focused on enforcing federal immigration laws through targeted operations that emphasise national security, public safety, and border security.""

""Individuals unlawfully present in the United States, including those out of status at federal sites such as USCIS offices, may face arrest, detention, and removal in accordance with US immigration law,"" the spokesperson was quoted as saying by CBS8.

“It’s just happened,” Mr. Trump said.
“This is what we had under the Biden administration,” Mr. Trump said, holding up the photograph of the frenzied evacuation scene for the news cameras in the room.
A reporter at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday asked Mr. Trump about this as well.
“When it comes to asylum, when they’re flown in, it’s very hard to get them out,” Mr. Trump answered.","The shooting of two National Guard members the day before in Washington hung over President Trump’s Thanksgiving events at Mar-a-Lago, where he held a call with members of the military to thank them for their service on the holiday.

At the beginning of the call, he revealed that one of the Guard members, Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, had died.

“It’s just happened,” Mr. Trump said. “She was savagely attacked. She’s dead. Not with us.” The other victim, he said, was “fighting for his life.”

Later, a White House official said that the president had spoken with the family of the slain National Guard member.

After authorities identified the suspect as an Afghan refugee, members of the Trump administration and other Republicans reacted furiously. They cited it as evidence of what they had been warning about immigration, condemned the Biden administration’s refugee policies and said it justified a further crackdown on immigration.

Joseph Edlow, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, announced on Thursday that in the wake of the attack, he was implementing new policy guidance on vetting prospective immigrants from 19 high-risk countries using “country-specific factors as significant negative factors.” The change in guidance had been under consideration before the shooting.

In his statement, Mr. Edlow blamed the Biden administration for “dismantling basic vetting and screening standards, prioritizing the rapid resettlement of aliens from high-risk countries over the safety of American citizens.”

The fierce rhetoric was echoed across the administration.

“I remember back in 2021 criticizing the Biden policy of opening the floodgate to unvetted Afghan refugees,” Vice President JD Vance wrote on social media on Wednesday. “Friends sent me messages calling me a racist. It was a clarifying moment. They shouldn’t have been in our country.”

At Mar-a-Lago on Thursday, Mr. Trump produced a photograph showing Afghans rushing onto a plane leaving their country as its government collapsed in 2021.

“This is what we had under the Biden administration,” Mr. Trump said, holding up the photograph of the frenzied evacuation scene for the news cameras in the room. “That whole thing should have never, ever happened.”

When a reporter pointed out that, according to officials, the suspect had worked with the C.I.A. and therefore had been vetted, Mr. Trump said, “He went cuckoo, I mean, he went nuts.”

Mr. Trump said his administration was “looking at” the possibility of deporting the family of the 29-year-old suspect, who lived in Bellingham, Wash., with a wife and several children.

Asked whether he was blaming all Afghans for the crime of one man, Mr. Trump said, “No, but there’s a lot of problems with Afghans.”

Echoing largely unfounded claims that he has made about immigrants from other countries, he said that “many of these people are criminals, many of these people are people that shouldn’t be here.”

Jumping to the subject of Somali refugees in Minnesota, he said that population was “taking over” that state, bringing gang violence.

Asked what Somalis had to do with the Afghan suspect, Mr. Trump replied: “Ah, nothing, but Somalians have caused a lot of trouble, they’re ripping us off a lot of money.” This led him to criticize Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, who came to the United States as a refugee from Somalia.

“We’re not taking their people anymore,” he said.

In a pair of lengthy social media posts just before midnight on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he would “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries” and denaturalize migrants “who undermine domestic tranquillity.” He did not provide details about how he would go about it, or provide specific evidence about problems created by immigrants.

He again referred to gangs from Somalia in Minnesota, questioning Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota’s intelligence and his ability to handle the supposed threat, and mocked Ms. Omar for her use of a hijab.

Similar language has exploded on the right since Wednesday’s shooting, including from Senator Tommy Tuberville, Republican of Alabama, who called for Muslim potential immigrants to be banned and for the deportation of anyone deemed an “Islamist.”

In the case of the shooting suspect, he received asylum from the U.S. government in April, according to three people with knowledge of the case who were not authorized to speak publicly. A reporter at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday asked Mr. Trump about this as well.

“When it comes to asylum, when they’re flown in, it’s very hard to get them out,” Mr. Trump answered. “No matter how you want to do it, it’s very hard to get them out, but we’re going to be getting them all out now.”

Meanwhile, in the cold shade of her stand, the breakfast street vendor looks out at the busy avenue.","Zohran Mamdani, the incoming Mayor of New York City has had a volatile relationship with President Trump. He's called the president a fascist. Trump, in return, has called him a ""little communist mayor,"" and warned that he may send in the National Guard. The administration also said it will expand ICE operations in the city.

But when the two leaders finally met face to face recently it was, to many people's surprise, cordial. Some may even say warm.

""We agree on a lot more than I would have thought. I want him to do a great job, and we'll help him do a great job,"" the president said. Soon the internet was flooded with memes of the president looking admiringly up at Mamdani. The next day's New York Post cover read ""I love you Mam.""

But many New Yorkers say they're taking it all with a grain of salt and remaining on guard.

""The president says one thing one day, and a different thing the next,"" says one street vendor outside the subway station in Queens. ""You don't know what's real anymore.""

What she does know is that she's seen an uptick in immigration enforcement recently, which is why she asked that NPR withhold her name. She's undocumented, and she's worried.

Every morning at around 4:30 a.m., she posts up here and sells refreshments and breakfast. A few weeks ago, a little after setting up, she says several ICE agents jumped out of an unmarked car in pursuit of two workers who'd just bought something to eat.

She ran into the building behind her, locked the door and hid in the stairway until it was all over.

This vendor says she loves Mamdani, but worries the president will punish the city for electing a democratic socialist. She fears New York will turn into Chicago or Los Angeles, two cities that have experienced large-scale immigration raids.

This is a common sentiment in New York these days. The day after the White House meeting, President Trump said that while he's not planning on sending troops into New York now, he would, if needed. NPR reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment and received no response.

Mamdani, for his part, reiterated he will defend immigrants in New York.

His team did not grant NPR an interview, despite multiple requests. But a source close to his transition team who spoke on condition of anonymity told NPR that Mamdani is exploring legal strategies at the local level to limit Trump's actions in New York City, including muscling up the NYC Law Department by adding 200 attorneys.

Congressman Patrick Ryan of the Hudson Valley, a Democrat whose district includes some of New York City's northern suburbs, told NPR that one of the lessons from Chicago and LA is that states can successfully challenge the administration in court. Ryan cites his own background as an Iraq War veteran.

""To come home to my state and my country, and see the idea of U.S. troops deployed against U.S. citizens and American cities, it's so fundamentally un-American. It's also, by the way, not what young American men and women sign up to do,"" he says.

He hopes the meeting between Mamdani and Trump de-escalated tensions. But like the street vendor in Queens, he's taking it with a grain of salt. He's hoping for the best, he says, but preparing for the worst.

Which is what organizers on the streets are doing.

Carina Kaufman-Gutierrez is the deputy director of the advocacy group Street Vendor Project. She says street vendors are among the most vulnerable immigrants in New York. ""Street Vendors are the eyes on the ground right? They see everything that happens.""

She's hopeful that the incoming Mayor will be an ally. She says she's also confident New York street vendors are uniquely prepared to weather an ICE campaign. Many of them, she says, see this as ""the next pandemic.""

The organization is, in fact, leaning in on pandemic-era strategies for vendors who are scared to work on the streets during immigration raids. ""We have a catering program for example, where people can reach out to us, and we'll connect them to a vendor for catering their event.""

She says, something the new mayor could do is make it easier for street vendors to operate — which Mamdani has said he will prioritize. He has pledged to allow thousands of additional license applications for vendors, and repeal criminal liability rules.

Meanwhile, in the cold shade of her stand, the breakfast street vendor looks out at the busy avenue. She wonders how long this liveliness will last, and how long she will endure.

""Three more years,"" she says, referring to the Trump administration. ""I hope they go by quickly.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8382x4715+0+873/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8e%2Fdc%2Fc47f8c8e4af6b267b7caf28fa3bd%2Fgettyimages-2242335314.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 21:56:39.171952

It is important for you to know about these new powers, and to know your rights.

For now, the most important things you can do are:

Keep notes of what happened, if you are searched or your things are taken. This can even be voice notes on a phone, or the phone of a friend, that you can use later.

Write down on paper the phone numbers at the end of this guide. You can call these numbers for advice, if you are searched or your things are taken in detention.

Write down on paper other important info you keep in your phone, like passwords or the phone numbers of family and friends, in case your mobile phone is taken away.

What are the new powers?

Using their new powers, immigration officers and guards can:

Ban certain items;

Conduct searches for those items including:

Searches of your clothes, your possessions or your room;

Strip searches; and

Searches using dogs.

What items have been banned?

The Minister for Home Affairs can ban any items in immigration detention, if he thinks they pose a risk to the health or safety of people in detention, or to the good order of the detention centre.

So far, the following items have been banned:

Mobile phones

SIM cards

Devices that have the internet, including tablets and computers

Alcohol

It is possible that other items could end up being banned.

What happens to items that are banned?

Once an item is banned, immigration officers can:

Search you and your room for the item (without a warrant);

Seize the item (meaning take it from you).

This does not mean that all banned items will be automatically taken from you. You do not have to hand over your phone if officers have not asked for it.

But if you are searched and items are taken from you, then as soon as you can afterwards, you should tell a friend in detention about exactly what happened – or write down a note about what happened. This will be important when you speak to a lawyer later.

What happens if I am searched?

Under the new powers, immigration officers can search for weapons, documents (which might serve as evidence), and banned items, and take them from you.

The search powers are very broad. Immigration officers don’t need a warrant, and can search your clothing or room even if they don’t suspect that you have a weapon or a banned item.

Immigration officers can only conduct a strip search if they reasonably suspect that you have a weapon or a banned thing on you. They can’t ask you to take off more clothing, or search you for longer, than is necessary to find the thing they are looking for.

If you are strip-searched, please call one of the numbers below as soon as you can for advice.

What should I do if I have a banned item taken from me?

If you have a banned item taken from you, you should:

Ask for the reason the item has been taken from you;

Ask for the item to be returned to you;

If your medication has been taken, then tell them which doctor prescribed it and what you need it for;

If the officer doesn’t give it back, then ask why – they must have a reason to hold onto your property. Make a note of what they say; and

Call one of the numbers below to get advice.

What if my mobile phone or computer are taken from me?

People in detention have a right to communicate with their lawyers to get advice. Immigration officers can’t interfere with that right, by making it hard or impossible for you to communicate with your lawyer.

People in detention also have a right to communicate about political issues (like government policy or protests against detention). Communicating might mean talking on the phone or posting online about your political views. Officers can’t interfere with that communication without a good reason.

If officers take away your mobile phone or computer, they have to provide you with another way to contact your family and your lawyer.

If you have your computer or mobile phone taken from you, you should:

Immediately ask for your computer or phone to be returned to you.

If the officer doesn’t return the thing, then ask for reasons why – computers and mobile phones can only be taken from you if they pose a risk to people or the order of the detention facility, and officers must have a reason to hold onto your property. Make a note of what they say.

Ask what alternative means you will be given to communicate with your family or lawyer.Make a note of what they say.

PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ORDERED DEFENSE SECRETARY PETE HEGSETH TO MOBILIZE 500 MORE NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS TO D-C IN THE WAKE OF THE SHOOTING.","The Trump administration says it won’t process immigration requests from Afghan nationals for the foreseeable future. The order comes after a gunman opened fire on two National Guard members in the busy streets of Washington, D.C., just blocks away from the White House, on Wednesday afternoon.

Authorities identified the shooter as 29-year-old Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal.

“This heinous assault was an act of evil, an act of hatred, and an act of terror,” President Donald Trump told the nation in an address Wednesday night. “It was a crime against our entire nation. It was a crime against humanity.”

The West Virginia guard members — who were in Washington as part of the Trump administration’s takeover of the police department there — were taken to the hospital in critical condition. Investigators say it appears to have been a “targeted shooting.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a social media post that Lakanwal was in the U.S. after being granted parole in 2021 under the Biden administration’s “Operation Allies Welcome” initiative. The initiative helped to safely relocate “vulnerable Afghans” and those who worked alongside U.S. forces in Afghanistan after the U.S. withdrawal from the country and subsequent Taliban takeover.

The federal government granted Lakanwal asylum earlier this year.

President Trump is now calling for a review of the immigration statuses of all Afghan migrants who were admitted to the U.S. during the Biden administration.

“We’re not going to put up with these kinds of assaults on law and order by people who shouldn’t even be in our country,” he said. “We must now reexamine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden, and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country. If they can’t love our country, we don’t want them.”

ICE detentions on track to double In the entirety of 2024, 1,185 were detained by ICE in Boone, Kenton, and Campbell counties.","Northern Kentucky is on track to see more than double the number of ICE detainees this year over 2024.

Less than 2% of ICE detainees in Northern Kentucky have commited a violent crime.

Just over half of those detained face criminal charges.

In Northern Kentucky, less than 2% of people detained by ICE this year committed a violent crime. Of those who had criminal charges, nearly all of them were minor charges like traffic or drug offenses.

That's according to an Enquirer analysis of federal data for the three Northern Kentucky counties across the Ohio River from Cincinnati.

ICE detentions are on track to more than triple this year in Boone, Kenton and Campbell counties as President Trump's administration cracks down on immigration violations.

All three county jails have contracts to detain people on behalf of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The more immigrants detained, records show, the more money counties get from the federal government.

Boone County, for instance, made $4.5 million from its ICE contract last fiscal year.

In roughly the first seven months of 2025, the jails have made at least $5.2 million from daily ICE detention payouts.

But who are these detainees, where do they come from, and are they the “the worst of the worst” violent criminals Trump said would be targeted in immigration sweeps?

Here's what we know based on data from the University of California, Los Angeles and University of California, Berkeley's Deportation Data Project. The project collected information about ICE detainees in jails throughout the country.

The data includes detentions from Jan. 1 to July 28 this year.

How many detainees were charged with crimes in NKY?

About 752 people – roughly 54% – of ICE detainees in Northern Kentucky were charged with crimes when they were taken into custody.

Most of those crimes – about 17.5% – were traffic offenses, the data shows.

Fewer than 2% had committed violent crimes – aggravated assault, rape, or robbery – as categorized by the FBI.

The other 635 ICE detainees have not been charged with crimes, according to the most recent available data.

Most immigration violations are civil offenses, though entering the country illegally is a crime. About 2.5% of people faced charges for that.

In a previous email to The Enquirer, U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin accused the media of peddling a ""FALSE narrative that ICE is not targeting criminal illegal aliens.""

""The official data tells the true story: 70% of ICE arrests were criminal illegal aliens with convictions or pending charges,"" she wrote in an email referencing national data.

Where do detainees come from?

Through July of this year, detainees in Northern Kentucky have reported citizenship in 59 countries.

Most were from Mexico and Guatemala. About 95% were male.

All of the 132 people deported from January to July were returned to the country where they had citizenship. The 103 who voluntarily left the country also returned to their country of citizenship, the data shows.

Some immigrants choose to voluntarily leave the United States as opposed to getting deported because it gives them a chance to legally enter the country later.

How long are they incarcerated?

The length of time people are held in the local jails varies wildly – from one day to more than 200.

But on average, people are in jail due to ICE detentions for roughly 43 days, based on available information.

ICE detentions on track to double

In the entirety of 2024, 1,185 were detained by ICE in Boone, Kenton, and Campbell counties.

That number is on track to double in 2025 with 1,387 ICE detentions in the first roughly seven months of the year.

According to available data, about 51% of people detained in 2025 had been deported or left the country by the end of July.

Why the spike in detentions locally?

A combination of increased federal resources for ICE detentions and the agency's new contracts with local jails are behind the uptick.

Boone County Jailer Jason Maydak said the county has housed ICE detainees for roughly 20 years.

""We literally just hold them for ICE. They bring them to us. We don't go get them. We don't pick them off the streets,"" he told The Enquirer.

The Boone, Campbell and Kenton county jails both have intergovernmental agreements that permit them to house the detainees on behalf of ICE.

Campbell and Kenton counties, however, didn't sign their contracts until May 2024 and March 2025 respectively. But that's mostly a processing change.

In previous years, for instance, ICE already had access to see who was booked in the jails for local charges and could see whether inmates also had immigration violations. Then, when the person was released on their local charges, ICE would be notified and in turn request a 48-hour detainment of the person.

Within that time frame, an ICE agent or other correction officer would then transport the person to Boone or Grayson counties.

The new contracts permit the county to house the inmates rather than having to transport them.

The change, Kenton County Jailer Marc Fields said, was prompted due to ICE. He said the organization reached out to the jail about changing their contract.

The jail agreed, primarily, because of money – the federal government pays local jails $88 per day to house the inmates and reimburses local jails for medical expenses, one of the jail's highest expenses.

Meanwhile, in addition to housing county inmates, the jail had also been holding hundreds of inmates for the state and was only reimbursed $35 per day.

""We kind of looked at it as our beds being a commodity for the county and … what is the best use of those not only for our residents but for our taxpayers?"" Fields said.

Kenton County expands cooperation with ICE

Kenton County Detention Center is the only local jail that's beefed up its cooperation with ICE, including a Jail Enforcement Memorandum and a Warrant Service Officer Program agreement, which were both signed March 28.

The officer program allows corrections officers to issue ICE administrative arrest warrants within the jail. The memorandum allows for the creation of at least one ICE-trained designated immigration officer at the Kenton County Dention Center who would act as a go-between between ICE officers and detainees.

The county plans to have two of the specially trained officers, though the two programs haven't kicked into gear yet because ICE hasn't hosted training sessions in the area yet.

Fields also echoed Maydak's sentiments about why the jail is seeing so many ICE detainees.

""It's totally enforcement on their side,"" he said.

Nasseri reported that five of his clients were detained last week. None of them had criminal records or prior arrests. All were spouses of US citizens going through the standard green card process. “None of my clients have any arrests or criminal history. These are just cases where they entered legally and overstayed their visa, all of my cases right now are people that have been married to US citizens, so these are spouses of US citizens that are going through the normal process, the normal channels, and they're being taken into custody,"" Nasseri said. Immigration attorney Habib Hasbini confirmed similar cases. He said the detentions appear limited to the San Diego USCIS office. ""The first one was November 12, the eve of the memo that came down from ICE. After that, I had four to follow through, but I've been getting a lot of phone calls from people who were arrested from the same facility,"" Hasbini said. ""I have relationships with many attorneys working in many other counties; this is not happening for their clients in their vicinity, or it's only happening in San Diego,"" Hasbini added. Hasbini advised those with upcoming green card interviews to attend, but to plan for the possibility of detention, as missing an interview can result in case denial for abandonment.

Navy wife detained by ICE during green card interview

Arrests in front of families Reports from The Mirror describe ICE agents entering green card interview rooms in San Diego and arresting at least two immigrants in front of their American spouses and a six-month-old infant. The incidents occurred days after the November 12 start of similar arrests. In one case, Audrey Hestmark, the American wife of German national Tom Bilger, described three masked ICE agents handcuffing her husband and showing a QR code instead of identification, reported CTN. In another, Stephen Paul witnessed ICE arrest his British wife, Katie. The couple had decided to remain in the United States for her high-risk pregnancy.What ICE says An ICE spokesperson told CBS 8 that the agency is “committed to enforcing federal immigration laws through targeted operations that prioritise national security, public safety, and border security.” The statement noted that individuals unlawfully present in the US, including those out of status at federal sites such as USCIS offices, may face arrest, detention, and removal under US immigration law. ICE also said self-deportation remains the safest and most efficient option for those living illegally in the country. Tools like the CBP Home app are available to assist individuals with the process.Impact on migrant communities Immigration attorneys say arrests during green card interviews are unprecedented and may deter individuals from attending appointments, even when they are legally eligible for adjustment of status, reported The Mirror. Families face immediate impacts, including separation from spouses or children and uncertainty about the outcome of their immigration cases. As Stephen Paul said, “We had done everything they asked us to do. We were told it was the right procedure. And despite all that, they arrested her.”

St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter joined Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson this month in a federal lawsuit over millions of dollars in police hiring grants that could be withheld by the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, otherwise known as the COPS program. To access COPS money, the DOJ has insisted that cities certify they do not operate diversity, equity and inclusion programs and they will cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.

That isn’t St. Paul’s only legal battle with the White House.

In another recent skirmish, Minnesota’s capital city had been counting on more than $560,000 from the U.S. Department of Energy to expand Evie — a network of electric vehicle charging stations aimed at boosting car-sharing — into low- to moderate-income neighborhoods on the city’s East Side. In October, word came that the funding had been eliminated, alongside more than $7.5 billion in grants for clean energy projects across 16 states, all of which were states that voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

“The Trump administration’s cancellation of $7.5 billion in climate grants targeted communities based solely on politics,” said Jennifer Lor, a spokesperson for Carter’s office. “In St. Paul, this decision cut the remaining funds from our $560,844 subgrant, slowing our groundbreaking work to expand clean, affordable, and reliable electric car-share options across the city’s East Side.”

Growing legal actions by city

The loss of energy-related grants forms the basis of yet another new federal lawsuit against the Trump administration, the latest in a growing number of legal actions filed by St. Paul and other municipalities and nonprofits alleging constitutional violations and federal overreach.

It’s been a busy year for St. Paul City Attorney Lyndsey Olson and her legal team, who have represented the city in at least five major legal battles with the Trump administration while trying to protect upwards of $200 million in federal funding that could be withheld from the city’s housing, public safety, clean energy and transportation initiatives.

The White House has derided so-called “woke” policies, including St. Paul’s 2004 separation ordinance, which prohibits city employees from asking residents their immigration status before delivering city services. In response, “blue” cities have accused the Trump administration of blatant political retaliation for not stepping into line with the president’s executive orders, including bans on language around diversity, equity and inclusion outreach, or “DEI.”

“We’re certainly being targeted and punished,” said Olson on Tuesday. “Our residents are being punished. Taxpayers are being punished in ways that are political and don’t have anything to do with the grants. The courts say this is not legal … and they keep doing it.”

St. Paul has company. Chicago has filed upwards of 40 legal actions against federal agencies, accusing them of playing politics with vital grant funding. In September, the U.S. Department of Justice filed its own legal action against St. Paul and other “blue” cities that don’t fall into step with its immigration policies, though the lawsuit was not served on the city until late November, Olson said.

With a new mayoral administration coming in following the election this month of Mayor-elect Kaohly Her over Mayor Melvin Carter, Olson said she expects to be leaving City Hall around January, as most St. Paul mayors handpick their chief attorney. She said she anticipates whomever holds her position in the months ahead to face similar battles with the White House, and Her has made no secret of her disdain for the president’s approach toward immigration enforcement.

“It’s not just the filing of the lawsuits and the litigation piece,” Olson said. “It’s tracking everything they’re doing all the time. … They’ll put new terms into grant agreements that are already in process. They’ll say ‘we’re going to withhold money until you agree to these terms.’ I think that’s our new normal for the remainder of this (presidential) administration. I think blue cities are being targeted.”

Here’s a look at six lawsuits involving St. Paul and the Trump administration:

San Francisco v. Trump

In February, St. Paul signed onto a lawsuit, led by the city of San Francisco, accusing the Trump administration of attempting to commandeer city services by denying federal funding to municipalities that don’t fall in line with its executive orders and immigration policies. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California, alleges that the White House is violating the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which states that powers not delegated to the federal government are reserved for the states.

In a written posting to its website, the White House that week called out the St. Paul mayor by name, as well as other city leaders in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles for immigrant-friendly policies that the president claimed protected “killers, rapists and drug dealers.” St. Paul has maintained a “separation ordinance” that bars city employees from asking residents about their immigration status while delivering core city services.

Olson said her team has “argued forcefully that St. Paul’s ordinance, in place since 2004, does not inhibit lawful federal immigration enforcement but appropriately delineates municipal roles under the 10th Amendment.”

The federal district court issued preliminary relief, and the case is now pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

Fresno v. Turner

In August, St. Paul joined a coalition of cities and counties in a federal lawsuit challenging the Trump administration for allegedly punishing them by withholding or threatening to withhold $262 million in federal funding grants, including Community Development Block Grants, transportation funding and housing support.

The federal department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, had called on the cities to remove all references to “equity,” transgender rights and “environmental justice” in their grant work. Led by Fresno, Calif., the 10 jurisdictions filed their legal action in the Northern District Court of California, which is headquartered in San Francisco.

St. Paul joined the lawsuit after HUD and other federal agencies threatened to freeze or rescind more than $197.3 million already under contract, and jeopardized an additional $64.9 million in awarded funding “all to force compliance with a political agenda unrelated to the grant programs Congress authorized,” Olson said. “Had the administration succeeded, St. Paul would have faced catastrophic delays in housing development, emergency response projects, youth employment programs, and major infrastructure work such as the Kellogg Bridge replacement. A preliminary injunction protected these critical investments.”

Chicago v. Noem

In October, St. Paul joined Minneapolis, Ramsey County, Chicago, Denver, Boston and other jurisdictions in a lawsuit against the Trump administration for allegedly placing “unlawful and unrelated conditions” on more than $100 million in public safety and disaster grants. Olson said the “high-stakes suit” attempts to block “sweeping federal control of local policy.”

Chicago v. Noem, which was filed in federal district court in Illinois, alleges the White House is attempting to force cities and counties to police speech around diversity, equity or inclusion in violation of First Amendment and 10th Amendment rights, which include constitutional arguments around the separation of state and federal powers.

St. Paul alone is at risk of losing $4 million in pending or awarded funds, including funding covering about half the staffing in the city’s nine-person Emergency Management department. Olson said her legal team “emphasized that these conditions were wholly unrelated to the purpose of emergency-preparedness grants” and the lawsuit is intended to protect counterterrorism preparedness, port security, hazard-mitigation projects “and the city’s ability to respond to emergencies without political interference.”

United States v. State of Minnesota

In September, the U.S. Department of Justice filed legal action against the state of Minnesota, the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office, the cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis, Hennepin County and the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office over so-called “sanctuary city” policies that it alleges interfere with federal immigration enforcement.

The federal lawsuit followed similar legal action against Boston, New York City, Colorado and other jurisdictions that have prohibited local law enforcement from cooperating with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on non-criminal matters, including holding jail inmates past their scheduled release date so immigration authorities can determine if they’re wanted on federal immigration warrants. The lawsuit was served on St. Paul about a week ago, Olson said.

St. Paul v. Department of Energy, and Office of Management and Budget

St. Paul signed onto a federal lawsuit this month accusing the Trump administration of abruptly reneging on $7.56 billion in grant funding for 321 clean energy projects — including the city’s Evie car-charging stations — based on the political leanings of the 16 states they’re based in.

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by the Environmental Defense Fund and four other environmental and energy-oriented advocacy groups, alleges constitutional violations of the First and Fifth amendments, which protect the freedom of speech and due process rights.

Chicago v. DOJ

St. Paul and Chicago filed legal action this month to prevent the Department of Justice from imposing sweeping new conditions on grants supporting the federally-backed COPS hiring program, including bans on diversity, equity and inclusion-related initiatives, compelled compliance with all executive orders and forced cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The lawsuit was filed this month in U.S. District Court for Northern Illinois.

“The case challenged unconstitutional conditions that directly conflicted with St. Paul’s separation ordinance and threatened vital community-policing initiatives, including the city’s Downtown Homelessness Initiative,” Olson said.",https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/STP-L-jea-21-PROTEST-0405.jpg?w=1024&h=657,N,,2025-11-27 22:56:26.458972

Both Oregon State Police and State Rep. Ricki Ruiz, D-Gresham, told KGW there are no known plans for ICE or other federal agents to conduct these operations.

Ruiz said he has been working for weeks to counter misinformation about immigration activity in his district, especially because there are verified enforcement missions and detainments reported to his office daily.

“We’ve seen kind of a steady operation of ICE agents being around our area. There’s no question that they’re here,” Ruiz said. “These are really tough times, very difficult times. But it is really important to verify with confirmed organizations that are doing this work on the ground.”

The roadblock rumor, alleging agents were preparing checkpoints on Interstate 5, Highway 26 and Interstate 84 spread quickly over the last couple of days. Ruiz said there is no verified information supporting those claims.

“There hasn’t been and there continues to be no verified or confirmed information regarding that,” he said. “If there were something like this to happen, someone within the state, the city or the county would know about this. And right now, there’s no indication of anything like this happening.”

Ruiz also took to his own social media accounts to urge residents to avoid spreading unverified posts that can fuel fear.

It’s hard, as they’re not the ones causing climate change, yet they’re the first to suffer from it.","Two years ago, a group of activists known as Scientist Rebellion blocked road and river traffic in Le Havre, Northern France, to oppose a new floating liquefied natural gas terminal.

Some activists locked themselves to the barriers on either side of the road, while others glued themselves to the asphalt. Police arrested them a few hours later and placed them in pre-charge detention for 24 hours.

Libre* is one of the 16 activists who took part in the protest. Each activist received a €200 criminal fine for blocking traffic, however they all chose to oppose and stood trial before the Havre First Instance Court, stating their acts were protected by freedom of expression. Two years later, on 10 February 2025, the Court acquitted the activists.

Libre’s case features in a new briefing developed by Amnesty International, APCOF and Suaram together with the Campaign to Decriminalize Poverty, Status and Activism “Dissent on Trial: Strategies to Counter Rising Criminalization of Activism”, which shares strategies activists, lawyers and civil society organizations can pursue to challenge the criminalization of various forms of activism including civil disobedience.

In this story, Libre reveals what inspired her activism, and why she’s hoping her engagement will lead to changes.

*Name has been changed to for security purposes

I’ve been aware of the effects of climate change since I was young. My parents used to find little notes I’d written such as “be careful with water” or “watch your waste”. It was a gradual journey, where I started taking small actions at home such as making posters for my parents, before trying to implement eco-friendly ideas in my classroom.

After that, I joined youth climate marches and organized scout projects, where we would pick up trash on beaches. However, I started to realise that youth climate marches weren’t as effective as I’d hoped, so I decided to turn to civil disobedience, hoping it makes a difference.

As part of Extinction Rebellion, I currently campaign on climate and environmental issues, taking on companies responsible for the climate and social crisis harming people, whose lives and lands they exploit.

The dangers of repression

I have faced dangers for taking part in these actions. While I was protesting against a giant water reservoir in south-western France, it turned extremely violent and I was genuinely afraid for my life. Police were shooting at us with rubber bullets and tear gas was being thrown into the crowds. I’ve also been kettled several times, deprived of access to water or toilets, as well as held in custody, which had a huge psychological impact on me.

Police were shooting at us with rubber bullets and tear gas was being thrown into the crowds

Libre, activist

In many ways, it’s nothing compared to the dangers others face due to climate change and I’m lucky I haven’t yet faced a real threat to my life because of climate disruption. However, when your life is put in danger because of activism, it’s still significant.

Repression is having a huge effect on me and my family. When my home was raided by mistake in connection to another case, my little sister was there. When I’m held in custody or go to court, my parents and partner come, so it’s stressful for them too. I’ve suffered nightmares. There are also legal consequences — for example, if I get a record, I can’t work anymore. I also miss workdays for trials, actions, and time in custody. It has affected my ability to travel. The last time I tried to go to England on the Eurostar, I was stopped at the border and questioned. They asked for my papers and why I was going there, because I think I’m flagged — maybe even as a “S file” (a security watchlist).

Climate change and its consequences

Sometimes, I feel like I am in a constant state of stress about the cause itself — climate change and its consequences — because I see that despite everything we do, very little changes.

Personally, I haven’t yet experienced the direct impacts of climate change, at least nothing beyond heatwaves. But I’ve witnessed small things.

For example, I think my grandparents’ house is collapsing due to global warming, especially because of soil issues. I also have a friend in Madagascar, who has experienced massive cyclones. It’s hard, as they’re not the ones causing climate change, yet they’re the first to suffer from it.

What we’re doing is for everyone

I wish authorities would realize that we’re not against them. We’re also doing it for them. We don’t want their children to suffer from climate change. It doesn’t bring us money or any personal benefit. It’s not for personal gain — it’s for all living beings. Everyone has a stake in this. By silencing the scientists and stopping us from taking action, authorities are putting themselves on the wrong side of history.

I wish authorities would realize that we’re not against them. We’re also doing it for them.

Libre, activist

We show our humanity when we’re able to see each other as equals, with respect and kindness for everyone, and when we act knowing that what we do has a positive impact on humanity and on all living beings.

My commitment is having an impact

Despite everything, I try and remain hopeful – especially when we manage to carry out actions that make sense, that speak to people. I also remind myself that small initiatives are taking place everywhere. And I tell myself that even if we don’t succeed, at least I’ll have done my part. I’ll be able to say to my children, and myself, I did what I could. That’s what keeps me going.

I know my work is having an impact. I’ve already had an impact on my loved ones by helping them understand the situation, as well as realize what state our rule of law is really in. Through the harsh repression we face as activists, my friends and family can see what that says about our democracy.

Then there’s the impact of our actions. Perhaps it feels small compared to what they cost us, but there is impact. We’ve seen results. And our actions make people think or at least force them to ask themselves questions. To me, that’s what matters.",https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/313106-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 20:57:26.366352

Where once the community was predominantly Black, Latino residents now form the majority.
In June, a viral moment spread across the internet after Latino protesters hurled racial insults at a Black L.A. police officer.","This story is part of ICE vs. LA, a collaborative reporting project by LA Public Press, Caló News, Capital & Main, Capital B, LA Taco, and Q Voice.

Four months after nearly 5,000 federal troops descended onto Los Angeles, Marsha Mitchell, a Black organizer in South Central, explained what made it impossible for her not to act: her neighbors.

At the peak of the federal immigration raids this summer — when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was arresting an average of 540 people per week in the city — her neighbor, Erica, and her husband and friend were taken by federal agents while eating breakfast in their home.

All three were placed in a van and driven toward downtown Los Angeles.

But Erica knew she had to get back to her small children, recalled Mitchell, a lifelong South Central resident, from a conversation she had with her neighbor.

“As a mother, her whole thing was, I got to get to my babies,” Mitchell said.

When the agents opened the van doors in downtown L.A., Erica broke free — still tied up, still terrified — and ran. While Erica managed to escape, her husband was placed in the detention center, where he said conditions were unbearable. According to Mitchell, he self-deported rather than endure them, choosing to escape the system that had trapped him.

Erica was the family’s breadwinner through her tamale stand, but with her husband gone, she is too afraid to leave her home. The family has collapsed financially under the weight of a single raid, Mitchell said.

“Not only has she lost her business, but also her husband and the ability to give her family what they need to survive,” said Mitchell, an organizer with Community Coalition, the long-standing anti-violence and drug addiction group founded by now-Mayor Karen Bass in 1990.

In South L.A., where Los Angeles City Council Districts 8, 9, and 10 have transformed from predominantly Black to predominantly Latino, and where the highest percentages of undocumented residents in the city now live, Erica’s story is part of the new normal.

For some South Central residents, the raids have triggered economic and social catastrophes. During the first weeks of concentrated immigration enforcement, 465,000 fewer workers reported for work. One local business owner told the economic justice group Strategic Actions for a Just Economy that he’d lost 80% of his business in the first month of the ICE crackdown. Other shops across South Central and downtown lost business for weeks.

The raids are posing a new hurdle for Black and Latino families to pay rent in one of America’s most expensive cities. But they’ve also catalyzed Black neighbors to act.

“[Erica] is a member of our community, and she is afraid to come outside,” Mitchell said. “She is not alone, and that is why we’re helping with mutual aid.”

Immediately, that looked like bringing her family groceries and referring them to resources for free mental health care.

Community Coalition, known as CoCo, is training dozens of block captains to canvass their communities and coordinate food drop-offs, safety check-ins, and care referrals in real time. They’re organizing their neighbors around the threats facing everyone, regardless of their race or residency status.

The immediacy of this care network — 18 block captains now, with hopes to reach 28 — emerged after Erica’s abduction by ICE, according to Mitchell, who works for CoCo.

L.A. County’s Black residents — 20% of whom are immigrants or children of immigrants — are standing in solidarity with their Latino neighbors, saying they are part of a shared fight against over-policing and racialized violence. Nine out of 10 ICE arrests have been of Latinos.

“Seeing families torn apart is so reminiscent of the white supremacist playbook that we’ve seen historically in communities of color, and that starts with our Indigenous siblings to slavery and through these latest ICE raids,” Mitchell said.

Neighbors moved to action

On a quiet stretch of 92nd Street, Pamela Riley propped open her front gate around 8 a.m. For one Saturday in October, her front yard — one of the typical South Central flair caged in by a sagging iron gate — became the heartbeat of a block fighting back against abandonment.

Within minutes, her neighbors began to gather. Grandmothers sipped coffee, young mothers munched on donuts, and teenagers organized flyers printed in Spanish and English.

Just steps from the 110 freeway and the ghostly remains of shuttered shops and clinics, her community is forging new lines of solidarity amid chronic neglect and a deep need for connection. This is the new frontline in South Los Angeles, where a coalition of Black and Latino residents is launching a network of “Neighborhood Action Hubs” along the Vermont and Broadway corridors to keep mutual aid alive as official support shrinks.

The goal: to weave a grassroots shield against ICE crackdowns and social services cuts and offer a model for how neighbors, not institutions, can bridge fear and isolation.

“That blueprint of success is there. The road is paved, we just need to walk it together,” said Riley, a 64-year-old lifelong South Central resident.

Later that morning, as the sun tried to fight through the gloomy sky, a group of three of the women who showed up at Riley’s event — two Black, one Latina — passed the same mural-painted utility boxes and chain-link fences that mark so many South L.A. blocks. Old-school Chevys, some missing hubcaps, were parked next to pickups and battered minivans, while the sound of cumbia drifted from a doorway where a woman watered her agave under the music’s sway.

As they moved from house to house, the group stopped at gates and asked neighbors about the specific issues facing their blocks and individual households. At one, a longtime Latino immigrant, gray-haired and smiling, shared how she planned to vote in the now-passed November election.

Deeper onto the block, the canvassers encountered two undocumented migrants — one a young father, the other a middle-aged woman. The father spoke to tangible issues in the neighborhood: “People have started stealing car tires at night and cutting wires from light poles for quick money,” he said.

The mother spoke quietly about work drying up and more neighbors “laying low” as rumors of ICE sightings swept through the area. The Latina canvasser asked directly about food access and whether anyone still sold homemade snacks. The woman hesitated, then explained in Spanish that she stopped selling crepes out of fear.

The canvassers turned to the others and suggested a solution: organizing a block-wide food vendor party, so people could sell their products safely.

Walking farther, they found themselves cautiously welcomed by a Black city worker who had lived on the block for decades. She described losing sleep as the city’s racial demographics shifted and her worry about Black and Latino votes being split or erased.

At each stop, the canvassers handed out cards with voting information and explained how to register, where to find drop boxes, and how to access rapid response teams if ICE was spotted or the lights went out again.

“Solidarity is literally in L.A.’s DNA,” Mitchell said. “We know that when communities come together, we weather all kinds of storms — governmental, financial, whatever comes our way.”

L.A.’s long-history of racial coalitions

Riley said her memories are filled with better days: bustling shops, a hospital on 94th, neighbors who’d send their kids to college together. She has watched her neighborhood swing from prosperity to depression and now, uncertainty.

Today, Riley’s yard and days are devoted to strategizing — she and other block captains count names, rehearse response plans and dream of new “welcome to South Central L.A.” signs at every corner. During meetings, they talk about how, in other parts of the city, neighbors stand by each other in crisis; here, too, unity could mean survival. The terror of recent abductions — a beloved tamalera torn from her routine and dayworkers swiped off the streets — still haunts these blocks, sharpening every knock at the door.

“I grew up in a civil rights era of the ’60s, and I’m starting to realize this is the new era of civil rights,” Riley said, explaining that the attack on civil rights today has extended far beyond immigration raids. “It is requiring more from all of us.”

Having lived through what she considers broken promises following the devastation of the 1992 L.A. Riots, Riley said she understands that revival cannot rely on state intervention alone, and it bridges racial divides. Instead, she insists, “what’s going on in Washington DC is showing us we need to join together and support each other.”

It also reminds her of the power of community. During the 1992 protests against police brutality, Latinos constituted the largest portion of arrests despite making up a smaller percentage of the overall population at the time.

The roots of Black and Latino collaboration go back to the founding of L.A. itself, where 26 of the city’s 44 original settlers in 1781 were Black/Afro-Latino with Spanish surnames — establishing a tradition of mixed neighborhoods and joint political action. This foundation was later strengthened during the Great Migration and again throughout the 20th century, when Black and Latino residents forged working alliances in the face of shared exclusion from citywide power.

In recent decades, the demographic mix in South Central has shifted further. Where once the community was predominantly Black, Latino residents now form the majority. The change created new opportunities for solidarity, as well as challenges, especially after Latino L.A. City Council members were caught on tape using racist anti-Black language while discussing concerns about the political power of Black residents. The tapes reopened wounds over neighborhood displacement.

Today, the skepticism remains real for a lot of Black people in L.A. In June, a viral moment spread across the internet after Latino protesters hurled racial insults at a Black L.A. police officer.

“A significant number of Black folks don’t see this as their fight,” author and commentator Earl Ofari Hutchinson said after the protest in June. “They’ve seen anti-Blackness in Latino communities. They’ve felt left out when it came to our issues. That breeds skepticism.”

But “if anything, the debate over whether Blacks should link hands with Latino activists in the immigration battle seems age old,” Hutchinson wrote on his daily blog.

Hector Sanchez, CoCo’s Deputy Political Director, agreed.“It takes a lot of work. I’m not going to say it’s very easy … but it’s people that are willing to have those difficult conversations at times to ensure that we have each other’s back.”

Just a day after the city council tapes leaked, more than 400 people came together in Boyle Heights “to talk about the importance of multi-racial solidarity,” he said. Despite the tensions, neighbors continue fighting side by side for justice and belonging.

In the years since, organizers have responded by promoting cross-cultural events, joint canvassing efforts, and language exchange programs. Language exchange workshops and “know your rights” sessions — alongside mutual aid deliveries — have become linchpins of the hub approach.

“We are not just helping Black folks, not just one population. It’s for all of us,” explained Sequarier McCoy, a 49-year-old lifelong L.A. resident.

“I grew up in a Black and Brown community,” she added. “I smelled Black-eyed peas, but I also smelled tortillas. I like corn on the cob and Esquites.”

McCoy is also acutely aware that the issues of migration, detention and deportation are far from just Latino issues. “It’s also for Dominican folks. It’s also for Belizean folks. It’s also for Caribbean folks,” she said. She said her partner, a Belizean migrant, is living in fear too.

Black undocumented migrants are deported at a rate four times more often than their numbers would suggest, according to an analysis of federal data by the Black Alliance for Just Immigration.

It is why this practical solidarity spans crises, organizers said. When SNAP benefits run dry, when an ICE van is spotted, or when a neighbor’s lights go out, the same phone trees and rapid response plans kick in.

“This work is an honor as a human being, not just as an activist,” McCoy said.

Botox has become increasingly popular with people in their 20s seeking to stave off wrinkles.

Clinics market what is known as ""Baby Botox,"" lower dose treatments administered less frequently than those for midlife adults — perhaps only once or twice a year.

Patients share the process in online videos filmed from injectors' offices, asking for a touch up to blur away any hint of crows feet or 11 lines between the brows.

It may seem absurd that anyone so young would be worried about aging. But like putting on sunscreen, patients say their use of Botox is preventive.

Botox is a brand name for botulinum toxin type A, an injectable neurotoxin derived from the bacterium that causes botulism. Other brand names include Dysport, Xeomin and Jeuveau. When administered in small amounts, the treatments block the nerve signals to the muscle causing it to relax, thereby temporarily reducing the appearance of wrinkles.

Attorney Stephanie Moore started getting Dysport when she was 27 to slow the formation of wrinkles around her eyes, which she attributes to her expressive face.

She pays about $460 per visit, and says these thrice-yearly injections are one of her favorite ways to treat herself: ""I feel a lot more confident.""

With Baby Botox, is age just a number?

There aren't comprehensive stats on what age groups are getting Botox, but data from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons shows that between 2019 and 2022, the use of injectable neurotoxins grew by more than 70% across all age groups under 70, including Gen Z adults.

It is not approved for use in minors, so the youngest someone can get Botox is 18.

Demand for other types of aesthetic procedures and surgeries, including cheek implants and fillers, has also jumped since the COVID-19 pandemic.

This timing is no coincidence says sociologist Dana Berkowitz, author of the book Botox Nation: Changing The Face of America.

During the pandemic, people's lives migrated to virtual spaces. That included younger people who had this experience at a formative age. They attended high school or college on Zoom during the day, and then logged onto TikTok and Instagram for socialization in the evenings.

Berkowitz says by looking at curated images of others far more frequently, inevitably, people were comparing those faces to their own.

At the same time, Berkowitz says some celebrities, along with social media influencers, now openly earn income through endorsements of various cosmetic procedures, further normalizing it.

While the 20s seem young for Botox, Dr. Kristy Hamilton, a board-certified plastic surgeon in Houston, says young adults can start to show signs of aging — a lot of it comes down to genetics and sunscreen.

""Sometimes we see people in their mid-20s that have a lot of wrinkles, and that's just life,"" she says.

But what's wrong with having wrinkles?

Ageless beauty is seen as a ""status symbol"" in today's society, says Berkowitz. Young women she researched told her these treatments show they were able to invest in themselves at a very early age: ""It was like they were part of this elite kind of social club.""

As Berkowitz explores in her book, falling short of society's definition of feminine beauty can incur a professional tax. ""Our ideal femininity is a youthful one,"" she says.

Research shows that people who are perceived as beautiful get better treatment, says David B. Sarwer, who studies the psychological aspects of appearance and cosmetic procedures at Temple University's College of Public Health.

Sarwer points to a robust body of literature on how attractiveness can positively influence one's academic performance, professional advancement and legal outcomes. One study even found that newborns who are seen as more attractive by hospital nursing staff get picked up more frequently.

""It may make some, dare I say, strategic sense for people to say, 'I want to find a way to improve the way that I look,'"" he says.

Are there any risks to starting young?

Botox was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration for cosmetic use in 2002. Physicians interviewed for this story note that since then millions have gotten it safely.

Reports of dangerous side effects are extremely rare, and typically linked to counterfeit or mishandled Botox.

There are still some risks. For one, it can stop working because your body forms a resistance to it.

This can be frustrating for patients, says Dr. Paul Durand, a Miami-based board-certified plastic surgeon. He hasn't seen any research explaining why this happens, but theorizes that younger people might be at higher risk because of their more robust immune systems.

Another concern is that too much Botox at too high a dose over time can cause excessive atrophy, or shrinking of the muscles. Since we lose volume in our faces as we age anyway, a person's face can start to look hollow instead of youthful.

Durand says well-trained clinicians can avoid that result by not overdoing it, i.e. not injecting too deep or using too much of the drug. But assessing a clinician's skill level may be difficult for patients.

Any medical doctor, regardless of specialty, can legally administer cosmetic injections without any special training or certification. That includes dentists.

Durand and Hamilton both recommend going to a plastic surgeon or dermatologist's office. Though Berkowitz says there are skilled injectors outside these specialties. She recommends that a Botox-curious patient ask friends or family for a referral.

Most people who get cosmetic procedures say they're happy with the outcome. Sarwer says the patients who are most satisfied are seeking to address discontent with a specific feature — like Moore's desire to soften the lines around her eyes.

But the evidence on how these procedures improve self esteem and quality of life are inconclusive, Sarwer says.

When cosmetic patients chase an unattainable ideal of beauty due to a mental health condition like body dysmorphic disorder or severe depression, Sarwer says Botox and other procedures don't improve their symptoms.

He explains these patients are, ""better treated by a mental health professional than they would be treated by a plastic surgeon.""

A life-long habit ... and expense

Durand turns away patients who want so much Botox that it would essentially freeze their face, blocking their ability to form expressions. ""That looks terrible,"" he says.

But in his experience, a determined enough person will eventually find a clinician to say ""yes,"" given that administering Botox can be a lucrative revenue stream with relatively few overhead costs.

Not only do clinician training and skill levels vary, so do prices. Discount treatments are unlikely to yield desired results, as Berkowitz warns. Amateur Botox can result in an obviously treated face.

And there's another problem: Once patients start with Botox or a similar injectable, they're unlikely to stop, says Berkowitz: ""You get people in their 20s, you have a lifelong consumer.""

Berkowitz herself is one of those lifelong consumers: She started getting Botox at 32 and now at 47, needs higher doses, paying about $800 per appointment.

For someone who starts young, that money — which could add up to tens of thousands of dollars in your 20s and 30s — could be spent paying off student loans, investing for their future, or traveling the world.

If you stop getting the injections, the effects wear off and wrinkles reappear.

In this way, Botox is addictive, argues Berkowitz, who admits that getting it feels in conflict with her feminist ethics, which aim to decenter appearance.

But Hamilton, the Houston plastic surgeon, says for many of her young patients, Botox is simply part of their overall investment in their health and appearance.

""Gen Z have this very different view on these things,"" she says. ""This is part of their self-care. It's part of their wellness.""

Stephanie Moore in Pittsburgh, says shaping her appearance with Botox makes her happy. She notes that her husband has tattoos, which she thinks are unnecessary and expensive.

""But that's his body and his choice,"" she says. ""And this is my body and my choice.""

The storm blew into Cozad, Nebraska, in the wee hours of Saturday, June 29, 2024. The wind felt like a hurricane. The hail was the size of softballs.

""I was in the window, I was crying,"" remembers Soledad Avalos, who has lived with her husband in their home in Cozad for 35 years. ""Seeing all the damage [to] the cars and the house.""

When the sun came up, the extent of the damage became clear. Cozad is a small town of about 4,000 people, surrounded by corn fields. Crops were flattened. Virtually every vehicle parked outside that night had a broken windshield. Nearly every roof in town was leaking, or worse. Siding was missing, paint had been stripped away. The storm came from the northwest, and so nearly every northwest-facing window was cracked. Both the hospital and the school were in disrepair.

""Those softball-sized hail stones just punched a hole through the roof membrane, and water was just pouring through the ceiling like a waterfall, or a shower,"" says Robert Dyer, the CEO of the Cozad Community Health System, which runs Cozad Community Hospital, the only hospital in town. ""Tiles were coming down, hunks of old plaster. It was just pretty devastating."" The hospital's emergency department had to shut down for several hours, and the building is still being repaired more than a year later.

Hailstorms like the one that hit Cozad don't often make national headlines, because they are usually hyper-local events that hit just one town, or one neighborhood in a larger city. Most hailstorms don't cause enough damage to trigger federal disaster declarations, or make it onto official annual lists of major weather disasters. And they are generally less deadly than flash floods, hurricanes and wildfires.

But extremely costly hailstorms are getting more likely in the United States, researchers warn. Across the central and eastern U.S., the weather conditions that can produce hail that's at least the size of a pool ball have gotten more common, according to Deborah Bathke, Nebraska's state climatologist. And the Great Plains are expected to have more frequent hail as the planet warms up.

That risk is driving up the cost of home insurance in the middle of the country, saddling average Americans with huge bills. Areas with the most hail risk are seeing some of the fastest growing home insurance prices in the U.S., according to two landmark federal reports released in the last year.

""In the Midwest, you've seen a surprising increase in losses,"" says Robert Gordon, a senior vice president at the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, the largest property insurance trade group. ""It's particularly the hail, the wind. A lot of damage to roofs.""

That escalating damage is a reminder that, as climate change drives more extreme weather, geography is no longer a guarantee of protection from skyrocketing insurance rates.

Home insurance costs are skyrocketing in the middle of the U.S.

The central United States is home to the worst hail risk on the planet.

""North America is the hail continent,"" explains Scott St. George, a climate scientist and the head of weather and climate research at WTW, an international risk analysis company. And he says hail is different from other types of severe weather because it does a lot of property damage without causing many fatalities.

""It basically damages anything that's outside. And we've got a lot of stuff in the way,"" according to St. George. ""There are more houses insured, more expensive cars. Roofs, siding, car windows and exteriors.""

That has led to enormous bills for property insurance companies. ""You've seen some really big losses coming out of hail, mostly in the U.S."" says St. George.

Last summer's hailstorm in Cozad caused an estimated $100 million in property damage, according to local insurance agent Brian Messersmith – an enormous sum for a town of just 4,000 people.

And, in 2024, hail damage contributed to $54 billion in insured losses from severe convective storms in the U.S., which include severe thunderstorms and other storms capable of producing large hail, according to the Insurance Information Institute, an industry-run think tank.

With losses mounting, insurance companies have raised prices in recent years. Nationwide, the cost of insurance rose about 8% faster than inflation between 2018 and 2022, according to a major report published by the Treasury Department in January.

The report found that the average price of property insurance in the Great Plains was significantly higher than the national average, with consumers in the Northern Plains paying about 20% more than the national average, and consumers in the Southern Plains paying more than 45% more. In Nebraska, the average cost of homeowners insurance this year is nearly $6,400, according to Bankrate. That's the highest in the country, and almost $4,000 above the national average.

In September, the Treasury report was removed from the department's website by the Trump administration. The Treasury Department did not respond to questions from NPR about why it was removed.

Hail risk is only one of many reasons that insurance is more expensive. The higher cost of labor, and of construction materials are also driving up insurance prices, says St. George.

""Insurance is very impacted by inflation,"" says Robert Gordon of the American Property and Casualty Insurance Association. ""So if inflation suddenly spikes, then insurance losses go up."" And the cost of building materials has increased even more than other goods in recent years, he points out.

Insurance companies are bringing in profits. Small towns are struggling

Rising prices for homeowners appear to be translating into profits for the industry. After losing more than $10 billion in 2023, the industry saw $26 billion in profits in 2024, according to credit agency AM Best.

Insurers say that's largely due to the severity of disasters in a given year. ""It can be a dramatic swing because some years you have huge catastrophes,"" says Gordon. When insurers raise prices, they are simply passing along the enormous costs of rebuilding from major disasters, he says.

But high prices are hitting many homeowners hard, particularly in places with historically low cost-of-living, like Nebraska.

""Insurance in our state really has skyrocketed the past several years,"" says Josh Tapio, an insurance broker at All Lines Insurance in Omaha, Neb.

A few years ago, an average homeowner would pay about $1,500 per year to insure their $300,000 home, Tapio says. Now, it costs between $3,000 to $4,500, a two or even threefold increase.

""There's a lot of sticker shock when somebody opens their renewal bill and they see that it's double from what they paid last year,"" Tapio says. His office has never been busier, as people shop around for a policy they can afford.

The high cost of insurance can make property ownership untenable. Before the storm, longtime Cozad resident Jennifer McKeone owned two rental houses in town. The hail caused extensive damage to both, and her insurance company refused to keep insuring them.

""I scrambled to find insurance, and the only insurance I could find was going to raise the rent to the point where I didn't think the people who lived in the houses could afford it,"" McKeone says. She ended up selling the homes, because neither she nor her tenants could afford the insurance costs.

Seniors are hit particularly hard by rising insurance costs

In the year and a half since the storm hit Cozad, most of the broken windows have been replaced, and most of the leaking roofs have been repaired. ""The town is doing well,"" says McKeone, who runs the Cozad Development Corporation, a local group that builds housing in town and works with businesses.

But under the surface, McKeone says, many are still trying to finish repairs to their homes. Seniors have been hit particularly hard, she says. Many older residents live on a fixed income from a pension or social security payments, and can't afford drastically higher bills.

Baltazar and Soledad Avalos, whose home was severely damaged in the storm, have experienced insurance problems firsthand. The home that they've lived in for 35 years had an insurance policy, but that policy didn't cover the full cost of all the repairs to the roof, windows and siding. Baltazar is still out on a ladder most days, fixing damage at age 72.

On top of that, the cost of their insurance has gone up by about 10%, which is significant for a retirement-age couple. Baltazar is retired, Soledad is still working.

Insurance is more expensive, and it covers less

One of the biggest complaints among Cozad residents is that, even as they shell out more for property insurance, that insurance is covering less.

Many people in town now have policies with higher deductibles, meaning that they need to pay thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars out of their own pockets before the insurance kicks in. And many new policies also don't cover the full cost of replacing a damaged roof, which is often the most expensive repair after a hailstorm.

Megan Fales has worked as an insurance agent in Cozad for more than a decade, and handles hundreds of home insurance policies in town. ""A lot of people have just gotten to the point where, like 'Let's just take a higher deductible,'"" she says, because it costs less each month, even though they agree to pay more for repairs if there's a future storm. She says many homeowners in the area hope to save money by doing repairs themselves, instead of relying on insurance to pay.

Businesses in town are also paying more money for less coverage. After the storm destroyed the roof of the local hospital, the insurance company refused to renew the policy. The only policies available are more expensive, and also have a much higher deductible for the roof. That means the hospital must pay more each month for insurance, and also must keep more cash on hand in case there's another storm.

In an effort to avoid catastrophic damage in future storms, the hospital's governing board chose to upgrade the building. Instead of simply replacing the damaged roof, they are investing in roof materials that can withstand high winds and small hail.

That choice saved them money on their monthly insurance premium, Dyer says. But even with those savings, they are paying more money for less coverage, compared to two years ago.

""It's to a point of unsustainability,"" says Dyer. ""If we got hit by another storm right now, it would drain all our cash.""

When he was looking for ‘80s tech inspiration and equipment for the fifth and final season of Stranger Things, special effects designer Shane Dzicek knew exactly where to go: Apex Surplus, a scrap metal recycling and industrial surplus business in Sun Valley.

“They're well known in the industry for being a place to rent a lot of hard-to-find electronics,” Dzicek said. “Imagine walking into a shop that would be in the world of Harry Potter, and there's just racks that go to the ceiling with everything that you can think of … military and airplane supplies to electronics … vintage microphones and knife switches.”

In addition to various knobs that he repurposed for the show, Dzicek also found an FM signal generator from the ‘80s, which served as a model for a decibel-reading device used by the character Steve Harrington, as seen in the teaser trailer:

Dzicek isn’t the only special effects designer who’s walked the halls of Apex Surplus. The shop’s co-owner, Adam Isaacs, estimates their credits span 5,000 different productions, including sci-fi classics like Back to the Future, Mad Max, Star Wars, Star Trek and 2001: A Space Odyssey.

So how did a nearly 70-year-old recycling business become a go-to destination for Hollywood designers?

The origins: A Holocaust survivor meets the SoCal aerospace industry

Apex Surplus is a third-generation family-owned business, first opened in 1958 by husband and wife Bill and Charlotte Slater.

Bill Slater was a Holocaust survivor who fled Austria in the 1940s and served in the U.S. army during World War II. After the war, he moved to Southern California, which was at the height of the aerospace industry boom.

With the space race raging, aerospace companies like Boeing, Northrop Grumman and Bendix Company were building at a rapid rate, with lots of materials left over. Slater decided to leverage his military connections and open an aerospace liquidation business and surplus front.

“ My grandpa would drive around with a semi-truck in the ‘60s and ‘70s and essentially recycle all of their old scrap metal,” according to Isaacs, who said subsidiaries of the aerospace hub in San Fernando Valley would then come to Apex to shop for secondary parts.

As Apex’s inventory grew in the 1960s, Isaacs said the business expanded and started catching the eye of set decorators and production designers in the TV and film industry.

Apex today: From oddball artist haven to film prop shop

After Bill and Charlotte Slater’s death, Apex was passed down to their children, Melissa and Don Slater.

Melissa now co-owns Apex Surplus with her son, Adam Isaacs, who said customers today range from folks outside the film industry, like electricians, plumbers, sculptors and artists, to set and production designers who work on films — anyone with a practical, aesthetic or historical interest in vintage or obsolete electronics.

Isaacs said, at heart, Apex still is a scrap metal, electronics and aerospace recycling and surplus business, though its also has embraced its role as a film prop and rental house.

More recently, its products have been featured in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., 13 Reasons Why, A.P. Bio and Avatar.

“Our close proximity to Hollywood has allowed us to open up this prop division and work with a lot of talented people,” Isaacs said. “There's so much creativity and artistry being produced in L.A. … We're very fortunate that we were able to reinvent ourselves as a production hub.”

The Eleventh Circuit held that CNN's use of the phrase the ""Big Lie,"" to describe President Trump's attacks on the 2020 election, was not defamatory because it did not constitute a false statement of fact and was constitutionally protected opinion.

In October 2022, President Trump sued CNN over the network's coverage of the 2020 election. President Trump claimed that the news organization defamed him by using the term the ""Big Lie"" to describe the President's claims about the 2020 election.

On appeal, President Trump argued that the district court got it wrong. The President claimed that the challenged statement was was not opinion. President Trump further argued that by using the phrase the ""Big Lie,"" CNN implied that Trump's ""actions and statements were designed to be, and actually were, variations of those [that] Hitler used to suppress and destroy populations.""

The Eleventh Circuit disagreed and affirmed the lower court's decision. The Court held that ""CNN's subjective assessment of Trump's conduct is not readily capable of being proven true or false."" The Court emphasized that both President Trump and CNN had different interpretations of how the President handled his ""concerns"" over the 2020 election—and that both were ""subjective interpretations."" Because the President failed to allege falsity, the Court held he failed to state a claim for defamation. The three-judge panel included two justices appointed by President Trump.

Trump is wielding tools created for him by Democrats and Republicans over many decades, despite a chorus of concern from scholars and advocates. We hand Trump a chainsaw, then act shocked when trees start to fall.

It is tempting to think that the best way to understand our current political crisis is to stay glued to every policy announcement, every tragic news story, every contemporaneous analysis of this new mass deportation regime. But we might be served just as well—or better—by stepping back from the clickbait firehose to understand the peculiar historical and political forces that animate, and have always animated, our immigration system.

Antonio Gramsci’s theoretical distinction between conjunctural and organic crises is applicable here: conjunctural crises emerge at peculiar moments (e.g., the 2008 financial crisis) out of deeper systemic factors (e.g., the circulation of capital). We might be able to solve conjunctural crises through policies and elections; organic crises require deeper tectonic shifts in the organization of society.

In immigration terms, we are living in a moment rife with everyday crises experienced by millions of U.S. citizens and immigrants alike, but the origins of this period of human suffering do not originate in the results of the 2024 election. The conditions for our moment are, as the thinking goes, baked into the U.S. immigration system itself and cannot be solved without a more profound reckoning. And that brings us to the Mapping Deportations project.

Mapping Deportations: An Ambitious Project That Meets the Urgent Needs of Our Moment

The recently launched Mapping Deportations project emerges from this line of research and critique as a rich source of historical deportation data and policies that illustrates the longstanding relationship between immigration controls and structural racism. The project examines the data, policy, and racial ideologies behind immigration policy from 1790 to today, and integrates this deep research into an engaging and interactive website portfolio that is easy to recommend for teachers, students, and researchers looking for a single, comprehensive source of vetted information.

The project assembles archival documents, digitized deportation ledgers, visualizations of annual removal counts, and timelines tracing the evolution of immigration law from 1790 through the present. When read together, these sources reveal how deportation has always functioned as a tool for shaping national identity, maintaining racial hierarchy, and defining who belongs. The dataset covers more than eight million formal deportation orders and when voluntary departure and border expulsions are included, the dataset balloons to over 58 million removals.

The website is highly interactive, with charts, timelines, maps, videos, and historical images that unpack the data across several eras of immigration enforcement and control. Mapping Deportations is more than a creative aggregation of existing information about immigration history, although it is partly that, too; there is a lot of new information that even the already-well-informed reader will find compelling. Integrating so many different data sources, as well as addressing the changing U.S. policies across various eras about how “deportation” is even counted, is an enormous lift.

For me, one of the most valuable resources on the site is not just the excellent visualizations, it’s the robust documentation of the methodology behind the project under their sources page. This ensures that whether you think about the project’s main theoretical arguments, they have laid out exactly how they did the work so that you can think through it for yourself, too. Researchers will greatly appreciate this.

The quality of the project will not be a surprise once you know who is behind it. Mapping Deportations was a collaboration between the Center for Immigration Law and Policy (CILP) at the UCLA School of Law and Million Dollar Hoods Project . Ahilan Arulanantham, professor at UCLA School of Law, is a brilliant legal strategist and among our most critical immigration thinkers. Kelly Lytle Hernández is an historian at UCLA and author of one of my favorite books about immigration history: Migra! A History of U.S. Border Patrol. She is easily one of the nation’s leading experts on race and immigration history. Mariah Tso is a GIS Specialist for the Ralph J. Bunche Center and the Million Dollar Hoods Project. Her creativity and expertise are all over the website. All my gratitude to this team as well as everyone who worked on the project or funded it.

After sifting through the project over the past few weeks and thinking about what this history means for us right now, I would like to use the Mapping Deportation’s findings to elaborate on my opening argument about the importance of understanding our current “mass deportation” moment in much longer history that is not so easily bounded by the current administration. I want to be clear: this is not at all to suggest that the current immigration policies are entirely in lock-step with all previous administrations—not at all. They are uniquely aggressive and should be taken seriously now. One need not be a bona fide immigration historian to offer substantive and powerful critiques. Rather, I only mean to lend evidence to the idea that in order to have better debates about what to do now, and what to do next, we must truly understand how we got here in the first place.

Has “Mass Deportation” Always Been the Official U.S. Policy?

The numbers that emerge from Mapping Deportations are staggering in their scale and consistency. Since 1895, when federal immigration authorities began publishing annual deportation counts, the U.S. government has issued more than eight million formal deportation orders. When voluntary departures and border expulsions are included in the accounting, that figure balloons to more than 58 million forced removals. To put this in perspective, 58 million removals represents a system of population control that rivals the largest displacement operations in modern history, sustained not through temporary crisis but through permanent institutional architecture.

What makes these numbers particularly revelatory is not just their magnitude but their distribution. More than 96 percent of all deportation orders since 1895 were issued to people from non-white majority countries, a pattern so stable across different eras, agency reorganizations, and shifts in political rhetoric that it suggests something far more fundamental than policy preference or enforcement priorities. Mexico alone accounts for 5.6 million deportation orders. When Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador are added to this count, the Western Hemisphere makes up eighty-eight percent of all recorded deportation orders in the dataset. That the United States built the largest deportation system in the world is significant; that this system has overwhelmingly targeted non-white communities across more than a century is foundational to understanding what deportation actually is and does.

The Mapping Deportations project makes it possible to see these patterns not as isolated episodes or the unfortunate byproducts of geographic proximity, but as evidence of one continuous historical structure. The project’s timeline, which tracks the evolution of immigration control from 1790 through the present, demonstrates how racial logic became enforcement infrastructure. Long before deportation was a formal federal process, the Naturalization Act of 1790 restricted the right to naturalize to free white persons.” The first immigration bans in 1803 prevented ship captains from bringing “negro, mulatto, or other persons of color” into states that prohibited their entry. These early statutes established the terms on which the later apparatus would be built, encoding into law the principle that immigration control was fundamentally about maintaining racial boundaries.

When the federal government constructed a national immigration system in the late nineteenth century, it inherited and institutionalized these logics. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 created the first federal deportation mechanisms, and Congress spent the following decades refining removal categories aimed at people deemed undesirable”: public charges, sex workers, the diseased, the disabled, the politically suspect. These categories were presented as neutral administrative classifications, but they functioned as the vocabulary of racial hierarchy, eugenic thought, and class anxiety. Supreme Court decisions in the 1880s and 1890s reinforced this emerging system by granting Congress virtually absolute power to exclude or deport immigrants while denying noncitizens the constitutional protections afforded to criminal defendants, a legal architecture that remains in place today.

The reforms that followed did little to alter the racial structure of the system even when they changed its statutory language. The 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act abolished the explicitly racist national origins quotas of the 1924 Johnson-Reed Act, which had been designed to engineer the U.S. population by favoring northern and western Europeans. But the same 1965 reforms that opened pathways for Asian and African immigrants inserted new restrictions on the Western Hemisphere that dramatically reduced legal pathways from Mexico and Central America. Combined with the end of the Bracero program that same decade, these changes helped produce the undocumented migration flows that politicians would later point to as justification for expanded enforcement. The reforms of the 1960s were followed in short order by the detention of Haitian asylum seekers in the 1980s, the criminalization of migration through employer sanctions and border prosecutions in the late 1980s and 1990s, and the eventual construction of the mass deportation infrastructure we live with today.

The 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act represents a critical inflection point in this history. IIRIRA created expedited removal, expanded the aggravated felony category to include minor offenses, authorized the 287(g) program that embedded immigration enforcement into local policing, and established mandatory detention for wide categories of immigrants. After 1996, immigration enforcement fused with the criminal legal system in ways that dramatically accelerated the scale of removals. Local police arrests became inputs into ICE databases. Minor convictions triggered automatic detention and deportation. Border prosecutions surged until unlawful entry became the most prosecuted federal crime in the country. After September 11, 2001, the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement embedded immigration enforcement even more deeply into the infrastructure of domestic security, treating migration as a matter of national threat rather than social and economic policy.

What emerged was not simply a larger version of the earlier system but a qualitatively different enforcement regime, one optimized for mass processing through technology, surveillance, and bureaucratic automation. Programs like Secure Communities and the Criminal Alien Program placed ICE inside nearly every local jail in the country. Title 42 expulsions during the COVID-19 pandemic removed more than 2.8 million people outside the asylum system entirely. The Mexico-U.S. border was transformed into an enforcement zone where rapid removals often go uncounted in national statistics, rendering large portions of this displacement invisible to public scrutiny. And yet through all of these changes, the racial patterns remained astonishingly consistent. The majority of people removed under this new regime continued to be Mexicans and Central Americans. The project argues that Black immigrants, though a smaller proportion of the overall total, were disproportionately funneled into the deportation system through criminal legal system referrals, mirroring the racialized policing that affects Black Americans more broadly.

The discriminatory logic of the system surfaced clearly during the pandemic, when the government invoked Title 42 to expel Haitian asylum seekers en masse while largely exempting Ukrainian refugees fleeing war. Based on available data from the twenty-six months between March 2020 and May 2022, the U.S. government issued nearly two million Title 42 expulsions, with 94 percent directed at citizens of Mexico and Central America. This is not the behavior of a system responding neutrally to migration flows or public health concerns but of one structured around longstanding patterns of racial exclusion that adapt to new justifications while maintaining their underlying architecture.

Understanding Deportation as Racial Control Rather Than Simply Administrative Necessity

The Mapping Deportations project includes a remarkable collection of primary source quotations from lawmakers, immigration officials, and public figures spanning more than a century, assembled in a section titled “In Their Own Words.” These quotations are not marginal or eccentric expressions of individual prejudice but represent the mainstream discourse that shaped immigration law and enforcement. Officials spoke openly for decades about protecting America as a “white nation,” guarding “American stock,” and excluding races deemed undesirable or dangerous. Madison Grant’s influential 1916 book The Passing of the Great Race described immigration control as essential to preserving “Homo Europeus the white man par excellence.” Congressional testimony from the 1920s characterized immigration control as “the greatest instrument which the federal government can use in promoting race conservation of the nation.” Representative John Box of Texas warned in 1928 that Mexican immigration represented “the most insidious and general mixture of white, Indian, and negro blood strains ever produced in America.”

These were not rhetorical flourishes disconnected from policy: they were the ideological framework that guided the creation of immigration law itself. The quotations that contemporary officials use may be more coded, but the structural continuity is unmistakable. When Stephen Miller, communications director for Senator Jeff Sessions and later senior advisor to President Trump, suggested in leaked emails that the country should return to the immigration principles established by Calvin Coolidge in the 1920s, he was explicitly invoking the era of national origins quotas and racial exclusion. When President Trump asked in 2018 why the U.S. was not letting more people in from Europe and described immigrants as “poisoning the blood of our country,” he was reaching for the same eugenic language that shaped the 1924 Johnson-Reed Act. When Attorney General Jeff Sessions referred to immigrants as “filth” during a 2017 speech announcing renewed immigration enforcement, he was deploying rhetoric that echoes more than a century of dehumanizing discourse used to justify exclusion and removal.

The artistically re-imagined maps below showcases more than a century of immigration ideology into a pair of unsettling images by pairing political quotes with policies that enacted them. Each statement highlights how U.S. leaders have repeatedly described non-white immigrants as threats to national identity, purity or security. The map exposes historical and contemporary rhetoric side by side by showcasing the links between Chinese exclusion act, The Muslim Ban and Title 42. These policies have functioned as tools to maintain the racial hierarchy. The map argues that whites-only immigration regimes did not end but has simply evolved into new legal forms that produce similar outcomes.

To name this system as one built on racial hierarchy is not to deny the legal violations that can trigger deportation proceedings or to dismiss the complexity of managing migration flows. It is to acknowledge the architecture we have inherited and to recognize that enforcement categories rooted in racial thinking do not become neutral simply because the language has been sanitized. When a system built on those categories grows into a mass removal apparatus capable of processing millions of people, its underlying design becomes even more consequential for the lives it touches and the society it shapes. The Mapping Deportations data make clear that this is not a story about episodic failures or unfortunate excesses within an otherwise sound framework. It is a story about a system working largely as designed across more than a century of operation, pursuing the same populations with remarkable consistency despite dramatic changes in political leadership, agency structure, and statutory language.

As I said at the outset, this is the lesson that the contemporary fixation on the Trump administration’s policies threatens to obscure. The tools Trump has wielded so aggressively were not created by his administration but assembled over decades by Democratic and Republican lawmakers responding to different political pressures and constituencies. The infrastructure that makes mass deportation possible today, the databases and detention centers and expedited removal proceedings and border prosecution programs, represents the accumulated policy choices of multiple generations. Trump’s innovation has been primarily (though not exclusively) rhetorical, his willingness to speak more openly about the racial logics that previous administrations worked to obscure, but the machinery itself is older and more bipartisan than most contemporary political discourse acknowledges.

Our Next Steps as a Country Requires Embracing Uncomfortable but Essential Historical Understandings

The Mapping Deportations project offers something increasingly rare in our current information environment: the patient accumulation of evidence across a timescale long enough to reveal patterns that shorter analyses miss. By documenting every recorded deportation from 1895 forward and situating that data within the fuller context of immigration control reaching back to 1790, the project makes it possible to see our present moment not as an aberration but as the latest expression of logics embedded in the system from its inception. In Gramsci’s terms, the data assembled by Mapping Deportations suggests that we are witnessing an organic crisis, not a conjunctural one.”

This is uncomfortable knowledge, precisely because it suggests that addressing the humanitarian crises we are witnessing will require confronting the deeper architecture of immigration enforcement itself and asking whether—or how—a system built for racial ordering can be reformed into one that treats migration as something other than a threat to be managed and a population to be controlled.

For teachers, researchers, and anyone attempting to understand how we arrived at this moment, Mapping Deportations provides an essential resource. The project’s timelines offer a comprehensive single source for tracking the evolution of immigration law and enforcement. And perhaps most importantly, the project models how to engage with historical evidence in ways that take both the scale of the data and the voices in the archive seriously, neither minimizing the violence documented in the numbers nor treating the racist language of lawmakers as mere historical curiosity disconnected from the systems those words helped build. In a political moment characterized by both urgent crisis and deliberate historical amnesia, this kind of patient, evidence-based work offers a foundation for understanding not just where we are but how we got here, and what it might take to build something different.

The arrests, which happened on Oct. 30 and Nov. 3, were either in a court facility parking lot or across the street from the courthouse.

Guidance released by the Department of Homeland Security in January allows for immigration arrests in and near courthouses. Agents must check with DHS lawyers for any jurisdictional legal restrictions.

An Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson confirmed the identities of the two men, Fabian Pablo Beltran-Flores and Adolfo Felipe Mendoza-Cruz, and told Cascadia Daily News they “abused our border as a revolving door.”

“These individuals were not seeking the American dream — they knowingly violated our laws and endangered public safety,” the spokesperson said.

The spokesperson said Beltran-Flores and Mendoza-Cruz’s arrest were “conducted in accordance with established procedures, protocols and authorities as outlines in ICE policy.”

Security footage captures first arrest

On the morning of Oct. 30, Mendoza-Cruz, originally from Guatemala, walks into Bellingham Municipal Court to be arraigned on a DUI. He likely doesn’t know a plainclothed federal agent follows him into the courtroom.

The agent does not tell security or court personnel he is a law enforcement official and does not sign in, as required by state law, said Melissa Morin, a communication specialist for the City of Bellingham.

As part of the Courts Open to All Act, all law enforcement — municipal, county, state and federal — should sign in with court personnel, including their name, the agency they are with, the specific law enforcement purpose and the action that’s going to be taken. The only exception is if the law enforcement official is participating in court proceedings.

Just before 10 a.m., Mendoza-Cruz leaves the courtroom and walks to the adjacent parking lot, the video shows. A handful of cars are captured in the security footage. Another man stands next to a car and lights a cigarette.

Suddenly, a gray Dodge Charger drives up to the two men, blocking exit routes. Six federal agents, some wearing Homeland Security Investigations vests and one wearing an Immigration and Customs Enforcement vest, surround Mendoza-Cruz, who was wearing a white ball cap.

Another federal agent, wearing a blue jacket, comes into the video and pulls up a face covering.

At least two more unmarked support vehicles arrive with more agents. By the time Mendoza-Cruz is detained, five minutes have passed since he left the courtroom. Seven unmarked cars leave the parking lot.

In response, city staff made the report to the AG’s office, Morin said. Bellingham Police Deputy Chief Jay Hart confirmed with federal officials that the detainment was an ICE removal operation.

Municipal Court Judge Debra Lev reported the incident to the state Administrative Office of the Courts.

ICE claims Mendoza-Cruz is a suspected member of the Surenos gang. His “rap sheet includes a conviction for negligent driving and a recent arrest for driving under the influence,” according to the spokesperson.

Second arrest shows surveillance

On Nov. 3, four days later, another plainclothes federal officer arrives at Whatcom County District Court around 8:30 a.m. Video footage captures him waving his badge at security and going to the fourth floor of the courthouse. A district court administrator said they had no record of a federal agency signing in.

Twenty minutes later, Beltran-Flores, originally from Mexico, arrives at District Court for his hearing. Footage shows the federal officer surveilling Beltran-Flores for more than an hour and a half. At one point, they cross in front of each other and ride the elevator together to the rotunda.

At 10:38 a.m., Beltran-Flores leaves the courthouse with the federal agent following behind. Beltran-Flores crosses the street to Bellingham City Hall, where he is detained by ICE on the sidewalk.

During the arrest, at least six officers throw him to the ground before placing him in an unmarked vehicle. The ICE spokesperson said Beltran-Flores “was physically aggressive” when ICE agents identified themselves. The video shows an altercation and Beltran-Flores trying to run.

“Beltran has a long history of defying U.S. immigration laws, with multiple orders of removal and voluntary returns to his home country,” the spokesperson said, listing convictions for false identification, possession of a stolen vehicle, entering a noncommercial dwelling, obstruction, evading, possessing controlled substances and reckless driving.

The entire detainment took two minutes.

Morin said a city staffer witnessed the detainment and approached one of the unmarked vehicles parked outside City Hall.

The employee “spoke to one of the (presumed) ICE agents, asking them to identify themselves,” Morin said. The agent did not reply and “drove away.”

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Thursday firmly rejected pressure from the Trump administration on European migration policy, stressing that such decisions remain the sovereign right of European nations.

Responding to reports that the US State Department had directed American diplomats to lobby against pro-migration policies in Europe, Merz underlined that European governments would chart their own course.

""Migration policy is our business, and we decide it as we see fit. And we in Germany have been on the right track since the change of government,"" the conservative leader said, referring to his coalition government taking office in May and implementing stricter policies to curb illegal migration.

""We don't need any admonitions from outside. Furthermore, we are in the process of formulating a new, common European asylum and immigration policy. We can do that on our own, and we will do it on our own,"" he added.

Several US media outlets reported earlier that the Trump administration had ordered American diplomats in Europe to lobby against pro-migration policies and advocate for tighter immigration regulations.

The US State Department said Friday that it has directed its embassies to report on alleged human rights consequences of mass migration in Europe, including in Britain, Sweden, and Germany.

""Mass migration poses an existential threat to Western civilization and may undermine the stability of key American allies,"" the department said in a statement on US social media company X.

The guidance asks embassies to gather information on policies perceived as lenient toward migrant crime and human rights abuses, as well as laws that may penalize citizens who object to mass migration.

To access COPS money, the DOJ has insisted that cities certify they do not operate diversity, equity and inclusion programs and they will cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.

That isn’t St. Paul’s only legal battle with the White House.

In another recent skirmish, Minnesota’s capital city had been counting on more than $560,000 from the U.S. Department of Energy to expand Evie — a network of electric vehicle charging stations aimed at boosting car-sharing — into low- to moderate-income neighborhoods on the city’s East Side. In October, word came that the funding had been eliminated, alongside more than $7.5 billion in grants for clean energy projects across 16 states, all of which were states that voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

“The Trump administration’s cancellation of $7.5 billion in climate grants targeted communities based solely on politics,” said Jennifer Lor, a spokesperson for Carter’s office. “In St. Paul, this decision cut the remaining funds from our $560,844 subgrant, slowing our groundbreaking work to expand clean, affordable, and reliable electric car-share options across the city’s East Side.”

Growing legal actions by city

The loss of energy-related grants forms the basis of yet another new federal lawsuit against the Trump administration, the latest in a growing number of legal actions filed by St. Paul and other municipalities and nonprofits alleging constitutional violations and federal overreach.

It’s been a busy year for St. Paul City Attorney Lyndsey Olson and her legal team, who have represented the city in at least five major legal battles with the Trump administration while trying to protect upwards of $200 million in federal funding that could be withheld from the city’s housing, public safety, clean energy and transportation initiatives.

The White House has derided so-called “woke” policies, including St. Paul’s 2004 separation ordinance, which prohibits city employees from asking residents their immigration status before delivering city services. In response, “blue” cities have accused the Trump administration of blatant political retaliation for not stepping into line with the president’s executive orders, including bans on language around diversity, equity and inclusion outreach, or “DEI.”

“We’re certainly being targeted and punished,” said Olson on Tuesday. “Our residents are being punished. Taxpayers are being punished in ways that are political and don’t have anything to do with the grants. The courts say this is not legal … and they keep doing it.”

St. Paul has company. Chicago has filed upwards of 40 legal actions against federal agencies, accusing them of playing politics with vital grant funding. In September, the U.S. Department of Justice filed its own legal action against St. Paul and other “blue” cities that don’t fall into step with its immigration policies, though the lawsuit was not served on the city until late November, Olson said.

With a new mayoral administration coming in following the election this month of Mayor-elect Kaohly Her over Mayor Melvin Carter, Olson said she expects to be leaving City Hall around January, as most St. Paul mayors handpick their chief attorney. She said she anticipates whomever holds her position in the months ahead to face similar battles with the White House, and Her has made no secret of her disdain for the president’s approach toward immigration enforcement.

“It’s not just the filing of the lawsuits and the litigation piece,” Olson said. “It’s tracking everything they’re doing all the time. … They’ll put new terms into grant agreements that are already in process. They’ll say ‘we’re going to withhold money until you agree to these terms.’ I think that’s our new normal for the remainder of this (presidential) administration. I think blue cities are being targeted.”

Here’s a look at six lawsuits involving St. Paul and the Trump administration:

San Francisco v. Trump

In February, St. Paul signed onto a lawsuit, led by the city of San Francisco, accusing the Trump administration of attempting to commandeer city services by denying federal funding to municipalities that don’t fall in line with its executive orders and immigration policies. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California, alleges that the White House is violating the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which states that powers not delegated to the federal government are reserved for the states.

In a written posting to its website, the White House that week called out the St. Paul mayor by name, as well as other city leaders in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles for immigrant-friendly policies that the president claimed protected “killers, rapists and drug dealers.” St. Paul has maintained a “separation ordinance” that bars city employees from asking residents about their immigration status while delivering core city services.

Olson said her team has “argued forcefully that St. Paul’s ordinance, in place since 2004, does not inhibit lawful federal immigration enforcement but appropriately delineates municipal roles under the 10th Amendment.”

The federal district court issued preliminary relief, and the case is now pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

Fresno v. Turner

In August, St. Paul joined a coalition of cities and counties in a federal lawsuit challenging the Trump administration for allegedly punishing them by withholding or threatening to withhold $262 million in federal funding grants, including Community Development Block Grants, transportation funding and housing support.

The federal department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, had called on the cities to remove all references to “equity,” transgender rights and “environmental justice” in their grant work. Led by Fresno, Calif., the 10 jurisdictions filed their legal action in the Northern District Court of California, which is headquartered in San Francisco.

St. Paul joined the lawsuit after HUD and other federal agencies threatened to freeze or rescind more than $197.3 million already under contract, and jeopardized an additional $64.9 million in awarded funding “all to force compliance with a political agenda unrelated to the grant programs Congress authorized,” Olson said. “Had the administration succeeded, St. Paul would have faced catastrophic delays in housing development, emergency response projects, youth employment programs, and major infrastructure work such as the Kellogg Bridge replacement. A preliminary injunction protected these critical investments.”

Chicago v. Noem

In October, St. Paul joined Minneapolis, Ramsey County, Chicago, Denver, Boston and other jurisdictions in a lawsuit against the Trump administration for allegedly placing “unlawful and unrelated conditions” on more than $100 million in public safety and disaster grants. Olson said the “high-stakes suit” attempts to block “sweeping federal control of local policy.”

Chicago v. Noem, which was filed in federal district court in Illinois, alleges the White House is attempting to force cities and counties to police speech around diversity, equity or inclusion in violation of First Amendment and 10th Amendment rights, which include constitutional arguments around the separation of state and federal powers.

St. Paul alone is at risk of losing $4 million in pending or awarded funds, including funding covering about half the staffing in the city’s nine-person Emergency Management department. Olson said her legal team “emphasized that these conditions were wholly unrelated to the purpose of emergency-preparedness grants” and the lawsuit is intended to protect counterterrorism preparedness, port security, hazard-mitigation projects “and the city’s ability to respond to emergencies without political interference.”

United States v. State of Minnesota

In September, the U.S. Department of Justice filed legal action against the state of Minnesota, the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office, the cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis, Hennepin County and the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office over so-called “sanctuary city” policies that it alleges interfere with federal immigration enforcement.

The federal lawsuit followed similar legal action against Boston, New York City, Colorado and other jurisdictions that have prohibited local law enforcement from cooperating with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on non-criminal matters, including holding jail inmates past their scheduled release date so immigration authorities can determine if they’re wanted on federal immigration warrants. The lawsuit was served on St. Paul about a week ago, Olson said.

St. Paul v. Department of Energy, and Office of Management and Budget

St. Paul signed onto a federal lawsuit this month accusing the Trump administration of abruptly reneging on $7.56 billion in grant funding for 321 clean energy projects — including the city’s Evie car-charging stations — based on the political leanings of the 16 states they’re based in.

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by the Environmental Defense Fund and four other environmental and energy-oriented advocacy groups, alleges constitutional violations of the First and Fifth amendments, which protect the freedom of speech and due process rights.

Chicago v. DOJ

St. Paul and Chicago filed legal action this month to prevent the Department of Justice from imposing sweeping new conditions on grants supporting the federally-backed COPS hiring program, including bans on diversity, equity and inclusion-related initiatives, compelled compliance with all executive orders and forced cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The lawsuit was filed this month in U.S. District Court for Northern Illinois.

“The case challenged unconstitutional conditions that directly conflicted with St. Paul’s separation ordinance and threatened vital community-policing initiatives, including the city’s Downtown Homelessness Initiative,” Olson said.

John Wilson Bennett and Mark Booth Bennett, both U.S. citizens, were arrested late last week on allegations they were planning to carry out attacks against Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, the department announcement said.

It said the department began an investigation Nov. 17 with the Virginia Beach Police Department after an off-duty Norfolk, Virginia, police officer reported he heard the brothers allegedly discussing plans to “kill police officers and ICE agents.”

Mark Bennett also was overheard allegedly saying he was going to Las Vegas to meet with other people to purchase firearms to carry out the attacks, according to the department statement. It said Mark Bennett was arrested Nov. 19 at the Norfolk International Airport, where he was set to fly to Las Vegas. Later that day, it said, John Bennett, an assistant principal at Kempsville High School, was arrested in Virginia Beach.

Both of the men were charged with “conspiracy to commit malicious wounding,” according to court records.

“It’s chilling that a human being, much less a child educator, would plot to ambush and kill ICE law enforcement officers — offering such specifics as to getting a high caliber rifle that would pierce the law enforcements’ bullet proof vests,” said Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs, in a statement.

The brothers and their attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.

During a hearing last week in a court in Virginia Beach General District Court, their attorneys said the conversation was hearsay and that the brothers posed no threat to the community, according to Virginia news outlet 13 News Now. The attorneys said Mark Bennett was traveling to Las Vegas for a Formula 1 race before he was apprehended at the Norfolk airport, according to the news report.

They were released on home confinement under pretrial supervision, according to the news report.

McLaughlin’s statement highlighted what she described as a sharp increase in assaults and death threats against immigration officers, including cases of bounties being placed on their heads, threats to their families, stalking and online doxxing.

The arrest comes at a time of heightened tension in the country over federal immigration enforcement.

Homeland Security officials have ramped up enforcement actions under President Donald Trump’s sweeping anti-immigrant crackdown highlighted by mass arrests, including the targeting of Democratic-run cities such as Chicago and Los Angeles for sweeping operations.

The justices' Wednesday order leaves in effect for now lower court rulings that held that the official, Shira Perlmutter, could not be unilaterally fired.

The case is the latest that relates to Trump’s authority to install his own people at the head of federal agencies. The Supreme Court has largely allowed Trump to fire officials, even as court challenges proceed.

Justice Clarence Thomas said he would have allowed Perlmutter to be fired as her lawsuit proceeds. The court majority, though, decided to wait to make a decision until after they rule in two other lawsuits over Trump firings.

Arguments are set for December in the first case, over the removal of Rebecca Slaughter as a member of the Federal Trade Commission.

And in January the court will hear the case of Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, who remains in her job despite Trump's attempt to fire her.

Rulings are expected weeks or months after the court hears arguments.

Perlmutter's case concerns an office that is within the Library of Congress. She is the register of copyrights and also advises Congress on copyright issues.

Despite the ties to Congress, the register “wields executive power” in regulating copyrights, Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the court.

Perlmutter claims Trump fired her in May because he disapproved of advice she gave to Congress in a report related to artificial intelligence. Perlmutter had received an email from the White House notifying her that “your position as the Register of Copyrights and Director at the U.S. Copyright Office is terminated effective immediately,” her office said.

A divided appellate panel ruled that Perlmutter could keep her job while the case moves forward.

Perlmutter’s attorneys have argued that she is a renowned copyright expert. She has served as register of copyrights since then-Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden appointed her to the job in October 2020.",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/12bc08b7-9dd3-46f7-8d46-50ad5cda36d0/wirestory_c5ccca29ff5413815347340ffa300f69_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-11-27 12:57:25.445902

While there is no 25-foot buffer law, police do have the power to impose boundaries to prevent onlookers from impeding their operations.
“He said he was not representing a 25-foot law.
He said federal agents told him at least one suspect was an alleged member of the gang MS-13.","NEW ORLEANS — As officers from Gretna Police and federal immigration agents took down a suspect in front of the Floor & Decor on Wednesday morning, they repeatedly yelled at a man who was filming the scene on his cell phone to back up to a 25-foot buffer zone.

But there is no legal 25-foot buffer zone. The state Legislature passed a 25-foot buffer law in 2024, but it was ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge earlier this year and blocked from ever taking effect.

While there is no 25-foot buffer law, police do have the power to impose boundaries to prevent onlookers from impeding their operations.

The video, which was shared by Impacto Informativo and other migrant advocacy groups on Facebook, shows a Gretna police officer in a plaid shirt, tactical vest and backwards baseball cap among six officers and masked ICE agents subduing a suspect on the ground.

After the person shooting the video refused to back up and insisted he could be 10 feet away, the Gretna officer told his colleagues, “I’m gonna hook him; y’all stay here.” He then jumped to his feet, tripped and stumbled to a knee. Then he appeared to push the man filming and shouted, “We have a 25-foot zone! Back up!”

Scott Sternberg represented a group of news organizations, including WWL Louisiana’s parent company, that argued the 25-foot barrier violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments and should be blocked. A federal judge in Baton Rouge agreed.

“The law was written in such a way that, you know, the common person, the average person, the smartest person couldn't figure out what was illegal and what was legal,” Sternberg said. “And, 25 feet from an officer could be a balcony on Bourbon Street, or it could be someone who's interfering with an arrest. It could be things that we want to stop and also things that are not illegal.”

After the Gretna officer walked away from the man who was filming the arrest, the man called the agents “absolute fascists.” That prompted the officer to reach for zip ties and say, “Come here.” The video cuts out momentarily and picks up again with the officer in the man’s face inside the store, holding the zip ties, pointing at him and saying, “You’re not allowed,” but stops short and retreats. The man follows him with the camera and says, “I’m absolutely allowed. You’re messing up your words. You cannot arrest me, sir.”

Gretna Deputy Police Chief Jason DiMarco said he’s reviewing the officer’s actions and deciding if any corrective action is needed. DiMarco said the department has informed its officers that there is no 25-foot barrier law.

“He said he was not representing a 25-foot law. He said, ‘I was telling him that he needed to get back. He was being an agitator.’ I don’t think he had any intention on arresting the guy,” DiMarco said.

The group that posted the video, Impacto Informativo, posted other photos of the arrest and commented on it in Spanish. One comment translates to, “Have you considered that you ought to offer more details about these operations publicly to lessen the uncertainty in the community?”

To that DiMarco responded, “I’m 100% on board with that, but I can’t compromise our own investigations or another agency’s investigation.”

He also urged members of the community to bring questions to the department after an arrest rather than during it.

“I answer every question asked because we’re public servants,” DiMarco said. “But the time to engage the officer is not while they’re making an arrest. If people have questions they can direct any question to this department after the arrest.”

He said the only arrests Wednesday were made by ICE, not local law enforcement. He said federal agents told him at least one suspect was an alleged member of the gang MS-13. DiMarco also said the operation was not part of the so-called “Swamp Sweep” operation planned for the New Orleans area by US Customs and Border Protection.",https://media.wwltv.com/assets/WWL/images/62af8637-91ac-4f42-8a29-61c4767111c1/20251126T232815/62af8637-91ac-4f42-8a29-61c4767111c1_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 15:57:01.141842

Why it matters: The Trump administration is already taking steps in that direction by suspending all immigration applications from Afghan nationals — a move even some Republican moderates aren't fully dismissing.

""I hope they give extra consideration to the interpreters. I agree everyone should be screened though,"" Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.), a frequent public critic of President Trump, told Axios.

Said Rep. Nick LaLota (R-N.Y.): ""America's leaders must put politics aside and neutrally examine the risk versus reward of the [Special Immigrant Visas] program.""

Driving the news: Two National Guard members were left in critical condition Wednesday after being shot near the White House in what officials have described as a targeted attack.

The 29-year-old suspect came to the U.S. in 2021 under Operation Allies Welcome after working with the CIA and other U.S. government agencies in Kandahar, Axios' Mike Allen reported.

Trump said Wednesday the shooting ""underscores the single greatest national security threat facing our nation,"" and that the U.S. ""must now reexamine every single alien from Afghanistan who has entered our country under Biden.""

He added that the administration ""must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country.""

What they're saying: Some Republicans in Congress want to go much further that just suspending Afghan immigration.

""We must IMMEDIATELY BAN all ISLAM immigrants and DEPORT every single Islamist who is living among us just waiting to attack,"" Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) said Wednesday in a post on X.

The sentiment was similar among House members, with Rep. Mary Miller (R-Ill.) writing: ""Deport them all. Now.

""We know the solution,"" Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) posted. ""Stop importing Islamists. Deport Islamists.""

Zoom out: The administration has already taken steps to curtail immigration into the U.S., particularly from Muslim-majority countries, as part of its wide-ranging anti-immigration agenda.

Trump announced a travel ban in June that included Afghanistan, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.

The administration has also terminated temporary protected status for migrants from more than a half dozen countries including Afghanistan and Syria.

What to watch: Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) is pushing for a vote on his bill to require ""recurrent and periodic vetting"" of Afghan refugees who came to the U.S. in 2021 and 2022 without certain documentation.

Miles, an Indigenous actor best known for her roles in “Northern Exposure,” “Smoke Signals,” “Wyvern” and “The Last of Us,” handed them her tribal ID from the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation in Oregon.

Federal government agencies recognize tribal ID as a valid form of identification, and Miles has used it to travel back and forth to Canada and Mexico without any issues.

Yet, Miles recalled one agent calling it “fake.”

“Anyone can make that,” she recalled another agent saying.

Reported encounters between immigration agents and Indigenous people like Miles’ remain rare. But as immigration enforcement has gotten more aggressive, including in the Seattle area, incidents like Miles’ are stoking fears beyond immigrant communities.

Miles said her son and uncle were both detained by ICE agents who initially did not accept their tribal IDs before they were eventually let go.

“What we’re talking about here is racial profiling,” said Seattle-based Indigenous rights attorney Gabriel Galanda, who does not represent Miles. “People are getting pulled over or detained on the street because of the dark color of their skin.”

ICE did not respond to a request for comment.

Miles wrote a social media post about her experience, which came on the same day ICE arrested multiple people at Redmond’s Bear Creek Village shopping center.

The arrests sparked strong reaction in Redmond, including its city council voting to turn off Flock Safety license-plate-reading cameras. Although there’s no evidence immigration authorities used Flock Safety footage to make the arrests, councilmembers said they were concerned about the possibility of it happening in the future.

Miles said the men, whom she worried could have been bounty hunters, did not identify themselves when she asked for their names and badge numbers while they detained her at a bus stop by the shopping center.

When the men did not believe Miles’ tribal ID, she pointed to a phone number for the Umatilla Tribal enrollment office on the back of the card.

“Call it,” she said.

When they didn’t, she took out her phone to call the office herself, but the agents tried unsuccessfully to take her phone, she said. That’s when a fifth agent in the SUV whistled over, and the agents went back to their vehicles and left.

Galanda said the agents’ refusal to recognize Miles’ tribal ID speaks of “a fair amount of ignorance about tribal citizenship generally in society and in government.”

Recently, an Indigenous woman born in Phoenix was mistakenly detained by immigration enforcement upon her discharge from jail in Des Moines, Iowa. She was eventually allowed to leave.

Galanda advises Indigenous people to always be ready with any and all forms of identification in case they are questioned by immigration enforcement, and that they do not escalate the situation.

Still, these detentions have been rare, and Galanda doesn’t want Indigenous people to be afraid.

But for Miles, she said, the damage has been done.

She said she’s afraid to leave the house alone or at night. Her aunt and uncle make her check in with them at the end of every day.

“The prospect of the First Peoples being physically or forcibly stopped or detained is harrowing and reminiscent of this country’s original treatment of the First Peoples,” Galanda said. “It’s also deeply troubling that in 2025, the first people of this country have to essentially look over their shoulders.”",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11262025_ICE-Miles_tzr_124647.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-11-27 12:57:57.260730

According to protestors, St. Paul police showed up to the scene a little after 10 a.m. and blocked the street to traffic.
St Paul Council Vice President Hwa Jeong Kim said that one of the protestors was slammed on the sidewalk by St. Paul police, according to MPR.
Even though the agents told the community organizers that they had a warrant for one person in the house, Suazo’s family said that their advocates didn’t yet have a warrant from the federal agents.
“When the St. Paul police started dispersing people and moving the line back, the agents then started shouting, “See, they’re leaving.","On Tuesday, Jeffrey Suazo woke up at 6 a.m. like he did every morning. He got ready for his work as a house painter, said goodbye to his girlfriend Deylin, and drove away, his family said.

But this morning was different in a key way — he left his house in the 600 block of Rose Avenue in St. Paul at the same time as Victor Rodriguez, a tenant from Honduras living on the first floor. Soon, Suazo found himself pursued by federal agents who were apparently looking for Rodriguez.

Suazo fled back home, his family said, prompting an hourslong standoff and drawing more than 200 protesters who clashed with federal agents and St. Paul police officers.

A day later, state and city officials have promised an investigation into how the operation devolved into a clash with law enforcement that led to tear-gas and other nonlethal munitions that sent at least one photojournalist to the hospital.

Federal immigration officials have filed a criminal complaint, charging Suazo with assaulting a federal officer. But confusion and questions still swirl around what exactly happened and why he was swept into the operation.

Family members spoke to Sahan Journal through a translator on Wednesday, sharing their account of what led to Suazo’s arrest. They asked to use their first names, citing safety concerns.

Suazo, 26, came to the United States four years ago from Honduras fleeing persecution. He had been living in the East Side house for a year with his girlfriend Deylin, her 6-year-old sister Siamy, their mother Maria, and his pregnant sister-in-law Daniela, family members said.

On Tuesday morning, he left for work in his car at the same time as Victor Rodriguez, a tenant from Honduras living on the first floor of the house. Soon after he left the house, Rodriguez was pursued and arrested by what Suazo described to Deylin and his sister-in-law Daniela as federal agents in three cars.

In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security said Rodriguez illegally entered the U.S. after being previously removed from the country and had previous charges of domestic abuse and disorderly conduct.

In a criminal complaint against Suazo filed after the federal operation Tuesday, ICE deportation officer Benjamin Jorgenson said agents were surveilling the Rose Avenue house when they saw Rodriguez leave around 7:45 a.m. and get into a white pickup truck. Suazo left at the same time and got into his Toyota Corolla, also parked outside.

Officers surrounded both vehicles in unmarked cars and turned on their flashers, the criminal complaint said. Suazo then squeezed past agents’ vehicles, leading Jorgenson to pursue him with lights flashing. A half-block later, Suazo “suddenly jerked his vehicle to the left, striking my vehicle,” Jorgenson said in the complaint.

Deylin said that during Rodriguez’s arrest, one of the agents from the three cars pointed at Suazo, who was dressed in his painter’s clothes. “That’s when he tried to find a way out,” she said.

Suazo drove back to the safety of his house, but was pursued by the three cars. He entered his garage through the back alley, where agents deliberately rammed his vehicle, Suazo told Deylin after he got into the house.

The family said soon after Suazo came into the house, the agents surrounded the house.

On his way in, Suazo forgot to lock one of the doors. At least two agents would later enter the first floor of the house, now vacant as Rodriguez was the only occupant, through that same door, the family said. “We started to hear the wooden floors creak and we could hear two voices from below,” said Daniela. “That’s when the manipulation tactics and the insults started,” she said.

According to their account, the agents tried to determine the number of people inside by calling out “Señora, señora.” They said the agents even mentioned Deylin’s 6-year-old sister Siamy, asking what the little girl would think when she returned from school.

They added that a male agent taunted Suazo in halting Spanish, calling him “poco hombre” for hiding and for putting his girlfriend at risk. “And just like mocking, you know, and singing, like in a horror movie, saying, ‘Jeffrey, come out, we’re gonna get you one way or another.’ That was nerve-wracking,” Daniela said. They added that a female agent said that they were arresting Suazo for missing his court date, but the family said that he did not have any ongoing court proceedings.

Suazo was in a room with Deylin while Daniela and Deylin’s mother, Maria, were in other rooms, communicating with each other and a team from the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee (MIRAC) through messages for advice. They were locked in their rooms for five hours without food, afraid to even use the bathroom.

They were watching from their window as more and more uniformed agents gathered on the street outside their house. “Jeffrey was scared,” Deylin said, “he started crying, and he was so scared to the point where he wanted to leave the house and give in to the officers.”

Over the next hour, dozens of neighbors and community organizers arrived to confront the federal agents. According to protestors, St. Paul police showed up to the scene a little after 10 a.m. and blocked the street to traffic. St Paul Council Vice President Hwa Jeong Kim said that one of the protestors was slammed on the sidewalk by St. Paul police, according to MPR. That person was taken to the backyard of the house along with two other protestors.

Suazo was told not to leave by legal advisers over the phone because the agents did not present a warrant. “They shouted through the stairs that they would say that Jeffrey was the one that crashed into the agents so that they could get a warrant,” Deylin said.

Even though the agents told the community organizers that they had a warrant for one person in the house, Suazo’s family said that their advocates didn’t yet have a warrant from the federal agents.

As scores showed up to protest the federal raid, St. Paul police closed off the perimeter in front of the house with yellow tape, using pepper spray to disperse protestors.

“When the St. Paul police started dispersing people and moving the line back, the agents then started shouting, “See, they’re leaving. They don’t care about you guys, they’re just here to put on a show,” Deylin said. “I was really scared.”

Daniela and Maria added that they were worried the agents would break in. “I was worried for my daughter, worried for everybody in the house,” Maria said. “What if they just forcibly come in? What if they break the doors? What do we do?”

At a Wednesday news conference held at St. Paul nonprofit Indigenous Roots, Executive Director Mary Anne Ligeralde Quiroz said agents had threatened to throw pepper balls into the house and break open the doors.

On Tuesday, Quiroz and acquaintances of the family were communicating with a Homeland Security Task Force officer. The officer said they would leave the rest of the family unharmed if Suazo turned himself in.

“I can’t say it’s this one, but normally, like, if we were to come into contact with somebody that doesn’t have status here, that would be a club-in situation,” the officer told Quiroz. “If that person freely comes out, they will not touch the rest of the family,” Tanisha Santiago, a relative of the family, said.

Daniela said that Jeffrey spoke to a lawyer over the phone. “That was the window of time to be able to leave the premises,” she said.

Deylin, who has been in a relationship with Suazo for five years and knows him from Honduras, said she wanted to go with him. “It was just a very intense, heavy, intimate moment for them,” Daniela said on Deylin’s behalf. “She was crying on the floor. She was distraught,” she said.

Before turning himself in, Suazo hugged each one of them goodbye, including his two cats.

After five hours of fear, anxiety, and uncertainty, Suazo was escorted out of the house at midday by federal agents, followed by two protestors who were also detained.

Suazo’s family never expected that immigration agents would one day knock on their door. “We had only ever heard about it at businesses and public spaces, we had never heard that agents were actually forcing their way into people’s homes,” Daniela and Maria said. “It was like a real shock in a moment of being checked into reality as to what’s going on,” Maria added.

Deylin knows Suazo to be a loving, caring partner. He is also the breadwinner of the house.

“He is just really important to the household,” Daniela said. “He is someone who has no vices, he’s not on the streets causing trouble or hanging out with people. He goes to work and comes home and does everything together as a family. If they need to go wash clothes, they all go to the laundromat together. He is such a pillar in the household because we don’t work, and so he was the one who would help pay for things, you know, like, ‘Do you guys want food? Let’s all get food together.'”

The family is now raising money for Suazo’s legal assistance. They hope that Suazo comes back home without charges, and is met with justice.

“They are painting Jeffrey as something he’s not. They’re calling him somebody who’s violated somebody like, plastering his face, coming out [of the house] crying… We want to make sure Jeffrey’s life and who he is is heard and that his name is not sullied, and portrayed as who he is, as we know him,” Daniela said.

“We also just want to be in a house that’s safe,” Maria said. “We want to be somewhere where we don’t have the fear that this is going to happen again, because we don’t feel safe in our house right now.”

The court supported her appeal to reject an immigration tribunal ruling that had allowed a Palestinian family to come to the UK under a scheme meant for Ukrainian refugees.
This protects the right to a family life.
The Appeal Court ruling could have a far-reaching impact because it will become case law cited by government lawyers and immigration tribunals in future cases.
New restrictions on use of Article 8 right to family life will mean only immediate family will count in order to prevent “dubious” connections.","Shabana Mahmood has overturned a human rights ruling that granted Palestinians fleeing Gaza refuge in Britain.

In a victory for the Government, Mahmood has been backed by the Court of Appeal in restricting the ability of migrants to use the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) to come and live in the UK.

The court supported her appeal to reject an immigration tribunal ruling that had allowed a Palestinian family to come to the UK under a scheme meant for Ukrainian refugees.

The family had successfully argued that their circumstances were so exceptional that they should be allowed to enter the UK and live with the father’s brother under the scheme.

This was despite warnings from lawyers for the Home Office that such a decision could open the floodgates to the “admission of all those in conflict zones with family in the UK”.

The Appeal Court judges, including Sir Geoffrey Vos, the Master of the Rolls, ruled that the family links between the brothers were not strong enough to justify their entry to the UK under Article 8 of the ECHR. This protects the right to a family life.

The court also said that immigration tribunals must take account of the Home Secretary’s rights under Article 8 to act in the interests of “the economic well-being of the country … or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others”.

The Appeal Court ruling could have a far-reaching impact because it will become case law cited by government lawyers and immigration tribunals in future cases.

The case, first highlighted by The Telegraph in February, sparked a row between Sir Keir Starmer and Baroness Carr, the Lady Chief Justice, when she rebuked him and Kemi Badenoch for criticising the original tribunal decision backing the family at Prime Minister’s Questions.

The Palestinian family, who had a “anti-Hamas profile”, were trapped in Gaza in “extremely dangerous” conditions where law and order had broken down and were living in a tent that had been damaged by gunfire.

They used the Ukraine Family Scheme form because the Home Office guidance told claimants to apply “for the route which most closely matches [your] circumstances”.

An upper immigration tribunal ruled that the rights of the family, who were in an “extreme and life-threatening” situation, outweighed the “public interest” of the rules on entry to the UK, which were designed to limit resettlement schemes and control immigration.

In its judgment, however, the Court of Appeal said the purpose of Article 8 was normally limited to the “nuclear” family and that there was not “family life” between the two brothers unless they could demonstrate “additional elements of dependence, involving more than the normal emotional ties”.

New restrictions on use of Article 8

The Appeal Court judges said the immigration tribunals had been wrong to ask themselves only whether the sponsor had provided “real, effective or committed support” to his brother and the family.

They concluded that the family links were not covered by Article 8 rights. “Applying the proper test, neither the brother nor his family had demonstrated that they had sufficient family life with the sponsor to engage Article 8,” they said.

The judgment comes as Ms Mahmood is preparing new laws to limit the way immigration courts use Article 8 in determining whether to block deportations or back asylum appeals.

New restrictions on use of Article 8 right to family life will mean only immediate family will count in order to prevent “dubious” connections. Judges will be required to prioritise public safety over individual article eight rights.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2025/11/26/TELEMMGLPICT000450611400_17641869093630_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrpfQw2hJyG_yckwxPAr0gmyy-GsNrhPQbLesooHneHs.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-11-27 10:57:28.302889

It said Mark Bennett was arrested Nov. 19 at the Norfolk International Airport, where he was set to fly to Las Vegas.
Later that day, it said, John Bennett, an assistant principal at Kempsville High School, was arrested in Virginia Beach.
The arrest comes at a time of heightened tension in the country over federal immigration enforcement.
The Virginia Beach Police Department confirmed the arrests in a statement and Chief Paul Neudigate called the allegations “incredibly alarming.”","Two brothers in Virginia have been arrested after an off-duty police officer overheard the men allegedly discussing plans to kill immigration officers, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday.

John Wilson Bennett and Mark Booth Bennett, both U.S. citizens, were arrested late last week on allegations they were planning to carry out attacks against Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, the department announcement said.

It said the department began an investigation Nov. 17 with the Virginia Beach Police Department after an off-duty Norfolk, Virginia, police officer reported he heard the brothers allegedly discussing plans to “kill police officers and ICE agents.”

Mark Bennett also was overheard allegedly saying he was going to Las Vegas to meet with other people to purchase firearms to carry out the attacks, according to the department statement. It said Mark Bennett was arrested Nov. 19 at the Norfolk International Airport, where he was set to fly to Las Vegas. Later that day, it said, John Bennett, an assistant principal at Kempsville High School, was arrested in Virginia Beach.

Both of the men were charged with “conspiracy to commit malicious wounding,” according to court records.

“It’s chilling that a human being, much less a child educator, would plot to ambush and kill ICE law enforcement officers — offering such specifics as to getting a high caliber rifle that would pierce the law enforcements’ bullet proof vests,” said Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs, in a statement.

The brothers and their attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.

During a hearing last week in a court in Virginia Beach General District Court, their attorneys said the conversation was hearsay and that the brothers posed no threat to the community, according to Virginia news outlet 13 News Now.

Former President Joe Biden’s administration extended TPS for Haitians in 2024, citing ""simultaneous economic, security, political, and health crises"" in the country fueled by gangs and a lack of a functioning government. That extension lasts through Feb. 3, 2026.

Haiti has been in turmoil for years, with natural disasters and political violence rocking the Caribbean nation.

Governance effectively collapsed in 2021 with the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse, leaving power vacuums. Kidnappings, gang rule and a lack of law enforcement have surged.

The number of people displaced by violence and instability in Haiti has reached an unprecedented level, with more than 1.4 million people forced from their homes this year, according to the International Organization for Migration.

UNICEF, according to the DHS notice, estimated in October that more than 6 million people — over half the population, including 3.3 million children — need humanitarian assistance.

Some Haitians have attempted to flee to the U.S. despite the Trump administration’s hardline approach to immigration. For instance, in February, the Coast Guard intercepted 132 Haitians on a boat south of the Florida Keys.

The US has suspended processing all immigration requests from Afghans, after an Afghan man was identified as the suspect in the shooting of two National Guard soldiers near the White House.

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services said the decision was made pending a review of ""security and vetting protocols"".

The suspect of Wednesday's shooting, which left two National Guard members critically injured, is said to have arrived in the US from Afghanistan in September 2021.

US President Donald Trump said the attack was an ""act of terror"", adding that he would take steps to remove foreigners ""from any country who does not belong here"".

Tens of thousands of Afghans entered the US under special immigration protections following the chaotic US withdrawal from the country in 2021 under former President Joe Biden.

The Department of Homeland Security named the suspect in a press release as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, ""a criminal alien from Afghanistan"".

It said Lakanwal had entered the US during the presidency of Joe Biden in September 2021, under a programme for Afghans named called Operation Allies Welcome.

At the time, the Taliban had taken back control of Afghanistan following a chaotic withdrawal of US forces.

An official told the BBC's US news partner CBS that Lakanwal had applied for asylum in 2024, and that his application had been granted earlier this year.

Lakanwal's is reportedly 29 years old, and he is said to not be co-operating with authorities' investigation.

Trump said following the shooting that the US ""must now re-examine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden"".

The Joint Task Force DC, which is co-ordinating the National Guard deployments to the nation's capital, said the attack took place at around 14:15 EST (19:15 GMT) on Wednesday near the Farragut Square Metro Station.

The soldiers had been on a high-visibility patrol near the corner of 17th and I streets - a busy lunch spot for office workers.

Metropolitan Police Assistant Chief Jeff Carroll said the suspect ""came around the corner"" and ""immediately started firing"", adding that the soldiers had been ""ambushed"".

Other National Guard members nearby heard the gunfire and intervened, holding the suspect down until police arrived, he said.

The suspect was shot four times, law enforcement sources told CBS.

One witness described to the BBC his experience of hearing gunshots, as people ran in panic and tried to take shelter in a nearby shop.

Another witness, who was in his car close to the metro station, showed the BBC footage he took of the two soldiers lying on the street in their uniforms while being treated by medics. Details on the identities of the soldiers have not yet been provided by officials.

A third person, apparently the alleged gunman, was also seen on the pavement being treated.

In the wake of the attack, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said the president had asked him to send 500 more National Guard members to the American capital.

""This will only stiffen our resolve to ensure that we make Washington DC safe and beautiful,"" the Pentagon chief said.

There are currently nearly 2,200 National Guard troops in the city.

They are a reservist force that can be activated to serve as military troops, but have limited power as they cannot enforce the law or make arrests.

The troops were deployed in August to tackle what Trump called ""out of control"" crime in Washington.

Overall crime in the city has fallen since the force was sent, which Trump credits to the troops' presence on the streets.

There have been similar deployments in other Democratic-led cities across the US, which have faced legal challenges by opponents who accuse the Trump administration of overreach.

“Effective immediately, processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals is stopped indefinitely pending further review of security and vetting protocols,” the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) said in a post on the social media platform X.

“The protection and safety of our homeland and of the American people remains our singular focus and mission,” the agency added.

President Trump on Wednesday night ordered his administration to review the cases of individuals from Afghanistan who entered the country after the U.S. withdrawal from the Middle Eastern country in 2021.

The shooting suspect, Rahmanaullah Lakanwal, 29, entered the United States in September 2021 through the program “Operation Allies Welcome,” DHS said Wednesday night. At the time, the Biden administration ordered DHS to help vulnerable Afghans who worked with American troops during the 20-year war in Afghanistan resettle in the U.S. after the Taliban’s takeover in August 2021.

In a short speech from his Mar-a-Lago property Wednesday night, Trump lambasted former President Biden for the program and called him “a disastrous president.” Vice President Vance echoed the president’s sentiment in a post on the social media platform X hours later.

“I remember back in 2021 criticizing the Biden policy of opening the floodgate to unvetted Afghan refugees,” Vance said. “Friends sent me messages calling me a racist. It was a clarifying moment. They shouldn’t have been in our country.”

Around 195,000 Afghan immigrants live in the U.S. as of 2022, with the majority living in Washington, D.C. and Sacramento, according to the Migration Policy Institute.

Before the shooting, the Trump administration on Tuesday ordered USCIS to “re-interview” some 200,000 refugees who entered the country, according to a memo obtained by The Hill. The memo suggested that refugees’ protections could be stripped.

“All principal refugees admitted during this period are to undergo a comprehensive review and a re-interview to verify that, at the time of their admission, they met the statutory definition of a refugee under the Immigration and Nationality Act,” the memo stated. “Officers must also reassess any inadmissibility issues that existed at the time of admission.”

Trump renewed his push after the shooting left two National Guardsmen in critical condition. At around 2:15 p.m., they were shot near the Farragut Square Metro Station in the area of 17th and I streets NW, the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) stated.

Both Guard members were “ambushed” after a person turned the corner, raised his arm and fired with a handgun, Jeffrey Carroll, executive assistant chief of the MPD, said at a press conference. Both Guard members were taken to a nearby hospital.

Lakanwal was also shot and taken to the hospital. He remains in custody.

Trump called the shooting “an act of terror.” He called on Americans to pray for the two Guardsmen and said the suspect would pay “the steepest possible price.”

“As we are filled with anguish and grief for those who were shot, we’re also filled with righteous anger and ferocious resolve,” the president said.

FBI Director Kash Patel said the FBI is investigating the shooting with the assistance of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), DHS, the U.S. Secret Service (USSS) and the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA).",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/AP25330764715554-e1764194379721.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-27 11:58:23.598760

The global debate over asylum and refugee frameworks will likely intensify as the administration attempts to align partners with its hardline approach.","A State Department cable sent to U.S. embassies in Europe, Canada, and Australia instructs diplomats to lobby foreign governments to curb pro-migration policies and highlight what the Trump administration claims are crime and human-rights abuses linked to migration. The cable, first reported by the New York Times and seen by Reuters, frames mass migration as a threat to public safety and social cohesion and urges embassies to report back on migrant-related crimes and host-country reactions. This aligns with Trump’s hardline immigration agenda: slashing refugee admissions, promoting global rollbacks to asylum protections, and amplifying claims contradicted by studies that migrants drive violent crime.

Why It Matters

The directive pushes U.S. immigration ideology into allied domestic politics, marking an aggressive attempt to reshape Western migration frameworks that have stood since WWII. It risks diplomatic friction with governments that support humanitarian migration or rely on migrant labor, and could further polarize debates on crime, asylum, and integration across the West.

The Trump administration is seeking to internationalize its restrictive migration model; U.S. diplomats are now tasked with lobbying allied governments on a politically charged issue; European, Canadian, and Australian officials face new U.S. pressure that may conflict with their own laws, data, and public sentiment; migrant and refugee communities could face heightened stigma as governments respond to U.S. messaging that links them to crime.

What’s Next

Expect pushback from some allies wary of U.S. interference in their migration policies, alongside possible political amplification from right-wing parties who see Washington’s stance as validation. Embassies will begin sending crime-related reporting to Washington, which may be used to justify further U.S. policy tightening. The global debate over asylum and refugee frameworks will likely intensify as the administration attempts to align partners with its hardline approach.

The ECtHR did not elaborate what specific actions States must take to protect its democratic elections from foreign interference – and indeed it would be difficult to do so given the diversity of threats.
While the judgment acknowledged that States have a positive duty to safeguard electoral integrity, it did not require States to investigate such claims.
Third, the Court afforded States an excessively wide margin of appreciation, setting an unduly high threshold for proving a violation under A3P1.
This case invites the Grand Chamber to ensure that the Convention continues to offer real, enforceable protection for free and fair elections.","In the recent judgment of Bradshaw & Others v United Kingdom, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has sent a powerful message to governments across Europe: democratic rights in the digital age require active protection—not just of the voting process, but of the entire information environment in which elections take place.

The case was brought by former MPs Ben Bradshaw, Caroline Lucas and Alyn Smith represented by Leigh Day solicitors. They argued that the UK Government had failed to investigate credible allegations of Russian interference in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, the 2016 Brexit vote, and the 2019 general election, including evidence from the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament set out in the Russia Report. This, they said, breached the UK’s positive obligations under Article 3 of Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights (A3P1) — the right to free and fair elections.

The Court did not shy away from acknowledging Russia’s systematic efforts to destabilise democratic systems across Europe and the United States, using tactics such as media manipulation, cyber-attacks, and disinformation campaigns. The Court emphasised that “the dissemination of disinformation is capable of posing a significant threat to democracy.

The ECtHR ultimately found no violation of A3P1. It accepted that there were initial shortcomings in the UK’s response—and it is notable that the full Russia Report has still not been released.

However, the Court held that steps taken by the UK - including two parliamentary investigations and the introduction of legislation such as the Elections Act 2022 and the National Security Act 2023—fell within the “margin of appreciation” afforded to States. The judgment also sets a new precedent that foreign interference in elections can in principle engage A3P1, with the Court holding that “States are therefore under an obligation to adopt positive measures to organise elections under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people.”

The Court made clear that this obligation is not confined to the act of voting or the integrity of the final count. It encompasses the entire ecosystem in which elections take place—including the circulation of political opinions and information in the period preceding an election and the equality of opportunity for candidates.

While acknowledging the right to a free and fair election, the Court warns against kneejerk reactions noting that there is a fine line between addressing the dangers of disinformation and outright censorship. Any actions taken by States to counter the risk of foreign election interference will need to be balanced against the right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention.

Looking Ahead

This case began with events in 2014. It has taken several years to reach Strasbourg, and in that time, the landscape of digital interference has grown only more complex. Social media platforms have evolved, AI-generated content is proliferating, and the pace of technological change continues to outrun the ability of lawmakers to respond. Foreign actors are increasingly exploiting these developments to influence public opinion, distort democratic debate, and undermine electoral integrity—often without detection, and often from thousands of miles away.

The ECtHR did not elaborate what specific actions States must take to protect its democratic elections from foreign interference – and indeed it would be difficult to do so given the diversity of threats. However, it concludes that “this is a complex global problem which cannot be addressed without the co-operation of international partners and social media companies.” The Bradshaw judgment sets a clear challenge for the UK government—and for governments across Europe.

This is not the end of the story. The applicants have now requested a referral to the Grand Chamber, arguing that this is an exceptional case raising serious questions about the interpretation or application of the Convention. The applicants argue that the Court’s judgment requires further consideration by the Grand Chamber in respect of three issues

First, the Court failed to recognise a freestanding obligation to investigate credible allegations of foreign interference with the right to free and fair elections. While the judgment acknowledged that States have a positive duty to safeguard electoral integrity, it did not require States to investigate such claims. Without a clear investigative obligation, the right to participate in elections under conditions ensuring free expression risks being theoretical and illusory only.

Second, the Court failed to clarify the scope of States’ positive obligations under A3P1.

Third, the Court afforded States an excessively wide margin of appreciation, setting an unduly high threshold for proving a violation under A3P1.

This case invites the Grand Chamber to ensure that the Convention continues to offer real, enforceable protection for free and fair elections. The outcome will shape how States respond to hostile threats against democracy - and whether voters can rely on the Convention to defend their right to choose their representatives without manipulation or foreign interference.",https://www.leighday.co.uk/media/cnwblxu4/gettyimages-496704430.jpg?width=800&height=480,N,,2025-11-27 12:57:48.877428

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which oversees U.S. immigration, made the announcement on social media late Wednesday. The two Guard members from West Virginia were in critical condition after a 29-year-old man from Afghanistan shot them, officials said. The man, who was also injured, entered the United States in 2021 under a Biden-era immigration program for Afghans leaving their country after the government fell to the Taliban.

“Effective immediately, processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals is stopped indefinitely pending further review of security and vetting protocols,” the agency said on social media. “The protection and safety of our homeland and of the American people remains our singular focus and mission.”

Earlier in the evening, President Trump had said in a speech after the attack that “we must now re-examine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan.”

The immigration pause will impact Afghan nationals trying to remain in the United States by seeking asylum or obtaining a green card, among other immigration benefits extended by the agency.

It will also affect Afghans who helped the U.S. government during the 20-year war in Afghanistan and had applied to be relocated to the United States through the Special Immigrant Visa program.

Many applicants have yet to reach the United States and remain stranded in third countries or in hiding in Afghanistan. The Trump administration’s decision to accept no more than 7,500 refugees from around the world for the fiscal year that started last month will not help them.

“The S.I.V. program was one of the few remaining pathways” for Afghans seeking a way out of their country, said Mevlude Akay Alp, a senior staff attorney at the International Refugee Assistance Project, a nonprofit based in New York. “And it’s unsure if even this will continue.”

The Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, estimated in 2022 that there were nearly 200,000 Afghan immigrants in the U.S., with the biggest populations living in the Washington, D.C., and Sacramento, Calif., areas.

Resettlements of Afghans have been in free fall since the start of Mr. Trump’s second term. In 2024, roughly 3,100 Afghan refugees were resettled in the United States each month. From January to May of this year, those arrivals plummeted by nearly two-thirds.

In July, the Trump administration withdrew humanitarian protections for Afghans already resettled in the United States, citing Afghanistan’s “improved security situation and its stabilizing economy.”

More than half of Afghanistan’s 42 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance. More than two million have returned, often without savings or housing, after being expelled from Iran and Pakistan.

Afghanistan is also facing a looming conflict with neighboring Pakistan, which has hit its two largest cities and border areas with airstrikes in recent weeks.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/26/multimedia/26dc-shooting-live-afghan-immigration-pfhg/26dc-shooting-live-afghan-immigration-pfhg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 07:58:41.135425

ICE Tracker

We’re tracking immigration enforcement in Santa Cruz County.

Stay informed with the latest data.

ICE Tracker

SANTA CRUZ COUNTY >> Federal immigration agents entered the county at least 24 times since Jan. 25, including three visits last month, according to records of calls to local law enforcement.

As the first year of Donald Trump’s second presidency draws to a close, uncertainty remains about the local effects of a nationwide surge in immigration enforcement. To combat misinformation and fear, Santa Cruz Local is tracking federal immigration enforcement in Santa Cruz County with records of “courtesy calls” to local law enforcement.

Federal law enforcement will often, but not always, give a heads up when operations are planned to avoid potentially dangerous confusion if the agents are unknown to local police.

Santa Cruz Local is filing ongoing public records requests with all five law enforcement agencies in Santa Cruz County to keep track of these notifications from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or any other agency carrying out immigration enforcement. This tracker will be updated as records are provided.

What the records show

ICE visited Watsonville, the City of Santa Cruz, and areas of the county outside of cities eight times each between Jan. 25 and Oct. 25 this year, according to notifications to local law enforcement. Most notifications were in the early morning, between 5 and 5:30 a.m., and often ICE reported they were leaving the area by 10 a.m. Customs and Border Protection, the agency that includes border patrol, did not report any activity in the county.

Local law enforcement officials have said they do not cooperate with immigration enforcement and California law prohibits any such collaboration.

ICE officials often went to the same address multiple times, and said they were surveilling the area. On some occasions, separate teams of agents visited different areas of the county on the same day. The records don’t include information about who ICE is looking for, or if they arrested or detained anyone. Officials may have visited without notifying local law enforcement.

Agents were in groups of two to seven, with two to four cars. The cars range in make and model, but were often Hyundai, Nissan or Dodge models.

What to do if you see immigration enforcement or reports of immigration activity

How to prepare for immigration enforcement

Know your rights.

If approached by immigration enforcement:

You have the right to remain silent.

You do not have to open your door for immigration officials or law enforcement unless presented with a judicial warrant — that means it’s signed by a judge.

You have the right to see a lawyer before signing documents, although if arrested by immigration enforcement you do not have the right to a public defender.

Businesses have a right to decline immigration officers access to private areas, unless the agents have a judicial warrant.

Make a plan.

People at risk of immigration enforcement can plan for possible arrest, detention or deportation.

Memorize the phone number for an emergency contact, like a family member or attorney.

Ensure emergency contacts have your immigration number (A-number) to help find you if you are detained or arrested. An ICE locator can search for detainees by name or immigration number, but the information may be delayed.

Make sure a trusted friend or family number has copies of your documents in case of detention.

Parents can fill out a child care safety plan with details of who will care for their children in case a parent is arrested, deported or otherwise needs help.

Review our full ICE tracker, it will be updated each month.

St. Paul leaders respond to ICE operation

Big picture view:

Members of the St. Paul City Council are calling for an audit into the public cost of the police department's actions during the raid as well as an investigation into the department's adherence to the separation ordinance.

The separation ordinance prohibits local law enforcement from enforcing federal immigration law.

Council members say they also want an investigation into the St. Paul Police Department's use of force, which included pepper balls, less-lethal munitions and chemical irritants.

Dig deeper:

After a federal operation on Lake Street in June, the Minneapolis City Auditor found that Minneapolis officers did not violate the city's separation ordinance when they assisted with crowd control.

What they're saying:

St. Paul City Council Member Nelsie Yang, who represents Ward 6, where the raid happened, said the St. Paul Police Department must be investigated for its role during the raid.

""First and foremost, ICE has no place in our city. Second, I am deeply horrified by the way our Saint Paul police officers conducted themselves yesterday,"" Yang said. ""What we witnessed from SPPD was not reflective of our values in safety for all. It speaks volumes about the growth edges in SPPD and the need to act with humility by learning from our community about what fighting fascism looks like rather than being complicit in it.""

St. Paul City Council President Rebecca Noecker shared the following statement:

""Yesterday’s events raise serious concerns about the use of force by our police officers and the integrity of our separation ordinance. Every resident of Saint Paul, regardless of immigration status, deserves to feel safe and protected by local law enforcement. My colleagues and I are committed to a full, transparent investigation into what happened, including a review of adherence to our separation ordinance and SPPD’s use of force policies. We are committed to taking any steps necessary to strengthen oversight and accountability for the department.""

St. Paul City Council Vice President HwaJeong Kim says he was present during the operation and released this statement:

""I’m enraged by the lack of de-escalation and care by our Police Department. Yesterday, I witnessed our officers fire indiscriminately at the press and community members, injuring several. We were tear gassed, pepper sprayed in the face and hit with lower lethals. To be clear, ANY release of chemical weapons, especially in a residential neighborhood, should be banned regardless of whether it’s federal or local law enforcement. It’s also clear our separation ordinance and our use of force policy don’t go far enough in protecting residents. Demands for policy change, transparency, and accountability need to be acted on by this council. Time and time again, our police department has shown a clear disregard for residents and their right to protest. Their level of posturing and escalation is all too familiar to communities of color, activists, and organizers.""

St. Paul Police Federation response

The other side:

The St. Paul Police Federation shared the following statement:

""Yesterday morning, federal agents executing a warrant were assaulted, threatened, and blocked by a violent mob. They called us for help. We responded only to protest lives and restore order - nothing more. We do not do immigration enforcement. Never have, never will.

""A core of professional agitators refused every order, attacked officers with frozen bottles and rocks, damaged patrol cars, and shouted 'Don't let them leave.' Our officers while being assaulted, used the absolute minimum force necessary to end the threat and get everyone home safe.

""Not one rioter was seriously injured. Several officers were struck by projectiles, yet every one of them showed extraordinary discipline and courage.

""This is not about politics.

""This is about public safety.

""We are not your adversary.

""We are your police.

""When the next mob comes, please stand with us - not against us.

Our community deserves nothing less.""

Melvin Carter responds to ICE raid

Mayor statement:

St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter shared the following statement:

""The injuries sustained by journalists during Tuesday’s ICE-related incident are troubling. Reporters play a vital role in telling our community’s story with clarity and accuracy, particularly in moments when reliable information is scarce. When they are harmed while doing so, it jeopardizes public trust and the very freedoms our community deserves.

""The conduct we saw yesterday was jarring. I have directed a thorough review of all Saint Paul police body-worn camera footage be done in a timely manner to understand exactly what happened and ensure full transparency and accountability.

""Saint Paul must remain a place where transparency is valued, civil liberties are upheld, and those who document our community can do their work safely. I am committed to ensuring the safety of all members of our community.""

What's next:

St. Paul City Council members say they will formally initiate the separation ordinance and use-of-force investigations as well as the public cost audit during the raid during their next meeting on Dec. 3.

Those investigations will be carried out by the Police Civilian Internal Affairs Review Commission, council members say.

The backstory:

A large crowd gathered in a St. Paul neighborhood the morning of Tuesday, Nov. 26, amid a federal law enforcement operation that protesters believed was an ICE raid.

St. Paul Police Chief Axel Henry released an update via YouTube shortly after the operation. He said his department was made aware of federal agents working a detail on the 600 block of Rose Avenue, and were called to assist when protesters broke the perimeter made by federal agents. Various law enforcement officers intervened, so protesters could express their first amendment rights, and federal agents could do their jobs, the chief said.

Chief Henry added that reports indicated protesters were arming themselves with rocks and sticks. That prompted additional officers to respond to secure the scene.

Federal authorities involved included ICE agents and a U.S. Marshals task force. Protesters held signs and called out anti-ICE chants as investigators worked inside a home.

Agents were on the scene at least through 11 a.m. Tuesday, but cleared the scene starting around 12:30 p.m.

As they left, police used tear gas to clear protesters who were blocking vehicles in the street.

Homeland Security officials say they were working with a detail to arrest Victor Molina Rodriguez, a Honduran who had previously been deported. Rodriguez has previous convictions for domestic abuse and disorderly conduct. DHS officials say he committed a felony by illegally re-entering the U.S.

Shasteen said after his wife's arrest, the immigration officer then gave him a business card with a QR code.
“The law clearly allows her to file for a green card through a U.S. citizen spouse,” he said.
“I just feel like I lost another wife,” Shasteen said.","As ICE continues to arrest people in San Diego during their green card interviews, the final step in a legal pathway, some of the people taken into custody have been spouses of military members and veterans, including one who said he felt “betrayed” after serving for decades in the U.S. Marine Corps.

ICE has repeatedly said these arrests, which began Nov. 12, are for overstaying visas. But multiple immigration attorneys contend that’s never been an issue before, with an exception in federal law for direct relatives of U.S. citizens, including spouses, who are going through the green card process.

“I kind of feel betrayed, to be honest,” said Samuel Shasteen, a retired Staff Sergeant who said he spent 20 years with the Marines, including two deployments to Afghanistan. “We do everything that we can to protect and serve our country. And then they betray us by treating us like we've never done anything.”

Shasteen lost his wife to cancer in 2022. Months later, on a break from work, he says he walked into a coffee shop in downtown San Diego and saw Chanidaphon Sopimpa, who stitched his broken heart back together again.

“It kind of felt like there wasn’t a hole there no more. She just filled a spot, the void that was there,” Shasteen said.

His kids were wary at first, but Shasteen said that quickly changed and two years later, they were married. Originally from Thailand, he said she did overstay her visa, but they’ve been trying to get her green card since the wedding.

On Nov. 18, they had her final interview with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Shasteen said “everything seemed great” until the end, when ICE agents came in, handcuffed his wife and took her away as she cried.

“Any other time in U.S. history, it would have been approved,” said Shasteen’s attorney Derek Poulsen. “It really is just a straightforward case.”

""All aliens in violation of U.S. immigration law may be subject to arrest, detention and, if found removable by final order, removal from the United States, regardless of nationality,"" ICE said in a statement in response to previous inquiries on this tactic. ""ICE enforces immigration law against all unlawfully present aliens – criminal history is not a prerequisite for enforcement. Being unlawfully present in the United States is itself a violation of federal law. This activity reflects ICE’s renewed focus on executing final orders, addressing public-safety threats, and reducing absconder population consistent with law.""

Shasteen said after his wife's arrest, the immigration officer then gave him a business card with a QR code.

“She says, ‘Scan this, it will answer all your questions on what you need to do next,’ and I scanned it and it just made me more frustrated because it was just like ICE propaganda,” he said.

“When we do our immigration papers, it asks you if you’re military,” Shasteen continued. “Everything that you upload for documents shows you’re part of the military, or your service. So they know. It’s just – why are they doing it this way? I don’t know.”

His wife was taken to the Otay Mesa Detention Center. When he visits her, Shasteen says he wears a shirt showing his service and has had others come up to him and share that they’re in the military as well. Shasteen said he’s started a support group for the people he’s met in the same situation.

“To me, it kind of feels like a bond that I built with my fellow Marines when I was over in Afghanistan,” he said. “You know, we're out there to fight the enemy, and we come together no matter where we're from and fight.”

Immigration attorney William Menard said his client is Australian, the wife of a Navy veteran and was arrested the same way, the same day.

“He put a lot of work into representing this country, and we did everything the right way,” Menard said. “I could hear him kind of muttering like, you know, ‘I served the country’ and kind of, ‘This is what I get.’”

For them, some good news came Wednesday: an immigration judge ordered her released on bond. In a support letter to the judge, a friend wrote that she “admires this country, its opportunities, and its core values,” while another wrote that she “couldn’t be prouder to be married to a U.S. veteran and on her path to permanent residency.”

Menard said she is still eligible for – and they will continue to pursue – her green card.

“The law clearly allows her to file for a green card through a U.S. citizen spouse,” he said.

“You’ve got to wonder what eight days of detention, what purpose that served. I don’t know,” Menard continued, adding that he’s done these interviews for over 12 years and never before seen an arrest like this.

He and Shasteen both said the women have no criminal history.

“I just feel like I lost another wife,” Shasteen said. “It feels horrible, you know, I just felt like they ripped something from me again. And to feel that way is not really how I ever wanted to feel again.”

Shasteen said his wife has a bond hearing next month. As he waits, he said his son – who years ago, had to warm up to her – has been avoiding the house.

“He texted me to tell me, ‘Dad I'm sorry I haven't been home,'"" Shasteen said. ""And he told me what it was reminding him of, which was his mom passing, and he didn't want to be home because he doesn’t want to be in an empty house without her.”

“One of the hardest parts of this current situation is the parallels I see every time I lay my head down to sleep at night,” his son wrote a letter to support her release. “I lay staring at the ceiling feeling hopeless and praying that she is okay, the same way I did when my mother was in the ICU fighting for her life.”",https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2025/11/samuel-shasteen.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-11-27 03:56:45.333779

In the MAGA version of the immigration courts, there is no deliberation, there is only the inking and thumping of rubber stamps that say REMOVAL ORDER.
This isn’t even the first time that the DOJ has been found to use political litmus tests to hire immigration judges.
Immigration judges play a fundamental role in making these determinations, typically involving complex cases and sympathetic (but not always qualifying) stories on overwhelming deadlines.
Some judges have spent their career on the bench acting as deportation judges already.","After months of maliciously firing immigration judges whose adjudication records do not explicitly embrace the White House’s official position of hostility toward the American legal system, Trump’s Department of Justice is now actively recruiting lawyers who are willing to trade professional integrity for a chance at rubber-stamping deportation orders.

In the past few days, the DOJ began a hiring campaign for immigration judges featuring a new webpage, a not-so-subtle nod to the larger project of racial nationalism, and the egregious misrepresentation of immigration judges as “deportation judges.”

The subversion of whatever was left of our immigration system is punctuated by moments of symbolic clarity which are worth more than a passing offense. This is one of those moments.

The casual but informative falsehood that “immigration judges” are “deportation judges” is consistent with the debasement of our most serious democratic institutions and the politicization of our courts—but it’s more than that: it’s a constitutive misrepresentation, a lie that is not available for correction because it is not accidental and its intent is not simply to mislead or to reframe, but to accelerate and legitimize the reconstitution of the immigration courts as deportation factories and judges as mindless functionaries. This is not necessarily true of many immigration judges currently on the bench who remain and do their work with a deep sense of integrity and a commitment to rule of law, but this recruitment page says a lot about the next wave of hirings.

To call an immigration judge a “deportation judge” is to declare, at the outset, that the position requires not adjudication but preordination, and in doing so, entirely negates the term “judge” as a person who attempts to address heavy case-specific questions of facts and law in the form of an authentic decision. Only a lawyer who despises the law and resents the intellectual responsibilities that the legal profession appropriately imposes on them would be moved to apply now for such a shamelessly subordinate position. EOIR Director Margolin isn’t hiring judges—he’s hiring henchmen.

If the slippage in terms were accidental rather than intention, we might call it parapraxis, since it transparently discloses a more authentic version of how the Trump administration views immigration judges. The reconstitution of the courts is already visible in the data. Since January, the rate of asylum denials in court has risen to 80 percent—the highest national rate for which we have data. Many courts have higher local denial rates (e.g., Atlanta, Omaha, Houston), but usually these are balanced out at the national level by more liberal courts (e.g., San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles). They won’t be satisfied until everyone except white Afrikaners are denied asylum.

And it’s not just denial rates that matter, it’s also the volume of cases closed. Due to a deluge of new policies, immigration judges are shoveling asylum cases and other removal cases out the door with little attention to detail or due process, often so that those same immigrants can be arrested on the spot in court or shortly after while going about their everyday lives. This has resulted in the first major decline in the immigration court backlog since anyone has started tracking it, but it’s all at the expense of basic fairness and justice. As I wrote recently, it’s an asylum denial machine on steroids.

This is all by terrible design. For a small and willfully misinformed subset of society, immigration law has always been, and will always be, a mere technical operation with deportation as its only legitimate outcome. In the MAGA version of the immigration courts, there is no deliberation, there is only the inking and thumping of rubber stamps that say REMOVAL ORDER. To them, every deportation order is rightly decided and every asylum application granted is evidence of “fraud”—and no amount of empirical or logical evidence can complicate this doctrine for all the same reasons that cult members are unaffected by rational debate.

Like most things, Trump alone is not to blame for this predicament. Notwithstanding the institutional normalization of immigration judges since the 1970s, the independence, and therefore legitimacy, of the position of immigration judge has never been fully settled by Congress and never fully respected by the Executive. As the National Association of Immigration Judges have proclaimed, with admirable integrity and consistency, both Democrats and Republicans have toyed with immigration judges’ independence through a whiplash-inducing series of policy changes that shuffle court dockets around based on the political winds of the moment. This isn’t even the first time that the DOJ has been found to use political litmus tests to hire immigration judges.

And it’s not as if there haven’t been real solutions. The prospect of creating an independent court system has been on the table for years, most recently with Zoe Lofgren’s introduction of the “Real Courts, Real Rule of Law Act of 2024,” which would have potentially mitigated the DOJ’s ability to engage in politically motivated firing and hiring. An independent immigration court would not have solved all of the problems, and it would not necessarily have solved the backlog (which is all anyone seems to foolishly focus on), but it would have solved some of the more fundamental questions about the independence of the courts and would have partially insulated the courts from the kind of politicization that we see now. The fact that the legislation was too much for some people and too little for others prevented everyone from seeing it as an important and practical step in good governance. If we manage to hold onto democracy, the independence of the immigration courts is the kind of obvious next step we need to make happen so we can move on with this part of our collective lives.

Am I taking this DOJ job announcement too literally? Maybe. I am aware that the recruitment language smells like trolling, by which I mean, using the phrase “deportation judge” is, in part, intended as a kind of rage baiting that Trump and the MAGA base regularly deploy as a substitute to substantive public debate and critical thinking. For example, during the recent shutdown, government websites added banners that blamed Democrats (Hatch Act be damned) for the shutdown. And if you’re still wading in the cesspool formerly known as Twitter, you’ll know that official agency accounts have become fountains of misinformation, petty feuds, and unnecessary vitriol that has nothing to do with their mission and which undermines the professionalism of the civil servants who work there.

This precise example is just part of the takeover of our government’s digital infrastructure by a pathologically online class of rejects who have grown up idolizing YouTube conspiracy theorists, whatabouters, and sealioners who are incapable of sustained serious thought. The mini-Trumpers-slash-DOGE-tweens who, until recently, spent their pitiable young lives complaining about being rejected by women on Reddit and trolling in the comments of actual respected leaders, now run the social media accounts and official .gov websites of our major federal agencies, and, like the digital disease vectors that they are, are now infecting civil society with the same sycophantic behavior that could only ever achieve a dribble of acceptance in the putrid trenches of the MAGA movement. “Deportation judge,” they joked. “This’ll be hilarious.”

But it’s not funny. It’s quite serious. There are over 3 million people with pending removal cases in the immigration court system, and very many—if not most—of them came to the United States seeking humanitarian protection from conditions in the world that we, ourselves, helped to create in the first place. They did not all enter the country illegally even if they may well be ordered deported (the first is not a precondition for the second, as people often seem to forget). Their lives are worth deliberation, not premeditated dismissal.

Immigration judges play a fundamental role in making these determinations, typically involving complex cases and sympathetic (but not always qualifying) stories on overwhelming deadlines. I know many people who believe that to accept the robes and responsibilities of an immigration judge is to join the ranks of an institution that is fundamentally oppressive. That might be true. But after more than a decade of research on the immigration courts, I can also tell you that the immigration judges that I have come to know have helped me to understand their deep professional and personal commitment to delivering the best version of justice they know how within the constrained context of the courts. Some judges have spent their career on the bench acting as deportation judges already. But many judges view their position as one that requires that decisions of great gravity be met with great integrity.

The DOJ recruitment page for immigration judges undermines the integrity of the position both discursively, by belittling the position as a “deportation judge” (even if that is, in fact, what the administration is trying to do), and it sends a clear message that the performance standard for current and future judges is how many deportation orders they issue. This will be bad for the immigration courts and it will require drastic Congressional action at the next possible moment to undo the damage unfolding in front of us. In the short term, Congress should investigate these hiring practices.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0MwP!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe69ed1af-da6d-423a-8a49-02c4e4b62cde_1948x1472.png",N,,2025-11-27 07:58:44.192424

According to the lawsuit, the administration’s overhaul targets HUD’s Continuum of Care program, the primary federal pipeline that funds permanent supportive housing. As California Governor Gavin Newsom described in announcing his state’s participation in the suit, the administration is “slashing federal money for permanent housing and replacing it with transitional housing tied to work mandates or treatment requirements.”

According to the lawsuit, the administration’s overhaul targets HUD’s Continuum of Care program, the primary federal pipeline that funds permanent supportive housing. (TNND)

What States Say HUD Did Wrong

The suit, led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, argues that the administration violated federal law on several fronts. According to AG James’ office, more than $3 billion in federal homeless-services grants are at risk, potentially affecting over 170,000 people nationwide.

The complaint makes three core legal claims:

HUD exceeded its authority.

The rule violates the Administrative Procedure Act.

The administration infringed on Congress’s power of the purse.

The administration has defended the shift as part of a broader strategy emphasizing accountability and faster transitions out of homelessness. But the case now moves to federal court, where judges will determine whether HUD exceeded its authority.

Cities Crack Down With Camping Bans, But Do They Work?

A 2025 brief from the National Alliance to End Homelessness concluded that sweeps and camping bans do not reduce homelessness and often make it more difficult for people to secure stable housing. (TNND)

At the same time, the federal policy fight escalates, cities across the country have been rolling out new enforcement rules following last year’s Supreme Court decision allowing states to prohibit public camping. Curfews, encampment clearances, and expanded policing have now become more common and, in many places, have visibly reshaped streets and public spaces.

But experts say cleaner streets don’t necessarily mean fewer people experiencing homelessness.

A 2025 brief from the National Alliance to End Homelessness concluded that sweeps and camping bans do not reduce homelessness and often make it more difficult for people to secure stable housing. The brief cites repeated consequences: destroyed belongings, missed case-management appointments, and mounting fines or warrants.

Debate Over Housing First

The Trump administration has also sharply criticized the “Housing First” model, which prioritizes getting people into housing without requiring treatment or sobriety first. Critics argue the approach has been misapplied and turned into what they call “housing-only”, offering apartments but not enough mental health or addiction services.

A report from the Capital Research Center highlights California’s experience, pointing to a 47.1% increase in unsheltered homelessness after the state required all homelessness funding to go to Housing First programs between 2015 and 2019.

However, the report does not provide evidence that Housing First directly caused that increase.

Gretna police initially reported that five people had been detained, but ICE later clarified the number was four. According to ICE, one of the individuals was convicted for assault and another had a fraud charge.

The detentions occurred at the Home Depot at 62 Westbank Expressway. Cell phone footage shared on social media appears to show ICE agents running through the store in pursuit of a person. One video, posted by the Facebook page Impacto Informativo, shows agents moving quickly through what the page says is the interior of the store. Another clip, posted by the immigrant rights group Unión Migrante, shows agents attempting to restrain an individual outside.

In one video, officers can be heard yelling at a man recording them on his phone, telling him to move back 25 feet. But there is no 25-foot rule. State lawmakers passed a 25-foot buffer law in 2024, but a federal judge struck it down earlier this year, so it never went into effect.

“The law was written in such a way that… the average person couldn’t figure out what was illegal and what was legal,"" attorney Scott Sternberg told WWL's David Hammer. "" And 25 feet from an officer could be a balcony on Bourbon Street, or someone interfering with an arrest. It could be things we want to stop and also things that are not illegal.”

RELATED: Officers demand 25-foot buffer during ICE arrests. But that's not the law.

Gretna police told WWL they’ve already reminded their officers that no such law exists. Deputy Chief Jason DiMarco said the officer in the video insisted he wasn’t trying to enforce a 25-foot rule — he just thought the man recording was “trying to stir things up.”

“If you’re not doing anything wrong, you don’t have anything to worry about… We’re all around the area — the Gretna Police Department,"" DiMarco said. ""If you’re not doing anything wrong, you don’t have anything to worry about.”

Authorities stressed that the operation was not related to the “Swamp Sweep” enforcement action scheduled to begin on Dec. 1, which will involve Border Patrol agents. Wednesday’s operation involved only ICE personnel.

Home Depot said it had no prior knowledge of the enforcement activity. In a statement to WWL Louisiana, the company said: “We aren’t notified that immigration enforcement activities are going to happen, and we aren’t involved in the operations. We aren't coordinating with ICE or Border Patrol. We’re required to follow all federal and local rules and regulations in every market where we operate.”

Unión Migrante, which has been documenting immigration enforcement actions in the region, held a small press conference outside the store later in the afternoon. Volunteer Sebastián Piraban said the group was preparing for heightened enforcement expected in December.

“I know what’s coming — this storm on December first — it’s gonna be bad,” he said. “But we have to get ready, we have to do everything legally possible to help the vulnerable people of this community.”

Witnesses told local station WWL that they saw a person running beneath the Westbank Expressway before being taken into custody nearby. Gretna police said no criminal charges were filed in connection with the incident.

Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Wednesday that Kempsville High School assistant principal John Wilson Bennett and his older brother Mark Booth Bennett were overheard at a Vietnamese restaurant in Virginia Beach allegedly conspiring to go to Nevada and plan attacks on ICE agents in retribution for what they claimed to be “kidnapping[s]” of civilians during recent immigration enforcement operations.

“It’s chilling that a human being, much less a child educator, would plot to ambush and kill ICE law enforcement officers—offering such specifics as to getting a high-caliber rifle that would pierce the law enforcements’ bullet proof vests,” McLaughlin said, after Fox News Digital originally reported on the adult brothers’ arrest days ago.

“Thanks to Homeland Security Investigations and our partners, these men are behind bars.”

John Bennett has been faculty at the school, located in the inland part of Virginia Beach, since 2009. The school told local press that he is currently on leave.

McLaughlin said DHS worked with law enforcement at all levels after an off-duty Norfolk police officer overheard the men at a Vietnamese restaurant in Virginia Beach on Nov. 17 discussing plans to “kill police officers and ICE agents,” with Mark Bennett allegedly saying he was planning to meet like-minded people in Las Vegas, where he would also purchase firearms with explosive rounds.

Two days later, Mark Bennett was arrested at Norfolk International Airport en route to Charlotte-Douglas International Airport, to connect to Las Vegas. John Bennett was also arrested that day.

McLaughlin said the case is indicative of the more-than 1,150% increase in assaults against ICE agents and 8,000-fold spike in death threats as they go about their daily work defending the homeland.

“They risk their lives every single day to remove the worst of the worst, including murderers, rapists, pedophiles, terrorists, and gang members. From bounties placed on their heads for their murders, threats to their families, stalking, and doxxing online, our officers are experiencing an unprecedented level of violence and threats against them and their families,” McLaughlin said.

Happy O’Brien, Mark Bennett’s attorney, disputed the recounting of events, reportedly saying his client was instead flying to Nevada for a F1 (Formula One) motorsports event with his child, according to the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot.

O’Brien reportedly compared the restaurant conversation to something out of the NBC sitcom “Seinfeld” – where Jerry Seinfeld’s and Jason Alexander’s characters would often have varying degrees of existential conversations while having coffee at “Monk’s.”

“It’s chilling that a human being, much less a child educator, would plot to ambush and kill ICE law enforcement officers — offering such specifics as to getting a high caliber rifle that would pierce the law enforcement’s bulletproof vests,” Asst. DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “Thanks to Homeland Security Investigations and our partners, these men are behind bars,” said.

The Las Vegas area has not seen widespread ICE raids as in other cities. Over the summer, ICE increased its enforcement in the valley, increasing arrests and triggering the temporary closure of the Broadacres Marketplace.

DHS reported “a more than 1,150% increase in assaults against ICE officers,” though the department did not provide a time frame for the increase.

The population at three Nevada detention centers totaled 600 detainees as of Nov. 10, according to official data. 54% of detainees in Nevada were identified as “non-criminal,” according to the data. Most of the detainees – 97% — are men.

The number of detainees in ICE custody without criminal records increased by more than 2,000% since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term, according to CBS News, which analyzed the data.

“No country can tolerate such a risk to our very survival,” he said.

Trump’s remarks, released in a video on social media, underscores his intention to reshape the country’s immigration system and increase scrutiny of migrants who are already here. With aggressive deportation efforts already underway, his response to the shooting showed that his focus will not waver.

The suspect in the shooting is believed to be an Afghan national, according to Trump and two law enforcement officials. He entered the United States in September 2021, after the chaotic collapse of the government in Kabul, when Americans were frantically evacuating people as the Taliban took control.

The 29-year-old suspect was part of Operation Allies Welcome, the Biden-era program that resettled tens of thousands of Afghans after the U.S. withdrawal from the country, officials said. The initiative brought roughly 76,000 Afghans to the United States, many of whom had worked alongside American troops and diplomats as interpreters and translators.

It has since faced intense scrutiny from Trump and his allies, congressional Republicans and some government watchdogs over gaps in the vetting process and the speed of admissions, even as advocates say it offered a lifeline to people at risk of Taliban reprisals.

Trump described Afghanistan as “a hellhole on earth,” and he said his administration would review everyone who entered from the country under President Joe Biden — a measure his administration had already been planning before the incident.

During his remarks, Trump also swung his focus to Minnesota, where he complained about “hundreds of thousands of Somalians"" who are ""ripping apart that once-great state.”

Minnesota has the country’s largest Somali community, roughly 87,000 people. Many came as refugees over the years.

The reference to immigrants with no connection to Wednesday's developments was a reminder of the scope of Trump's ambitions to rein in migration.

Administration officials have been ramping up deportations of people in the country illegally, as well as clamping down on refugee admissions. The focus has involved the realignment of resources at federal agencies, stirring concern about potentially undermining other law enforcement priorities.

However, Trump’s remarks were a signal that scrutiny of migrants and the nation's borders will only increase. He said he wants to remove anyone “who does not belong here or does not add benefit to our country.""

“If they can’t love our country, we don’t want them,"" Trump added.

Afterward, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services announced it would indefinitely stop processing all immigration requests for Afghan nationals pending a review of security and vetting protocols.

Supporters of Afghan evacuees said they feared that people who escaped danger from the Taliban would now face renewed suspicion and scrutiny.

“I don’t want people to leverage this tragedy into a political ploy,” said Shawn VanDiver, president of #AfghanEvac.

He said Wednesday's shooting should not shed a negative light on the tens of thousands of Afghan nationals who have gone through the various legal pathways to resettling in the U.S. and those who await in the pipeline.

Under Operation Allies Welcome, tens of thousands of Afghans were first brought to U.S. military bases around the country, where they completed immigration processing and medical evaluations before settling into the country. Four years later, there are still scores of Afghans who were evacuated at transit points in the Middle East and Europe as part of the program.

Those in countries like Qatar and Albania, who have undergone the rigorous process, have been left in limbo since Trump entered his second term and paused the program as part of his series of executive actions cracking down on immigration.

Vice President JD Vance, writing on social media, criticized Biden for “opening the floodgate to unvetted Afghan refugees,"" adding that “they shouldn't have been in our country.”

“Already some voices in corporate media chirp that our immigration policies are too harsh,” he said. “Tonight is a reminder of why they’re wrong.”

The White House press secretary’s brother, Michael Leavitt, 35, had a relationship with Ferreira, 33, and they had a son, Michael Leavitt Jr, aged 11.
Ferreira’s sister, Graziela Dos Santos Rodrigues, told the outlet that the agents demanded her name and driver’s license, but Ferreira did not have an identification card.
Neither the record of Ferreira’s arrest record or how any charges were resolved were immediately available.
At the time, the newspaper said, Leavitt and Ferreira were engaged and their son was eight months old.","Karoline Leavitt’s nephew’s mother has been detained by US immigration agents in Revere, Massachusetts, as part of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

Bruna Ferreira, a Boston-area resident who migrated with her family to the US from Brazil as a child, is now in custody at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Louisiana, according to the Boston radio station WBUR, which first reported the arrest.

The White House press secretary’s brother, Michael Leavitt, 35, had a relationship with Ferreira, 33, and they had a son, Michael Leavitt Jr, aged 11.

Ferreira was leaving her home to pick up her son from school in New Hampshire when her car was “suddenly swarmed” by ICE agents, according to the Boston Globe. Ferreira’s sister, Graziela Dos Santos Rodrigues, told the outlet that the agents demanded her name and driver’s license, but Ferreira did not have an identification card.

“They were not the most gentle with her,” she told the Globe.

“I’m sure my sister was terrified, frantic. She’s been here since she was six years old. She’s more American than she is anything else. I’m sure she tried to just use whatever she could come up with in the moment. However, it didn’t really help very much.”

A White House source familiar with the situation said: “This individual is the mother of Karoline’s nephew and they have not spoken in many years. The child has lived full time in New Hampshire with his father since he was born. He has never resided with his mother.”

Separately, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson confirmed that “ICE arrested Bruna Caroline Ferreria [sic], a criminal illegal alien from Brazil. She has a previous arrest for battery. She entered the US on a B2 tourist visa that required her to depart the US by 6 June 1999. She is currently at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center and is in removal proceedings.”

They added: “Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, all individuals unlawfully present in the United States are subject to deportation.”

Tricia McLaughlin, the Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, said in a statement to WBUR that Ferreira had a “previous arrest for battery”.

Neither the record of Ferreira’s arrest record or how any charges were resolved were immediately available.

At a minimum, Ferreira’s detention and likely deportation has brought home the close or casual connections many Americans have to the administration’s immigration crackdown.

Leavitt, the 28-year-old New Hampshire native, is best known for her high-ranking role as Trump’s spokesperson. Leavitt began her career interning at Fox News in 2016 before serving in the communications office during Trump’s first term.

When Trump entered office for a second time in January, Leavitt made history by becoming the youngest-ever White House press secretary.

Less is known about her brother except that he won $1m in a DraftKings fantasy sports contest in 2014, according to The North Andover Eagle Tribune. At the time, the newspaper said, Leavitt and Ferreira were engaged and their son was eight months old.

In a statement to WBUR, Leavitt said: “My only concern has always been the safety, wellbeing, and privacy of my son.”

Ferreira’s attorney, Todd Pomerleau, told CNN that his client had been arrested on 12 November and was currently in the middle of a “lawful immigration process” for US citizenship.

Ferreira’s sister, Graziela Dos Santos Rodrigues, has now started a GoFundMe page to help with legal costs to fight the ICE charges and permit her sister to stay in the US.

Ferreira has maintained her legal status through Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), a program which grants temporary protection from deportation for those who entered the country as children, according to the post.

Ferreira has “followed every requirement, and has always strived to do the right thing”, according to her sister’s GoFundMe page. As of Wednesday morning, more than $16,000 has been raised.

“She is hardworking, kind, and always the first to offer help when someone needs it,” Dos Santos Rodrigues wrote. “Whether it’s supporting family, friends, or even strangers, Bruna has a heart that puts others before herself.”

The Associated Press reported on Tuesday that Daca recipients have been among those detained in immigration sweeps, although steps taken by Trump to end Daca during his first term were blocked by the supreme court.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e782ff34940ae6bcbae835c42f3ea2ff988eb1a3/407_0_4081_3264/master/4081.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=84f82b8b21eba0ed1012c8740024b1af",N,,2025-11-27 01:56:18.020610

Their deployment would be the latest development in a monthslong debate about the role of the National Guard in American cities to tackle crime.

Last week, a federal judge in Washington ruled that the president’s National Guard deployment appeared to violate the law.
The shooting on Wednesday was sure to inflame the debate about how Mr. Trump has used the National Guard as part of his crackdown on crime.","President Trump on Wednesday called for a crackdown on immigration and ordered 500 more troops to Washington after the shooting of two National Guard members patrolling the capital and the identification of an Afghan national as the suspect.

Mr. Trump posted a video shortly after 9 p.m. from Palm Beach, Fla., where he is spending Thanksgiving, describing the shooting as an “act of terror” and “a crime against humanity.” He called the suspect, whom people familiar with the investigation identified as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, an “animal” who shot the guard members “at point-blank range in a monstrous, ambush-style attack just steps away from the White House.”

Although many details about the shooting were still unknown by nightfall on Wednesday, Mr. Trump did not hold back. He used the attack to launch a broadside against immigration, saying the shooting “underscores the single greatest national security threat facing our nation” and vowing to redouble his mass deportation efforts.

He said the suspect had entered the country in 2021 as part of a program under President Joseph R. Biden Jr. that provided entry to Afghan nationals fleeing the Taliban takeover of their country after the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. troops.

“We must now re-examine every single alien who has entered our country under Biden,” he said.

The president described what he saw as the stakes in nearly apocalyptic rhetoric. He called Afghanistan “a hellhole on earth” and warned about Somali refugees in what he called “the once great state” of Minnesota, renewing a push he made last week to strip protections from them. “No country can tolerate such a risk to our very survival,” he said.

Still, it was not immediately clear exactly how he might change immigration policy as a result. Mr. Trump’s administration is already pursuing mass deportations and has taken steps to remove immigration protections for many Afghans.

More concrete was Mr. Trump’s request for hundreds more troops on the streets of the capital, in addition to the about 2,000 already there. Their deployment would be the latest development in a monthslong debate about the role of the National Guard in American cities to tackle crime. The Guard has traditionally been asked to provide humanitarian assistance when deployed domestically.

There is only one other city, Memphis, where troops are currently deployed; other cities are embroiled in court fights over whether troops can be deployed there. The Supreme Court is considering whether the president can deploy hundreds of National Guard troops in the Chicago area over the objections of state and local leaders.

Last week, a federal judge in Washington ruled that the president’s National Guard deployment appeared to violate the law. In particular, the decision found the combination of troops from a number of Republican states, assembled in Washington under central command, to be an unlawful use of the National Guard.

In her decision, Judge Jia M. Cobb blocked the deployment of the troops, who were scheduled to remain in the city until at least the end of February. But she stayed her own order, pausing it from taking effect until Dec. 11 in the interest of “orderly proceedings.” The Justice Department has appealed the ruling and sought emergency relief on Wednesday.

The shooting on Wednesday was sure to inflame the debate about how Mr. Trump has used the National Guard as part of his crackdown on crime.

Maj. Gen. William Enyart, a former adjutant general of Illinois — the Guard’s top officer in the state — said he was shocked that two Guard members had been shot near the White House.

“It is probably one of the safest places on this planet to be, so for two guardsmen to be murdered there — or shot and desperately wounded — in that location is really astounding,” said Mr. Enyart, who is a former Democratic congressman.

“I don’t want to see this turned into a political football,” he added, “which I’m afraid will happen.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/26/multimedia/26dc-trump-guard/26dc-trump-guard-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 00:56:41.164708

The lawsuit accuses immigration agents of indiscriminately arresting Latinos to meet the Trump administration's immigration enforcement goals without evaluating the requirements to legally detain them.

The judge said each of the plaintiffs had long-standing ties to their communities and no reasonable agent could have believed they were likely to flee before obtaining a warrant.

Under federal law, immigration agents must have probable cause to believe someone is in the country illegally and likely to flee before a warrant can be obtained, in order to arrest them without one, Jackson said.

Immigration agents are also required to document the reasons for arresting someone.

But Greene fired back, saying she was merely staying pure to the “America First” cause Trump had abandoned.
Other Republicans beyond Massie and Paul have downplayed the impact of Greene’s departure on the foreign policy debate — and made clear it is the president who does the most to drive the party’s direction.

Marjorie Taylor Greene’s (R-Ga.) abrupt decision to quit Congress could reshape the foreign policy debate among Capitol Hill Republicans as they grapple with the future — and the very meaning — of President Trump’s “America First” mantra.

Greene, perhaps more than anyone else in the Capitol, has personified the isolationist wing of the MAGA movement that propelled Trump’s political rise, and hers along with it. Few lawmakers cheered louder when Trump cracked down on immigration, attacked NATO, bashed his predecessors for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development as part of this year’s DOGE purge. She is a staunch critic of foreign aid, to include Ukraine and Israel, and has dubbed herself as “America Only.”

Those positions put Greene at odds with other Republicans who saw room in “America First” for “pragmatic” foreign interventions — not to mention the neocons of the old GOP order — but aligned her squarely with Trump’s pledge to shift U.S. policy away from foreign endeavors and focus instead on tackling domestic problems.

“I ran for Congress in 2020 and have fought every single day believing that Make America Great Again meant America First,” she said in the statement announcing her resignation.

In a stunning twist, however, it was tensions over foreign policy that caused the early cracks in the Trump-Greene alliance, as the Georgia firebrand spoke out loudly against the president’s decisions this year to strike Iran, bail out Argentina, send military aid to Ukraine, and continue to arm Israel even as the civilian casualties skyrocketed in Gaza. She was the only congressional Republican to dub Israel’s actions in Gaza a “genocide.”

Trump, in cutting ties with his onetime MAGA ally, called Greene a “raving lunatic” and a “traitor” for vocally criticizing his policies. But Greene fired back, saying she was merely staying pure to the “America First” cause Trump had abandoned. In Greene’s telling, she was simply pressing the president to make good on the commitments he’d made on the campaign trail — vows she said Trump had betrayed by continuing, and in some cases escalating, U.S. interventions overseas.

“My only goal and desire has ever been to hold the Republican Party accountable for the promises it makes to the American people and put America First,” she said in her resignation statement.

“If I am cast aside by MAGA Inc and replaced by Neocons, Big Pharma, Big Tech, Military Industrial War Complex, foreign leaders, and the elite donor class that can’t even relate to real Americans,” she added, “then many common Americans have been cast aside and replaced as well.”

Her exit means Capitol Hill will have one fewer Republican holding Trump’s feet to the fire when it comes to foreign policy endeavors — a role that will be left largely to Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), two isolationists who have also jousted frequently with the president over U.S. ventures abroad.

“This is not great news for our country,” Massie said of Greene’s decision to leave Congress.

With her resignation, Greene joins a long list of conservatives who sparred with Trump only to be pushed out of power — a demonstration that the president’s sway over the Republican Party remains enormous despite his diminishing approval ratings. But Paul warned this week that Trump is treading on thin ice as he eyes an aggressive foreign policy — moves that risk alienating his MAGA loyalists.

“If he invades Venezuela or if he approves significant arms sales [to Ukraine], … the rift with Marjorie Greene will pale in comparison to what happens to his movement,” Paul said in an interview with Reason Magazine. “If he invades Venezuela or gives more money to Ukraine, his movement will dissolve.”

Greene had repeatedly led amendments to cut foreign aid to Israel and Ukraine, helping to put her fellow Republicans on the record on the issue and sometimes getting dozens of House Republicans to vote along with her, such as on a July amendment to a Pentagon funding bill that would prevent funds from being used to aid Ukraine. On that amendment, 76 Republicans voted in favor.

But the amendment votes were often a futile effort, frequently failing — sometimes overwhelmingly — on the House floor. In July, a Greene amendment to cut funding to the Israel Cooperative Program that funds missile defense for Israel ended in a 6-422 vote, with Massie being the only Republican who voted with her.

That frustrated Greene, who lashed out at her GOP colleagues: “Both Republicans and Democrats refuse to stop sending your hard earned tax dollars to foreign countries,” she posted on X.

Other Republicans beyond Massie and Paul have downplayed the impact of Greene’s departure on the foreign policy debate — and made clear it is the president who does the most to drive the party’s direction.

“I never saw her as a big force in anything, whether it be domestic or foreign policy,” Rep. Mike Haridopolos (R-Fla.) said of Greene on Tuesday.

“As far as foreign policy, the person I look to is the president and, of course, my longtime friend Marco Rubio,” Haridopolos added, referring to the secretary of State.

And there is plenty of Republican support in Congress for taking a stronger, more active stance in foreign affairs — particularly on legislation imposing sanctions on countries helping enable Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) last week pledged to submit a discharge petition to force a vote on such legislation, following the Trump administration’s reported 28-point peace plan that was widely panned among some Republicans as a pro-Moscow proposal. U.S. officials have said the document is not the final offer and that it would likely change. Ukraine agreed to the core elements of the peace plan, a U.S. official confirmed Tuesday to NewsNation.

“A lot of us believe in Ronald Reagan, you know, peace and strength and standing up to a dictator that’s invading an innocent country. I mean, I have such moral clarity on this,” Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.), who is leading that effort with Fitzpatrick, told The Hill on Monday. “Not standing up to Russia is a terrible strategic mistake. I want our conference and Republicans to stand up and be clear about it.”

Greene’s resistance to foreign assistance and intervention as she’s gotten on the bad side of Trump has made her some strange bedfellows on the left, some of whom have expressed their appreciation for Greene in light of her resignation announcement.

Media Benjamin, the founder of left-wing peace activist group Code Pink, posted a video on X outside Greene’s office on Monday expressing appreciation for both the Georgian’s stances and a sign posted on her office door warning against foreign lobbying.

“While we can disagree with the congresswoman on all kinds of things, let’s remember, there are very, very few Republican officials who have stood up to the Israel lobby and have called out Israel for its genocide. And for that, we are grateful,” Benjamin said in the video.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/GreeneForeignPolicy_HouseTeam_Getty-Bloomberg_GraemeSloan.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-27 00:56:55.614569

""Age of 6, and they're calling her a criminal illegal alien.""
By then, she already had DACA, which you can't get if you're a criminal illegal alien, cause [of] its disqualifying factors for people who have crimes.""
The White House press secretary has not publicly commented on the case.","A Brazilian woman who had been living in the United States for most of her life is being held in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Louisiana as she fights deportation.

The woman, identified as 33-year-old Bruna Ferreira of Revere, Massachusetts, is the mother of the nephew of White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, according to official sources familiar with the case.

Ferreira's lawyer Todd Pomerleau said she was detained on Nov. 12 after leaving her home in Revere to pick up her 11-year-old son in New Hampshire. Pomerleau said ICE agents stopped her and detained her. She then was taken to Vermont before being moved to Louisiana.

The Department of Homeland Security said Ferreira overstayed a tourist visa and has a prior battery arrest — allegations Pomerleau disputes. He argues that Ferreira arrived in the U.S. as a child and later qualified for DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.

""She came here at 6 years old,"" said Pomerleau. ""Age of 6, and they're calling her a criminal illegal alien.""

He insists the government's claims about a visa violation are not correct.

""They're saying she violated a visa,"" he said. ""You can't violate a visa under the immigration laws until six months after your 18th birthday. By then, she already had DACA, which you can't get if you're a criminal illegal alien, cause [of] its disqualifying factors for people who have crimes.""

Ferreira shares custody of her son with Michael Leavitt, brother to Karoline Leavitt. A source confirmed the family connection, but said the two women have not spoken in years. The White House press secretary has not publicly commented on the case.

Pomerleau described the past relationship between Ferreira and Michael Leavitt as typical of many young couples.

""Like a modern family,"" he said. ""They're two people that were young and in love at one point. They were engaged to be married, and it didn't work out, like countless others.""

In a statement, DHS described Ferreira as ""a criminal illegal alien from Brazil"" and said she entered the U.S. on a B-2 tourist visa requiring her departure by June 6, 1999.

Her attorney disputes the agency's claims and said he has seen no evidence she ever committed a crime.

""Under the immigration laws, she's following the only processes that she has available to her, and I've seen no proof whatsoever that she has ever committed a crime,"" Pomerleau said.

Pedro Latorre, a church deacon who lives across from Ferreira's home, said the situation has been painful for many Hispanic families in the area.

""It's very painful for the family,"" he said, adding that fear has been widespread. ""I'm concerned because we know each other, and the problem is that ... people are afraid about this.""

Detained DACA recipients question their arrests Catalina “Xóchitl” Santiago Santiago, a 28-year-old activist from El Paso, Texas, was arrested in August despite showing immigration officers a valid work permit obtained through DACA.","Yaakub Vijandre was preparing to go to work as a mechanic when six vehicles appeared outside his Dallas-area home. Federal agents jumped out, one pointed a weapon at him, and they took him into custody.

Vijandre is a recipient of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program that has shielded hundreds of thousands of people from deportation since 2012 if they were brought to the United States as children and generally stayed out of trouble. The Trump administration said it targeted Vijandre over social media posts. The freelance videographer and pro-Palestinian activist described his early October arrest to his attorneys, who relayed the information to reporters.

His arrest and several others this year signal a change in how the U.S. is handling DACA recipients as President Donald Trump’s administration reshapes immigration policy more broadly. The change comes as immigrants have face increased vetting, including of their social media, when they apply for visas, green cards, citizenship, or to request the release of their children from federal custody. The administration also has sought to deport foreign students for participating in pro-Palestinian activism.

DACA was created to shield recipients, commonly referred to as “Dreamers,” from immigration arrests and deportation. It also allows them to legally work in the U.S. Recipients reapply every two years. Previously if their status was in jeopardy, they would receive a warning and would still have a chance to fight it before immigration officers detained them and began efforts to deport them.

In response to questions about any changes, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin issued a statement saying that people “who claim to be recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) are not automatically protected from deportations. DACA does not confer any form of legal status in this country.” DACA recipients can lose status “for a number of reasons, including if they’ve committed a crime,” she said.

McLaughlin also claimed in a statement that Vijandre made social media posts “glorifying terrorism,” including one she said celebrated Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, al-Qaida’s leader in Iraq who was killed in a U.S. strike in 2006.

An attorney for Vijandre, Chris Godshall-Bennett, said Vijandre’s social media activity is “clearly” protected speech. He also said the government has not provided details about the specific posts in court documents.

Vijandre is among about 20 DACA recipients who have been arrested or detained by immigration authorities since Trump took office in January, according to Home is Here, a campaign created by pro-DACA advocacy groups. The administration is seeking to end his DACA status, which could result in him being deported to the Philippines, a home he has not visited since his family came to the U.S. in 2001, when he was 14.

DACA has faced legal challenges

DACA survived the first Trump administration’s attempt to rescind the program when the Supreme Court ruled in 2020 that the administration did not take the proper steps to end it.

There have been other attempts to end the program or place restrictions on recipients.

This year, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling that would deny work permits for DACA recipients who live in Texas. The Trump administration recently presented its plans to a federal judge who is determining how it will work.

The administration also has issued new restrictions on commercial driver’s licenses that would prevent DACA recipients and some other immigrants from getting them. Last year, 19 Republican states stripped DACA recipients’ access to health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. And the number of states where immigrant students can qualify for in-state tuition has dwindled since the Justice Department began suing states this year.

“This administration might not be trying to end DACA altogether the way that they did the first time around, but they are chipping away at it,” said Juliana Macedo do Nascimento, spokesperson for United We Dream, which is part of Home is Here, the coalition keeping track of public cases of DACA recipients who have been detained.

Detained DACA recipients question their arrests

Catalina “Xóchitl” Santiago Santiago, a 28-year-old activist from El Paso, Texas, was arrested in August despite showing immigration officers a valid work permit obtained through DACA.

Days later, federal officers arrested Paulo Cesar Gamez Lira as the 28-year-old father was arriving at his El Paso home with his children following a doctor’s appointment. Agents dislocated his shoulder, according to his attorneys.

Both Santiago and Gamez Lira were held for over a month while their attorneys petitioned for their release.

Marisa Ong, an attorney for Santiago and Gamez Lira, said the government failed to notify either of her clients of any intention to terminate their DACA status.

“DACA recipients have a constitutionally protected interest in their continued liberty,” Ong said, adding that “the government cannot take away that liberty without providing some valid reason.”

DACA recipients can lose their status if they are convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanors like those involving harming others, driving under the influence or drug distribution, or three or more misdemeanors. They can also lose their status if they pose a threat to national security or public safety.

DHS claimed in a statement that Santiago was previously charged with trespassing, possession of narcotics and drug paraphernalia and that Gamez Lira was previously arrested for marijuana possession.

Ong said that when attorneys sought their release “the government presented no evidence of any past misconduct by either individual.”

Vijandre, the Dallas-area man who was arrested in October, remains in a Georgia detention facility. His attorneys say he received notice two weeks before his arrest that the government planned to terminate his DACA status but that he wasn’t given a chance to fight it.

“I think that the administration has drawn a very clear line and at least for right now, between citizen and noncitizens, and their goal is to remove as many noncitizens from the country as possible and to make it as difficult as possible for noncitizens to enter the country,” Godshall-Bennett, Vijandre’s attorney, said.",https://kfoxtv.com/resources/media/fbda0991-08d2-4a24-9e70-1cd2ca9a1e49-jumbo16x9_dacadreamerprotestjpg8395745ver10.jpg?1513864866033,N,,2025-11-26 21:57:41.775612

Meanwhile, the lawsuit claims that the Oct. 31 guidance from USDA should have marked the start of the 120-day period.
Starting in 2028, states must fund a portion of SNAP benefits if its payment error rate is equal to or greater than 6 percent this year or next.","Democratic officials in 21 states and Washington, D.C., sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) on Wednesday, alleging that it is “arbitrarily” excluding many lawful permanent residents from receiving food assistance benefits.

The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Eugene, Ore., says the USDA is unlawfully implementing guidance for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) eligibility under the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) Act.

The sweeping budget legislation, signed into law by President Trump in July, enacted significant changes to SNAP. It expanded work requirements to groups previously exempt from them, changed eligibility for noncitizens and enacted penalties for noncompliance by states.

The federal government funds the program monthly, while states administer SNAP benefits. The USDA issued new guidance in accordance with the OBBB on Oct. 31, one day before the end of the 120-day exclusionary period for states to adhere to the changes.

The changes to the program restricted SNAP eligibility to three groups of noncitizens: lawful permanent residents, Cuban and Haitian entrants and those lawfully residing in the U.S. from Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau.

Lawful permanent residents are only eligible for SNAP benefits after a five-year waiting period, given they meet other requirements.

However, the lawsuit filed on Wednesday alleges the USDA is misinterpreting the new eligibility provisions of the law, which did not bar “individuals who once held the status of refugees, individuals granted asylum, or parolees from gaining eligibility for SNAP” if and when they become lawful permanent residents.

Meanwhile, the lawsuit claims that the Oct. 31 guidance from USDA should have marked the start of the 120-day period. Instead, USDA is arguing that July 4, when Trump signed the OBBB, is when that time frame began.

Starting in 2028, states must fund a portion of SNAP benefits if its payment error rate is equal to or greater than 6 percent this year or next.

In sum, the changes to SNAP eligibility and the rollout of guidance “has caused significant confusion” for states, which “have been asked to implement new substantive, erroneous limitations on SNAP eligibility, many of which could not have been anticipated as they diverge from the text of the OBBB, in 24 hours.”

The plaintiff states have asked the court to stay and vacate the guidance from USDA.

A spokesperson for the USDA said Wednesday that it “does not comment on pending litigation,” but directed The Hill to the Justice Department.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/AP25300778196167-e1761934676866.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-26 23:56:43.667724

The latest updates include inquiries from federal contractors, including one made on behalf of ICE.

As first reported by the Capitol Chronicle, Solv LLC, an environmental consulting firm based in Virginia, emailed the Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development asking procedural questions about an environmental assessment required by both state and federal law for major coastline projects.

The email inquiry, obtained by KATU through a records request, notes in the signature that it is being made on behalf of ICE. The inquiry does not specify what type of project the assessment is for.

In a video post on social media made Tuesday, Newport Mayor Jan Kaplan also announced more federal inquiries.

""We confirm today that Team Housing Solutions has called multiple hotels up and down the coast, as recently as this morning, looking for as many as 200 hotel rooms for a year,"" he said in the video.

Records previously obtained by KATU show Team Housing Solutions, a Texas based federal contractor had, on Nov. 4, asked the city about leasing space at the Newport airport.

The Department of Homeland Security, which houses both U.S. Coast Guard and ICE as federal agencies, owns a landing pad at the airport that it has used for the USCG rescue helicopter.

On Nov. 10, when Kaplan first went public with concerns about the potential for a detention facility, he pointed out that the relocation of the rescue helicopter to North Bend had been clue number one.

In 2014, when the USCG had intended to remove the helicopter, it had notified the community well in advance. This time leaders and advocates for commercial anglers say there was no notification about the relocation.

Newport nonprofit Fishermen's Wives and Lincoln County sued to have the helicopter brought back in 2014. Members of the state's congressional delegation ultimately succeeded in passing legislation to keep the helicopter there temporarily. The same parties filed a similar lawsuit, first reported by KATU, on Nov. 21.

PAST COVERAGE: Tears, frustration & fear from 800+ attending Newport meeting on potential ICE facility

In a win for the Newport nonprofit and Lincoln County, a federal judge on Monday granted a temporary restraining order telling USCG to bring the helicopter back. The order lasts two weeks.

""We were excited about (the ruling). Happy. It's a good start. We have a really long fight in front of us and we realize that it's, especially for our small group, we're just nine strong as far as the women on our board,"" said Taunette Dixon, a board member and spokesperson for the nonprofit, during an interview with KATU on Tuesday.

Kaplan said Tuesday the helicopter had been spotted back in the community, though it was unclear whether it was refueling or there as a result of the judge's order.

Kaplan also said a U.S. Customs and Border Protection helicopter landed in Newport to refuel and seemed to insinuate in his social media video post that there may have been ulterior motives for the stop.

""It's important to note that since our airport has fuel, the FAA requires us to provide fuel to any aircraft that lands at our airport. The pilot of the helicopter told our staff that they tried to refuel in Tillamook, but there was no one at the airport, so they flew here for fuel,"" Kaplan can be heard saying in the video. ""It's also important to note that there are seven airports in Oregon with fuel options that would have been closer than Newport.""

Kaplan goes on to list recent job postings for immigration detention officers in the area, the most recent of which he says was made on Nov 19.

Since Time Magazine launched the TIME100 Next list six years ago, an extension of its annual 100 Most Influential People list, it has served as a pedestal for individuals who are on the come-up in their respective fields.

“While we’ve made it our mission to cover people who have reached the pinnacle of their fields, the TIME100 Next is an opportunity to recognize those still on the rise,” Time Editor in Chief Sam Jacobs wrote in an editorial accompanying this year’s list.

Published on Sept. 30, the 2025 iteration of the TIME100 Next list features short pieces about each member of this year’s class.

The list, which Time magazine described as “The World’s Most Influential Rising Stars,” is divided into sections including “Innovators,” “Phenoms,” “Artists,” “Leaders,” and “Advocates.” It includes actors, authors, musicians, business owners, athletes, CEOs and philanthropists from around the world who the magazine deems worthy of recognition.

Included among those influential individuals on the list is a Valley attorney who has devoted his career to immigrant and human rights.

Efrén Olivares, who practices law in McAllen, made the 2025 TIME100 Next list — a recognition that he said came as a surprise.

“I didn’t apply,” he said. “It’s not something that one applies to. They just select people.”

He said that he first became aware that he was being considered when representatives from the magazine reached out to his colleagues at the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy organization where he currently serves as vice president of Litigation and Legal Strategy.

It was in September that the magazine contacted his colleagues to inform them that he had been selected.

“I thought just being considered for it was already itself an honor, but when once I found out that I had gotten it, I was just very excited, both for myself and also for the issues that I work on,” Olivares said. “It’s a recognition that the work for immigrants rights and defending the rights of immigrants, especially in this moment, was being looked at and recognized by the magazine. I was very excited about that.”

Olivares was recognized in the “Advocates” section with a brief essay written by Kerry Kennedy, daughter of Robert F. Kennedy and president of the RFK Human Rights nonprofit advocacy organization.

“For years, Efrén has championed human dignity. He’s defended families cruelly separated at the U.S.-Mexico border,” Kennedy wrote. “Through his work at the National Immigration Law Center, he’s stopped the midnight deportation of unaccompanied children denied fair court hearings. And as our co-counsel, he’s battling a federal plan to force immigrants to report for registration as a prelude to detention and deportation.

“He isn’t just a brilliant lawyer. He’s an example of the principles we’re fighting to protect.”

Olivares was born in Allende, a town located about three hours southwest from the Rio Grande Valley in the Mexican state of Nuevo León. He said that he’d spent most of his childhood in Allende with the rest of his family.

It wasn’t until he was about 9 years old that circumstances led to his family having to seek opportunities elsewhere.

“I was living in Mexico, and most of my family was in Mexico, and I was planning to live my life in Mexico,” he recalled. “When I was nine, my dad just ran out of work. He couldn’t find work anymore. Like so many adults in Mexico in the 90s, after NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement) was enacted, he ran out of work. He had been a truck driver for most of his life, so he came to the U.S. looking for work, and he found a job as a school bus driver at Valley View in Pharr.”

Olivares said that his father had a visa allowing him to move to the country because his grandfather had been born in the United States. While his father lived and worked in the U.S., eventually earning his citizenship, Olivares had to stay behind in Mexico with his mother and his siblings.

It would be four years before they too were able to join his father and move to the United States.

“I came in when I was 13,” he recalled. “I was supposed to go into eighth grade, but I didn’t speak English, so they kept me down a year. I went into seventh grade at Valley View. That’s where I graduated from high school.”

After graduating from Valley View High School in 2001, Olivares became the first member of his family to attend college.

He attended the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, an experience that he described as a culture shock.

“When I moved to the Valley, most people spoke Spanish. The food was not that different. The music was not that different,” Olivares said. “Then I got to Philly, and I was like, ‘Whoa, this is the rest of the U.S.’”

Olivares graduated in 2005 with a degree in philosophy, politics and economics. He then attended Yale Law School, where he graduated in 2008.

“When I went to law school, I wanted to be involved in human rights work,” Olivares said. “I thought I wanted to specialize in Indigenous people’s rights. And in fact, the first human rights job that I got was exactly about that. It involved the rights of Indigenous peoples in the Americas, in Guatemala and Peru, Colombia, Brazil. That was the work that I was doing.”

After a few years, Olivares returned to the Valley where he began working with the Texas Civil Rights Project in December 2013.

A few months after returning to his home in South Texas, Olivares found himself at the center of a human rights crisis as the first influx of unaccompanied minors from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador began arriving in the Rio Grande Valley.

Many local entities scrambled to provide support for the large volume of children arriving in the area by providing food and shelter. It was then that Olivares decided to offer his services as well by focusing his attention on immigration and border-related issues.

“I went to law school driven by this conviction to provide the best possible legal representation to those who can least afford it,” Olivares said. “I am a firm believer that the outcome of a case or an issue should not depend on how much you are able to pay your lawyer. It should depend on the merits of the issue and the injustice that has been perpetrated. That’s what I’ve been trying to do my entire career — be the best possible lawyer I can be for folks who cannot afford to pay anything.”

As the issues surrounding the border evolved over time, so has Olivares’s career. Through his law practice, he has found himself navigating the constantly evolving border issues, from border wall issues to family separation issues.

Many of his experiences were captured in his 2022 book, “My Boy Will Die of Sorrow: A Memoir of Immigration From the Front Lines.”

His book details Olivares’s first-hand accounts representing hundreds of immigrant families, parents who were separated from their children as a result of zero tolerance during the summer of 2018. Those stories are told alongside his own experience of being separated from his father while he worked in the United States.

The 302 page memoir earned Olivares the 2023 International Latino Book Award in the Raul Yzaguirre Best Political/Current Affairs Book category.

Despite the eye-opening accounts captured in Olivares’s book, it is only one chapter in a book that is constantly being rewritten as immigration and border-related issues continue to evolve. And through it all, Olivares remains in the eye of the storm.

When asked why those issues continue to be at the forefront of many political agendas, his answer was simple, “bigotry.”

“Politicians look for a scapegoat. They look for somebody to blame in the face of problems; the economy is not doing well, or you’ve got COVID, or rising prices, lack of jobs, any issues that all countries face for different reasons,” Olivares said. “They just point the finger, and they happen to point the finger at the most vulnerable people in our communities who happen to be, by and large, Black or brown. I think that is what’s driving this sentiment.”

With the work never ceasing, Olivares was still able to take a moment to reflect on his recognition in the magazine — an accolade that he described as surreal.

“It’s honestly hard to believe that,” he said. “Here I am, this kid from Allende who went to public school in Mexico, and just kind of had to migrate to another country. I’m just doing my work and trying my best at it.”",https://myrgv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/112625.EFREN_OLIVARES.jm_.001.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 19:56:54.318938

In a statement, the Homeland Security Department announced the Haitian TPS cancellation — which is a tacit assertion on the Trump administration's part that conditions inside Haiti have improved sufficiently for Haitians to return there.

""After consulting with interagency partners, Secretary (Kristi) Noem concluded that Haiti no longer meets the statutory requirements for TPS.

""This decision was based on a review conducted by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, input from relevant U.S. government agencies, and an analysis indicating that allowing Haitian nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is inconsistent with U.S. national interests.”

The Haitian TPS termination takes effect on Feb. 3, 2026.

But the move — which affects about 500,000 Haitians in the U.S. — contradicts numerous assessments about gang control and violence in Haiti.

That plague — which last year resulted in more than 5,600 people murdered and has turned more than 1 million Haitians into homeless refugees in this decade — has not improved but has in fact worsened, they say.

A big fear is that Haitians who lose TPS and are deported back to Haiti will only end up adding to those throngs of displaced people in the country.

Haiti's gangs, including the large confederation known as Viv Ansanm, already control 90% of the capital, Port-au-Prince amid the country's government vacuum.

(A nine-member Temporary Presidential Council is currently trying, with little success, to arrange desperately needed new elections there.)

This month the U.N. issued a new report that warns how the gang takeovers and terror are now expanding beyond Port-au-Prince throughout the country's interior. Gang killings are track to exceed 6,000 this year.

TPS, which was created by Congress and is renewable every 18 months, allows migrants from countries torn by disasters or political violence to remain in the U.S. until it is deemed OK for them to go back.

TPS for Haitians was created in the wake of Haiti's catastrophic 2010 earthquake, which killed at least 200,000 people.

READ MORE: Port-au-Prince is about to fall to gangs. So is it 'crazy' to send Haitians back to Haiti?

Since President Trump took office again last January, he has pushed a campaign to cancel TPS renewal, not only for Haitians but Venezuelans and several other migrant nationalities, as part of his anti-immigration America First agenda.

Federal judges this year have blocked the administration from revoking Haitians' TPS before it was legally scheduled to end. But it's uncertain if the courts can stop its cancellation when the February renewal expires.

As a result, say Haitian-American immigration attorneys like Frandley Julien of North Miami, the Haitian community here had been bracing for Wednesday's decision.

""They know exactly what's happening here,"" Julien told WLRN.

""They just have to separate the administration's lie [about conditions in Haiti] from the reality that they know too well — how bad it is back home.

""Even so, this news of the TPS termination is devastating for them — especially since, true to form, the administration announced it on the eve Thanksgiving, as if to inflict as much emotional damage as possible to the community.""

Trump was also accused of anti-Haitian racism during last year's presidential campaign, when he publicly pushed the lie that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were eating residents' pets.

Either way, the DHS announcement warned that if ""you are an alien who is currently a beneficiary of TPS for Haiti, you should prepare to depart if you have no other lawful basis for remaining in the United States.""

It also advised those Haitians that they can use DHS's CPB Home mobile application to facilitate their ""self-deportation,"" and that they are eligible for free airfare and a $1,000 exit bonus.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2aaf59f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+8/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa6%2F3c%2Ff10f2bc3452a88e05a08e9c8359f%2Fap24266804069230.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 18:57:10.845465
