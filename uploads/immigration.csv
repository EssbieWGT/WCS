There have been growing tensions between federal law enforcement and the public in immigration courts as federal agents are tasked with making more arrests. Over the last five months, ICE has increased its footprint inside immigration courthouses, which are operated by the Justice Department. The agents' presence and arrests in courthouses, particularly in New York, have resulted in conflicting mandates and instances of explosive anger, as NPR previously reported.

In August, as NPR and a court observer — an immigrant advocate — entered the hall, federal enforcement brushed past. The agent, who was unmasked and had been sitting in the waiting area earlier, yelled at NPR: ""stop f****** following me! Why are you f****** following me?"" before turning and yelling the same thing at the court observer.

""It's not f****** about you!"" she retorted.

As they turned the corner, more shouting could be heard.

""Don't f****** touch me,"" the court observer yelled. ""Why are you pushing me? Why are you shoving me? I am not following you!""

It’s the latest chapter in the convoluted legal battle over Trump’s efforts to slash foreign aid.
At that time, the justices rejected the president’s request that nearly $2 billion in blocked foreign aid payments remain frozen in a 5-4 decision.","The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to allow the Trump administration keep frozen billions of dollars in foreign aid that is set to expire next week, the latest turn in a lengthy legal saga over the congressionally appropriated funds.

The emergency intervention came at the administration’s urging to lift a lower court’s ruling ordering it to spend $4 billion in funds approved for aid programs by Sept. 30, its expiration date.

The unsigned order indefinitely extends the pause on U.S. District Judge Amir Ali’s injunction that was put in place earlier this month by Chief Justice John Roberts, who handles emergency appeals from the nation’s capital by default, as the high court considered the appeal.

The court gave a brief explanation of its reasoning, saying that the government “at this early stage” made sufficient showing that the lawsuit is precluded under the Impoundment Control Act and that the plaintiffs can’t force the government to pay up.

The court also said that the asserted harm to Trump’s foreign policy powers appeared to outweigh potential harm faced by the respondents.

“This order should not be read as a final determination on the merits,” the order read. “The relief granted by the Court today reflects our preliminary view, consistent with the standards for interim relief.”

Justice Elena Kagan wrote in a dissenting opinion joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson that the application raises “novel issues fundamental to the relationship between the President and Congress.”

Solicitor General D. John Sauer had argued that letting Ali’s injunction stand would force the administration to obligate the money at “breakneck speed,” even as Trump has proposed cancelling the aid to Congress.

The president’s proposal is known as a “pocket rescission,” a rare and legally murky bid to avoid spending appropriated money by asking Congress to cut the budget late into the fiscal year. It means the 45-day window lawmakers have to act on the request could be cut short by the budget year’s end, leaving the funds to expire. If lawmakers reject the request, the funds must be released.

Kagan wrote that the “stakes are high,” pinning down the central issue as the allocation of the power of the purse between the president and Congress. She criticized the majority for granting any emergency relief with the weighty issues at play.

However, the administration’s outrage amounts to “the price of living under a Constitution that gives Congress the power to make spending decisions through the enactment of appropriations laws,” she argued.

“If those laws require obligation of the money, and if Congress has not by rescission or other action relieved the Executive of that duty, then the Executive must comply,” the justice wrote. “It cannot be heard to complain, as it does here, that the laws clash with the President’s differing view of ‘American values’ and ‘American interests.’

“That inconsistency, in other words, is not a cognizable harm, to be weighed in the equitable balance,” she continued. “It is merely a frustration any President must bear.”

Roberts’s temporary order only paused Ali’s injunction as it pertained to the funds subject to Trump’s Aug. 28 rescission proposal to Congress.

Global health and aid groups challenging Trump’s efforts to freeze the funds rejected the notion it would interfere with Congress’s decisionmaking to make the government pay up.

“Any emergency is of the government’s own making, as it has been under an obligation to spend the appropriated funds for specified purposes since at least March 2024,” the plaintiffs’ response to the government’s emergency application read.

Trump paused about $30 billion in foreign aid in one of his first acts back in the White House, prompting the groups to swiftly file suit.

About $10.5 billion of the total $30 billion is set to expire Sept. 30, but the government planned to obligate $6.5 billion of those funds by the deadline, Sauer said. That left the roughly $4 billion in play.

“The President can hardly speak with one voice in foreign affairs or in dealings with Congress when the district court is forcing the Executive Branch to advocate against its own objectives,” Sauer wrote in the government’s request for a stay.

It’s the latest chapter in the convoluted legal battle over Trump’s efforts to slash foreign aid.

Though the plaintiffs only sued in February, the case reached the Supreme Court for the first time in March. At that time, the justices rejected the president’s request that nearly $2 billion in blocked foreign aid payments remain frozen in a 5-4 decision.

Last month, a panel of U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit judges found the challengers did not have standing to bring their lawsuit, striking down Ali’s ruling ordering the administration to spend billions in aid work.

That ruling was later amended, which left a pathway for the plaintiffs to ask for a preliminary injunction on different legal grounds. After that, Ali granted a new preliminary injunction, the subject of this appeal.

The Trump administration’s appeal of that ruling yielded a 2-1 decision from the appeals court in the plaintiffs’ favor, prompting the emergency application to the justices. Roberts issued his administrative stay earlier this month.

Our congressional correspondent, Lisa Desjardins, and White House correspondent Liz Landers are here with the latest.
Geoff Bennett: That's right.
We tried to find what those contingency plans would look like, and from a lot of the major federal agencies, we didn't see any updated contingency plans.
Geoff Bennett: All right, Lisa Desjardins, Liz Landers, our thanks to you both.","Amna Nawaz:

The White House is threatening to use a looming government shutdown to drive mass layoffs at federal agencies.

Geoff Bennett:

And that's with the funding deadline that lawmakers appear almost certain to miss just days away.

Our congressional correspondent, Lisa Desjardins, and White House correspondent Liz Landers are here with the latest.

So, Liz, we will start with you.

Last night, the OMB director, Russ Vought, he told agencies to prepare shutdown plans that include permanent layoffs? What more do we know?

Liz Landers:

We obtained this memo late last night. It was sent over by the Office of Management and Budget.

And, in it, it says that they are preparing for a potential shutdown. And some of this is normal and they have had some planning calls apparently about this week. And there's some politics in here, some finger-pointing that the administration is doing, Democrats, in particular, saying that they are inching closer to a shutdown over a series of insane demands, including a trillion dollars in new spending.

But this note goes farther, and what it suggests is that the agencies could use this moment to do mass layoffs. It says: ""Agencies are directed to use this opportunity to consider reduction in force.""

And, as you know, Geoff, this agent — this administration, I should say, has really relied on these RIF notices, these reduction in force mechanisms, to really slim down the federal government in the last seven or so months of the Trump administration.

Geoff Bennett:

That's right. And we should make clear that the threat of permanent cuts is new. How do these agencies typically prepare for a possible shutdown?

Liz Landers:

So it's normal for an agency to put out a contingency plan, and they usually post those on a Web site. And the White House currently has some of this up right now, saying that agency contingency plans for a lapse in appropriations are hosted on each agency's Web site.

We tried to find what those contingency plans would look like, and from a lot of the major federal agencies, we didn't see any updated contingency plans. So, basically, what that means right now is, we don't know who is going to be deemed an essential worker who keeps the government functioning, critical issue — critical functions of the government that we need, who may be furloughed, and who may be part of this reduction in force.

So, right now, federal employees around the country are waiting to find out if they are impacted by this RIF or not.

Geoff Bennett:

Yes, lots of confusion.

So, Lisa, you have been talking with your sources on the Hill, as well as the unions that represent federal workers. How do they see this threat of mass layoffs by the Trump administration?

Lisa Desjardins:

Somehow, we yet again are in uncharted territory. And you're right. Federal workers are right in the middle of it.

So, talking to the largest union for federal employees, which is the American Federation of Government Employees, they put out this statement they sent to me and to others, saying that: ""The only path forward is compromise. Federal employees are not bargaining chips.""

And that gets to this idea of RIFs being on the table. They see RIFs as patently illegal. Now, the argument there, talking to a former official with the Office of Personnel Management, is that the law governing shutdowns says that, when you're shutting down, H.R. for each agency is only supposed to be doing shutdown activities, figuring out who stays and who goes, and that a permanent RIF is not a shutdown activity.

What it is, is reorganizing government. And that's the argument this is illegal. Now, in reality, as we have seen the Trump administration do, they will make their argument that he has that power and they will wait for courts to act, which will take much longer.

Meanwhile, federal employees who have been promised to be paid after shutdown now have a new concern, which is that they could lose their jobs entirely. Now, I also want to mention about Democrats, where they are all with this federal workers being in the crosshairs moment. They right now are saying this is an intimidation scheme. It's not changing their strategy for the shutdown.

But, privately, some Democrats admit they are worried that maybe some aspects of a shutdown could lead to worse consequences, things they don't want to happen for government.

Geoff Bennett:

So let's talk more about that. Where do things stand? Because the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, was on this program last night. He described President Trump as derelict in the way that he's going about handling all of this. Is either side budging? It appears they're not.

Lisa Desjardins:

Yes, this is a high-stakes game of chicken right now. And what we're seeing is Democrats actually emboldened, because they think Republicans have made some missteps, including the president canceling not meeting with them.

Today, we saw Hakeem Jeffries, the House Democratic leader, again go in front of microphones. He is trying to make a statement here by having news conferences every day at the Capitol saying, hey, I'm here. I'm ready to meet.

Now, in reality, also, Republicans have canceled not just the first couple of days of session next week, but all of next week. I spoke to a Republican member tonight. And I said, aren't you nervous about not being in town during the shutdown? He said, no, I don't think voters are going to care after this is over.

That's the risk that Republicans are taking. I also want to walk people through, because this is a lot to talk about, a basic 101 of what is needed to avoid a shutdown, because it hasn't happened yet, right? So, first of all, the first thing obviously is the House majority has to pass a funding bill. That has happened. House Republicans passed that bill.

Now, this is what Democrats have rejected. And the Senate needs to have 60 votes to pass a funding bill. Now, they're eight votes short right now of getting that done. So that's really where the holdup is. That's where Democrats have leverage, because you don't need a lot of Democrats, but you do need more than they have right now.

Where are we with the shutdown? I'm sticking with my 80 percent chances. They could maybe have a short-term funding bill, but no one's even discussing it right now.

Geoff Bennett:

Yes.

And quickly back to something you said, Lisa. House Republicans, they canceled the session for next week. What reason did they give?

Lisa Desjardins:

They said they don't think there's any reason to come back once they have passed their bill for funding, and they're leaving it up to the Senate. They're really just trying to jam Democrats in the Senate. But they say, we have done our job. They need to do theirs.

Geoff Bennett:

All right, Lisa Desjardins, Liz Landers, our thanks to you both.

Lisa Desjardins:

The conflict over several hours is the latest pushback by federal authorities against protesters focused on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Broadview, about 12 miles west of Chicago, amid a surge of immigration enforcement that began early this month.

Agents repeatedly fired chemical agents toward protesters after some of the group attempted to block a car from driving down a street toward the ICE building. The pepper balls and tear gas canisters went into the entire crowd, most of them standing far back from the fence and not blocking any traffic.

Protesters fell to the ground and ran as agents repeatedly fired, dispersing most of the crowd of dozens.

In previous weeks, protesters had also tried to block agents’ vehicles from moving in or out of a yard next to the building. A fence installed Tuesday pushed Friday’s demonstrators farther away.

Earlier in the morning, a handful of protesters yelled and rang bells at a section of the fence closer to the building. Agents shot the first round of pepper balls Friday morning toward protesters using ribbons to tie handwritten messages of support for detainees onto the fence, including “No human is illegal,” and “We stand with you! You are not illegal!”

Protesters and agents yelled expletives at one another when federal immigration agents pulled signs and flags off the fence surrounding the building.

Bushra Amiwala, a 27-year-old elected official on the Skokie Board of Education, said she was shot by pepper balls while tying notes on the wall, causing her to cough and have trouble breathing.

“They caught us so incredibly off guard,” she said as remnants of the white powder clung to her pants and hijab. “We literally were just tying notes on the wall.”

Amiwala called the use of chemical agents “fully unprovoked.”

Village officials have demanded the “illegally built” fence be removed over security concerns from the fire department. It remained in place Friday.

It was not immediately clear if anyone was arrested.

The superintendent of the largest school district in Iowa has been detained by federal immigration officials. Superintendent Ian Roberts of Des Moines Public Schools was detained Friday morning by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), according to a message to the district from DMPS Board Chair Jackie Norris.

Norris said the district has not confirmed why Roberts was detained or what ""next potential steps"" will be.

According to a listing of detainees on the ICE website, Roberts is being held in Pottawattamie County Jail in Council Bluffs, although a jail employee said Roberts is not located there. The website lists his country of birth as Guyana.

Roberts was named superintendent in 2023. A district profile states he was born to immigrant parents from Guyana and grew up in Brooklyn, New York.

Per board protocol, DMPS Associate Superintendent Matt Smith will serve as interim superintendent until further notice. Norris said the district will share more updates as they confirm more information.

The following email was sent to the district shortly after 12:20 p.m.

""On behalf of the Board of the Des Moines Public Schools, I wish to share information of immediate importance to the DMPS community.

The email was signed by Jackie Norris, DMPS board president.

Who is Ian Roberts?

Roberts was hired as the superintendent of DMPS in July 2023. When he arrived, he faced a slew of challenges. The district was divided over the actions taken by the previous superintendent, Thomas Ahart, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, DMPS kept students and staff out of buildings longer than most other Iowa school districts during the pandemic.

Roberts oversaw the completion of the district’s 4,000-seat Mediacom Stadium, which was a collaboration with Drake University. All five of the district’s high schools compete there. Roberts also expanded the district’s Montessori preschools beyond Cowles Elementary School in Windsor Heights.

He has been leading the Reimagining Education campaign, a five-year plan that “outlines major changes and improvements designed to strengthen student outcomes” in the district.

In terms of district challenges, Roberts has been tasked with managing an ever-tightening budget, which includes closing several school buildings. Another one of his goals is to raise algebra proficiency rates among Black males.

Before coming to DMPS, Roberts was a track and field athlete who competed for Guyana in the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Roberts is known to challenge DMPS students to footraces, often dressed in his signature suits with matching pocket squares. He frequently tells reporters that he enjoys reading, writing, running and hunting—especially Iowa’s deer.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8946c21/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1620x851+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2Fd8%2F54e3e59b4c95b3651c718cf8fea4%2Fdr-ian-roberts.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 15:56:40.211992

“Over the past month and a half, plain-clothed, masked, and armed federal agents have flooded the streets of the nation’s capital, indiscriminately arresting without warrants and without probable cause District residents whom the agents perceive to be Latino,” says the complaint.

The complaint was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the ACLU of D.C., the National Immigration Project, and others, on behalf of the plaintiffs.

In August, President Trump declared a crime emergency in D.C., despite record-low rates of violent crime. During that press conference, Trump made numerous misleading statements about the prevalence of crime in the city, and announced that D.C. will “no longer be a sanctuary for illegal alien criminals.”

“We will have full, seamless, integrated cooperation at all levels of law enforcement, and we’ll deploy officers across the District with an overwhelming presence,” he said.

A few days later, on August 15, Attorney General Pam Bondi directed D.C.’s mayor to use local resources to assist with “enforcement of federal immigration law,” including “locating, apprehending, and detaining aliens unlawfully present in the United States.”

Between the time of the emergency declaration and September 9, more than 40 percent of the arrests in D.C. were for alleged civil immigration violations, more than any other cause for arrests, according to the suit. The complaint says that federal officers have indiscriminately targeted anyone who appears Latino, including one person who was taking the trash out and another who was walking out of a grocery store.

Agents abducted one resident when he was on his way to dialysis treatment, according to the groups’ press release announcing the lawsuit. He was detained for over eight hours, without food or his medication.

“They ignored my U.S. driver’s license and left me without critical treatment that day, putting my health in immediate danger,” he said in a statement. “Since then, I have lived in fear that I could be torn from my family and deported to a place where I cannot get the medical care I need to survive.”

All four of the individual plaintiffs in the case were abducted by federal agents who did not have warrants for their arrest.

José Escobar Molina, who has had Temporary Protected Status (TPS) since 2001, was taken by federal agents as he was about to get into his truck and start his work day.

“The agents immediately handcuffed Mr. Escobar Molina, grabbed him by the arms and legs, and called him ‘illegal’ repeatedly,” the suit says. “When he responded that he has ‘papers’ (in other words, immigration status), they replied, ‘No you don’t. You are illegal.’”

After they put him in a vehicle, he told them again he had “papers.”

The driver reportedly yelled at him, “Shut up, bitch! You’re illegal.”

He was detained overnight and released the next day after a supervisor realized Molina had valid TPS.

Federal agents abducted another plaintiff, identified in the complaint as N.S., as he sat in his car in a Home Depot parking lot after he finished shopping.

“The agents pulled N.S. out of the driver’s seat, threw him against the car, handcuffed him, and provided him a clear bag in which to place his belongings, before placing him in the back of a van,” the complaint says.

N.S., who has a pending asylum application, was detained for almost four weeks in detention centers around the country until he was released on his own recognizance.

“His knee is swollen due to being shackled for several hours at a time and sitting on several long flights as he was repeatedly transferred while detained,” the complaint says. “He is unable to sleep through the night. He is scared to walk outside or drive and has stopped driving his grandchildren and youngest son to school.”

In another case, a plaintiff identified as R.S.M. and her husband were driving to work when federal agents surrounded their car. They detained R.S.M for about 10 hours, and released her with an ankle monitor. R.S.M. has a pending asylum application.

Trump’s emergency order expired on September 11, but “mass immigration stops and arrests in D.C. are continuing,” the complaint says.

After D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said local police would stop cooperating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) once the emergency declaration expired, Trump lashed out at the mayor, who he had previously praised for her cooperation.

“It has been a beautiful thing to watch but, now, under pressure from the Radical Left Democrats, Mayor Muriel Bowser, who has presided over this violent criminal takeover of our Capital for years, has informed the Federal Government that the Metropolitan Police Department will no longer cooperate with ICE in removing and relocating dangerous illegal aliens,” Trump posted on Truth Social.

“If I allowed this to happen, CRIME would come roaring back. To the people and businesses of Washington, D.C., DON’T WORRY, I AM WITH YOU, AND WON’T ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN,” he continued. “I’ll call a National Emergency, and Federalize, if necessary!!!”

Most of the city’s residents, however, are opposed to the president’s takeover. In August, D.C. resident Sean Dunn, who threw a sandwich at a federal agent, became a folk hero, and a grand jury refused to indict him.

“Fuck you! You fucking facists!” he allegedly yelled before throwing the sandwich. “Why are you here? I don’t want you in my city!”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/09/2025-9-26-free-dc-protest.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 13:56:50.258443

The exchange was captured on video. It starts in the hallway.

A man who officials say had just attended an immigration hearing is seen standing with his family, holding his daughter's hand, when ICE agents tell him to let go of the girl.

""Let go of the girl, you're being detained,"" one is heard saying.

It wasn't clear why the man was being detained or why, specifically, he was at Federal Plaza.

His wife, Monica Elizabeth Moreta, then links arms with her husband, her daughter sandwiched between them. She said if her husband had to go, she and her daughter would go too. The agent dismissed her.

Meanwhile, the husband is heard in the background pleading his case, saying, ""I didn't do anything wrong.""

A tussle breaks out as federal agents try to pry the family apart. The husband is eventually pried away, his daughter left crying. As the husband is taken away, video soon shows his wife tussling with ICE agents.

At times, she yells, ""Let me go!"" as her daughter stands nearby. Then an agent in a plaid shirt and baseball cap is seen lifting her and carrying her to a room. The children are ushered in, while their mother repeatedly yells, ""No."" The door is then slammed closed, blocking out the cameras.

The video then cuts to the wife and that same plaid-shirted agent, now standing near an elevator bank. He repeatedly yells, ""Bye!"" as she tries to talk to him. At one point, the woman says, ""My hair was pulled. You don't care about anything.""

Suddenly, the agent lashes out, shoving the woman backwards, into a wall, and down onto the floor, then yells at her while she is on the ground. He yells for people to get her out of the building.

Moreta went to the hospital afterward. She's expected to be physically OK. Later, Moreta told reporters she came to the U.S. after being ""nearly killed"" in her home country and had to go into hiding. Moreta says she thought her family would be protected in America.

At an ICE protest Thursday night, City Comptroller and activist Brad Lander says he was in 26 Federal Plaza, which houses the New York immigration court and an ICE processing site, when the incident happened but he didn't witness it. Lander says seeing the video is enough.

""We are here in non-violent, non-cooperation to what ICE is doing, but every day there’s violence in that building being perpetrated by ICE agents,"" Lander said. ""Whatever your point of view on immigration, watch that video.""

The incident was caught on camera Thursday at an immigration court in New York City - sparking outrage amid growing concern across the country about ICE's increasingly aggressive tactics in arrests of immigrants.

""The officer's conduct in this video is unacceptable and beneath the men and women of ICE. Our ICE law enforcement are held to the highest professional standards and this officer is being relieved of current duties as we conduct a full investigation,"" ICE Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Friday.

CNN has asked ICE to clarify what ""relieved of his current duties"" means - and whether the officer is still employed elsewhere within ICE.

In one video of the incident shared on social media, a woman and a girl are seen clinging with locked arms to a man, reportedly the woman's husband, who is being detained, in a hallway of 26 Federal Plaza, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement District Office in Lower Manhattan.

One masked agent grabs her hair as someone says, ""Just grab her, grab her and pull her away."" Moments after separating the woman and the man, she is removed from the hallway into a nearby room.

It's unclear how long she stayed in the room.

The video resumes with her in the hallway speaking to a federal agent, saying in Spanish, ""You guys don't care about anything!"" The agent says, ""Adios, adios,"" as the woman pleads and motions her hands towards the agent.

The agent grabs the woman and forces her several feet down the hallway, into a wall. He then continues shoving the woman down the hallway and pushes her to the ground.

The agent then stands over her and says, ""Leave!"" in Spanish, and asks nearby officers to remove her from the building.

Several videos shared by other news outlets captured the interaction from different angles. In one video, court security officers were seen escorting the woman from the scene.

The federal building in Manhattan, where the interaction took place, has become the epicenter of immigration crackdown efforts in New York City. It is home to an immigration court, the FBI's New York field office and other federal agencies, and has been a place ICE agents routinely apprehend migrants after court appearances.

Rep. Dan Goldman, a Democrat whose district includes the courthouse, said in a statement on X that the woman - whom he identified as Monica - and her two young children ""fled to my office for safety after she was assaulted.""

He called on Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to ""take appropriate disciplinary action and implement measures to prevent this from happening again."" ICE falls under DHS.

Brad Lander, the city comptroller and frequent ICE critic who has previously been arrested for trying to prevent the agency from arresting migrants, said on X he was at the plaza when the incident took place.

""An ICE agent violently threw this bereft woman to the ground in front of her kids,"" he wrote. ""She had not touched him. She did not pose any threat. She had to be taken to the hospital.""

CNN has reached out to DHS, Goldman and Lander.

The masked ICE agents did not identify themselves, did not present a warrant and did not give any lawful grounds for detaining the man, Lander said.

""Regardless of motive or targets, we must condemn political violence,"" he wrote. ""But let's be clear: every day, masked ICE agents are acting violently against our neighbors, illegally abducting them, holding them in cruel and inhumane conditions. Treating them as less-than-human, and not deserving due process.""

The Democratic nominee for New York mayor, Zohran Mamdani, called the incident ""sickening"" in a post on social media.

The woman, speaking to reporters after the interaction, said: ""Over (in Ecuador), they beat us there too. I didn't think I'd come here to the United States and the same thing would happen to me.""

By the time of the Constitutional Convention, there was a clear consensus that the legislative branch would have the power of the purse.
The Anti-Deficiency Act reiterates that the executive branch cannot make spending decisions outside of what is authorized by law.
Third, the challenged executive orders violate the separation of powers by usurping Congress’s authority over spending and appropriations.
The Fourth Circuit should reject President Trump’s attempt to seize Congress’s power of the purse.","This case is about whether our Constitution, which grants the power of the purse to the people’s representatives in Congress, allows the President to unilaterally impose conditions on federal funding not found in any law. The answer is no.

Yet shortly after taking office, President Trump issued an executive order commanding federal agencies to “immediately take appropriate steps to ensure that institutions receiving Federal research or education grants end” gender-affirming medical care for people under the age of nineteen. That order built upon another, which proclaimed that “[f]ederal funds shall not be used to promote gender ideology.” Together, these orders resulted in a sudden and devastating shutdown of medically necessary care for children and teenagers across the country experiencing gender dysphoria.

Advocates for LGBTQ families, health care professionals, and parents of young people receiving gender-affirming care challenged the administration’s actions in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, which granted a preliminary injunction blocking the unlawful conditions. The government appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. In September 2025, CAC filed an amicus brief in the Fourth Circuit in support of the plaintiffs. Our brief made three principal points.

First, the Framers gave Congress control of appropriations and spending to guard against the risk of a tyrannical president. They took pains to deny the President the sweeping powers that the King of England had historically enjoyed, such as the power to spend without Parliament’s approval. By the time of the Constitutional Convention, there was a clear consensus that the legislative branch would have the power of the purse. In the Taxing and Spending Clause, the Framers granted Congress the affirmative power to raise revenue and to spend funds, while the Appropriations Clause limits the executive, stating that “[n]o Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.” The text of the Constitution is clear that the executive branch cannot make an end-run around the legislative process, including in the realm of spending and appropriations.

Second, for hundreds of years, Congress has passed federal legislation guarding its control of the purse. Since the earliest days of the Republic, when the Tenth Congress passed the Purpose Statue requiring appropriations to be “solely applied to the objects for which they are respectively appropriated,” Congress has made clear that the President cannot disobey its spending decisions. The Anti-Deficiency Act reiterates that the executive branch cannot make spending decisions outside of what is authorized by law. And after President Richard Nixon unlawfully refused to spend billions of dollars in federal appropriations, Congress passed the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (ICA) to create special procedures the President must follow to seek congressional approval for delays or cancellations of federal funding. Recently, in response to the first Trump administration’s efforts to withhold foreign aid, Congress strengthened the ICA with new transparency requirements.

Third, the challenged executive orders violate the separation of powers by usurping Congress’s authority over spending and appropriations. Though Congress has the exclusive power to attach conditions to federal funding, it may delegate that authority to the executive branch through a statute. In this case, however, there is no statutory delegation, so the executive orders are lawful only if authorized by the Constitution itself. And, as discussed above, the Constitution requires that appropriations be “made by Law,” which is to say, through the constitutionally prescribe process of bicameralism and presentment. The President may not use an executive order to make an end-run around that process. To the contrary, the Constitution requires that the President “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,” even when he disagrees with those laws or thinks they should say something that they simply do not say.

The protesters are upset about the immigration crackdown in and around Chicago.

The Border Control Commander Greg Bovino posted these pictures of immigration agents patrolling the Chicago River on Thursday.

Demonstrators continue to clash with federal agents once again near the Broadview ICE processing facility.

Protestors moved to 25th Avenue, where they are trying to block federal vehicles from entering and leaving the facility. That's already led to some pretty tense moments.

At one point, heated protesters tried to block a federal immigration SUV as they hit the hood and yelled at the driver trying to reach the Broadview ICE processing facility.

""This is not the type of action our law enforcement agencies, whether local or federal, should be conducting on US soil,"" demonstrator Roger Lonergan said.

Army veteran Roger Lonergan has demonstrated here for weeks. Lonergan said he's serving his country once again not in the military, but alongside these protestors.

""This is really what standing up for democracy looks like,"" he said. ""It's not always putting on uniforms and going overseas.""

Near the intersection of South 25th Avenue and Harvard, demonstrators could be seen gathering down the street near gates leading to the Broadview facility.

At some points a chemical gas was deployed among the crowd to disperse the protesters.

""There are people that know they are there that want to fight for due process and think this is wrong and a lot of illegal actions and unknown conditions inside,"" demonstrator Sue said.

Federal agents installed tall gates on Beach Street to block demonstrators from reaching the entrance.

The move was not deterring passionate protestors from making their voices heard. Some even wrote phone numbers on their arms in case they are detained.

""People are getting brought in and we don't know where they are going and being driven miles and miles away without a way to get home,"" demonstrator Akeisha Lee said. ""People are getting pulled in for hours and we can't track them.""

Friday's demonstration comes one week after demonstrators and federal agents clashed literally right outside the Broadview immigration facility.

Berwyn woman Holly Graham came out in support of local and federal law enforcement.

""I Like the flag that is half an American flag and half a Mexican flag,"" Graham said. ""I think that that's appropriate. But I also think that people should be following the rules and if that's the immigration rules, that's what it is.""

Curtis Evans was there when what is believed to be tear gas was deployed.

""People are very brave here today because they know the violence they saw last week, so there is a deeper sense of what they are up against,"" Evans said.

Veronica Escobar (D-Texas) accused the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement of stonewalling lawful congressional oversight at the new Camp East Montana detention center on Fort Bliss, raising alarms about what she called “illegal” obstruction and dangerous conditions inside the still-unfinished facility.

MIGRANT INSIDER is sponsored by

In a sharply worded letter Friday to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, Escobar said her staff’s September 23 inspection visit was abruptly canceled—less than 24 hours after being confirmed—under the vague justification of “operational tempos.” She warned that the move violates Section 527 of federal law, which guarantees members of Congress access to detention facilities for oversight.

“This is an unacceptable response from an agency that is currently in violation of the law and illegally barring Members of Congress and their staff from their oversight duties,” Escobar wrote.

The El Paso congresswoman, who has been a leading critic of Trump administration detention policies, detailed a pattern of ICE obstruction since Camp East Montana opened in August. Initial tour requests were denied on alleged safety grounds, even as migrants were already being held on-site. During visits that did take place in August, Escobar and her staff reported rotting food, foul drinking water, insufficient medical care, and broken communication systems.

Her account matches a Washington Post investigation earlier this month documenting at least 60 federal standards violations, including detainees without access to functioning toilets, sinks, or adequate space, and staff failing to monitor medical conditions.

Escobar’s office says it has 21 unanswered case inquiries with ICE about detainees at the facility and has yet to receive responses to formal questions submitted on September 3. Among them: staffing levels as the camp scales to 5,000 beds, details of food vendors, water safety testing, and why detainees’ legal calls routinely go unanswered.

The congresswoman has set deadline of October 3 for DHS and ICE to respond.

The Biden administration’s Camp East Montana, described by advocates as “Alligator Alcatraz in the desert,” has quickly become a flashpoint in the immigration wars. For Escobar, who represents El Paso, the issue is personal:

“My staff and I observed serious issues… detainees told us about being served rotten food and raised urgent concerns over the quality of the drinking water, which they reported had a bad smell and made them feel sick,” she wrote.

Broadview ICE protest

What we know:

The protests began around 7 a.m. at two locations near the facility, including Beech Street and 25th Avenue. Some demonstrators surrounded an ICE vehicle as it tried to reach the building, prompting agents to deploy pepper spray and bring in a military-style vehicle.

At least 50 protesters were seen midday Friday at the facility. An ICE spokesperson told Fox News that two were arrested, one of whom was carrying a firearm.

Parts of 25th Avenue were temporarily locked down as gas lingered in the air and officials prevented access to the area.

Bushra Amiwala, a congressional candidate who joined the protest, said she was struck by pepper pellets while attaching signs to a security fence.

""The residue that comes up makes it incredibly difficult to breathe,"" Amiwala said. ""There was nothing provoked on our side. The three of us were literally signing on the fence and we were the direct targets of the shooting.""

Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss, who was also present, said agents fired without warning.

""We were standing here with a group of people literally doing nothing,"" Biss said. "" There was no disturbance. There was no chaos. There was no effort to move a car in or out. They just shot at us as though for sport. They are trying to dominate and intimidate, and we are not going to be intimidated.""

Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson has warned that use of the facility could last 45 days and might disrupt nearby businesses and emergency routes.

Dig deeper:

One of those being held at Broadview ICE facility is Laura Murillo. She was detained Thursday morning near a BP gas station at 47th Street and Western Avenue in the city's Back of the Yards neighborhood, according to her fiancé, Jaime Perez.

Murillo is originally from Tamaulipas, Mexico but has lived in the U.S. for more than a decade, Perez explained.

He shared that Murillo often sells tamales on that corner, but on Thursday, he received a frantic call from her at 7:32 a.m.

""She was being detained and there was somebody behind her,"" Perez said. ""I told her to hold on, that I was going to come to her, I’m only a few blocks away but traffic was so bad and all I kept hearing her saying was, ‘You’re hurting me, you’re hurting me.’""

Perez told FOX 32 that Murillo does not have a criminal record. Since her arrest, he learned she is being held at ICE’s processing facility in Broadview.

INSKEEP: NPR congressional correspondent Barbara Sprunt.","STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

We are four days away from a government shutdown.

A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:

And a memo from the White House promises to punish federal workers if that happens. The Trump administration is threatening large-scale layoffs if Democrats don't provide the necessary votes to avoid a shutdown. We don't know exactly which jobs would be targeted or how many federal workers could lose their jobs, but the deadline to come up with a solution is fast approaching.

INSKEEP: And NPR congressional correspondent Barbara Sprunt will be covering whatever happens. Barbara, good morning.

BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning, Steve.

INSKEEP: OK. So this is kind of a departure from the normal shutdown scenario where the government says, we're going to increase the pain. What prompted this?

SPRUNT: Well, there's a line in the memo that I think is telling here, essentially saying, we're hopeful that Democrats in Congress don't trigger a shutdown, and then this won't be necessary. So I think this is partly aimed at making any funding lapse as difficult as possible for Democrats.

INSKEEP: Got it.

SPRUNT: Normally in a shutdown, you know, agencies furlough federal workers temporarily until a deal is brokered and a stopgap funding bill is passed. This is next-level. It's instructing agencies to look for workers to fire permanently, people whose work is not consistent with the president's priorities.

INSKEEP: How are Democrats responding?

SPRUNT: Well, they view it as an intimidation tactic to get them to accept the continuing resolution that House Republicans passed that would fund the government through November 21. I spoke with Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, about this yesterday. Here's what he had to say.

CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: This is nothing less than Mafia-style blackmail. Essentially, the president is threatening to fire dedicated federal employees who have nothing to do with the ongoing political and policy dispute.

SPRUNT: Meanwhile, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer says that if these firings do go forward, he suspects they'll eventually be overturned in court.

INSKEEP: Although we've learned when the president fires someone, even if a court finds illegality, it's difficult to reverse the firing, so we'll see. Is anybody talking about getting a deal out of this?

SPRUNT: Well, top congressional Democrats were supposed to meet with President Trump yesterday at the White House, but the president canceled that meeting, saying it would be pointless to meet because Democrats, in his view, are making unreasonable demands.

INSKEEP: Which are what?

SPRUNT: Well, Democrats want to roll back some Medicaid changes that were part of the big tax and spending bill that the president signed earlier this summer, and they want to extend tax credits from the Affordable Care Act that are set to expire at the end of the year. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries has said a verbal agreement that comes in any sort of negotiation isn't enough. Democrats want to address these issues in written legislation. Here he is yesterday.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

HAKEEM JEFFRIES: We're able to sit down any time, any place with anyone, not hard to find. I'm here in the Capitol, willing to go to the White House at any time in order to have that conversation.

SPRUNT: But, you know, Steve, yes, this is about the shutdown. It's a very real possibility, and it would have very real consequences for people who rely on certain services and workers who might find themselves without a job permanently. But this is also about an ongoing conflict between the White House and Democrats in Congress who feel the administration has continued to overreach in its authority and diminish the legislative branch's power of the purse. So yes, this memo is unprecedented, but it also very much follows the administration's philosophy that we've seen play out again and again this year.

INSKEEP: Well, Barbara, I hope you're ready for a busy few days here.

SPRUNT: Looking forward to it. Thanks, Steve.

Even before the new fees, only a limited number of employers would hire student visa holders.","An astronomical hike on visa fees for highly-skilled workers will impact an important industry in Florida: higher education.

When Donald Trump announced last week that applying for an H-1B visa would now cost $100,000, much of the focus was on the tech industry, which heavily relies on this category of foreign workers.

But federal data shows that in Florida, universities, colleges and schools in the state employ thousands of workers on H-1B visas. That includes professors, researchers and staff.

A Miami Herald analysis of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services data found that in the last five years, Florida universities and schools have had 2,589 workers with H-1B visas in the educational services category.

One-quarter of them are from the University of Florida, and 13 percent are University of Miami employees. Other top sponsors include Florida State University (236), Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (217); University of South Florida (207); and Florida International University (111).

That tally excludes renewals, job changes, petitions involving multiple employers and other circumstances. When those categories are factored in, the number of approvals for H-1B visas in the educational services category in Florida jumps to 4,709 in the same time period.

“Universities will most certainly take a hit from this policy change,” said Bruce Baker, a University of Miami professor who studies education policy and funding.

One international student enrolled at FIU from India who studies business analytics, said the fee increase will likely prevent him from working in the United States after graduation. He’s on a student visa right now, but like many other foreign-born students, he hopes to explore work opportunities here after graduation. Even before the new fees, only a limited number of employers would hire student visa holders. The new application costs are another hurdle amid an already challenging job market.

“It’s ten times the price, it’s absolutely mind-blowing,” said the third-year student. The visas have historically cost between $2,000 and $5,000 in fees paid to the U.S. government. In addition, companies often have to pay lawyers to process the applications.

Many international students who come to the United States to study count on transitioning from their student visa and Optional Practical Training (OPT) to an H-1B visa status. Critics of the fee increase say that this change could deter international students from enrolling in universities in the United States if their plans included seeking employment here after graduation.

The student told the Miami Herald the fee increase is already discouraging foreign students from making plans to stay in the U.S. He has two friends, one from Pakistan and the other from India, who left the United States for their home countries. “They just couldn’t take it,” he said of the constantly changing laws and rhetoric around immigration. He said he believes this change will devastate universities.

The University of Florida, Florida International University, and the University of Miami did not respond to Miami Herald requests for comments about how the new visa application fees could impact their staffing, hiring or international student enrollment.

Several middle and high schools in South Florida, including in Aventura, Hialeah and Miami, also have H-1B holders among their employees.

White House points to ‘systemic abuse of the program’

During a press conference last week, Trump said this change will provide an incentive to companies to hire American workers.

But the original intention of the H-1B visa category, which Congress created during President George H.W Bush’s administration, was to address worker shortages by bringing in highly-skilled foreign workers. To qualify, the applicant must generally hold a bachelor’s degree or higher and perform a job that requires specialized knowledge. There are also separate H-1B categories for Department of Defense workers and for models, which requires the person to be “of prominence” in the fashion world, according to USCIS. First Lady Melania Trump, a former model, was an H-1B worker in the late ‘90s.

Under the law, only 65,000 new visas are awarded every year. Another 20,000 visas are awarded to people with master’s degrees or higher in the U.S. under a special exemption. And H-1B workers who are petitioned for or employed at an institution of higher learning or nonprofits or governmental entities involved in research are not subject to this cap.

Trump acknowledged that there are instances where companies do need specific skilled international labor. In those instances, he said, the company should pay the higher fee to bring them in. The executive order became active on Sept. 21, and does not apply to people with previously issued H-1B visas or petitions submitted prior to that date.

The Department of Labor is also opening investigations into companies the agency says are abusing the system.

“The large-scale replacement of American workers through systemic abuse of the program has undermined both our economic and national security,” reads a proclamation from the White House.

“Stop the nonsense of letting people just come into this country on these visas that were given away for free,” said Howard Lutnick, United States Secretary of Commerce, at the press conference.

Homeland Security is also proposing a change so the lottery to select H-1B visa holders favors applicants who earn higher wages.

Juan Gomez, law professor and director of the Carlos A. Costa Immigration Human Rights Clinic at FIU, called President Trump’s move self-destructive for the country.

“They didn’t go through Congress, they just basically erased it without legislating,” he said.

But some immigrants rights groups recognize that H-1B visas have been problematic in many ways. Rene Gomez, the civic engagement coordinator with the Farmworkers Association of Florida, said many workers who receive H-1B visas are mistreated by their employers through harassment, wage theft, and safety concerns, which are difficult to report because of their immigration status.

“The focus and priority should be on fixing the broken system we have now,” said Rene Gomez.",https://www.miamiherald.com/public/latest-news/lydqze/picture303773346/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/MIA_6DAV_FIU_DUNN,N,,2025-09-26 12:58:00.333938

The other concerns a murder accused denied permission to leave India for medical care abroad.

These stories are reminders of how immigration and justice systems across borders can impact lives caught between legal rigidity and humanitarian concerns.

Harjit Kaur’s story began in 1991. She reportedly arrived in the US as a single mother. She worked as a seamstress in an Indian saree store, paid taxes, and volunteered at gurdwaras.

She applied for asylum, an effort that was eventually rejected. Kaur continued to live in the US, attending regular ICE check-ins. She renewed her work permits each year while awaiting travel documents from the Indian consulate. Her lawyer, Deepak Ahluwalia, told a media house that a removal order had been issued in 2005. Her final asylum appeal was rejected in 2012.

Not allowed to say good-bye

She had a clean record and longstanding community ties. Naturally, her detention on September 8 came as a shock.

Kaur was arrested during what she thought was a routine check-in at the San Francisco ICE office.

Her family revealed she was transferred between detention centers in Fresno and Bakersfield. Not just that, she was held in bare concrete cells. She was reportedly even denied consistent access to prescribed medication for her high blood pressure and diabetes.

She was not even allowed to say goodbye to her family or collect her belongings, said Ahluwalia in an Instagram post, describing the deportation as “inhumane”.

Kaur was flown from Bakersfield to Los Angeles, and then via a chartered ICE flight to Georgia, Armenia, and finally to Delhi, arriving at Indira Gandhi International Airport on September 23. “We had just two demands: first, to send her back on a commercial flight, and second, to let her meet her family for a few hours. But they refused to listen,” the lawyer told media houses.

Beyond unacceptable

The Sikh Coalition, a US-based rights group, called ICE’s actions “beyond unacceptable”, especially given Kaur’s age and medical condition.

While many protested in California with placards reading “Hands off our grandma” and “Harjit Kaur belongs here”, ICE stuck to its stand.

Kaur has filed multiple appeals all the way up to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and LOST each time. Now that she has exhausted all legal remedies, ICE is enforcing US law and the orders by the judge; she will not waste any more US tax dollars, it told the BBC.

Kaur’s deportation is part of a broader wave under President Donald Trump’s second term, which began in January 2025.

Reports, citing data by the Ministry of External Affairs, revealed that at least 1,703 Indian nationals had been deported by late July, over 90 per cent from just five states: Punjab (620), Haryana (604), Gujarat (245), Uttar Pradesh (38), and Goa (26).

A February 5 flight with 104 shackled deportees to Amritsar drew widespread outrage, followed by another similar flight that same month.

Dargahwala’s worsening condition

Meanwhile, in Gujarat, the High Court denied Jafar Dargahwala’s plea to travel to the US for cancer treatment. A US citizen for over four decades, Dargahwala faces charges of murder and criminal conspiracy in a 2022 dispute over ancestral property in Navsari. Though he was granted regular bail on health grounds in March 2024, the court restricted his movement to Gujarat and medical visits to Mumbai, requiring him to surrender his passport.

According to reports, in a fresh application, Dargahwala claimed that his condition had worsened. He had spent over Rs 20 lakh on treatment, suffered a cardiac arrest and a paralytic stroke, and was now bedridden.

Arguing that he needed to be with his family in the US for better care, he requested a six-month relaxation in bail conditions.

His lawyer noted that his absence wouldn’t delay trial proceedings, as he had not been attending hearings recently due to poor health. The complainant’s counsel, however, opposed the plea, calling the case a “supari killing” and warning that Dargahwala might abscond permanently if allowed to leave. The prosecution highlighted that 61 extradition requests from India to the US were still pending.

Rejecting the plea, Justice DA Joshi has said that medical facilities are available in India and the applicant can easily avail of the same.

Kaur’s deportation has sparked protests. Dargahwala’s medical plea drew legal scrutiny. Both cases reflect the frictions at the intersection of health, justice, and migration policy.

THIS WEEK IN BRIEF:

Though still very low, Border Patrol apprehensions increased 38 percent in August: Border Patrol’s apprehensions of undocumented migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border increased 38 percent from July to August, the first increase in four months, although apprehensions remain near 60-year lows. The increased number of family and child arrivals to south Texas appears to account for much of the growth.

”Mass deportation” and human rights: CNN documented a new family separation crisis as ICE is not giving some parents enough time to make arrangements for their U.S. citizen children before deportation. ICE’s version of what happened during a fatal shooting in Chicago came under tight scrutiny. The number of people who have died in ICE detention this year appears to have grown to 16.

In the Courts: Throughout the federal courts, legal challenges are proliferating against the administration’s early-July policy of denying bond to nearly every undocumented immigrant in the United States who arrived illegally, which is mandating a growing number of detentions of people who have been living in the United States and pursuing immigration cases for years.

THE FULL UPDATE:

Though still very low, Border Patrol apprehensions increased 38 percent in August

Migration

Customs and Border Protection (CBP) published data about its encounters with migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border in August, with a release issued late on Friday, September 19.

The number of people apprehended by Border Patrol last month remained near its lowest monthly level in about 60 years, due to a near-total ban on asylum access and a growing climate of fear among migrants in the U.S. interior. Still, apprehensions increased for the first time since April.

Border Patrol apprehended 6,321 migrants between ports of entry (official border crossings) at the U.S.-Mexico border in August, or 204 per day, up from 4,596 (148 per day) in July and 6,068 (202 per day) in June, but down sharply from 58,009 (1,871 per day) in August 2024.

Data table

Seventy percent of Border Patrol’s apprehended migrants in August were citizens of Mexico, similar to the percentage in July (67 percent). That is far greater than the 35 percent share of the apprehended migrant population that has come from Mexico since fiscal 2020. As in July, 87 percent of Border Patrol’s August apprehensions were of citizens of Mexico or northern Central America (Guatemala, Honduras, or El Salvador), much more than those nations’ 61 percent share since fiscal 2020.

Of nationalities over 50 in either month, Border Patrol reported increases in apprehensions of nearly all from July to August:

Colombia 44—>102, 132%

Cuba 50—>99, 98%

Nicaragua 33—>53, 61%

Honduras 301—>440, 46%

Mexico 3,071—>4,431, 44%

El Salvador 97—>120, 24%

Venezuela 149—>182, 22%

Other Countries 148—>165, 11%

Ecuador 71—>72, 1%

Guatemala 508—>500 -2%

The reason for the increase is not clear. However, the New York Post, citing a “Homeland Security source” in late August, raised the possibility of recently deported people “trying to sneak back into the United States.”

CBP’s statement noted that Border Patrol did not release a single asylum seeker or other migrant into the U.S. interior with parole or a notice to appear in August. There have been no such Border Patrol releases since April. All apprehended migrants were detained, deported, or, in the case of unaccompanied minors, sent to the Health and Human Services Department’s Office of Refugee Resettlement.

Border Patrol’s apprehensions of family unit members and unaccompanied minors increased 48 percent from July to August, faster than the rate of increase for single adults (35 percent). Still, family and unaccompanied minor apprehensions (1,139) accounted for only 18 percent of August’s total, similar to the 17 percent in July (769). Eighty-four percent of families and unaccompanied children entering Border Patrol custody in August were from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, or El Salvador, up from 58 percent since fiscal 2020.

Overall, CBP—which combines Border Patrol agents operating between ports of entry and Field Operations officers operating at the ports of entry—took 9,740 people into custody in August, up from 7,824 in July and 9,302 in June, and down sharply from 107,473 in August 2024. The August 2024 figure had included 45,500 people with CBP One appointments at ports of entry—a program that no longer exists.

Data table

Migrants encountered at the ports of entry remained few in August, as the Trump administration stopped using the CBP One smartphone app to help asylum seekers make appointments. CBP’s port of entry encounters totaled 3,419 people or 110 per day in August, up 6 percent from 3,228 in July, which was almost identical to 3,234 in June. Ninety-four percent of migrants encountered at ports of entry in August were citizens of Mexico, similar to 94 percent in July and 92 percent in June.

Of the nine geographic sectors into which Border Patrol divides the border, the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas displaced El Paso, which had been the number-one sector for the previous six months (since the Trump administration took office). The Rio Grande Valley sector’s August apprehensions (1,363) increased by 43 percent from July and made up 22 percent of August’s border-wide total. El Paso (Texas-New Mexico, 1,305) was second, followed by Tucson (Arizona, 1,068) and Laredo (Texas, 742). Laredo, which is adjacent to the Rio Grande Valley and typically one of the least busy sectors, also saw a 43 percent increase from July to August.

”Mass deportation” and human rights

Family separations

A multi-author investigation from CNN found over 100 cases of U.S. citizen children, “from newborns to teenagers, who have been left stranded without their parents,” whom Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deported without giving them adequate time to make arrangements for their kids’ care.

ICE’s “Detained Parents Directive,” revised on July 2 with weaker protections for undocumented parents, calls for agents to give parents time to make arrangements for U.S. citizen children if they choose not to be deported with them. “Yet, some detained parents have alleged they were not given such accommodations,” CNN found.

This echoes allegations that WOLA and Women’s Refugee Commission (WRC) heard repeatedly in interviews with people who receive deported migrants in Honduras and Guatemala in late July. “This is the new family separation crisis,” Zain Lakhani of WRC told CNN. (We discuss these separations with Lakhani in an August episode of WOLA’s Podcast.)

The report includes accounts of children being abruptly left with teenage siblings, acquaintances, or even strangers who are now grappling with how to care for them. CNN reporters found many of the families through GoFundMe pages for the children’s new guardians.

An ICE spokesperson said: “CNN is trying to obscure the fact that each of the illegal alien parents they are defending willingly chose to break our nation’s criminal and administrative laws and as a result of those choices, are responsible for what happens to their children—just as any U.S. citizen parent who breaks the law is when they are taken to jail.”

Chicago

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) continues sending ICE and other agencies’ agents to pursue undocumented immigrants in Chicago, a surge of personnel, sweeps, and raids that it is calling “Operation Midway Blitz.” Over its first two weeks, ICE claimed that it had arrested nearly 550 people with “no end date in sight.”

More surveillance and body camera footage, among other details, have become available about the fatal September 12 ICE shooting of an undocumented Mexican man in a Chicago suburb. These have called into question ICE’s initial account that an agent used lethal force in self-defense when firing his weapon at the vehicle of Silverio Villegas González, age 38, who allegedly dragged an agent “a significant distance” with his car as he sought to flee the scene.

Villegas died of gunshot wounds in Franklin Park, shortly after dropping his two children off at school and day care. The New York Times posted a detailed analysis of footage from the incident, showing Villegas pulling his sedan into reverse, not driving at two agents standing on either side of the vehicle. One agent escalated quickly, pulling out his gun. One of the agents suffered a wound while off-camera. Footage showed him with a scraped knee and torn jeans. Both agents can be heard in radio communications saying the wound was “nothing major.”

The Chicago Sun-Times was unable to determine which agency—local police, the FBI, or perhaps another—might be leading the investigation into the incident.

ICE considered temporarily shutting its facility in the Chicago suburb of Broadview, the site of intense protests, but decided to keep it open. Many citizen videos from the protests showed agents freely using tear gas and pepper-spray bullets, and slamming demonstrators to the ground to clear the way for vehicles. One woman caught on camera being thrown to the ground was a local Democratic congressional candidate with a large social media following.

Rosalio Pelayo Salgado, a father detained at Broadview since ICE arrested him at his home on September 10, told his daughters that he is “being held in a room with at least 150 other men as ICE officers constantly yell at them and call them slurs. He also told his daughters detainees are only given food and water based on good behavior,” the Chicago Sun-Times reported. “They’ve refused to give him his anxiety medication and said they threw his glasses away, so he can’t see.”

Deaths in ICE detention

Ismael Ayala-Uribe, a 39-year-old DACA recipient, died on September 21 at the Adelanto Processing Center, an ICE detention facility run by the GEO Group in California. “The Adelanto facility has been the subject of ongoing complaints from detainees, attorneys, and inspectors regarding medical care, segregation practices, and mental health services,” recalled Austin Kocher at his newsletter.

Ayala-Uribe, Kocher said, was the 14th person to die in ICE custody since the Trump administration began. On September 23, Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Washington) announced two more deaths, increasing the total to 16.

Pregnant women in detention

In a letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, 29 Senate Democrats requested information, with a September 26 deadline, about the mistreatment of pregnant women in ICE detention facilities. The letter cited reporting on 911 calls from pregnant detained women in “distress, bleeding or suffering severe pain,” and a recent Senate Judiciary Committee staff visit that found 14 pregnant women detained at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center, “a shockingly large number…with many of them receiving little to no medical care.”

Abuse of migrants who can’t be deported to their home countries

A Mother Jones investigation by Tanvi Misra revealed a growing number of cases of migrants whom ICE will not release from custody, or whom DHS seeks to deport to third countries, even after immigration courts grant them protection from deportation to their countries of origin. “ICE officers are no longer using their discretion, but just applying this blanket policy of, ‘We’re just not going to release you at all unless, basically, a court tells us that we have to,’” said attorney Evan Benz of the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights.

Detention of crime victims

Among those caught up in the “mass deportation” campaign are immigrants who were victims of crime; ICE has been detaining and deporting them more often, after rescinding a policy that shielded them from detention and removal. The change, the Associated Press reported, may affect “thousands of immigrants who would likely never have been arrested by ICE under other administrations, let alone held without a chance to post bond.”

Detainees missing in Florida

Florida’s state government is now operating two very large detention facilities for migrants, and well over a thousand did not appear in ICE’s locator system as of September 18. In many cases, loved ones and attorneys have no way to find them, Reason and the Miami Herald reported.

New York arrests

In downtown Manhattan, 11 local elected officials were among dozens of activists and religious leaders arrested after carrying out a non-violent direct action. They were demanding access to observe conditions in a short-term ICE holding facility on the 10th floor of 26 Federal Plaza, which has become notorious for prolonged stays and miserable conditions. Those arrested included Brad Lander, the New York City comptroller, who was also arrested there in June.

On September 25, video showed a federal agent violently pushing an Ecuadorian woman to the floor of the hallway of the immigration courthouse at 26 Federal Plaza, as she and her daughter clung to her husband, whom the agents were detaining.

Immigration judges

The Trump administration has fired nearly 20 immigration judges so far in September, adding to the over 80 judges already cut this year, NPR’s Ximena Bustillo reported. More than 125 judges have quit or been fired since the beginning of 2025; as of September 30, 2024, there had been a total of 735. As of June 30, that corps of immigration judges had a backlog of 3,797,662 cases to consider.

Racial profiling

Naturalized citizens in the United States are now carrying their passports during their daily routines as a shield against ICE’s tactics and racial profiling, even though they have full legal status in the United States, Ruben Castañeda reported at Palabra. The fear of being targeted by ICE agents has led to concerns about belonging and safety. “ICE agents are acting with a lot of hate. They don’t care if you show them a passport; they don’t want to see it,” said “Claudia,” a Chilean-American woman in the Washington, DC area. “They’re using violence against people walking on the street or driving in their cars.”

Terrorism charges

Now that the Trump administration has added several Mexican and Latin American organized crime groups to the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations, migrants who pay Mexican smugglers to enter the United States could end up being charged with aiding terrorism. “If people are paying these criminal organizations, you could say they are lending financial support to these terrorist groups,” CBP official Robert Dominguez told a virtual news conference covered by Border Report.

ICE masking in California

California passed a law, the “No Secret Police Act,” banning law enforcement officers, including federal immigration agents, from concealing their faces while on duty. It would take effect on January 1. “California officials and immigrant-rights advocates say the law is aimed at restoring transparency after months of viral videos showing masked teams detaining residents during Los Angeles operations—images that [California Governor Gavin] Newsom (D) likened to ‘a dystopian sci-fi movie,’” noted Migrant Insider. “The State of California has no jurisdiction over the federal government,” tweeted the Trump-appointed acting U.S. attorney for California’s Central District.

Strawberry delivery driver

Brittny Mejía of the Los Angeles Times narrated what happened to Angel Minguela Palacios, who was detained while delivering strawberries in downtown Los Angeles on August 14 near the site where Border Patrol agents were putting on a show of force outside a news conference with Gov. Newsom. The 48-year-old father, who fled Mexico 10 years ago, spent six weeks in an Arizona ICE facility before a judge ordered him released on bond. Before that, immediately following his arrest, Minguela had spent six days in an ICE temporary processing center called “B 18,” where conditions appeared intentionally made severe to convince those held there to self-deport.

ICE recruitment and office space

Helen Li of the Intercept visited a DHS Career Expo in Provo, Utah, to explore the question of “who wants to join ICE.” Those who showed up to apply for jobs at ICE, CBP, and elsewhere “ran the gamut from college students seeking debt relief to those parroting white nationalist talking points.”

The U.S. government’s General Services Administration is “scrambling” to find office space for the rapidly growing ICE presence around the United States, forming an internal “ICE Surge” team to seek office space in 19 cities, according to NPR.

Worksite raids

ICE is shifting its focus to target undocumented people at job sites, to round up large numbers of individuals at once, like a controversial recent raid of a Hyundai plant in Georgia where ICE arrested 300 people from South Korea. An official told Anna Giaritelli at the Washington Examiner that the administration considers this a new phase, following operations focused on migrants with criminal records and those targeting cities.

In the Courts

Denying bond for people with active immigration cases

At Politico, Kyle Cheney and Myah Ward reported on federal judges’ overwhelming rejections of a Trump administration policy, launched on July 8, that allows indiscriminate detention of undocumented immigrants with active immigration court cases, regardless of how long they have lived in the United States or their lack of criminal history.

The policy seeks to reinterpret the law to mandate detention (deny bond) for undocumented immigrants who entered the United States improperly, by reclassifying them as “applicants for admission.” The measure threatens the freedom of millions of asylum seekers who crossed the border between ports of entry and turned themselves in to Border Patrol agents, and have since been living and working in the United States while their cases proceed.

The Justice Department immigration court system’s Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), which now has a supermajority of Trump-appointed judges, upheld the policy earlier this month.

Some are now kept in detention even after immigration judges grant their release, using an infrequently employed mechanism called an “automatic stay.”

This has led immigrants’ lawyers to recur to the federal court system. “Their lawsuits have led to dozens of recent rulings from gobsmacked judges who say the administration has violated the law and due process rights and is threatening to do so for millions more,” Cheney and Ward wrote (the hyperlinks in the quote are theirs). They added, “Immigrant advocates say the goal is clear: make the process so excruciating that people give up and accept deportation—even if they have meritorious asylum claims or pathways to legal status.”

Four ACLU offices, the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic, and two law firms filed a class-action lawsuit in Massachusetts federal court to challenge the policy. The suit calls the denial of bond hearings “a violation of statutory and constitutional rights, upending decades of settled law and established practice in immigration proceedings.”

TPS for Venezuelan citizens

The Trump administration’s solicitor-general asked the Supreme Court on September 19 to reinforce its May “shadow docket” decision allowing the administration to proceed with canceling Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for about 300,000 citizens of Venezuela in the United States. That decision had lifted a stay imposed by Judge, Edward Chen of the U.S. District Court in San Francisco. In early September, Judge Chen again put a hold on the TPS cancellation: “He said he was not bound by the Supreme Court’s order in May, noting that it ‘did not provide any specific analysis,’” the New York Times explained.

Sharp cracks of gunfire pierced the morning air, loud, jarring pangs that echoed off the concrete. Inside the building, officials shouted warnings: a sniper was firing.

From the rooftop of a nearby building, the gunman, later identified as Joshua Jahn, was unleashing bullets, targeting the facility.

The shooting began at about 6:30 a.m. and bullets “sprayed the length of the building, the windows and law enforcement vans that were in the sally port area,” of the ICE facility, Nancy Larson, acting US attorney for the Northern District of Texas, said. Sally ports are controlled entry points commonly found in prisons and on military bases.

“It was a very traumatic moment for everyone there,” a Venezuelan woman, who CNN is not identifying due to safety concerns, said. Gripped by terror, she braced for the worst.

“Honestly, a lot of things go through your mind. I can’t even explain … Who would imagine something like that would happen in such a guarded, protected facility?”

With one detainee dead and two others seriously injured, according to Larson, fear has infiltrated the immigrant community. Many are now returning to the facility with anxious hearts, desperate to do the right thing but haunted by what happened.

Still, fear of deportation outweighs the fear of bullets for many.

Eugenio Uscategui, who has been in the US for nearly four years and is also from Venezuela, arrived at the building after the shooting and was told he would have to come back the next day.

He was scared, but still came back, he said, “out of fear of being deported.” He doesn’t want to risk missing a step in his immigration process.

“There’s uncertainty because you never know if there’s another shooter nearby or if something could happen. Honestly, the city feels very dangerous today,” he said.

Blanca Jimenez, an immigrant from Mexico, was inside the facility when the shooting began. The gunshots were deafening, “like bombs,” she said.

Still, she returned the next day, fear in her chest but resignation in her steps.

“I am afraid, yes,” she says. “But I had to come.”

Immigration appointments end in fear, not answers

Shane Reynolds was sitting on a bench outside the Dallas ICE facility, waiting for a friend’s immigration appointment, when the sound of gunfire shattered the morning.

As people around him ran for cover, Reynolds stayed frozen, unsure where the bullets were coming from.

“Running out into the open parking lot just seemed like a bad idea,” Reynolds told CNN. “I said a prayer. I looked around to try to assess our options, which there weren’t a whole lot.”

He tried to hide, crouching behind a nearby chain link fence as shots continued to ring out; at least six, maybe ten, he recalled.

Denises Robleto was also outside the facility when the shooting began. She was on a video call with her sister, waiting in the car while her mother attended an appointment.

As gunfire erupted, her sister begged her to stay inside the vehicle, but Robleto stepped out, trying to understand what was happening. She heard screaming from the facility.

Reynolds said he couldn’t communicate with others nearby during the shooting because they didn’t speak English. But their calm demeanor helped him stay grounded, even as the chaos unfolded.

After a brief lull, he heard a smaller pop noise, which he believes was the sound of the gunman taking his own life.

The shooter, Jahn, who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, was from Fairview, Texas, a suburb of Dallas, Larson said. He was a US citizen.

A woman who was at the facility for her annual appointment when the shooting started, said she doesn’t think it was motivated by anti-immigrant sentiment. “We still don’t know if it was against us. I don’t think it was because … we waited outside for about an hour before the building opened and nothing happened. Everything happened once we were inside,” the woman, who CNN agreed to not identify, said.

Handwritten notes left behind by Jahn indicated “hatred for the federal government” and led investigators to believe he intended to target ICE personnel and property, even though all three victims were detainees.

“The tragic irony for his evil plot here is that it was a detainee who was killed and two other detainees that were injured,” said Larson.

‘This is not a Republican or a Democrat issue, it’s a humanity issue’

Authorities have not released the names of the victims. However, Mexico’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed one of the injured detainees is a Mexican national.

While statements from authorities have so far largely focused on the investigation, Dallas-based immigration attorney Jaime Barron, who isn’t representing any of the victims, said the injured and killed detainees should be included in more of the conversation.

“We should focus on the humanity,” Barron told CNN. “These were human beings, and they were killed and severely hurt while being under the protection of the US government.”

Democratic state Rep. Rafael Anchía, who represents Dallas, said his community “stands united against targeted gun violence” following the shooting.

“This is not about politics — every person who values their neighbor must denounce violence in all forms and commit to meaningful action to address the gun violence epidemic,” he said in a post on X.

Barron echoed that sentiment.

“This is not a Republican or a Democrat issue, it’s a humanity issue where innocent people, be it law enforcement or immigrants, are targeted for who they are,” Barron said.

Dallas Mayor Eric L. Johnson called for healing and unity after the shooting.

“We are better than this craven act of violence,” the mayor said in a statement. “In moments like this, our city must stand together and support one another. We must heal.”

He said violence like Wednesday’s shooting should never happen and that it affected an entire community, not just law enforcement and the victims.

“It is an attack on our community and on our nation’s heritage of civil and democratic discourse,“ Johnson said. “We should all condemn violence intended to serve a political agenda and work together to end it.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-09-25t162644z-2066247173-rc2iygazcru3-rtrmadp-3-usa-shooting-ice.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-09-26 11:57:49.462556

Instead the attack on Sept. 24 at the Dallas immigration agency field office left a detainee dead and two critically injured.
FBI officials said the gunman fired from a nearby rooftop at vehicles carrying federal agents and detainees.
The gunman also fired multiple shots into the windows of the office building where immigration enforcement employees were working.
The Dallas facility also serves as a processing center for detainees arrested by immigration agents.","The suspected gunman in an attack on a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas said he wanted to inflict ""real terror"" on agents, a federal prosecutor said Thursday.

Handwritten notes retrieved from the home of suspected shooter 29-year-old Joshua Jahn expressed ""hatred for the federal government"" and a desire to give ICE agents a taste of terror, Nancy Larson, acting U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Texas, said on Sept. 25.

The latest details shared by federal investigators are the firmest details yet of what inspired the shooting that left one person dead and two critically injured.

""This, what he did, is the very definition of terrorism,"" Larson said.

The notes described a ""gameplan of the attack"" and a wish to ""terrorize ICE employees and interfere with their work, which he called human trafficking,"" said Larson, adding Jahn also wished to ""minimize any collateral damage or injury to the detainees.""

Instead the attack on Sept. 24 at the Dallas immigration agency field office left a detainee dead and two critically injured. Larson called the result a ""tragic irony for his evil plot."" No law enforcement agents were injured. Authorities say Jahn was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene.

FBI officials said the gunman fired from a nearby rooftop at vehicles carrying federal agents and detainees. The gunman also fired multiple shots into the windows of the office building where immigration enforcement employees were working. The Dallas facility also serves as a processing center for detainees arrested by immigration agents.

The release of information based on the suspected shooter’s writing comes a day after the attack. Initially, the only information regarding what inspired the shooting that authorities shared came from an unspent shell casing located near Jahn’s body. The casing has the phrase ""ANTI-ICE"" written on it, according to FBI Director Kash Patel.

Authorities believe Jahn acted alone. Larson said Jahn claimed full responsibility for the attack, writing ""Yes, it was just me and my brain."" Investigators did not find evidence of ""membership in any specific group or entity.""

Jahn also allegedly wrote ""good luck with the digital footprint,"" which authorities are taking to mean Jahn deleted evidence from his devices, according to Larson.

The attack is the latest shooting to stir a tense national debate over political rhetoric and acts of violence. Two weeks earlier, conservative activist and President Donald Trump ally Charlie Kirk was killed with a single shot during a speaking event at a Utah university.

As a result of the Sept. 24 shooting, ICE facilities are ramping up security, officials said.

Every roughly six months, Kaur “faithfully” visited the ICE office in San Francisco to check in, her family told Richmondside.
Her work permit was renewed annually while ICE officials tried to secure the documents she needed to go to India.
“When she asked to have (food) or even water to take with her medication, she was given a plate of ice,” Ahluwalia said.
And of the 204,297 people detained by ICE in that period, 65% had no convictions at all.","Harjit Kaur, a 73-year-old East Bay woman who was detained for 15 days by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after a routine check-in, was deported to her home country of India this week. She had been living and working legally in the United States for more than three decades and had no criminal history.

Kaur, who came to the Bay Area as a single mother in 1991, lived in Hercules, regularly attended the El Sobrante Sikh Gurdwara and worked for two decades as a seamstress at Sari Palace in Berkeley.

Kaur, a grandmother of five, was denied asylum and tried to appeal several times. When her appeal was denied at the federal appeals court, she was willing to self deport but in 13 years was never able to secure travel documents from the Indian Consulate, her family said.

Every roughly six months, Kaur “faithfully” visited the ICE office in San Francisco to check in, her family told Richmondside. Her work permit was renewed annually while ICE officials tried to secure the documents she needed to go to India.

So, on Sept. 8, when she was detained at one of those check-ins, she and her family were shocked, along with the wider community, which held a rally on Sept. 12 in El Sobrante to show their support for her.

On Sept. 9, Kaur was taken to the Mesa Verde Detention Facility in Bakersfield. She was then moved to a detention center in Lumpkin, GA., on Sat., Sept. 20 and ultimately deported without any notice on Monday.

“Around 2 a.m., without notifying the attorney, without any advance notice to anybody, (ICE) took her from Bakersfield, drove her to (Los Angeles) while in handcuffs yet again, and put her on a flight to Georgia,” her Fresno-based attorney Deepak Ahluwalia said in a video he shared on social media.

Ahluwalia said at one point no one knew her location for more than 24 hours. She was able to call her family Sunday.

“I’ve been to Lumpkin, and it’s as remote as remote can be,” Ahluwalia said, referring to Kaur as “Bibiji, a Punjabi term of respect. “And (when) she had called us, she was not able to tell us herself where she actually was.”

East Bay woman, 73, said she wasn’t given toilet paper and slept on floor during ICE detention

What Kaur did share was that she was held in cells without a bed or a chair for hours and made to sleep on the floor. She was refused vegetarian meals in accordance with her religious beliefs (she is Sikh) during the first six days of detention and was only provided with her medicine several days into detention.

“When she asked to have (food) or even water to take with her medication, she was given a plate of ice,” Ahluwalia said. “She explained she had dentures and she couldn’t eat it. The guard told her, ‘That’s your fault.’ ”

Ahluwalia noted that two individuals tried to meet Kaur at the detention center on Sunday when they learned where she was, but ICE denied the visit.

Kaur also wasn’t given access to basic hygiene supplies such as toilet paper and wasn’t allowed to shower. When she was about to board her ICE chartered flight to India on Mondays she was given wet wipes to clean herself, Ahluwalia said.

He said the family was willing to comply with the deportation and had two requests: Kaur be released (with an ankle monitor) for 24 to 48 hours to tie up any loose ends and/or that she be allowed to fly on a commercial plane and be accompanied by a member of her family due to her age and medical conditions.

Her family even purchased a plane ticket to India for her while she was detained in Bakersfield, Ahluwalia said, but those requests went ignored. He said ICE eventually responded to his multiple requests, saying the family could visit her on Tuesday — the day after she was deported.

The attorney also noted that he is filing a complaint regarding the conditions of Kaur’s detention.

“Some might call (what I’m saying to be) ICE bashing. Some might call it, you know, obviously speaking out. But at the end of the day, I’m speaking facts,” Aluwalia said. “I’m telling you, matter of fact, what took place.”

ICE defends deportation of Harjit Kaur, saying she will no longer “waste” tax dollars

In an emailed statement to Richmondside, which misspelled her name and called her an illegal alien, an ICE official said Kaur litigated her case for more than 34 years and was ordered to leave the country an immigration judge in 2005, so “to say her arrest by ICE is somehow unjust or lacking in due process is absurd.”

“(Kaur) has filed multiple appeals all the way up to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and LOST each time,” the statement says. “Now that she has exhausted all legal remedies, ICE is stepping in to enforce the law and orders by the judge; she will not waste any more U.S. tax dollars.”

Ahluwalia pushed back on the notion of Kaur wasting tax dollars.

“This is how a 73-year-old grandmother was treated with no criminal record … she worked, she contributed to the U.S. taxpayer system and didn’t live off social security or any other sort of benefits,” Ahluwalia emphasized. “And everyone can keep saying she had a final order removal and she was asked to leave. Correct — she was asked to leave, and she was complying.”

Kaur’s case drew attention due to her particular circumstance, but she is one of thousands who have been detained by ICE this year alone.

As of the last status update on Sept. 7, the last U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was holding 58,766 individuals in detention facilities, according to TRAC reports. Of those being detained, 70.8% do not have a criminal conviction. Many of those who do were convicted of minor offenses, including traffic violations.

The number of ICE detentions and deportations have skyrocketed since President Donald Trump’s reelection. The president has repeatedly said he wants to crackdown on illegal immigration, focusing on getting rid of criminals, and has increased ICE’s budget — making it the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency.

But data from the Cato Institute found that more than 93% of detainees from the 2025 fiscal year (October 2024 to June 2025) were not convicted of any violent offenses. And of the 204,297 people detained by ICE in that period, 65% had no convictions at all. Most convictions fell into three main categories: immigration, traffic, or nonviolent vice crimes.

Kaur’s granddaughter Sukhmeet Sandhu took to social media this week to thank everyone “from the bottom of my heart for standing with us.” She said her grandmother’s detention was very difficult for the family and her safe deportation was only possible because of the advocacy from the community.

“While we are thankful for her safe return, it’s important to remember the many other innocent individuals who remain detained for months or even years,” Sukhmeet Kaur wrote. “Please continue to raise your voices and fight for them the same way you stood with our grandmother.”",https://richmondside.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/harjitcrop-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 13:57:09.320617

Katie Blankenship, director of SOS, says that authorities are repeating the same “recipe” used at Alligator Alcatraz at Deportation Depot.
“He was transferred to this facility two weeks ago and says he’s almost ready to sign a deportation order.
SOS is aware that at least two of its clients were transferred to Deportation Depot from other detention centers.
Deportation Depot was previously a state prison west of Jacksonville, near the border with neighboring Georgia, which closed five years ago due to staffing shortages.","Less than a month after the start of operations at Deportation Depot, the new immigrant detention center set up in a former men’s prison in Baker County, northern Florida, complaints have started to emerge about the poor conditions and treatment at the facility — very similar to those reported at Alligator Alcatraz, the infamous tented jail west of Miami. Detainees at Deportation Depot (as it was dubbed by Republican Governor Ron DeSantis) have complained of limited access to medical care, including emergencies, poor and insufficient food, lack of drinking water, and no privacy to speak with their lawyers, according to testimonies collected by the legal network Sanctuary of the South (SOS).

They have also reported having no mechanisms to file complaints or store legal documents or religious items, that staff threaten them with solitary confinement as retaliation, and that, because there are multiple contractors, it’s unclear who is in charge — raising questions about oversight, due process, and basic standards of care at the facility.

Immigrant detention centers in Florida have been criticized in human rights reports for “dehumanizing” overcrowding and blatant violations of immigration detention standards. Nearly half a dozen people have died in immigration custody in Florida so far this year — half of the total nationwide. The state has sought to position itself at the forefront of the anti-immigrant measures pushed by the Trump administration, which include mass deportations and detention quotas, and leads the nation in the number of agreements with local authorities to detain immigrants.

Katie Blankenship, director of SOS, says that authorities are repeating the same “recipe” used at Alligator Alcatraz at Deportation Depot. “It’s being repeated in the detention centers they’re opening over and over again throughout the country, and you see the same problems.”

Authorities want to detain a “crushing amount of people” because “it’s very profitable, and so they rush to create these detention centers without any thought if, whether they’re actually able, capable, set up to humanely house human beings,” Blankenship charges. “It’s quite literally the same recipe over and over again,” she adds, describing the detention centers as “basically cages with no postal service, no reliable air conditioning, no reliable medical care, no reliable food, or anything like that set up.”

No water, scarce food, and no privacy

A man previously detained at the Krome processing center, southwest of Miami — flagged in a Human Rights Watch report for poor conditions and where at least two people have died in recent months — said Deportation Depot is far worse, according to Alejandra Puerto, an SOS legal assistant who spoke with the detainee by phone. “He was transferred to this facility two weeks ago and says he’s almost ready to sign a deportation order. The conditions are unbearable,” she notes.

Another detainee reported losing 10 pounds (4.5 kilos) in the two weeks he’s been there. Another said he has a restricted diet but has not been provided with appropriate food. The tap water at the facility is undrinkable, and detainees are only allowed to drink from a dispenser.

Puerto has also received complaints that “they’re taken out at 5 a.m. with no jackets or anything to keep warm. They’re forced to walk outside in those conditions and wait to enter the dining hall, with nothing to protect them from the cold, because of overcrowding — since not everyone fits in the cafeteria at the same time.”

There is no place or system to file complaints: “They are not allowed to have pens. They haven’t been able to write their requests or complaints, which is exactly the procedure officials tell them to follow. They’re told, ‘Write your complaints,’ but then they aren’t given pens or paper,” Puerto explains. “In addition, their legal documents are being withheld.”

Images from inside the facility show rooms with long rows of bunk beds, no other furniture, and no place to store personal belongings. One detainee said his only possession is a Bible, which he is forced to place on the floor, Puerto says.

SOS has tried to determine whether detainees can send or receive legal mail, but authorities at the site said they don’t know. Because multiple companies operate on-site — one for laundry, another for the kitchen, three or four security firms, a medical company — “it’s not clear who’s in charge, and no one has any answers. There’s no one person in charge,” Puerto says.

Clients can communicate with their lawyers in conference rooms, where “they are placed in a space with a laptop. But some are cautious because they don’t trust how secure the communication is. They lower their voices when officers pass by,” Puerto adds.

SOS is aware that at least two of its clients were transferred to Deportation Depot from other detention centers. Hundreds of detainees do not appear in the online database of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and these transfers — along with the opacity in record-keeping — have raised alarms about potential violations of immigrants’ constitutional rights and due process.

Deportation Depot was previously a state prison west of Jacksonville, near the border with neighboring Georgia, which closed five years ago due to staffing shortages. Blankenship, director of SOS, says her clients have complained that the facility “was not fit for use” and “they did nothing” did nothing to address the situation. “They just threw people in there. It hasn’t been cleaned at all and there’s mold and filth everywhere. It’s really cruel, terrible treatment,” she adds.

Stephanie Hartman, communications director for Florida’s Division of Emergency Management (FDEM), which oversees the facility, said these allegations “are false” and that “detainees receive three meals a day, have access to indoor and outdoor recreational facilities, continuous access to a fully staffed medical clinic with an on-site pharmacy,” as well as clean facilities and the ability to schedule appointments with their lawyers, “both in person and virtually.”

FDEM did not respond to questions about how many detainees are at the center or how many have been deported. The Department of Homeland Security and ICE also did not respond to this newspaper’s inquiries. Authorities have said the facility has a capacity of 1,300 detainees, which could be expanded to 2,000.

The deportation machine

When announcing at the end of last month that he would repurpose the prison to detain immigrants, Florida Governor DeSantis highlighted its proximity to Lake City airport, just minutes from Baker, as a strategic point, and said the goal was not to “hold people indefinitely” at the site, “but to process and deport them.” The former prison required fewer resources — around $6 million — to operate as a detention center than the other option considered by the state, a military base southwest of Jacksonville.

Immigrant advocates have claimed that poor conditions and long periods of detention are part of a strategy to pressure people into accepting deportation. Authorities insist that those who agree to voluntary deportation are given a plane ticket and $1,000. But Blankenship says the real reason they want to keep people detained is money.

In July, President Trump signed his tax reform law, which allocated more than $100 billion to ICE, including around $45 billion to expand detention center capacity.

“That’s the reason. I don’t think Trump or the people behind this care at all about immigrants. It’s a political move. That’s where there’s a lot of money and political power. So what do you do? You start talking about immigrants, you set up the whole anti-immigrant propaganda machinery that’s been running in this country for years, and suddenly you have billions pouring out of Congress,” she says.

“So it’s money first. Like that old saying: ‘It’s the money, stupid.’ Look at that, and everything else fall from there,” she concludes.",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/3EMBQ5LQLVF73OYMAEFFU2AARM.jpg?auth=de58ab9e078c0a5fa8b2c52a14282124176d50fa15e290c45db691dbeac6b9cd&width=1200,N,,2025-09-26 11:56:55.148158

It’s the home of GEO Group, a 40-year-old company that operates more than four dozen immigrant detention facilities and prisons across the country.

The firm, which was founded by a Greek immigrant who entered the United States through Ellis Island, has cultivated relationships with top figures in the Trump administration, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and immigration czar Tom Homan.

Few companies have made a bigger killing from the administration’s turbocharged efforts to detain and deport undocumented migrants.

Ten days after Trump won last year’s presidential election, the company hired top Trump advisor and former Florida state congressman, Carlos Trujillo as a lobbyist. Trujillo’s firm, Continental Strategy, employs the daughter of Susie Wiles, Trump’s chief of staff.

The company contributed more than $500,000 backing President Trump’s election effort last year and then chipped in an additional $500,000 to support Trump’s inauguration this year.

It’s been money well spent.

The company has already landed contracts worth up to $500 million since Trump’s second inauguration on January 20, 2025, a Miami Herald analysis of federal contracting records found.

“We believe our company faces an unprecedented opportunity at this time to play a role in supporting President Trump’s new administration policy,” said George Zoley, GEO’s founder and executive chairman, in an earnings call in February. He added that GEO was “well positioned” to “scale up” its portfolio of detention and transportation facilities and electronic monitoring products in this “unique moment” in the company’s history.

The federal contracts include a renewal to a prior contract to operate the Broward Transitional Center, a detention facility in Pompano Beach.

Four months ago, the firm also agreed on a 15-year contract to operate an immigrant detention center in Newark, New Jersey. GEO told investors that it expects to generate $60 million in revenue from that deal in the first year alone and up to $1 billion over 15 years.

For-profit detention centers like those run by GEO have drawn intense scrutiny, especially over the last decade. For instance, a 2020 Congressional report documented numerous problems at privately-run facilities, including delayed and inadequate medical care, deficient sanitation and management of infectious diseases, overcrowded conditions, limited mental health support and lack of transparency.

In April, 44-year-old Marie Ange Blaise, a Haitian, died while being held at GEO’s Pompano Beach facility after complaining of chest pains. Her son told medical examiners that she had “chest pains and abdominal cramps” but detention staff refused her request to see a physician.

More recently, four detainees escaped from GEO’s Newark detention center, according to the New York Times. While the exact timing of the escape is unclear, detainees at the facility had faced off against guards over meager and dismal meals, unsanitary conditions and overcrowding that same day.

The company said that it is proud of the role it has played in supporting the law enforcement mission of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a GEO Group spokesperson said.

“Our innovative support service solutions have helped the federal government implement the policies of seven different Presidential Administrations,” he said.

Detainees at GEO’s facilities are provided “robust access” to medical facilities and professionals and off-site specialists, emergency services and access to local community hospitals is also provided when needed.

GEO did not respond to specific questions about cultivating relationships with influential figures in the government. George Zoley declined an interview request from the Herald.

Immigration is typically a civil ⁠— not criminal ⁠— matter under U.S. law but facilities that hold undocumented migrants remain places of confinement. Critics argue that the profit-driven model prioritizes occupancy over the welfare of detainees.

“No matter how you spin it, these are prisons,” said Faisal Al-Juburi of the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, a Texas-based immigrant rights group.

“There is no way to humanely detain people, especially families.”

Capital connections

GEO’s prospects looked very different a decade ago.

On August 18, 2016, Sally Yates, Obama’s attorney general announced that the Justice Department would be looking to phase out the use of private prisons.

“They simply do not provide the same level [compared to federally run Bureau of Prisons facilities] of correctional services, programs and resources; they do not save substantially on costs; and … they do not maintain the same level of of safety and security,” she wrote in a memo directing the bureau to “either decline or substantially reduce” contract renewals with for-profit prison companies.

GEO’s stock tumbled immediately.

The next day, GEO made a $100,000 contribution to Rebuilding America Now, a super PAC supporting Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and a further $125,000 a few months later, filings with the Federal Election Commission show. The company also contributed $250,000 for Trump’s inauguration in 2017.

Trump’s surprise 2016 victory would boost the company’s fortunes.

Jeff Sessions, then Trump’s attorney general, rescinded Yates’ guidance soon after Trump took office and the company has received hundreds of millions more in federal contracts since then.

Since 2016, GEO has also spent around $12 million in lobbying agencies like the Homeland Security and Justice departments.

Roughly two weeks after Trump took office on Jan. 20, 2017, the firm employed the services of Ballard Partners, a lobbying firm owned by Brian Ballard, who POLITICO dubbed the “most powerful lobbyist in Trump’s Washington” in 2018. Ballard lobbied the White House on the company’s behalf.

Attorney General Pam Bondi, then a lobbyist for Ballard Partners, also lobbied the White House and Department of Homeland Security in 2019 on the “use of public-private partnerships in correctional services.”

Tom Homan, the current immigration czar, disclosed providing consulting services to a subsidiary of GEO Group before he took office this year. He was paid at least $5,000 but the report does not specify the nature of his work for the company. MSNBC and the New York Times reported last weekend that Homan was the subject of an FBI investigation last year for allegedly accepting cash in exchange for help with winning government contracts in a second Trump administration.

Both Homan and the White House have strongly denied any wrongdoing and dismissed the investigation into Homan as politically motivated by the Biden administration.

“Tom Homan has not been involved with any contract award decisions,” said White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson. “He is doing a phenomenal job on behalf of President Trump and the country.”

Joe Biden, like Hillary Clinton before him, ran in 2020 on a platform that promised the end of the federal government’s use of private prisons. Stocks of contractors like GEO plummeted immediately after he was elected president.

But while Biden did end the use of prison contractors by the Justice Department, he did the opposite for immigration facilities and allowed ICE to expand its work with for-profit companies.

The move paved the way for Donald Trump to rapidly expand their use to hold undocumented migrants. The passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill” in May this year earmarks a further $45 billion — more than three times what the government spent during the Biden and Trump’s first administration ⁠— to expand immigration detention centers in the country.

“Who stands to gain from such policies? It is the GEO Groups of the world,” said Al-Juburi of RAICES.

Zoley’s fortune

GEO Group was founded in 1984 by George C. Zoley. It went public ten years later.

The company received its first federal contract for immigration detention in Aurora, Colorado in 1987. Ten years and expansions into Australia and the United Kingdom later, it received a U.S. federal Bureau of Prison contract to operate a correctional institution in Taft, California ⁠— the first privately-run federal prison in the country.

Today, the firm’s portfolio includes more than 50 immigrant detention centers and correctional facilities in the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom and South Africa. It also runs a migrant detention facility in the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The company offers transportation services for inmates and detainees, electronic monitoring products, privatized healthcare for those in detention as well as financing, design and construction services for correctional facilities.

Zoley’s personal fortune has grown by $50 million since Trump got elected in 2024, according to Bloomberg estimates. It is now $304 million.

Zoley himself is an immigrant. Born in Greece, he arrived at Ellis Island aged three with his 28-year-old mother and five-year-old brother on September 19, 1953, archived passenger manifests from the ship Nea Hellas show. The historic ship helped thousands of Greeks make the two-week sea voyage from Athens to New York and often served as an escape route for hundreds fleeing the Nazi occupation and later, the difficult postwar years in Europe.

Zoley’s last name at the time was Zolis. The family travelled to Ohio and Zoley grew up in the small township of Copley, a 15-minute drive from Akron.

At the time, the path to naturalization was much easier: Individuals need only have been a resident in the United States for five years, not committed murder, not been in an American jail for more than 180 days and had to be “attached to the Constitution” and of “good moral character.” When he turned 18, Zoley was a shoo-in.

Six decades later, the Zoley family ⁠owns a nine-bedroom waterfront mansion and another four-bedroom single-family home in Boca Raton, both near the Royal Palm Yacht and Country Club. The properties, which the Zoleys had bought for a total of nearly $12 million, are now worth roughly $26 million, records show.

GEO facilities

Less than 10 miles southwest of the Zoley’s waterfront mansion stands one of the facilities that helped pay for it.

The flamingo pink Broward Transitional Center hides in plain sight on a stretch of road in Pompano Beach lined with palm trees and modest commercial buildings. There are no spools of barbed wire atop its fences or looming guard towers to announce its purpose.

Right below the American flag at the facility’s entrance is a flag emblazoned with the GEO Group’s logo.

Hundreds of people looking to emigrate to the United States sit inside the facility’s walls in limbo, waiting for a legal process that often stretches on for weeks, months or even years.

Detainees include asylum seekers, visa overstayers and those apprehended in Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. Many of them have no history of violent crime.

Among them was Harpinder Singh Chauhan, a 56-year-old British entrepreneur, who recently went bankrupt, had tax problems and was arrested by ICE this spring. He was transferred to BTC on April 20.

He told Human Rights Watch, an international civil rights watchdog group, that staff at the facility deprived him of his insulin for nearly a week even though he had serious medical conditions including diabetes, pancreatitis and asthma. He collapsed while lining up for dinner one night and had to be rushed to a hospital with signs of cardiac arrest. Chauhan has since been deported to the United Kingdom.

GEO Group did not respond to the Herald’s questions about allegations of mismanagement and lack of care in its facilities. The company emphasized that its services are monitored by the Homeland Security Department and said that issues that arise are quickly addressed.

Sworn declarations by detainees filed in federal court and obtained by the Herald on condition of anonymity allege negligent medical care and crumbling infrastructure at GEO’s facility in Karnes, Texas. They also reveal the wide swath of people getting caught in ICE’s dragnet: An Iranian teen fleeing an abusive father, a Venezuelan looking for a safer life in the United States and a Mongolian family seeking asylum.

A Colombian detainee at Karnes stated in one declaration was arrested by ICE in Pompano Beach, had a fracture in his tibia ⁠— a bone in the leg. While at Karnes, he was taken to an offsite orthopedic clinic whose “walls were falling down.” The doctor ordered his crutches to be taken away and said the swelling and pain were “mental.”

Another testified that she, along with her mother and two younger brothers were detained at Karnes for some weeks. One of her brothers has severe autism and she said his symptoms got much worse in custody ⁠— he was angry, nervous and stopped eating. She herself started having panic attacks. Her mother and brothers were later released and she is now detained alone.

A Venezuelan who was arrested in Austin and detained at Karnes, said in another declaration that she has seen “people be carried out after passing out.” She said that officials always ignored her complaints about the cold temperatures inside affecting her asthma and that the food at the facility often smells off. The guards never answer detainees’ questions, she said, and yell at them to go back to their rooms.

“We came here looking for safety, a peaceful life where we are not living in constant fear,” she testified. “I want my freedom.”

In the shadow of Congress and the current Trump administration driving up health care costs and booting Americans off their coverage, the court’s decision makes clear that communications between federal agencies and congressional staff cannot avoid FOIA’s reach simply because a congressional staffer pastes boilerplate language onto emails labeling them “congressional records.”

“This ruling is a significant victory for transparency at a time when Congress and the Trump administration are driving up health care costs and stripping people of their coverage,” said Chioma Chukwu, Executive Director of American Oversight. “If congressional staff could shield agency communications from disclosure with a simple boilerplate disclaimer, the public would lose access to policymaking debates with life-and-death consequences, like the fight over health care access. The court was clear: FOIA’s spirit of disclosure cannot be undermined by such gamesmanship.”

In 2017, just months after opening its doors, American Oversight sued the Department of Health and Human Services and the Office of Management and Budget for records related to the Trump administration’s attempt to roll back the Affordable Care Act. Among the documents produced were emails from House Ways and Means Committee staff that included attachments and a boilerplate footer asserting the materials belonged to the Committee and were exempt from FOIA — even though the agencies had relied on the materials in crafting legislative strategy. The Committee intervened to block disclosure of the records, but after years of litigation, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia has ruled that Congress cannot use such tactics to circumvent FOIA and prevent the release of records agencies use in their decision-making.

In concluding its opinion, the court underscored the importance of maintaining public access to policymaking records:

“[A]gencies frequently communicate with Congress about a range of budgetary and policy matters, and . . . FOIA’s protections do not shield all of those communications from disclosure simply because of Congress’s involvement. To deem the actions here — staffers simply copying and pasting a catch-all disclaimer into any communication they find appropriate — as a clear assertion of congressional intent would significantly broaden the scope of FOIA exemptions. Such an approach would contravene the D.C. Circuit’s admonition that Congress’s FOIA exemption cannot be interpreted to ‘undermine the broad spirit of disclosure that animates the Act.'”",https://americanoversight.org/wp-content/uploads/Copy-of-Web-image-template-1.png,N,,2025-09-26 15:56:35.415781

All are believed to be in the United States illegally, the FBI says.

Officials report nine of those who were arrested Thursday were targeted for their suspected involvement in the sexual assault and/or trafficking of minor American girls.

FOX 11 is working to get more details on the arrests. It's unclear where these people were living in Manitowoc County, if these alleged crimes were happening in the county and what level of involvement those arrested had in the alleged crimes.

FOX has also asked officials when and how the FBI and ICE got involved and when these individuals will appear in court.

Manitowoc County is in the 6th Congressional District, represented by Republican Rep. Glenn Grothman. FOX 11 spoke with Grothman Thursday afternoon, asking him what he knows about the arrests and the ongoing ICE investigations in the area.

""We're still trying to collect information. As we understand it, many of them were involved in human trafficking, which usually is another way to say prostitution. Others may have been working in the field of agriculture. ICE has so much work to do, as you know,"" Grothman said. ""And this is an example of the fact the problems, particularly with prostitution involved, the problems are not just along the Mexican border. The people come all the way up here, then to Manitowoc.""

Crusaders of Justicia, the Manitowoc affiliate of Forward Latino, a nonprofit and nonpartisan advocacy organization that has groups in 29 states, decried these ICE operations, calling it, ""the unjust targeting of innocent, hardworking immigrant community members and the separation of families.""

Jennifer Maldonado, executive director of Crusaders of Justicia, said in a news release, ""We all want safe communities. However, it is both reckless and harmful to connect all those detained today with allegations of sex trafficking.""

At least one of today’s actions targeted a group of dairy workers who gather every morning in the same place and ride together to work. They do this day in and day out. They are hardworking, church-going individuals who are only looking to provide for their families. Not only do they contribute to our communities, but they are sustaining Wisconsin’s family-owned dairy farms.

Darryl Morin, national president of Forward Latino, added:

As documented by numerous independent sources, this administration continues to prioritize the detention and deportation of immigrants with no criminal record. The reasoning is simple.

First, the vast majority of immigrants are not involved in criminal activity. Second, detaining individuals who go to work every day and come home to their families every night is easier than apprehending someone actually engaged in unlawful behavior.

At a time when Wisconsin faces a severe labor shortage, we should be focused on expanding legal pathways, not tearing families apart. Hardworking, tax-paying, law-abiding immigrants should be part of the solution, not demonized and separated from their families.

Grothman told FOX 11 he understands many Wisconsin farms need migrant workers. He said Congress may need to consider approving more workers coming into the country to help dairy farms, but added that Wisconsin farms shouldn't be hiring people in the country illegally.

Voces de la Frontera, a Milwaukee-based immigrant rights organization, says it is aware of the arrests and is working with the affected families and conducting a full investigation.

Ayala-Uribe’s death marked the 15th detention death officially reported by Ice, part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), since Donald Trump returned to the White House in January.
In response to Alaya-Uribe’s death, Ice said in a statement, in part: “ICE remains committed to ensuring that all those in its custody reside in safe, secure and humane environments.
Only [approximately] eight months into the second Trump term … we’ve already seen 15 deaths, or nearly two detainee deaths per month (1.88).
Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director of the Detention Watch Network, said in a statement to the Guardian: “Ice detention is inherently inhumane, and we’ve documented horrendous conditions for decades.","Deaths occurring in the custody of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) have reached at least 16 since January amid increasing mass detention across the country and growing concerns over conditions.

On Sunday, Ismael Ayala-Uribe, a 39-year-old Mexican national and former “Dreamer” – those given protections after being brought to the US as undocumented children in the past – died after being held at an Ice facility in Adelanto, California, according to a statement from the federal agency.

Ayala-Uribe’s death marked the 15th detention death officially reported by Ice, part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), since Donald Trump returned to the White House in January.

However, an incident then followed in Texas on Wednesday when a detainee was killed by a gunman and two others were wounded at an Ice facility in Dallas, even though prosecutors said the suspect was targeting Ice, not detainees.

And Ayala-Uribe’s death followed a 42-year-old Honduran national who died last week while held by Ice in Nassau county, New York.

In response to Alaya-Uribe’s death, Ice said in a statement, in part: “ICE remains committed to ensuring that all those in its custody reside in safe, secure and humane environments. Comprehensive medical care is provided from the moment individuals arrive and throughout the entirety of their stay.”

According to the latest data from the Guardian, which has been tracking immigration enforcement under Trump, Ice was holding 59,762 people in detention as of 25 September. The number exceeded 60,000 in August, a record. On 26 January, roughly a week after Trump assumed office for a second term, Ice was holding 39,238 in detention and the total had been below 40,000 throughout 2024, although rising steadily later in the Biden administration.

Adam Sawyer, a migration data scientist with Relevant Research, based in Maryland, reviewed the current and prior administrations.

“A total of 26 people passed away during the 48 months of the Biden administration. That’s a bit more than one death every second month (0.54 deaths per month). Only [approximately] eight months into the second Trump term … we’ve already seen 15 deaths, or nearly two detainee deaths per month (1.88). About half of the detainee deaths (12 of 26) during the Biden administration took place last fiscal year 2024, so detainee death rates were ramping up before Trump took office in 2025,” he said.

Sawyer said even considering the increase in Ice detentions, the rising death toll remains worrying.

Earlier this week, Georgia US senators Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, Democrats, wrote to homeland security secretary Kristi Noem and acting Ice director Todd Lyons demanding information.

Citing the deaths of two detainees in Ice custody in Georgia, the senators said: “We write with serious alarm regarding the rise in the number of deaths in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody nationwide … We request that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ICE immediately provide information about these individuals’ deaths and about the Trump administration’s plan to prevent further fatalities.”

Concerns surrounding detention conditions are rising.

Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director of the Detention Watch Network, said in a statement to the Guardian: “Ice detention is inherently inhumane, and we’ve documented horrendous conditions for decades. What we are seeing now is an exacerbation of these conditions that is resulting in more deaths.”

Despite criticisms from immigration rights groups and lawmakers who have been denied entry to detention centers, Ice and DHS assert that conditions in detention are safe.

“All people in ICE custody receive medical, dental and mental health intake screening within 12 hours of arriving at each detention facility, a full health assessment within 14 days of entering ICE custody or arrival at a facility, access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care. At no time during detention is a detained illegal alien denied emergent care,” Ice said in a statement online.

Advocates are alarmed, however.

Michael Lukens, executive director of the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights in Washington DC, said: “The detention in America is higher than it’s ever been … If you were a xenophobic, racist wannabe dictator and you wanted to deport as many people as possible, you’d want to make sure that the detention system is in a place where people get as little help as possible.”

And Sawyer pointed to detention levels.

“When increasing the size of a population, in this case the national [Ice] detainee population, we would expect it to increase the total number of people experiencing health complications that might lead to death if not monitored … While the demographic and statistical aspects of Ice detention definitely impact mortality rates, the actual conditions at Ice detention centers might be more immediately relevant,” he said.

The Guardian has reached out to Ice and DHS for comment about the 2025 death toll.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/849f08e65dfe2f6afc5bdfea043c67db9525cf4b/0_0_5718_4576/master/5718.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=25446f6b728703d68a520a3fff88c696",N,,2025-09-26 09:56:19.212039

""","A 39-year-old former DACA recipient died in ICE custody this week. Ismael Ayala-Uribe had been detained at Adelanto ICE Processing Center near Victorville since August, when he was arrested by immigration agents.

Ayala-Uribe is the 14th person to die in immigration custody in the U.S. this year. ICE said in a statement that an investigation into the cause of death is underway, and community groups are demanding an independent report on what happened.

The death comes as Adelanto has seen a surge of hundreds more detainees since immigration agents ramped up enforcement in Southern California this summer. The privately run detention center has faced accusations of medical abuse and neglect, and some lawmakers recently were turned away when they tried to enter the facility.

But experts told LAist that they doubted much would come from ICE's investigation into the death. Sergio Perez, the executive director of the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, said government oversight of deaths in its detention centers is limited and flawed.

"" Accountability and transparency in this space following a death in custody has always been severely lacking. It's even more lacking now,"" Perez said.

What happened?

Ayala-Uribe died in the early hours of Monday morning, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The agency said he was evaluated by a medical provider at Adelanto on Sept. 18, given medication and returned to his dorm. Three days later, on Sunday, he was sent to a nearby hospital, where he was evaluated for an ""abscess on his buttock"" and scheduled for surgery.

The next day, he was dead.

The center has been under scrutiny for its treatment of people detained there for years and has been in the spotlight again in recent months as it received a surge of people detained in this summer's immigration sweeps.

The advocacy group Disability Rights California visited the facility in June and interviewed 18 people detained there. It then issued a report claiming that detainees faced ""inadequate access to medical treatment, such as life-saving medication and wound care, and exposure to widespread respiratory illnesses.""

""Due to the surging numbers of people at Adelanto, conditions appear to have quickly deteriorated,” that report reads.

What is ICE required to do after a death in custody?

When a person dies in immigration detention, ICE is required to post the news within two business days. The agency is then legally required to publish all its reports on the death within 90 days. Those reports are posted online.

According to ICE's policy posted online, the agency ""conducts medical reviews, as well as oversight and compliance investigations,"" and its Office of Professional Responsibility examines the circumstances of the death. ICE's review is then given to Homeland Security's Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.

Critics have questioned the accuracy of ICE investigations into in-custody deaths for years. In 2024, the ACLU issued a report looking at the deaths of 52 people in ICE custody between 2017 and 2021.

""ICE’s investigations, formal and informal reports and recommendations in response to deaths in custody are structured to avoid fault and disclaim agency accountability for the death of detained immigrants,"" that report reads, in part.

Two immigration experts told LAist that the offices at the Department of Homeland Security responsible for investigating deaths like Ayala-Uribe's have been eroded under the second Donald Trump administration.

Heidi Altman with the National Immigration Law Center cited recent job cuts in DHS offices such as the offices for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and the Immigration Detention Ombudsman.

Assistant Security Tricia McLaughlin wrote in a statement to LAist that those offices obstructed immigration enforcement by adding bureaucratic hurdles and undermining DHS' mission.

""Rather than supporting law enforcement efforts, they often function as internal adversaries that slow down operations,"" according to McLaughlin.

The Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman conducts oversight and will ""independently examine immigration detention to promote safe, humane conditions,"" according to its government website.

"" You start seeing things like the dismantling of the oversight bodies that provided the very, very little accountability that was there for abuses and medical negligence and custody,"" Altman said. ""And you just know that these detention centers are becoming increasingly dangerous places for people to be.""

McLaughlin wrote that all legally required functions continue to be performed and that DHS remains committed to civil rights.

What about lawmakers?

There are other paths for oversight of conditions at detention centers. Lawmakers can launch their own investigations. In July, Sen. Jon Ossoff issued a report on the experiences of pregnant women and children in immigration detention, including inadequate medical care. That investigation is ongoing.

""Obstruction of Congressional oversight by the Department of Homeland Security has been an impediment to site visits and interviews with detainees,"" that report claims.

In a statement provided to LAist, Rep. Raul Ruiz called for a full investigation into Ayala-Uribe's death.

""Congress has a duty to provide strong oversight to ensure that all individuals in custody are treated with dignity and receive timely, appropriate care,"" Ruiz said.

His district includes Eastern Coachella Valley, and parts of Imperial and San Bernardino counties.

What’s another path forward?

Perez, with the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, said these limitations on government oversight meant a private lawsuit might be the most effective route for families, such as Ayala-Uribe’s, to take. But he noted that lawsuits are costly and shifts the burden to individuals rather than the state.

""Lawsuits are slow. Lawsuits are expensive. Lawsuits are emotionally trying,"" Perez said, adding that it means those who have lost loved ones are ""continuously traumatized"" and must be the ones to labor in getting justice.

Image credit: WikipediaYou can read the report online here.

The briefing follows the Government's June publication of its Industrial Strategy, which includes £625 million in funding to train 60,000 skilled construction workers by 2029. Despite this investment, the Construction Industry Training Board estimates that an additional 240,000 workers will be needed over five years to meet house building targets.

Under the proposed immigration reforms in the Government's White Paper, construction roles will be included on the new Temporary Shortage List, allowing recruitment at lower skill levels. The then Home Yvette Cooper confirmed that ""construction workers will be on the Temporary Shortage List because they are clearly crucial to growth in our economy."" Workers in these roles will face restrictions, including being unable to bring dependants and limited eligibility for settlement.

WoRC noted: ""[N]ew workers arriving in the UK in Temporary Shortage List construction roles will not be able to bring dependants with them. Similarly, the government currently plans for recruitment from this list to end by 31 December 2026. The government's intention is for access to this labour pool to be temporary by nature. This, combined with the government's other plans to extend the qualifying periods for settlement in the UK, mean it is currently unlikely that those sponsored to work in Temporary Shortage List roles will in the future be eligible to apply for indefinite leave to remain.""

WoRC later adds that the introduction of the Temporary Shortage List is ultimately part of a growing policy trend that treats migrant workers as a disposable labour force, undeserving of the rights and entitlements that would lift them out of work and immigration-related precarity.

The report compares the construction sector's vulnerabilities to those seen in social care, where the expansion of the Health and Care Worker visa to cover a shortage of care workers led to widespread exploitation and abuse. WoRC finds there are a number of important similarities between construction and social care with regard to the UK's work sponsorship system, and warns it could likely lead to similar problems for construction workers.

WoRC highlights, for example: ""The transient and flexible work arrangements that exist within the construction sector and the prevalence of self-employment make it poorly aligned with the rigidity of existing sponsorship rules. This is similar to what transpired in the care sector, where a large number of available roles were actually in domiciliary care (characterised by hyper flexible work and contractual arrangements), which did not align to rigid rules around the requirement for full-time hours to be provided. If subsequent enforcement action is taken on this issue, it is likely to plunge a large number of workers into limbo at short notice.""

The report also cautions against adopting a labour provider model akin to the Seasonal Worker visa, citing risks such as debt bondage and concentrated power among operators. WoRC calls for flexibility to be central when it comes to building safeguarding measures into immigration rules. Drawing on extensive casework, the organisation highlights how rigid visa sponsorship rules, particularly those that tie workers to individual employers, not only undermine workers' human rights but also create significant practical barriers that fail to reflect the realities of how work is carried out on the ground.

To mitigate the risks, WoRC briefing proposes removing employers from the visa grant process entirely, thereby allowing workers greater mobility. As a more cautious alternative, it suggests sector-based sponsorship, echoing recommendations previously made by Unison in the social care sector. While acknowledging that this would not resolve all underlying issues, WoRC says it would at least prevent immigration rules from worsening conditions. It also calls for complementary safeguards, such as extended timeframes for workers to change sponsors and the introduction of a ""Workplace Justice visa."" Although the Government's Immigration White Paper hinted at exploring such measures, the report notes that ""nothing concrete has materialised thus far.""

In concluding, the report notes that the Government is stuck in an impossible balancing act: maintaining the veneer of a hostile immigration rhetoric while simultaneously relying on migrant labour to drive economic growth before the next general election.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/UK_Visa.jpg/640px-UK_Visa.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 11:57:25.460648

The party has also promised it would make migrants reapply for their visa every five years and would stop anyone other than British citizens from accessing welfare benefits.

Overall, the party claims that it could save the British public 234 billion pounds (about 267 billion euros) over the next ""several decades.""

InfoMigrants takes a closer look at the party's claims and how realistic they are.

Asylum seekers in the UK scapegoated amid economic precarity

What are the claims?

In a paper published last year for the general election, Reform UK says they are aiming for ""smart immigration, not mass immigration."" They say that ""all non-essential immigration"" would be ""frozen to protect public services, boost wages, end the housing crisis and cut crime.""

Tackling migration -- what Reform UK is promising:

Channel crossings: The party promises to ""detain and deport"" all those who arrive in the UK via small boat, and ""if needed, migrants in small boats will be picked up and taken back to France.""

A ""four-point plan"" to stop boats from crossing the Channel. This would include leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, forbidding the possibility for ""illegal immigrants to be resettled in the UK."" It would also create a ""new department for immigration,"" and pick up ""illegal migrants out of boats and take them back to France.""

Asylum process: ""All asylum seekers that arrive illegally from safe countries will be processed rapidly, offshore if necessary."" Furthermore, Reform UK says that ""Those entering from a safe country will also be barred from claiming asylum or citizenship.""

There would be ""no legal aid for non-citizens,"" and ""those rejected will be returned.""

Dealing with criminals: Reform UK says that any ""foreign criminals"" would be ""immediately deported, after their prison sentence ends"" and proposes to ""withdraw citizenship from immigrants who commit a crime with the exception of some misdemeanor offenses.""

Residency: Student dependents, so dependents of those on a student visa in the UK, would be ""barred.""

A ""five-year residency and employment"" hurdle to anyone wishing to claim benefits in the UK.

An ""immigration tax"", making the national insurance rate (the current tax paid by all UK employees towards their healthcare and pension) 20 percent of their earnings for all foreign workers. This, claims Reform, ""would incentivize business to employ British citizens whose National Insurance rates would stay at 13.8 percent."" Only those regarded as ""essential"" (for instance healthcare workers) would be exempt from the tax. According to Reform, these measures could raise ""more than 20 billion over five years"" that would then be used to ""pay for the apprenticeships and training for young Brits.""

All in all, Reform claimed that these proposals would help save the UK between five and ten billion pounds (between 5.7 and 11 billion euros) per year.

Abolishing ILR

Reform UK this week also announced the party intends to abolish indefinite leave to remain (ILR). Farage claimed this would make sure that those who were allowed to stay in the UK for the duration of their visas were contributing to the British economy, as having to reapply for a visa every five years would ensure they fulfilled hurdles like being in full employment, having a high standard of English and earning above a certain salary threshold in order to qualify for their visas.

ILR, said Farage, also gave people an automatic right to benefits and conferred upon people all the rights enjoyed by other British citizens. Something he wants to be harder to come by.

Farage told reporters that he believed that Britain should not be ""the world’s food bank,"" and ""it is not for us to provide welfare for people coming in from all over the world.""

How realistic and implementable are these claims?

Many of the policies outlined by Farage would require law changes and treaty changes to rescind rights and status already granted, in some cases, to hundreds of thousands of people.

His costings and potential savings have also been called into question by experts and politicians.

Returning people to France, or removing them from boats mid-voyage would currently be impossible under international maritime law and conventions, not to mention, it is unlikely that the French would accept such a proposal. The current Anglo-French accord allows for a 'one in, one out' policy. So far, four migrants have been sent back to France under the pilot scheme and the French authorities admitted to the French news agency Agence France Presse (AFP) this week that finding eligible migrants to send to the UK is proving difficult.

The first three migrants from France were sent to the UK this week.

Processing migrants offshore has so far proved impossible to do. The Conservative government's Rwanda plan failed, after costing billions and was scrapped by the current Labour government. Italy's attempt to process asylum seekers in Albania has also not proved to be the success anticipated by the Italian government. Most attempts run into legal challenges, even though the EU and even the current British government have expressed interest in finding ""third country"" solutions to dealing with asylum claims.

Leaving the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) would be complicated and could have far-reaching consequences, placing the UK apart from most other Western countries, which could affect its international standing, as well as day-to-day legislation and case law.

According to the UK in a Changing Europe, an academic think tank providing impartial research-based analysis of the UK’s relationship with the EU and hosted by King’s College in London, ""if the UK withdrew from the ECHR there would be inevitable international consequences.""

These would range from affecting the Belfast/Good Friday agreement, which brought a peace settlement to Northern Ireland after years of violence, killing and deaths. It would also further strain relations with the EU and could affect the UK-EU trade and cooperation agreement, the think tank points out in a report published in May 2024.

""Experts also agree that withdrawal would be at odds with the UK’s integrated review of security, defense, development and foreign policy,"" all things that are based on the UK’s commitment to international law and universal human rights.

Leaving the ECHR would also affect law in the UK, since the British Human Rights Act (passed in 1998) is based on the rights enshrined in the ECHR. So, in order to leave the ECHR, the government would also have to repeal the HRA, which would require the government to pass another act to replace it. And that would also require parliamentary approval.

Being a signatory to the ECHR is a condition for membership in the Council of Europe. So, if the UK were to leave the ECHR, it would also have to leave the Council of Europe, the report authors state. Both steps would involve legislative changes at the international and domestic levels.

Formal notification of the intention to withdraw from the ECHR would take six months. On the domestic level, the government would need the approval of parliament.

Are legislative changes possible?

Passing bills in the UK can take months if not years. Some don’t pass within a full parliamentary term, since they require not only majorities to vote for them, but also a series of debates in both parliamentary houses and with all MPs and lords involved, of all political persuasions. Bills are subject to rounds of modifications and more votes before they finally make their way to seek royal assent and are passed into law.

However, even when a bill passes the lower house of parliament, the upper House of Lords can order more modifications before sending it back to the lower house for another round of votes that often result in some of the more extreme policies being modified quite heavily.

Only governments with very strong majorities are able to pass legislation slightly more quickly, as if all MPs in the ruling party or coalition agree, then there might be fewer modifications.

The UK electoral system, which operates a first-past-the-post electoral system, has favored the two main parties (Labour and Conservative) up until now. Even in the 2024 election, where Reform came second in terms of the number of votes in many constituencies, they didn't gain many actual seats. They currently hold five in the UK parliament. This is compared to Labour's 399.

Past experience also shows that previous attempts to introduce an alternative Bill of Rights floundered in parliament. In June 2022, the then Conservative Minister of Justice Dominic Raab attempted to introduce a Bill of Rights that he hoped would make it harder for people to bring claims via the ECHR. Even though the UK clarified it did not at that point intend to leave the ECHR, the bill failed to progress through parliament.

'No basis in reality'

Britain’s current Chancellor (Finance Minister), Rachel Reeves, declared that Farage’s claims ""have no basis in reality,"" and that the UK government is already looking at restricting migrants' welfare access. The British government is also, according to the BBC, already consulting on whether or not to double the average wait for migrants applying for ILR from the current five years to ten.

The Labour government has also noted that some of the financial figures used by Farage came from a report authored by the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS), a think tank founded by former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

The figures used in that report were later challenged by the Office for Budget Responsibility, a watchdog set up to assess and calculate government budgets and later the CPS admitted that these figures ""should no longer be used.""

'Half-baked and unworkable'

Ben Chu, a correspondent with the BBC’s Verify department, told viewers that he would be ""very very wary"" of the figures claimed by Farage. Firstly because the CPS had withdrawn their own figures and said that they would put out another set later, but haven’t yet, and secondly because it is very difficult to estimate exactly how many people might be affected by a policy, how much they might or might not contribute to, or cost, the UK economy, or even whether withdrawing a right, might end up costing the country more than allowing for those with ILR to continue with their current status.

Chu also points out that the estimates were not for any given year, but for how much people who might get ILR might cost the British taxpayer over ""their lifetime"" which is ""difficult to estimate."" Chu explained on BBC’s Newscast, ""Speaking to labor market experts who are looking at how that estimate was arrived at, and the actual numbers of what recent migrants to the UK are earning, and could reasonably be expected to continue earning, over their lifetimes, they don’t think it’s a credible figure.""

Reeves told the BBC ""the numbers that Reform have come out with overnight have already begun to disassemble.""

The Conservative Party's shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp also branded Reform’s plans ""half-baked and unworkable.""

Philp told the BBC that he believed Reform are ""a one-man band with no experience of government, and their reckless, left-wing economics mean more debt, more spending, more tax.""

The Liberal Democrats also said that Reform’s proposals were ""not serious."" Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey spent much of his party conference speech picking apart why it would be dangerous to allow Reform into power. Reform are currently ahead in the polls, were there to be an election held right now.

How many people might Reform’s policies affect?

Reform claims that the changes would lead to ""hundreds of thousands of people having to apply and ultimately losing their settled status in the UK.""

Head of Policy for Reform, Zia Yusuf, said the party believed that ""many of those who will lose their leave to remain are entirely dependent on the welfare state and will leave voluntarily upon losing access to benefits.""

Those who don’t leave, Yusuf promised, ""would be subject to immigration enforcement as part of our mass deportation program.""

The exact number of people who might be affected is difficult to quantify, since it is based on people who might potentially apply for ILR in the future, and not all migrants might stay long enough, or want to apply for that.

However, data obtained from the Home Office by the BBC demonstrates that there has been a gradual increase in the number of people granted ILR in the UK over the last decade.

At the end of 2024, estimates from the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford showed that the total population of non-EU citizens with ILR stood at 430,000. These people, under Reform’s plans, could be the ones targeted to lose their ILR status and be forced to apply for visas.

Reform has said that EU nationals granted ILR under the European Union Withdrawal Agreement (whereby EU citizens who had been living and working in the UK could apply for settled status there), who number around four million, would not lose their status under their policy proposals. However, EU nationals not benefiting from those provisions, reported the BBC, would be subject to the new system.

In July this year, the Department for Work and Pensions published figures suggesting that 213,666 people with ILR were claiming Universal Credit (welfare) benefits. According to the BBC, EU nationals with protection, who are not being targeted by Farage’s policies, actually make up the ""majority of benefit claimants by people with ILR.""

According to Ben Chu of BBC Verify, ""in the year ending June 2025, there were 163,000 grants of ILR to non-EU citizens."" As for those who might go on to claim ILR in the future, at the end of 2024, Chu reports that there were around four million people in the UK on temporary visas. These people arrived between 2015 and 2024.

Experts at the Migration Observatory, reported Chu, believe that just over half of those four million (2.1 million) could claim a potential path to settlement. Although Chu says it is really difficult to quantify how many people it might affect, Farage’s proposals could end up splitting families and affecting a ""very very large number of people currently residing in the UK.""

Despite other parties' quick dismissal of his policies, Farage claims that his proposals will force the other parties to take note and adopt some of his policies to regain popularity among the British electorate.

Current policies to reduce migration

The Labour government says that it is already pursuing policies to reduce migration and ""bring down illegal migration."" Chancellor Rachel Reeves told the BBC that her government has ""sent a record number of people who have no right to be in our country home. We’re reducing the use of hotels for asylum seekers and we’ve made an agreement with France to send people back who come over on small boats.""

Reeves added that ""those are all steps towards our ambitions to get a grip of this situation that we inherited.""

Information provided to InfoMigrants by the Home Office this week underlines that the current Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, introduced a bill in parliament, when she was still Minister for Justice, that would allow for ""immediate deportations"" of foreign criminals, and would obviate the need for them to serve any of their sentence before being deported.

The government also introduced secondary legislation that came into effect on September 23, which allows for the deportation of prisoners with no right to be in the country once they have served 30 percent of their sentence. Currently, they can be deported after serving 50 percent of their allotted time in jail.

The Home Office underlines that since taking office on July 5, 2024, they have deported 5,179 foreign national offenders, which marks a 14 percent increase compared to the 4,532 returns operated in the last year of the Conservative government’s rule.",https://scd.infomigrants.net/media/resize/my_image_small/74864afef331e2a4d3af02f3eba72013eef16698.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 11:57:31.674000

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS — PROSECUTIONS

A federal grand jury yesterday indicted former FBI Director James Comey on one count of making a false statement and one count of obstruction of a congressional proceeding in relation to the testimony he gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2020. The indictment was signed only by Lindsey Halligan, Trump’s former attorney and the new interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, who personally presented the case to the jury. According to court records, the jury rejected Halligan’s attempt to indict Comey on a second false statement charge. Devlin Barrett, Glenn Thrush, and Alan Feuer report for the New York Times.

In response to the indictment, Comey yesterday proclaimed his innocence, stating “I have great confidence in the federal judicial system, and I’m innocent, so, let’s have a trial.” Comey added that “My family and I have known for years that there are costs to standing up to Donald Trump, but … [w]e will not live on our knees, and you shouldn’t either.” According to sources, Troy Edwards, a senior federal prosecutor who is Comey’s son-in-law, announced his resignation in response to the indictment, saying that he is quitting “to uphold my oath to the Constitution and country.” Kyle Cheney and Josh Gerstein report for POLITICO.

A senior official in the office of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on Monday instructed more than a half dozen U.S. attorney’s offices to draft plans to investigate the Open Society Foundations, a grant group funded by George Soros to support democratic initiatives around the world, the New York Times reports. According to the Times, the official’s directive suggests that the DOJ leaders are following orders from Trump that specific people or groups be subject to criminal investigation. Devlin Barrett reports.

Senior DOJ leaders are also pushing for charges to be filed against Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton this week, according to sources. Some of the DOJ leadership see Bolton’s case as a means of bringing forward one of the criminal cases sought by Trump, a different source added. DOJ prosecutors currently think they could bring a stronger case against Bolton by the end of the year. Katelyn Polantz and Hannah Rabinowitz report for CNN.

OTHER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth yesterday ordered hundreds of U.S. military generals and admirals to gather at Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, next week, without stating his reasons for issuing the directive. A Pentagon spokesperson affirmed that Hegseth “will be addressing his senior military leaders early next week,” but provided no additional details. Several sources who spoke to the Washington Post about Hegseth’s directive voiced concerns about the security implications of the impromptu gathering, and the potential it could collide with a government shutdown. Tara Copp, Dan Lamothe, Alex Horton, Ellen Nakashima, and Noah Robertson report.

In a presidential memorandum, Trump yesterday ordered the DHS, the DOJ, and the Treasury Department to tackle alleged “domestic terrorism” and “organized political violence” by coming up with a “strategy to investigate, prosecute, and disrupt entities and individuals engaged in acts of political violence and intimidation” and their funders. The memorandum singles out an alleged rise in left-wing political violence. Ivan Pereira reports for ABC News; Devlin Barrett reports for the New York Times.

Attorney General Pam Bondi this week summarily fired the third federal prosecutor working in the Southern District of Florida. According to multiple sources, Bondi fired the prosecutor, Will Rosenzweig, because he said negative things about Trump on a social media blog while working for the prominent law firm Kobre & Kim in Washington during Trump’s first term. Jay Weaver reports for the Miami Herald.

The federal Bureau of Prisons yesterday announced it is ending a collective bargaining agreement with its workers, stripping them of union rights. “The whole purpose of ending this contract is to make your lives better,” the Bureau’s Director, William Marshall, said in a message to employees. Michael R. Sisak reports for AP News.

The law was put to use on September 12, when three Turkish citizens were convicted of illegal residence and handed stiff jail sentences. Two men were given two years of imprisonment and fines of 5,000 euros ($5,870), while the third, aged 19, the youngest of the group, was handed a 10-month prison sentence.

Athens plans to test-drive the law through a likely minefield of legal challenges in the coming months. Humanitarian organisations say the measure unfairly includes children and stigmatises refugees and migrants as criminals.

Greek Minister for Migration and Asylum Thanos Plevris told Parliament on September 2 that the law was “the strictest returns policy in the whole EU” and claimed there was “a lot of interest from European countries, especially EU members, to adopt this law as a law that will force an illegal migrant to return”.

Rights groups, which are gearing up to challenge the legislation, say it far outshoots a draft Returns Regulation the European Commission wants to make binding on all member states by June 2026.

The new law has shortened deadlines and raised penalties for unauthorised residence.

For example, rejected asylum applicants will be fitted with ankle monitors and given just two weeks to remove themselves voluntarily. If they do not, they face, like the two Turkish nationals, a 5,000-euro ($5,870) fine and between two and five years of confinement in closed camps.

Children, more than a fifth of arrivals this year, are not exempt. If people wish to appeal, they have to do it in four days.

“We always claim that it’s not legal to put children in detention,” said Federica Toscano from Save the Children. The law is “not aligned with the [UN] Convention on the Rights of the Child”, and is “absolutely challengeable”.

The Greek Ombudsman, an independent authority monitoring public services, also objected to the law’s maximum reprieve of 60 days, down from 120, so children can complete their school year.

The Ombudsman suggested the law sets out to prove the proposition that all undocumented people are criminals.

Ankle monitors, it said, which are not mentioned in the draft Returns Regulation, “deepen the view of migrants as criminals and put their treatment on a par with that reserved for indictees, convicts and prisoners on leave”.

Electronic tagging is “a massive programme that costs a lot of money and involves a whole web of private actors. So I think that would be pretty difficult to set up”, said Hope Barker, an independent researcher on migration.

“Refugees are entitled to effective access to international protection without punishment for violating migration policy,” says the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Under the Geneva Convention, “the quest for asylum … is not a criminal offence, but a human right”.

The EU approves about 45 percent of asylum applications on average.

Of the remainder, 90 percent end up staying on European soil because there is no effective policy to return them, say European officials.

“Without a returns policy, no migration policy has any meaning,” said Greece’s then-migration minister, Makis Voridis, presenting the new proposals in Parliament’s European Affairs Committee on May 15.

Irregular entry into the country has been raised to a felony. Anyone arriving without documents can be detained for two years, up from 18 months.

A provision that legalises anyone after seven years of undocumented residence is being abolished.

Greece’s predicament

Plevris has defended the hardened law, arguing that Greece guards external EU borders.

“It’s easy to defend borders when there’s three or four countries people have to cross to get to you. Compare us to other first reception countries,” he said.

Since 2015, Greece has been the arrival point of 46 percent of more than 2.8 million undocumented people entering Europe, according to UNHCR.

Many have moved on to other EU member states, but because of EU rules, rejected asylum seekers or asylum recipients who lose their protected status would be returned to their country of arrival in the EU for deportation.

Greek officials admit they do not expect refugees and migrants to spend five years in detention. The draconian rules, they say, are designed to force them to return voluntarily once they are convicted.

That is because it is legally difficult to deport anyone forcibly.

The law has a second aim – to deter what Greece views as so-called economic migrants travelling to Europe when there are Geneva Convention signatories closer to home.

Greece’s Union of Administrative Judges objected that the law did not define flight risk, leaving incarceration decisions to the discretion of the police. The law “needs to provide a comprehensive list of criteria, not an indicative one”, it said.

The Council of Bar Associations of Greece also weighed in with objections to tightened deadlines for appeal and the criminalisation of undocumented entry.

“Danger to life and limb vastly outranks whatever law is broken by entering Greece illegally,” it said.

The EU’s guinea pig?

Repeatedly, these bodies pointed out, the new law violates the existing EU Returns Regulation, which dates back to 2008, but observers of EU migration policy say the European Commission is deliberately allowing Greece to push the boundaries.

“Greece has become something of a testing ground for many EU measures, especially on the Greek islands,” Amnesty International’s Olivia Sundberg told Al Jazeera, citing the Closed Controlled Access Centres built to house thousands of asylum seekers.

“In a lot of ways, Greece is a place that has tested things out before they became EU law, and if they worked well, they were carried over into [EU] directives,” she said.

The EU is now looking for ways to implement returns.

“There is this whole push for what they call ‘innovative solutions’,” said Barker. “So one of these is obviously return hubs in third countries, another is getting people to sign up to voluntary returns,” she told Al Jazeera.

Italy has been testing third-country hubs through a deal with Albania, but Italian courts have ordered some of the asylum seekers sent there for processing returned to Italy.

Greece’s law casts a wider net, suggesting returnees should seek protection in any safe country closer to their country of origin.

But Greece’s Ombudsman has objected to this.

Passing the burden “allows a return process to a country the returnee doesn’t come from, or hasn’t passed through and has no connection to, except that it is geographically close to his country of origin. In this case, it’s no longer a ‘returns’ procedure but a ‘displacement’ procedure”, the Ombudsman said.

Some observers say Europe is in danger of falling short of its own human rights charter.

“Migration is becoming a rule of law issue rather than an implementation of law issue,” said Amnesty’s Sundberg.

Others point out that Europe is an ageing continent in need of more workers to sustain its tax base and social security systems in the coming decades.

“How are we going to create an environment of reception of the people we need, when we take this type of measure?” asked Lefteris Papayiannakis, who heads the Greek Council for Refugees, a legal aid charity. “If you can’t attract them, what’s your next move?”

Besides, he said, the measures exude desperation.

“You’re creating an impression now that you’re not in control. But if we compare the situation now with 2015, or the [flight of] Ukrainians in 2022, it’s a completely different situation,” Papayiannakis said.

“How can you justify being up in arms now about a very small number of migrants compared to the number … you’re going to need?”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-02T181557Z_27109918_RC2UJGA0V288_RTRMADP_3_MIGRATION-GREECE-PROTEST-1758793786.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-09-26 11:57:35.790936

Professional photographer Raphi Talisman’s video shows officers detaining a man at the business intersection of Hamilton Street and Queens Chapel Road in Hyattsville. Officers are seen trying to handcuff a man on the ground. At one point, an officer's gun dropped to the ground, and he lunged to pick it up and appeared to point it.

Talisman had dropped his child off at school just before 8:30 a.m. when he saw what was happening and started to record.

“It could have gotten way out of control very quickly,” he said. “It was such a dangerous situation.”

Drivers honked their horns, and some yelled at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers as they struggled to put the man in handcuffs.

The detainee's cries were heartbreaking, Talisman said.

“I love America,” the detainee is heard saying on video showing two officers holding him down.

“The real thing was the brutality of it all. It's disgusting,” Talisman said.

The video spread on social media.

Prince George’s County Council member Wanika Fisher said she was angered and saddened by it. She emphasized county police do not work with ICE in making arrests.

“I don’t think it's something that we accept,” she said, “and I think filming interactions like that show the community what their federal government is doing in this constant dog and pony show. I think it’s important to bring awareness to our community.”

The arrest was in an area with a diverse population and several popular Hispanic businesses and restaurants. State Del. Deni Taveras, D-Prince George’s County, said the incident makes some fearful to go out and support those businesses.

“This administration is not creating a safe environment,” she said. “We feel very afraid for our lives, literally.

ICE has said officers identify themselves when making arrests and can wear masks to protect their identities.

Police eventually placed the man in handcuffs and put him in a van. It’s unclear why the officers arrested the man or if he's facing charges.

News4 reached out to ICE but has not received a response.

Talisman said videos like his are spreading awareness of what ICE is doing in the community.

“If ICE is attacking one part of the community, they're attacking all of us,” he said.

Telemundo 44 spoke to another witness, who said he was scared by the officer holding the gun.

The U.S. adheres to a global asylum system first laid out in the 1951 Refugee Convention and enshrined into U.S. law in 1980.","NEW YORK -- The Trump administration pitched several other countries Thursday on its view that the global system for seeking asylum, in effect since World War II, has been rampantly abused and urged them to join the United States in cracking down on such migration.

Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau led the discussion on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly alongside representatives from Kosovo, Bangladesh, Liberia and Panama. Landau's gathering allowed American officials to gauge early support and interest for what could be a massive revamp of the asylum system.

“If you have hundreds of thousands of fake asylum seekers, then what happens to the real asylum system?” Landau said in his opening remarks. “Saying the process is susceptible to abuse is not xenophobic; it is not being a mean or bad person.”

The U.S. said changes must, at a minimum, embrace asylum as a temporary status and dictate that those seeking protection should eventually return home. The Trump administration also emphasized that there is no right to receive asylum in a country of choice and that decisions are governed by individual nations, not multinational organizations.

Human rights groups watched from the sidelines with unease.

Bill Frelick, Human Rights Watch’s director of refugee and migrant rights, said the U.S. proposal “looks like the first step in a bid to tear down the global refugee system.” He faulted the proposal for not embracing a core principle of the current system that people should not be sent to countries where they face persecution.

Filippo Grandi, the U.N. refugee chief, sat in the audience as the world leaders on the panel applauded the Trump administration’s controversial approach to asylum and migration. Grandi, whose organization advocates for those in forced displacement, used the Q & A portion of the event to plead with Landau to take advantage of organizations like his as the U.S. moves forward with this shift in nearly 80 years of policy.

“The right to seek asylum, which my organization upholds, is not incompatible with sovereignty,” Grandi said to the panel. He added that instead of rushing to halt the global asylum process, “the key is to address the root causes” that force people to flee in the first place.

The U.S. has been the top destination for asylum-seekers by far since 2017, with Germany a distant second, according to 2024 figures from the U.N. refugee agency. President Donald Trump and his allies say people with weak cases have abused the system to gain entry to the United States, obtaining work permits while their cases take years to wind through backlogged immigration courts.

The U.S. adheres to a global asylum system first laid out in the 1951 Refugee Convention and enshrined into U.S. law in 1980.

People seeking refuge in the U.S. are able to apply for asylum once they are on American soil, regardless of whether they came legally. To qualify, they have to show a fear of persecution in their own country because of specific reasons, such as their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. Refugees meet a similar standard by applying abroad.

Once someone is granted asylum, they can't be deported, they can work legally, bring immediate family, apply for legal residency and eventually seek U.S. citizenship. It offers a permanent future in the U.S.

The panelists Thursday, despite their countries facing varying degrees of migration, appeared to agree that economic migration, in which an individual flees to another country for better financial opportunities, has been conflated with individuals seeking asylum for safety purposes.

Vjosa Osmani Sadriu, the president of Kosovo, talked about her own refugee experience, saying that people like her who are experiencing real dangers and persecution are suffering from loopholes of the asylum system.

“We all came to the conclusion is that it is the illegal migration that must be challenged in order to protect and preserve the integrity of those who are real asylum seekers, of those who are legal citizens and those who respect the rules and respect the law,” she said.

The number of people coming to the U.S.-Mexico border seeking asylum has ballooned in recent years, overloading immigration courts and leading to cries that the system is being abused by people who are coming for jobs or other reasons that don't meet the standards for asylum.

Facing mounting criticism over the large numbers of migrants coming to the border, the Biden administration took steps that severely curtailed asylum access.

The first day in office, Trump signed an order declaring an invasion at the southern border and said he was “suspending the physical entry” of migrants and their ability to seek asylum until he decides it is over. Immigration advocates have sued, and the issue is before the courts.

He held several jobs since entering the country illegally in 2008, often afraid to out himself by speaking Spanish.

José says he fled to the United States from El Salvador as a teenager after he faced violence from gangs, which he didn’t want to join. So strong was the call of the American dream, he says, that after he crossed the southern border and U.S. officials flew him home, José crossed a second time.

Now, José sees America at a distance once again. He voluntarily left this summer to avoid detention. He and his family, now in Europe, plan to start a new life there through legal pathways. Like other immigrants interviewed for this story, he asked the Monitor to omit his full name for privacy and security concerns.

Why We Wrote This

Part of the Trump administration’s immigration clampdown involves encouraging unauthorized immigrants to “self-deport” by offering cash and other incentives. A growing number are deciding to leave the U.S. on their own.

José, whom the Monitor met through his attorney, found no clear way to legalize his status in the U.S., though his wife and 8-year-old daughter are citizens. He watched as President Donald Trump ramped up a nationwide deportation campaign, including sending men to a notorious Salvadoran prison. He mulled his family’s future. Like José, millions of immigrants – with and without lawful status – are thinking through whether to leave on their own.

“The American dream was a lie,” José says. “I don’t have to work 72 hours a week.” Not only does he have less stress since leaving, he says, “Nobody’s hunting me anymore.”

The Department of Homeland Security has spent over half a year urging unauthorized immigrants like him to leave, offering travel assistance, a $1,000 “exit bonus,” and forgiveness of immigration-related fines if they use a certain app. A public relations campaign by top government officials, and posters in the nation’s immigration courts, emphasize a call to “self-deport.” It’s part of the overall message that the U.S. is inhospitable to people who don’t have proper documents.

“If you don’t [leave], we will find you. And we will deport you,” Secretary Kristi Noem said in a DHS ad campaign this past winter.

The government’s call to self-deport has raised fear and confusion in the homes of some immigrants, along with difficult questions about where they belong: to the original country they left or to the U.S., where they’ve made a life. Their advocates warn of unknowns – such as how data will be used – if they use a promoted government app to schedule a free departure. Immigration enforcement proponents take a different view, praising President Trump’s “Project Homecoming” campaign as a way to save money on detention costs.

For all the anti-immigrant campaigns throughout U.S. history, most people have not “packed up and left the country,” says Adam Goodman, a professor at the University of Illinois Chicago and author of “The Deportation Machine.”

Yet, under this administration, he says, “I don’t think we’ve ever seen anything that is so coordinated, in terms of orchestration, of encouraging people to self-deport and then documenting their departure.”

How many immigrants are leaving the U.S.?

Homeland Security this week said that more than 2 million unauthorized immigrants have left the United States during the second Trump term. Most – an estimated 1.6 million – are self-deportations, said the government, while the rest are deportations. An estimated 14 million unauthorized immigrants lived in the U.S. as of 2023.

The administration has not published monthly data on deportations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, instead issuing periodic press statements. Last month, the administration cited a 1.6 million figure on all unauthorized immigrant departures so far, from an estimate by the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank promoting reduced immigration. While it’s difficult to discern the full scope of departures, given data limitations, the nonpartisan Pew Research Center published a similar estimated decline for the immigrant population overall.

The U.S. has used coercive campaigns to oust immigrants for more than a century, says Dr. Goodman. A “repatriation” effort to remove Mexicans – including Mexican Americans – emerged during the Great Depression. In some cases, local, state, and federal agencies incentivized departures by paying for travel tickets, a precursor to today, he says.

In March, the U.S. government repurposed an app called CBP One that the Biden administration had used to schedule appointments for asylum-seekers and other migrants as a way to enter the country lawfully. Conservatives argued that the process enabled a back door for otherwise illegal immigration. Now called CBP Home, the app is touted by the Trump administration as a way for unauthorized immigrants to document their intent to depart voluntarily, avoiding fines and arrest.

In May, Homeland Security said an initial “voluntary charter flight” of 64 people took off to Honduras and Colombia.

The self-deportation campaign is “genius,” says Scott Mechkowski, a retired Immigration and Customs Enforcement official. Funding voluntary travel home is cheaper than “the cost of detaining somebody – and then removing them,” he says.

Unauthorized immigrants want to avoid detention and deportation, advocates say. Still, “There’s a lot of fear around using the app” to leave, says Christina Wilkes, an immigration attorney in Maryland.

Part of that fear stems from confusion around how the app works. A DHS webpage says noncitizens requesting assistance will have their departures arranged within an estimated 21 days. It’s unclear whether someone who alerts the government, but leaves on their own, faces the same deadline. There are also questions around how their data will be used, including if someone tries to reenter in the future. Typically, unauthorized immigrants who want to return to the U.S. lawfully can face yearslong bans.

José filled out his information on CBP Home and had an in-person appointment to take his photo and fingerprints. After weeks passed without further instructions, José bought his own ticket abroad. He couldn’t verify his departure through the app, and says he never received the $1,000.

The app is “very confusing,” says José.

“Tens of thousands” of unauthorized immigrants have used the CBP Home app, according to Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary for public affairs at DHS. The department has not directly answered several questions sent by the Monitor – including how many people have received travel assistance and the exit bonus.

Brothers decide

Many immigrants, like Santos, aren’t ready to leave.

The college-aged construction worker says he crossed the southern border illegally, years ago, to avoid the cost and bureaucracy of a visa. Santos says he used to work for a Trump-supporting dairy farmer without days off.

At the start of the new administration, his brother returned to Mexico. That departure was “very difficult for me,” says Santos, now alone in the United States.

“I have friends and acquaintances, but it’s not the same as having your family here,” he says.

Santos says he fears deportation, and now leads a “more hidden life” in which he sticks close to work and home. Staying is a financial decision.

“Someone from the family needs to stay here and subsidize expenses in Mexico,” including care for his parents, he says. Santos has been seeking a way to legalize his status through a special visa.

When finding a job in the U.S. isn’t so easy

Some Haitians have decided to return home, despite gang violence and a political crisis, because they can’t support themselves here, says Sabyne Denaud, senior program and contract manager at the International Institute of New England.

“Back home, they wonder about safety. But here, they wonder about housing. They wonder about jobs,” she says. The Trump administration has also moved to end temporary legal status for Haitians and Venezuelans, cases that face ongoing litigation.

Gina flew back to Haiti on her own a few months ago, without notifying the U.S. government. She didn’t see any other option.

Her cousin sponsored her to come to New York last year through a Biden-era parole program that offered work permits. But her cousin’s family excluded her from meals, she says, leaving Gina to seek food on the street. A friend recommended Massachusetts, a hub of the Haitian diaspora. Even there, Gina struggled to find a job.

“I couldn’t sleep at home because I was very stressed out,” Gina says in Haitian Creole through an interpreter. She also learned she was pregnant with her first child.

Gina, whom the Monitor met through a group that helped her in the U.S., says she feels safe in her coastal town away from the capital, Port-au-Prince, even though she calls the overall situation in her country “very, very bad.” She wants to find a job, and make sure her child “has a good life.”

A previous effort yielded little results

Under President George W. Bush, ICE tried to incentivize those exits through a pilot program known as Scheduled Departure.

The agency had spent significant time and money to identify people who had removal orders, but hadn’t left, according to Jim Hayes, a former ICE official who says he came up with the pilot program in 2008.

Scheduled Departure was meant to test ICE critics’ theory that the agency could deport people in a manner “less painful, less difficult for the people who were in the country illegally,” he says.

It didn’t attract many takers. During the campaign, which lasted three weeks, NPR reported at the time, only eight people took advantage. Roughly half a million people had been eligible.

The current administration’s self-deportation campaign is part of a “comprehensive enforcement strategy” that differs from the Bush approach in part through its use of technology, says Mr. Hayes, now vice president at Guidepost Solutions, a risk management firm.

As he tries to put down new roots in Europe, José says he’s shielded his 8-year-old daughter from much of his immigration saga so far.

“We just told her that we had to leave, and we’re going to a better place,” he says. “She understood.”

The EU’s renewed push to contain transit migration through Libya provides an oppor­tunity to assess the workings and consequences of its migration policy in the coun­try.
Although a change of course is unlikely – given the absence of alternative strategies to reduce arrivals – a sober evaluation of the political costs is essential.","A modest rise in irregular arrivals via Libya over the past two years has prompted a flurry of European shuttle diplomacy, which intensified in the summer of 2025. Whereas irregular arrivals along other migration routes to the EU declined in the first half of the year, there was a sudden surge from eastern Libya to Crete, generat­ing alarm in Greece. In response, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen dis­patched Commissioner for Internal Affairs and Migration Magnus Brunner to Tripoli and Benghazi. Joined by ministers from Greece, Italy, and Malta, Brunner met with representatives of the internationally recog­nised government in Tripoli in July to press for tougher measures to block departures – without any concrete results. The subsequent visit to Benghazi was cut short after the region’s de facto ruler, Khalifa Haftar, made an audience conditional on having the delegation officially meet his parallel government, which is not internationally recognised. When the Europeans refused, they were compelled to leave. Since then, Greece has launched training programmes for Haftar’s forces, following Italy’s lead. But European efforts to court Haftar go even further. At the end of July, the EU naval operation Irini intercepted a container ship whose inspection in a Greek port found that it was carrying armoured vehicles to Benghazi. Although this was a clear viola­tion of the United Nations (UN) arms em­bargo, the Greek government made sure that the vessel proceeded to Libya, appar­ently fearing that seizing it would jeopardise cooperation on migration. Meanwhile, crossings from eastern Libya to Crete con­tinue, even though Haftar’s forces could prevent them.

This sequence of events illustrates the state of EU migration policy in Libya. The EU’s cooperation on migration with Libyan authorities, which it has pursued since 2017, has become increasingly ineffective, even when measured by the number of arrivals. Yet, European policymakers are doubling down on their strategy of seeking arrangements with Haftar and western Libyan militia leaders to halt departures. In doing so, they are making themselves dependent on partners who are escalating their demands. The fact that a relatively small number of arrivals in Crete – just 7,336 in the first half of 2025 – triggered such alarm in Europe is only likely to embolden actors such as Haftar to raise the price for their cooperation.

The EU’s renewed push to contain transit migration through Libya provides an oppor­tunity to assess the workings and consequences of its migration policy in the coun­try. Beyond Haftar’s growing demands, there are further signs that the EU’s approach is reaching its limits.

The anti-ICE messaging surprised Joshua Jahn’s brother, Noah Jahn.
“He was one of those people that I would call for help, just in different situations, whether it be emotional support or physical support,” the troop member said.
According to Noah Jahn, his brother was “not a marksman” but knew how to use their parents’ rifle.","A 29-year-old Texas man opened fire on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas on Wednesday, the second instance in two weeks of a gunman setting up with a rifle on a rooftop, opening fire and communicating a message through writing on bullets.

Multiple senior law enforcement officials briefing on the investigation identified the shooter as Joshua Jahn. He was found dead with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Vice President JD Vance said evidence that is “not yet public” indicates the shooter was “politically motivated” to go after law enforcement and people enforcing the border.

Vance called Jahn “a violent left-wing extremist.” Authorities have yet to release an official motive. The FBI special agent in charge in Dallas, Joe Rothrock, said the attack was “targeted violence.”

Three detainees in a van in the facility’s sally port were shot. No ICE officers were hurt in the shooting, Dallas police said at a news conference. One person was killed, and two others are in critical condition, according to federal officials.

A bullet found near the shooter had the words “anti-ICE” written on it, according to the FBI. Other recent shooters, including those who assassinated Charlie Kirk and killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, have also engraved messages on bullets.

The anti-ICE messaging surprised Joshua Jahn’s brother, Noah Jahn.

“He didn’t have strong feelings about ICE as far as I knew,” Noah Jahn said of his brother, who DHS officials said fired at the ICE building “indiscriminately.”

Public records show that Joshua Jahn registered as an independent in Oklahoma and last voted in November.

In 2016, he was charged in Texas with delivering marijuana in an amount greater than ¼-ounce but less than 5 pounds. He pleaded guilty to the felony charge, records show.

Noah Jahn described his brother as “unique” but said he was not one he ever would have thought would be involved in a politically motivated shooting.

“I didn’t think he was politically interested,” he said. “He wasn’t interested in politics on either side as far as I knew.”

He said they grew up about 30 miles away in Allen, Texas. He said that they were Boy Scouts and that his brother took an interest in coding but was unemployed. Joshua Jahn had been planning to move onto their parents’ property in Oklahoma, his brother said.

Noah Jahn said that the last time he saw his brother was two weeks ago at their parents’ house and that nothing seemed out of the ordinary.

A man who said he had known Joshua Jahn since his early teens as a member of the same Boy Scout troop in Texas said Jahn did voice his opinions about politics, and he recalled a conversation several years ago about migrant caravans entering the United States.

“He was just upset about how people were not understanding people’s desperation to get out of bad situations and how immigration was being handled as a whole,” the troop member said.

The troop member, who asked not to be named for fear of harassment, said that the shooter was “passionate” about his stance on issues but that he did not know him to be “the action type of person.”

The troop member was surprised that Jahn had been identified as the shooter.

“He was pretty against it,” the fellow troop member said of the notion of gun violence, “so that’s why this is making it even more surprising. He was not somebody that would condone those kind of actions.”

The troop member said he remained friends with him as an adult but lost touch about five years ago when Jahn said he was planning to move to Oklahoma.

He said the shooter’s father was an active troop leader. He said Jahn had helped him move a couple of times.

“He was one of those people that I would call for help, just in different situations, whether it be emotional support or physical support,” the troop member said.

According to Noah Jahn, his brother was “not a marksman” but knew how to use their parents’ rifle.

The Trump Administration is specifically targeting Latino communities and racial profiling Hispanic and Latino families. These military-style raids, with masked and unidentified enforcement, are separating children from families and are simply un-American.

America is a country built by immigrants with the promise of freedom, equality and the pursuit of justice. The Trump Administration has made a mockery of that as it moves the United States toward an authoritarian state.

Our immigrant community is full of hard-working people who have come to this country to make a better life for themselves. A study by the independent think tank California Budget and Policy Center, published last year, found that undocumented immigrants paid nearly $100 billion in federal, state and local tax revenue in 2022 despite being shut out of the programs their taxes fund.

In California, undocumented immigrants contributed $8.5 billion in state and local taxes in 2022 — which would rise to $10.3 billion if these taxpayers were granted work authorization, according to the study.

Instead, the Trump Administration has painted undocumented immigrants as criminals, “killers, rapists and drug dealers,” and used that as justification for sending in the National Guard and conducting military-style immigration enforcement agents into cities such as Los Angeles, Washington, DC, and Chicago — unsurprisingly, cities run by Democratic administrations.

They continue to claim they are arresting “the worst of the worst” criminals. But the data, as documented in a study by the Brennan Center for Justice published in May 2024, does not support the claim that the United States is experiencing surging crime caused by immigrants. In fact, many studies have shown lower crime rates among immigrants compared to natural-born citizens. Instead, it is often hard-working, tax-paying members of our community who are the ones being taken away from their families — sometimes in the middle of their workday.

What’s clear is that the Trump Administration is using illegal immigration as a tool to further divide our country and to attack Democratic states and cities — he is inciting division. Standing up to Trump is not just about standing up for our values or political differences, it’s about protecting all Californians, including our immigrant families.

With a Republican majority in Congress and a Trump-packed Supreme Court, the American system of checks and balances in the federal government has broken down. What has emerged is a system of checks and balances in which states and cities are serving as the check on the Trump Administration. States are challenging the Trump Administration through the courts. Over the first six months of this presidency, the California attorney general filed 37 lawsuits against the federal government.

We must stand up to Trump — in the courts, at the ballot box, and on the streets to protect our immigrant families and communities. Trump has been terrorizing communities and breaking families apart.

According to Mr Patel, a handwritten note recovered from Mr Jahn's home read: ""Hopefully this will give ICE agents real terror, to think, 'Is there a sniper with AP rounds on that roof?'""","The gunman who opened fire on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in Dallas, Texas, left behind a collection of notes at his home saying he acted alone in an attack that was intended to terrorise ICE agents and minimise harm to detainees at the facility, officials say.

He was identified as Joshua Jahn, 29, a Dallas-area resident who previously attended a community college and had worked as a solar panel installer.

Nancy Larson, acting US attorney for the northern district of Texas, said at a news conference that the shooter's writings were found during a search of his home in Fairview, Texas, following Wednesday's pre-dawn shooting.

Ms Larson said the notes included a game plan of the attack targeting ICE employees and areas at the facility and an admission from the sniper that he was acting alone.

""He wrote that he intended to maximise lethality against ICE personnel and to maximise property damage at the facility,"" she said.

""He hoped to minimise any collateral damage or injury to the detainees and any other innocent people …

Earlier in the day, FBI Director Kash Patel said the suspect had searched for apps in August that track the location of ICE agents and downloaded a list of local Department of Homeland Security facilities.

One immigration detainee at the Dallas site was shot dead and two others were critically wounded.

No federal personnel were injured in the incident.

Within hours of the shooting, the FBI released a photo of an unused bullet found inscribed with the phrase ""ANTI-ICE,"" an early piece of evidence, officials said, that the immigration enforcement agency was the target.

The perpetrator, who the FBI said had opened fire from the rooftop of a nearby building, was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound afterwards, Ms Larson said.

The investigation thus far, Mr Patel said on Thursday, ""indicates a high degree of pre-attack planning"".

Mr Patel also outlined additional evidence reinforcing the theory that the attack appeared to have been aimed not at the detainees who were shot but at ICE, the primary enforcement agency of President Donald Trump's aggressive immigration crackdown.

According to Mr Patel, a handwritten note recovered from Mr Jahn's home read: ""Hopefully this will give ICE agents real terror, to think, 'Is there a sniper with AP rounds on that roof?'""

He did not provide photos or other documentation of the evidence.

Mr Patel also said the suspect had downloaded a document titled Dallas County Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Management, containing a list of DHS facilities and, during a period of several days in August, the perpetrator had searched for apps that tracked the presence of ICE agents.

One of the seriously injured victims is a Mexican citizen, according to Mexico's foreign ministry.

The Dallas shooting came two weeks after Charlie Kirk, co-founder of the conservative political group Turning Point USA and a close ally of Trump, was shot dead by a rooftop sniper during a speaking event in Utah, fuelling fears of a new wave of violence in the United States.

Mr Trump and members of his administration immediately blamed left-wing activists for Wednesday's attack, even though there has been no evidence released to suggest the suspect was linked to any outside groups or individuals.

""The radical left is causing the problem, they're out of control,"" Mr Trump said.

""They're saying things and they're really dumb people … and it's going to get worse and, ultimately, it's going to go back on them.

""I mean, bad things happen when they play these games …

""And I don't want to see that happen either, I'm the president of all the people.""

In a joint statement, Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives condemned the attack and called for less divisiveness.

""The political and ideologically motivated violence in America has reached a breaking point this year,"" they said. ""We need leaders who bring the country together in moments of crisis — and that is what is required right now.""

Political violence has risen in the United States in recent years, with high-profile attacks targeting figures on both the right and the left, including Mr Trump himself, who endured two assassination attempts during his 2024 presidential campaign.

The older brother of the suspect in the Dallas attack spoke with a Reuters reporter on Wednesday as Joshua Jahn's name began circulating online in connection with the shooting.

Noah Jahn, 30, said he was not aware that his brother harboured any negative feelings about ICE.

ABC says roughly 6.3 million viewers watched Kimmel’s first post-suspension episode on Tuesday, more than three times his typical audience.

Here’s what else you need to know to get up to speed and on with your day.

1️⃣ ICE facility shooting

A shooting at an immigration facility in Dallas has left one detainee dead and at least two others in critical condition. The FBI is investigating the shooting as an “act of targeted violence,” after a “sniper” on a nearby rooftop fired “indiscriminately” at the ICE building. One of the injured detainees is a Mexican national, according to the Mexican government. The shooter was identified as a 29-year-old Dallas resident who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told CNN that the shooter was “very much against” ICE agents based on the evidence that has been gathered. The secretary’s comments come as President Donald Trump is blaming the shooting on rhetoric from “radical left Democrats.”

2️⃣ Government shutdown

The federal government could shut down next week if Congress fails to pass a spending bill by the end of the month. While essential services would remain in operation, many government agencies would come to a halt on October 1, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees would go without pay until the deadlock is resolved. The White House budget office is instructing federal agencies to prepare plans for mass firings in the event of a government shutdown, with instructions to target programs they are not legally required to continue. The threat of mass job losses is likely to escalate the partisan funding showdown over the next several days, with Democrats demanding key concessions — most notably, an extension of Obamacare enhanced subsidies set to expire at the end of the year.

3️⃣ Hurricane season

Tropical Storm Humberto has formed in the Atlantic, and another system near the Bahamas could develop soon, putting the East Coast on alert heading into the weekend. Humberto — the eighth named storm of the season — is currently about 500 miles away from the Leeward Islands and is expected to strengthen into a Category 2 or 3 hurricane in the coming days. While it’s forecast to curve out to sea, it’s still too early to rule out potential impacts on Bermuda or elsewhere. Meanwhile, forecasters are closely monitoring a disorganized cluster of storms over the northeastern Caribbean, which is intensifying as it moves toward the Bahamas.

4️⃣ Cyberattacks

An airport in northern Denmark was forced to close today due to unauthorized drones in its airspace — the second such incident this week. The drone sightings come amid a surge in cyberattacks and suspected Russian airspace violations across Europe. Just days ago, sightings of two or three large drones halted all takeoffs and landings for hours at the airport in Copenhagen, in what Denmark’s prime minister called a “serious attack on Danish critical infrastructure.” It’s unclear if the incidents are linked, but the pattern was similar, police said. This also follows a major cyberattack over the weekend that disrupted automatic check-in systems at several of Europe’s busiest airports, including London’s Heathrow.

5️⃣ Powerball winner

A lucky man in Missouri who won half of the nearly $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot has come forward to claim his prize. He held one of only two tickets that matched all the numbers in the September 6 drawing, the second-largest lottery jackpot in US history. The man, who the lottery did not identify, opted for a one-time payment of $410.3 million (before taxes). While accepting the massive prize, he described himself as a homebody and said he’s looking forward to spending quality time with his wife. “The perfect day is sitting at home doing what I do — relaxing,” he said. Referring to his wife, he joked that “she’s going to drag me out of town now.” The man purchased the winning ticket at a gas station in St. Louis. The other winning ticket was sold at a convenience store in Fredericksburg, Texas.

A group of more than 60 Democratic legislators sent a letter to the Trump administration Wednesday that expresses “grave concerns” about ongoing removals to so-called third countries to which immigrants have no connection.

The legislators are requesting that the Trump administration provide “basic information” about the scope of the third-country removal program, which the administration has aggressively pursued. In many cases, people have been sent to nations to which they have no connection and have remained in detention abroad. The Trump administration has fought legal efforts that seek to block—or give people more time—to challenge their removals to unstable countries like South Sudan.

The letter from Democrats asks the administration to explain how frequently it is first attempting to send people to their country of origin, a list of all the countries with which the State Department has agreements to send immigrants, and the number of people sent to third countries without “diplomatic assurances that they will not torture or persecute deported individuals.”

The letter is addressed to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The effort is being led by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), along with Reps. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), Troy Carter (D-La.), and Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.).

“We are concerned that the Trump Administration is offshoring the immigration detention system in an apparent attempt to evade the due process requirements of the US Constitution,” the members of Congress warned in the letter. “Increasingly, individuals are being ‘whisk[ed]…off the street and onto buses or planes out of the country,’ and into detention facilities in unfamiliar countries, with virtually no notice and no opportunity to have their cases adjudicated or to assert a fear of persecution or torture.”

The most prominent third-country removals conducted by the Trump administration so far involved sending more than 200 Venezuelans to El Salvador’s notorious Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT. As Mother Jones reported, Venezuelans sent there told us that they faced horrific conditions there; they were released in July as part of a prisoner swap deal. The administration has also used other Latin American countries, along with African nations like Eswatini and South Sudan, for third-country removals.

Under the law, third-country removals are supposed to be used only when it is “impracticable, inadvisable, or impossible” to send someone to their country of origin. But there have already been multiple cases in which the Trump administration appears to have made little or no effort to deport people to their home country before sending them to African nations instead.

“In reality, these operations appear to be, at least in part, an attempt to evade the statutory, regulatory, and constitutional due process requirements of the US immigration adjudication process—which President Trump has complained can take years to complete,” the members of Congress wrote. “Fast-tracked expulsions and deportations to third countries allow DHS to deport planeloads of people practically overnight, to whatever country has agreed to receive or detain noncitizens en masse.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25075583393829.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-09-26 07:57:43.476925

Fairview resident Joshua Jahn, 29, opened fire with a bolt-action rifle at a Dallas ICE field office around 6:30 a.m., shooting across the length of building, through windows, and toward law enforcement vans, where he hit three detainees being transferred.

One died and two were taken to a nearby hospital, where they are undergoing treatment, acting U.S. Attorney Nancy Larson said at a press conference Thursday.

Law enforcement obtained warrants for devices and locations associated with Jahn, and at his home, found a collection of notes. One said: “yes, it was just me and my brain,” Larson said. He referred to ICE agents as ""people showing up to collect a dirty paycheck,” and said he wanted to maximize harm against ICE while minimizing collateral damage.

The fact that he killed a detainee and injured two others was a ""tragic irony,"" Larson said.

“This, what he did, is the very definition of terrorism,"" she said.

RELATED: Dallas ICE office shooting heightens fears among immigrants

It’s unclear how many shots were fired, and the identities of the victims have not been revealed as of Thursday. At least one injured victim was a Mexican national, according to the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Jahn’s notes allegedly revealed he planned the shooting months in advance, and that he wanted to “cause terror” to law enforcement, FBI Dallas Special Agent Joe Rothrock said at Thursday’s press conference.

“He doesn't want to just impact the ICE agents and the law enforcement agents that were carrying out that mission yesterday,” Rothrock said. “He wants to impact ICE agents and law enforcement across the country.”

When asked if Jahn’s suicide was part of his plan, Rothrock said his notes, “indicate that he did not expect to survive this event.”

Evidence shows Jahn used ICE tracking apps designed to spot, track, and locate ICE officers, according to an ICE official. He also downloaded information about several Department of Homeland and Security facilities, said Marcos Charles, ICE executive associate director for enforcement and removal operations.

Charles added there will be increased security at facilities, something Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem already ordered for agencies to do as well.

Earlier that morning, around 3 a.m., Jahn was reportedly seen on camera footage driving with a large ladder in his car, which the DOJ believe is what he used to ""position himself"" on top of an adjacent building. After the shooting started, the Dallas Police Department responded, and eventually found Jahn dead on the roof of that building with a self-inflicted wound.

Found at the scene, according to the DOJ and FBI, were unspent shell casings, one of which was scrawled with the words, ""Anti-ICE.""

The FBI did not find evidence he was a member of any specific political group, and the notes did not single out any agency other than ICE. Other notes found in Jahn's home, according to Larson, made clear he didn’t intend to kill detainees or harm them.

He also wrote, ""good luck with the digital footprint,” Larson said — indicating he likely destroyed digital evidence or otherwise scrubbed his online presence.

While the shooting was likely intended to be an attack on ICE, it also fueled the North Texas immigrant community’s fears of being targeted amid anti-immigrant rhetoric.

It’s also just the latest incident of alleged political violence in recent months.

On Aug. 25, the same Dallas field office received a threat from a man who walked up to the building claiming to have a bomb in his backpack, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The man has since been arrested and charged with making terroristic threats, the agency said.

Less than two months earlier, on July 4, a group of people went to the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado as part of a noise demonstration, according to official complaints. But court documents say things took a turn when a shooter in the nearby woods opened fire at police and correctional officers, hitting one police officer.

Seventeen people have been arrested in connection to what happened that night.

Shouhed claims he told agents he had recently undergone heart surgery, had three stents, and could not breathe, but that his pleas were ignored.","A 79-year-old Van Nuys car wash owner has filed a federal civil rights claim seeking $50 million after he says he was violently body slammed and pinned by federal agents during an immigration raid at his business on Sept. 9. The claim names the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Border Patrol, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement as defendants.

Rafie Ollah Shouhed, a longtime Valley Car Wash owner, said he was inside his business at 7530 Van Nuys Blvd. when masked agents stormed the premises. Surveillance video reviewed by KTLA shows a federal agent shoving Shouhed to the ground inside a hallway.

Shouhed told KTLA he stepped outside to speak with the agents, offering proof that his employees were legally authorized to work, but was instead cursed at, pushed back, and body slammed onto the pavement. According to the civil rights claim, three agents then jumped on his back, with one forcing a knee onto his neck while others restrained his arms.

“They grabbed one of my guys, and I told them, hold on, some of these people have papers, they have the documentation here. And the only thing they said was, ‘You don’t F with ICE. We are here,’ and they threw me on the floor … and three of them, they jumped on me and they were sitting on me,” Shouhed told KTLA in a previous interview.

Shouhed claims he told agents he had recently undergone heart surgery, had three stents, and could not breathe, but that his pleas were ignored.

He was handcuffed, transported to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles, and held nearly 12 hours without medical attention, he alleges. Despite agents later acknowledging he was a U.S. citizen, Shouhed said he was denied phone calls to his family and released without charges.

After his release, Shouhed was treated at a local hospital for multiple broken ribs, elbow injuries, contusions, and post-concussive symptoms of a traumatic brain injury. He says he continues to suffer both physical and psychological effects.

Attorney V. James DeSimone, who filed the claim on Shouhed’s behalf, said in a statement that federal agents’ actions were “outrageous and unlawful” and violated both federal and California civil rights laws.

The $50 million claim alleges assault, battery, violation of the California Bane Act, deliberate indifference to a serious medical condition, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and other torts. It also claims that DHS, ICE, and CBP maintain policies that tolerate the use of excessive force.

Live Events Why Did Immigrants Vanish from Alligator Alcatraz?","Synopsis

The mysterious disappearance of hundreds of immigrants detained at the Alligator Alcatraz immigration processing center near Miami, Florida, has raised serious concerns. About 800 detainees who were held there no longer appear in ICE's online database, and around 450 others have no listed location, showing only the message to ""Call ICE for details."" Their lawyers and families have been unable to track or contact them, raising fears regarding their whereabouts and welfare.

Florida’s remote detention center in the Everglades—known widely as “Alligator Alcatraz”—is once again under the spotlight. Reports are mounting that hundreds of detainees who were once inside can no longer be traced. Families, lawyers, and immigrant advocates are sounding the alarm, warning that people appear to have simply disappeared from official records.

Alligator Alcatraz, a detention center built rapidly on a former airstrip in the Everglades and endorsed by President Donald Trump during its inauguration in early July 2025, has become known as a ""black hole"" in the immigration system.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and immigrant advocacy groups highlight that detainees are effectively ""off the radar,"" which obstructs due process and attorney-client communication. There have been multiple lawsuits against the facility, challenging Florida’s authority to detain immigrants there and raising issues of poor conditions and mistreatment.

Following a judge’s ruling to dismantle the camp, now stayed by an appeals court, the detainee population at Alligator Alcatraz has significantly decreased. State officials and DHS have stated the facility would soon be empty, with transfers to other centers and some deportations occurring. However, it is unclear how many detainees have been deported or transferred, and reports indicate pressure on detainees to sign voluntary deportations. Incidents such as accidental deportation of detainees have been reported, adding to the confusion.

The Department of Homeland Security claims detainees have opportunities to communicate with attorneys and family and that the number of detainees fluctuates due to deportations and transfers. Nevertheless, advocacy groups criticize ICE for not promptly updating detainee locations and maintaining transparency. The lack of clear information has caused distress among families and legal representatives, with some attorneys needing days to schedule visits.

Live Events

Why Did Immigrants Vanish from Alligator Alcatraz?

The story begins quietly, in the wild heart of the Florida Everglades. There, a new immigration detention center rose up almost overnight. Locals started calling it “Alligator Alcatraz.” Its official name hardly mattered. What people saw and heard mattered more.

At first, thousands were held inside—mothers, fathers, sons, daughters. Most had come from Latin America, many fleeing difficult lives only to find themselves surrounded by heat, humidity, and fences. Inside, stories filtered out: food shortages, drinking water complaints, medical care delays. Some told of cages packed wall to wall, with dozens of people called by number and not by name. The fear was constant—of storms, of illness, of never seeing family again.

But by late summer, almost as suddenly as it filled, the vast camp began to empty. Families waiting for news found the phone calls stopped. Online, the detainees’ names vanished without record. Mothers, fathers, and lawyers called but got no answers. Rumors spread that many had been deported, or shipped elsewhere, or released in secret. Nobody could say for sure. With no public lists and no paper trail, loved ones began asking: “Where did everyone go?”

Searching for Answers in the Shadows

Even government officials struggled to explain. One week the center was bustling with nearly two thousand people; weeks later, that number dropped by more than half. Inquiries to agencies went in circles. Sometimes the official advice was simply, “Call back later.” Families camped out, hoping for word. Lawyers scrambled to track their clients. Human rights groups sounded alarms about disappearing people and secret removals. Was it a data glitch—or a deliberate blackout?

For those stuck outside, the days grew tense and fearful. Family members described the agony of trying to learn whether loved ones were alive and safe, or even within U.S. borders anymore. Some feared the worst. Stories of medical emergencies, denied lawyer visits, and lost court dates made the uncertainty feel even more urgent.

Inside the complex, pressure mounted. Lawsuits accused the facility of violating the rights of detainees and risking lives with poor conditions. Judges weighed in, demanding ICE at least slow down the removals and provide more information. But appeals and bureaucratic delays pushed real answers further away. Meanwhile, buses kept rolling out of the swampland. Each departure brought a swirl of new questions.

What Next for Alligator Alcatraz—and Its Missing Detainees?

As the summer closed, officials announced the site would soon be empty. News crews showed up hoping for interviews. Protesters and faith leaders gathered at the gates, lighting candles for those lost in the shuffle. In courtrooms and city halls, debate raged over the future of detention in America and the growing number of people swept away by changes in policy.

What stands out, in the end, is how quickly lives can disappear from view. When records vanish and systems close their doors, real people are left searching for hope. The fate of those who passed through Alligator Alcatraz is still unknown to many families. Some attorneys say they may never know what happened to all of them.

This story isn’t just about one controversial building in the swamp. It’s about the ongoing struggle over borders, belonging, and basic human rights. What happens when the system loses track of people it was supposed to keep safe—no matter where they came from or why they came here? How long will families and advocates go on searching for answers that may never come?

This mystery, born in the isolation of the Everglades, now follows a trail across the nation—a trail faded by time, confusion, and silence. For those who care about justice, the next chapter is clear: the search must continue until every missing name is found, and every voice has the dignity to be heard.

This weekend, Mr. Trump insisted that his attorney general, Pam Bondi, act quickly to prosecute people that he considers his enemies.
So far, the committee, which is the House’s principal investigative panel, has largely received files from the Justice Department that were already public.
Still, many Republican lawmakers have used the committee’s investigation as cover to avoid recording a vote that would anger Mr. Trump.
All three women may face continued pressure from Mr. Johnson, Mr. Trump or their allies to withdraw their support.","In the letter, the White House Office of Management and Budget called on Congress to adopt a short-term measure that would preserve existing funding levels into November. Such a move would buy time for Democrats and Republicans to negotiate a longer-term agreement, which would fund the remainder of the 2026 fiscal year.

Absent that, the White House instructed federal agencies to prepare for a shutdown, setting in motion a process that may darken a vast array of vital government services while furloughing many federal workers without pay beginning Oct. 1.

But the Trump administration coupled its formal notification with an additional directive to agencies, telling them “to use this opportunity to consider Reduction in Force” notices to lay off federal employees. Since taking office, President Trump has invoked this process repeatedly in a campaign that began with the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, though some affected workers were later rehired or contested their firing in court.

In the new memo, the White House told agency leaders to focus on eliminating positions where funding has expired, or could not be sourced under other laws, and had been deemed to be “not consistent” with President Trump’s political agenda.

On one hand, the White House signaled the potential firings would “not be necessary” if Congress could strike a short-term deal to avert a shutdown. House Republicans adopted such a stopgap earlier this month, but Senate Democrats quickly rejected it, as they sought to force Mr. Trump to extend a set of expiring health care subsidies.

The administration also indicated, however, that agencies should still “revise” their layoff plans once funding for the 2026 fiscal year is finalized, tasking them to maintain a work force with only “the minimal number of employees necessary to carry out” functions required by law.

“We remain hopeful that Democrats in Congress will not trigger a shutdown and the steps outlined above will not be necessary,” the memo said.

Politico reported the memo earlier Wednesday.

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic minority leader, swiftly rebuked the White House over the directive, describing the threat to fire workers in a statement late Wednesday as an “attempt at intimidation.”

“Donald Trump has been firing federal workers since day one — not to govern, but to scare,” added Mr. Schumer. “This is nothing new and has nothing to do with funding the government.”

Prosecutors have been looking into whether Mr. Comey should be charged with lying to Congress in connection to the F.B.I. investigation of Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign’s ties to Russia, which the president claims was a witch hunt aimed at destroying him.

Ms. Halligan, who had no experience as a prosecutor before her recent appointment, could seek to bring charges as early as Thursday, but is expected to take action by Tuesday, when the statute of limitations on Mr. Comey’s congressional testimony expires, according to officials who requested anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.

Even if Ms. Halligan meets her deadline, there is no guarantee the grand jury will determine that the government has met the evidentiary threshold to indict Mr. Comey.

It is not clear if a career prosecutor would be willing to present the case to the grand jury — or if Ms. Halligan or another Trump-allied political appointee would appear in court.

“Perjury is a very difficult crime to prove,” said John P. Fishwick, who served as U.S. attorney for the Western District of Virginia from 2015 to 2017. “The department must show that a particular statement was false and that the defendant knew it was false at the time he or she testified. Because of the difficulty of proof, it is not often pursued.”

Career prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia investigated Mr. Comey and informed Mr. Trump’s political appointees at the Justice Department that there was insufficient evidence to obtain a conviction, according to several people briefed on those discussions.

Over the past week, Mr. Trump has greatly intensified his pressure campaign on the Justice Department by publicly demanding that top officials prosecute Mr. Comey and Letitia James, the New York attorney general who accused Mr. Trump of inflating the value of his assets.

It is not clear where prosecutors may seek to bring a case against Mr. Comey. The headquarters for the district is in Alexandria, but investigators have been active in other parts of the state, according to two people familiar with the situation.

On Friday, Erik S. Siebert, the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney overseeing both investigations, stepped down after Mr. Trump told reporters he had lost faith in Mr. Siebert’s willingness to bring criminal charges.

In his place, the president installed Ms. Halligan, who had been serving as a White House aide.

Mr. Siebert had recently told senior Justice Department officials that investigators found insufficient evidence to bring charges against Ms. James, and had also raised concerns about a potential case against Mr. Comey, according to officials familiar with the situation.

Attorney General Pam Bondi and Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general who runs the day-to-day operations of the Justice Department, had privately defended Mr. Siebert against officials, including William J. Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who had urged that he be fired and replaced with a prosecutor who would push the cases forward, according to a senior law enforcement official.

Devlin Barrett contributed reporting.

The suit was prompted by a February directive from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ordering agencies under her purview to stop sending federal money to jurisdictions that do not assist the federal government in immigration enforcement. Many of the states involved in the lawsuit have laws or policies that bar local or state police from assisting federal immigration enforcement.

On Wednesday, Judge William E. Smith of Federal District Court in Rhode Island granted the plaintiffs a permanent injunction in the case. In his 45-page ruling, he rejected the Department of Homeland Security’s contention that the agency was focusing on its core mission of immigration enforcement, and called placing conditions on disaster money “arbitrary and capricious” and unconstitutional.

“Such platitudes cannot substitute for an actual explanation of why it is necessary to attach sweeping immigration conditions to all the grants at issue here,” wrote Judge Smith, an appointee of President George W. Bush.

The Rhode Island attorney general, Peter F. Neronha, noted that the same coalition of attorneys general had been challenging Trump administration policies in court almost since the moment the president took office in January.

“These cases can feel long and daunting, and we still have a long road ahead of us, to be sure,” Mr. Neronha said in a statement. “But today’s decision reminds us that this president cannot impose his will where he does not have the lawsuit power to do so.”

Rob Bonta, the California attorney general, said the ruling also protected state access to Department of Homeland Security grants that help state law enforcement agencies fight terrorism.

“This permanent injunction is a huge win in our case that will protect funding for our communities to defend against terrorist attacks and prepare for emergencies,” Mr. Bonta said in a statement. “This is a good day for the rule of law and public safety.”

The administration has not indicated whether it will appeal, though an aide to Ms. Noem responded to the ruling in a defiant tone on Wednesday evening.

“Cities and states who break the law and prevent us from arresting criminal illegal aliens should not receive federal funding,” Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary with the Department of Homeland Security, said in an email. “The Trump administration is committed to restoring the rule of law. No lawsuit, not this one or any other, is going to stop us from doing that.”

That move reflected a broader campaign by Mr. Trump to pursue his perceived political enemies, as he has openly pressured the Justice Department to bring cases against them. But in recent weeks, federal prosecutors in Maryland and Virginia have failed to do so, prompting the ouster of at least one U.S. attorney, in the Eastern District of Virginia.

The stalled effort against Mr. Brennan, in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, would be the most recent setback for such prosecutions.

Senior administration officials said on Wednesday that prosecutors believed they were making progress in the investigation of Mr. Brennan. But the decision last month by Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, to revoke the security clearances of current and former national security officials has deeply hampered the inquiry.

The officials said a number of the people stripped of their clearances were likely to be interviewed by Justice Department prosecutors over their involvement on the intelligence community assessment of Russian influence. At least three officials, all of whom worked at least indirectly on the assessment, lost their jobs after their clearances were revoked.

Those firings took many senior intelligence officials by surprise, and were done over the objection of at least one agency head.

But other officials denied that. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has provided huge amounts of material to prosecutors, they asserted, and the most important potential witnesses were not among those who had their security clearances revoked. These officials added that prosecutors, struggling to make a case, were looking for a scapegoat.

A spokesman for the Justice Department said it was committed to working closely with Ms. Gabbard’s agency to end what the administration calls the “weaponization” of intelligence and law enforcement by the previous administration.

Axios earlier reported that the revocations had hobbled the Justice Department inquiry.

Ms. Gabbard said in August that the revocations, which included a number of people who worked on the intelligence assessment, were in response to Mr. Trump’s orders, part of a wider purge of national security officials.

A month earlier, Mr. Ratcliffe, a sharp critic of Mr. Brennan, released a tradecraft review of that assessment before making a criminal referral to the F.B.I. Officials said that the review suggested that Mr. Brennan may have misled Congress about the role that a discredited dossier assembled by a former British spy had played in the assessment.

The revocations complicated the investigation of Mr. Brennan, the senior administration officials said, because it swept up many people involved in the assessment, including those with concerns about how it was handled. Some administration officials said they believed that the officials whose clearances were revoked would be unlikely to cooperate with prosecutors. Others said they believed their credibility with juries might be impaired.

But the revocations did not include the C.I.A. officers who worked most closely with Mr. Brennan and wrote the bulk of the classified report that was issued in December 2016, an unclassified version of which was released in January 2017, two weeks before Mr. Trump took office for his first term.

Mr. Brennan has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and his public comments on the dossier and the intelligence assessment have been consistent. His actions were examined by multiple congressional committees and a special counsel appointed during the first Trump administration. Legal experts have raised questions about whether any prosecution of Mr. Brennan would be possible.

Current and former intelligence officials involved in the assessment are skeptical that Mr. Brennan violated any law, but some believe he did mishandle parts of the assessment. In hindsight, some have said, the dossier should not have been used at all or referred to in the assessment. And Mr. Brennan’s push for providing an intelligence assessment to President Barack Obama before he left office meant that some intelligence officers had little opportunity to shape the document’s conclusions.

Judge Reyes reasoned that the officers’ “inability to perform their duties for 30 days” did not rise to an “irreparable harm” that would justify intervening in the case. She also noted that if they were reinstated, Mr. Trump could move to put them on leave, “rendering them functionally unemployed.”

“The Court recognizes plaintiffs’ exceptional service,” Judge Reyes wrote, adding that the officials “deserved better from their government. They still do. Unfortunately, this court cannot provide plaintiffs more.”

In effect, the ruling was a victory for the Trump administration, even though Judge Reyes largely agreed with the inspectors general that the president had broken the law and flouted their congressionally mandated job protections. The officials performed oversight of the Departments of Defense, State, Education, Agriculture, Labor, Veterans Affairs and Health and Human Services, as well as the Small Business Administration.

The ruling also closed a case that began with Judge Reyes scolding the plaintiffs’ lawyers for the manner in which they brought the case. With federal courts overwhelmed earlier this year by a fire hose of presidential actions — met with a corresponding wave of lawsuits by Mr. Trump’s opponents — Judge Reyes excoriated the lawyers for filing the case through emergency procedures that she said had wasted the court’s limited time.

During a hearing in February, Judge Reyes, who was appointed by President Joseph R. Biden Jr., went as far as to threaten the plaintiffs with court sanctions if they did not immediately withdraw their emergency request so the case could proceed on a slower timeline. The lead lawyer initially refused but eventually relented after withering criticism from the judge.

The longer Russian statement emphasized “understanding” between Russia and the United States, noted their “mutual interest in finding peaceful solutions” and agreement to continue talking, and denounced “schemes promoted by Kyiv and certain European capitals, aimed at dragging out the conflict.”

Somewhat abstractly, the Russian statement also referred to a “synchronization of watches” on “the entire range of the bilateral agenda.”

The U.S. statement struck a very different tone. According to Tommy Pigott, a State Department spokesman who issued a terse, 40-word statement on the meeting, Mr. Rubio “reiterated President Trump’s call for the killing to stop and the need for Moscow to take meaningful steps toward a durable resolution of the Russia-Ukraine war.”

Mr. Trump abruptly reversed his stance on the war on Tuesday, posting on social media after a meeting with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, that “Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form.”

It was a big diplomatic win for Mr. Zelensky who has struggled to get support from Mr. Trump. Last month, after the American president met with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in Alaska, Mr. Trump insisted that Ukraine would have to make a deal, giving up territory to its powerful neighbor.

But some European diplomats also worried that Mr. Trump was distancing himself from the war — washing his hands of a conflict that he once promised to solve in days or weeks.

Mr. Trump had hoped for an immediate cease-fire out of the meeting with Mr. Putin. It did not happen. But the two leaders spoke effusively about each other and their relationship, leaving little doubt that Mr. Zelensky, who had not been invited to the conference, was the odd man out.

Now, after Mr. Trump’s turnabout — for which he has provided no rationale — Russia is facing a different situation in its dealings with the Trump administration.

Mr. Trump said on Tuesday that the war was “not distinguishing Russia,” and that the country’s failure to win after “fighting aimlessly for three and a half years” revealed weakness. He predicted that Russians would come to resent all the money being spent on the conflict and lauded Ukraine’s “Great Spirit,” which he said is “only getting better.”

On Monday, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, referred to Mr. Mangione at a news conference as a “left-wing assassin.” And on Tuesday night, Stephen Miller, a White House deputy chief of staff, told Fox News that the executive was “brutally gunned down” by a so-called antifascist and was celebrated by “communist revolutionaries.”

The comments, made less than two weeks after the Sept. 10 assassination of Charlie Kirk, a right-wing activist, violated an order in April by the judge in Mr. Mangione’s case that explicitly warned Justice Department officials to refrain from speaking publicly about the case in order to ensure a fair trial.

Mr. Mangione is accused of shooting Brian Thompson, the chief executive of United Healthcare, minutes before an investors meeting at a Midtown hotel on Dec. 4. He was captured in possession of a manifesto decrying America’s system of for-profit health care and a “parasitic” insurance industry.

This month, a state judge in New York dismissed terrorism charges against Mr. Mangione, which included a count that could have put him in prison for the rest of his life, though he still faces a murder charge, to which he has pleaded not guilty. In the parallel federal case, he has pleaded not guilty to a murder charge, which could bring the death penalty.

Judge Margaret Garnett’s order on Wednesday comes as Mr. Trump continues to tear down walls between the White House and the Justice Department that were intended to protect its tradition of independence. This weekend, Mr. Trump insisted that his attorney general, Pam Bondi, act quickly to prosecute people that he considers his enemies.

The judge’s order shows how the president’s statements can swiftly affect active prosecutions — and the administration of justice.

The White House referred a request for comment on Judge Garnett’s Wednesday order to the Justice Department, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office and Mr. Mangione’s lawyers declined to comment.

On Tuesday, Mr. Mangione’s lawyers, led by Karen Friedman Agnifilo, had complained to the judge that the recent comments by administration officials had “indelibly prejudiced Mr. Mangione by baselessly linking him to unrelated violent events, and left-wing extremist groups, despite there being no connection or affiliation.”

The lawyers said Mr. Kirk’s murder had “only increased this prejudicial rhetoric.”

“The attempts to connect Mr. Mangione with these incidents and paint him as a ‘left wing’ violent extremist are false, prejudicial, and part of a greater political narrative that has no place in any criminal case, especially one where the death penalty is at stake,” the lawyers wrote.

The judge’s original order in April directing Justice Department officials to stop commenting on the case came after Ms. Bondi’s announcement that the government would seek capital punishment “as we carry out President Trump’s agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again.” On Fox News Sunday, Ms. Bondi again discussed the decision. “The president’s directive was very clear: We are to seek the death penalty when possible,” she said.

Later that month, Judge Garnett made it clear that she wanted to depoliticize the atmosphere surrounding the case. The judge directed prosecutors to convey her warning against public commentary to Jay Clayton, the Manhattan U.S. attorney, whose office is handling the prosecution, and that he pass the message to Ms. Bondi “and any of her subordinates at Main Justice.”

In her order on Wednesday, Judge Garnett wrote that Mr. Mangione’s lawyers had cited statements by two high-ranking Justice Department officials that appeared to violate her April order, and a court rule barring lawyers from making comments that could “interfere with a fair trial or otherwise prejudice the due administration of justice.”

Judge Garnett directed the government to submit a sworn declaration from either a top official in either the Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office or the Justice Department in Washington explaining “how these violations occurred” and what steps were being taken to ensure none occur in the future.

Any further violations, the judge said, could result in sanctions, which could include personal financial penalties, contempt of court findings or what she called “relief specific to the prosecution of this matter.”

The judge did not elaborate, but Mr. Mangione’s lawyers have asked in court papers seeking dismissal of the indictment that the government be precluded from seeking the death penalty.

“On my very first day in Congress, I’ll sign the bipartisan discharge petition to force a vote on releasing the Epstein files,” Ms. Grijalva said in a statement on Monday. “This is as much about fulfilling Congress’s duty as a constitutional check on this administration as it is about demanding justice for survivors.”

It is likely to take weeks for the measure — which is cosponsored by Representatives Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, and Ro Khanna, Democrat of California — to come to a vote, and the effort could falter if any of the three Republicans who have signed on withdraw their backing.

But should none withdraw, Ms. Grijalva’s signature would be all but certain to force Speaker Mike Johnson and Republican leaders to confront an issue that they had hoped to dispense with in the face of resistance from President Trump, sharp divisions within their ranks and pressure from right-wing supporters.

The Trump administration’s sudden reversal on a much-vaunted promise to make public investigative files on Mr. Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 while facing sex-trafficking charges, prompted an outcry from many of Mr. Trump’s right-wing adherents, who had been primed to expect new revelations. G.O.P. lawmakers have been reluctant to break with the president on the matter, but also fearful of crossing their voters by opposing more transparency about the investigation.

Republican leaders will likely have time to determine their approach. Ms. Grijalva cannot sign the discharge petition until she is sworn in, which is not expected until early next month. Once the petition has 218 signatures, it still cannot be acted upon for seven legislative days when the House is in session. As of this week, the House is not scheduled to return to session until Oct. 7, though members were advised that they may need to return sooner as Congress works to avert a government shutdown.

While the clock ticks, Mr. Johnson has options at his disposal to head off a vote. House leaders generally have an array of procedural maneuvers they can use to thwart legislation. Earlier this year, the speaker turned to the powerful Rules Committee, which determines what legislation reaches the floor, to block another discharge petition he opposed by tying the issue to an unrelated bill.

Still, Republican members of the rules panel, including the chairwoman, Representative Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, have suggested they were not inclined to subvert the will of the majority of the House and block an Epstein-related discharge petition that some of their right-wing constituents would likely want to see succeed.

Many Republicans in Congress have joined their constituents in calling for the full release of the files. But when Mr. Trump began dismissing questions about the issue as a Democratic hoax and urged his supporters to move on, many of the lawmakers quieted down, hoping to avoid having to record a position that would leave them jammed between right-wing voters and the president.

Mr. Massie, who is a vocal Trump critic, and Mr. Khanna teamed to try and force a vote on the issue, introducing a resolution that would demand that the Justice Department release its files within 30 days of passage.

The White House pressured lawmakers not to back the effort, and Mr. Johnson has explicitly opposed the resolution, claiming that its scope is too narrow and that it does not contain sufficient protections for Mr. Epstein’s victims. He has instead pointed to the House Oversight Committee’s ongoing investigation into the matter as a more appropriate vehicle for transparency.

So far, the committee, which is the House’s principal investigative panel, has largely received files from the Justice Department that were already public. The committee’s chairman has said that the department has committed to providing more material, but there is no clear timeline for doing so.

Still, many Republican lawmakers have used the committee’s investigation as cover to avoid recording a vote that would anger Mr. Trump.

As of Wednesday, only three other Republicans had signed onto Mr. Massie’s effort: Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Nancy Mace of South Carolina.

All three women may face continued pressure from Mr. Johnson, Mr. Trump or their allies to withdraw their support. At an event in Kentucky on Wednesday, Mr. Massie told the news outlet Semafor that Republican leaders had already “threatened them politically” and “tried to get the four of us to take our names off of the petition.”

The city’s unemployment rate is now nearly 6 percent, well above the national rate as well as the rate in the Virginia and Maryland suburbs. But while unemployment in the region as a whole is still below the national average of just over 4 percent, the report says, this would soon change “if rates continue to rise at such a rapid pace.”

Though a substantial majority of federal jobs are outside the capital region, no area of the country is more reliant on government work than Washington. With the mass layoffs and cancellations of thousands of federal grants and contracts, many of them recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency and later solidified by Congress, the region has taken a disproportionate hit.

The analysis, as well as a report recently released by the D.C. Chamber of Commerce, found that private sector job growth and entrepreneurial activity in the region have stagnated this year. The job categories that have seen new hires — construction, hospitality and health care — do not align with the skills of many former federal employees who are now looking for work.

Even as the supply of workers has ballooned, the demand for them has not: Job listings in the region lag other metro areas around the country, the Brookings report found, and postings for internships have dropped by 36 percent over the past year. According to a recent survey by the D.C. Policy Center, expectations from business owners and executives about the short-term business outlook of the city have become “quite pessimistic” compared to early 2025.

In a possible sign of this turmoil, the Brookings report found that the year-over-year increase in active home sales listings in the D.C. area was double that of other large metro areas.

In the early days of the Trump administration, when federal job cuts seemed to rise by the day, local leaders emphasized that the capital was moving away from its dependence on federal work, toward jobs in fields like artificial intelligence and quantum computing. But this report has little consolation to offer on that point: After a period of marked success in attracting venture capital money, the stream of investment dollars into the region slowed sharply as 2025 unfolded.

Last year “was actually an amazing year for venture capital flow,” said Tracy Hadden Loh, a fellow at Brookings Metro and one of the report’s authors. “So what happened in between 2024 and 2025?”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/24/multimedia/24trump-news-promo-2a-zmtk/24trump-news-promo-2a-zmtk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 21:56:24.539589

Federal courts tend to avoid tackling unprecedented questions that strike at the heart of the separation of powers — the large and small mysteries left by the framers (and amenders) of the Constitution.

Dallas ICE shooter attacked from a rooftop with engraved bullets, authorities say

A shooter opened fire at an ICE field office yesterday, killing one detainee and leaving two others in critical condition. The gunman was found dead with a self-inflicted gun wound. He has been identified as Joshua Jahn, according to authorities.

No ICE officers were hurt, Dallas police said. The victims' identities have not been publicly released. One of the injured victims is a Mexican national, Mexico's Foreign Affairs Ministry said.

The motive or what the shooter was targeting was not immediately clear. A bullet found near Jahn bore messages that were “anti-ICE in nature,” special agent in charge of the Dallas FBI office, Joe Rothrock, said. He said the attack was an act of “targeted violence.”

The victims were struck while in a van in the facility’s sally port while the shooter fired multiple rounds from a nearby roof, the second instance in two weeks of a gunman setting up with a gun on a rooftop, opening fire and using bullets with writings.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said more ICE agents and law enforcement officers will be hired in response to the attack.

“My heart goes out to that detainee’s family. We’re charged with their protection, their custody. Nothing like that should happen,” Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said.

Democratic candidates frustrated with their party see an opportunity

A trend of Democratic outsiders end-running party leaders to launch their campaigns, sometimes in explicit opposition to them, looks set to define the 2026 primaries.

A crisis of confidence among Democratic voters has given encouragement to the types of nontraditional candidates who have been walloped by leadership-aligned rivals in the past, creating a number of crowded and competitive-looking Senate primaries.

Democratic angst following the loss to Trump last year has contributed to the trend in at least five races that could determine the majority, from core battlegrounds like Michigan and Maine to long-shot targets like Iowa and Texas.

The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has not endorsed in any competitive Senate primaries so far, though Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., who chairs the committee, has not ruled out doing so. Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who serves as a DSCC vice chair, said the committee would only intervene in primaries if it was necessary to stop a politically toxic candidate.

WASHINGTON — Today, in response to reports that U.S. Department of Justice officials are preparing to launch a federal investigation into the Open Society Foundations, Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, issued the following statement:

“The accusations levied against the Open Society Foundations are the latest example of just how far the Trump administration will go to silence its critics. It’s clear that the president intends to weaponize the U.S. Department of Justice to seek retribution against his perceived enemies.

“We are living in a modern-day McCarthy moment, as President Trump turns the full weight of the Department of Justice against organizations speaking out against his administration’s increasingly un-American agenda.

“The Open Society Foundations represent a stark contrast to the president’s agenda. Founded by philanthropist George Soros, and now led by his son Alex Soros, the Open Society Foundations champion the creation of open and democratic societies, based on the rule of law, market economies, transparent and accountable government, freedom of the press, and respect for individual human rights. George Soros epitomizes the American dream – a poor immigrant who succeeds beyond anyone’s wildest dreams and then commit his riches to make ours a more perfect union. Alex Soros, who now heads the foundations, represents the best of principled and upcoming leaders. Grantees of the Open Society Foundations are some of the world’s greatest altruists – seeking to level the playing field for the world’s poor, dispossessed, and powerless. The United States government should be lauding the work of the Open Society Foundations, not attacking them.

“The Trump administration’s baseless attack against the Open Society Foundations is a challenge to the values that make this country great. In this time of increased peril for our democracy, all Americans of conscience need to stand with the Open Society Foundations.”

What Expedited Removal Gives the Trump Administration Like its predecessors, the Trump administration is relying on expedited removal to increase deportations quickly, unimpeded by lengthy adjudications or judicial review.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have waited in the hallways to arrest people immediately upon the case’s dismissal.
Court Challenges to Trump’s Expansion The Trump administration’s expansion of expedited removal was quickly challenged in court by groups alleging the moves exceed statutory authority.","The Trump administration has expanded the use of fast-track deportation powers in unprecedented ways to remove unauthorized immigrants in as little as a few hours, on the decision of individual Department of Homeland Security (DHS) personnel, and without judicial review. This transforms what previously had been a more limited authority for recent arrivals at the border into a far-reaching and potent deportations tool.

The process, known as expedited removal, historically had applied primarily to unauthorized immigrants who had just arrived across a U.S. land or sea border. The administration has sought to expand use of the fast-track authority nationwide, has reportedly used it to order removals of longtime U.S. residents, and has orchestrated maneuvers to use it on individuals previously covered by various temporary protections as well as those with asylum cases pending at immigration courts and asylum offices.

The expansion of expedited removal, which is being challenged in court, offers the administration a major tool to meet its goal of 1 million deportations annually as well as reduce the backlog of almost 4 million removal cases pending in immigration court.

Under the administration’s expanded vision, the powers could, in theory, be applied to at least 2.5 million noncitizens, according to Migration Policy Institute (MPI) estimates. This includes approximately 1 million migrants who arrived at the southwest border without authorization and were allowed into the United States during the second half of the Biden administration, as well as 1.5 million noncitizens previously granted temporary protections such as humanitarian parole, whom the Trump administration argues are now eligible for expedited removal. The MPI estimates cannot model the entire number of noncitizens who may be subject to expedited removal, for example the population of those who evaded arrest after crossing the border without authorization.

The Trump administration has vigorously justified the expanded use of fast-track removal authority as a much-needed policy to reverse what it terms the migrant “invasion” that occurred under President Joe Biden. Immigration lawyers and others warn the procedure, which comes with limited due-process protections and inhibits immigrants’ quick access to legal counsel, exacerbates the odds that asylum seekers’ fears of persecution will be overlooked—and will also inevitably scoop up some U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, with important costs to civil liberties and constitutional rights.

This article reviews the history of expedited removal and the Trump administration’s efforts to expand its application.

A Contested Interpretation of a Longstanding Authority

Congress authorized expedited removal three decades ago, with the passage of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. Since then, more than 3 million noncitizens have been removed under the authority—chiefly individuals encountered at the border or inland ports of entry (such as airports).

President Donald Trump in his first term sought to extend the process nationwide but was slowed by a federal court, and his administration ultimately moved its attention to COVID-19-related border challenges. Just 17 noncitizens were removed through expanded expedited removal procedures during the first Trump term. Early in its second term, the administration quickly revived its more muscular interpretation of the authority, but a federal judge in August blocked geographic and other expansions. The Justice Department swiftly appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit may soon reinstate some of the changes; one member of the three-judge panel considering the nationwide expansion case has indicated he would have already removed the block.

Yet even if the nationwide expansion remains halted, DHS can use expedited removal within a 100-mile zone of U.S. land and sea borders, an area that encompasses two-thirds of the U.S. population. Its mission may be aided by a recent Supreme Court order allowing authorities to apprehend noncitizens to check their immigration status based on their race or ethnicity, language, or type of work.

Box 1. Not All Deportations Are Removals

Removals are only one type of deportation, which is not a legally defined category. Returns constitute the other major type, typically occurring at the U.S. border or a lawful port of entry.

Removals accounted for most deportations during the Obama and first Trump administrations, but returns were more numerous before that time and under President Joe Biden.

Expansion of Expedited Removal Was Slow, then Sudden

Following a period of high-profile and increasing unauthorized arrivals at sea and land, Congress in 1996 established expedited removal for certain noncitizens who arrived without valid entry documents and had been in the country for less than two years. While the statute grants leeway in using the authority, administrations mostly used it for recent border arrivals, concerned that its application in the U.S. interior would raise significant operational and civil liberties concerns.

It quickly accounted for a significant share of removals (but not necessarily of all deportations; see Box 1). The fast-track process accounted for more than half of removals during the Biden administration, from fiscal year (FY) 2022 to FY 2024 (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. Expedited Removals and Total Removals from the United States, FY 1997-2025*

* Data for fiscal year (FY) 2025 cover only the first two months of the fiscal year; full data are not available.

Note: The number of Total Removals is not the total number of deportations, which is a non-legal term (see Box 1). Figure does not include data on returns.

Sources: Data for expedited removals from FY 1996 to FY 2013 are from U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Office of Homeland Security Statistics (OHSS), “Immigration Enforcement Actions Annual Flow Reports 2004 – 2013,” updated February 11, 2025, available online; data for total removals from FY 1996-2013 are from DHS, OHSS, “2023 Yearbook of Immigration Statistics,” updated September 16, 2024, available online; data for FY 2014-25 are from DHS, OHSS, “Immigration Enforcement and Legal Processes Monthly Tables-November 2024,” updated January 16, 2025, available online.

Pre-1996, all unauthorized arrivals were processed for removal in immigration court, where mounting backlogs and asylum applications led to lengthening proceedings. With the advent of expedited removal, officials could order noncitizens deported without a hearing before an immigration judge; people making asylum claims were to be quickly screened by asylum officers. The Clinton administration used the authority mostly for migrants arriving without authorization on planes, boats, and at official border posts. Its usage rose rapidly, from 23,000 deportations in FY 1997 to 89,000 in FY 1999, when it accounted for 49 percent of all 183,000 removals.

Subsequent administrations expanded the use of expedited removal, in limited ways. In 2002, President George W. Bush’s administration extended use to migrants who arrived without authorization by sea and had been in the United States for less than two years. In 2004, the process was extended to migrants who had crossed a land border without authorization, had been in the United States for less than 14 days, and had been apprehended within 100 miles of the border.

The Obama administration ramped up use of expedited removal, especially after an increased emphasis on border enforcement in 2011. In FY 2013, DHS conducted 198,000 expedited removals (the most ever in a fiscal year), accounting for 46 percent of all 432,000 removals (also the most in one year). In 2017, before leaving office, the Obama administration extended expedited removals to Cubans; previously, Cubans who reached U.S. soil had been granted parole to enter.

Border Policies Move into the U.S. Interior

The Trump administration in 2019, during its first term, expanded expedited removal across the U.S. interior. The policy was initially blocked by then U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson (now a Supreme Court justice) who ruled the administration had not followed proper administrative procedures. In 2020, an appeals court reversed her order, finding that the administration was not required to provide advance notice of the policy. Though cleared to resume the expanded use during its final months in office, the administration by then had largely turned elsewhere; amid the COVID-19 pandemic, DHS shifted enforcement focus to border expulsions under the Title 42 public health order.

In 2022, Biden rescinded the Trump-era expansion to the U.S. interior and instead focused on using expedited removal at the border, especially after the May 2023 end of Title 42. At that point, expedited removals accounted for the most removals since the Obama administration; 194,000 of all 330,000 removals in FY 2024 (59 percent) were under the fast-track authority.

Upon retaking office, Trump sought to pick up where he had left off. On his second day in office, he expanded expedited removal to “the full scope of its statutory authority.” DHS has not released data on the number of expedited removals carried out from the U.S. interior since then, but the vast majority of migrants arriving at the border have been placed in expedited removal. With record low unauthorized border arrivals, Border Patrol agents have also been assigned to assist with interior arrests and removals, bringing with them their knowledge of the fast-track process.

What Expedited Removal Gives the Trump Administration

Like its predecessors, the Trump administration is relying on expedited removal to increase deportations quickly, unimpeded by lengthy adjudications or judicial review. Issuing an expedited removal order can take just a matter of hours: An immigration official quickly determines whether a noncitizen has a lawful basis for remaining in the United States; if not, the official serves a removal order. There is no administrative hearing or right to an appeal. Once approved by a supervisor, expedited removal orders are final and not reviewable.

In many cases, noncitizens opt to avoid expedited removal by voluntarily leaving the United States without receiving a formal removal order and the consequences it brings, including a bar on re-entry for at least five years. Hundreds of thousands of noncitizens have taken voluntary return over the years.

Box 2. Exceptions to Expedited Removal

Expedited removal cannot be used on all individuals who otherwise might be eligible:

Officers must attempt to verify the claim of someone who purports to be a U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident (also known as a green-card holder), or hold refugee or asylee status. If they cannot verify the claim, the individual may seek administrative review before an immigration judge.

Unaccompanied immigrant children from countries other than Mexico and Canada may not be placed into expedited removal.

A noncitizen expressing a fear of return to their origin country or who intends to apply for asylum must be referred to an asylum officer for a screening interview.

Proponents of expedited removal underscore the fact that typical removal proceedings in immigration court take more than two years on average, and twice as long in an asylum case, before appeals. Noncitizens wait a decade or more for an asylum interview at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which handles claims by individuals not in removal proceedings. These delays are due to record backlogs, which swelled after historic border arrivals in recent years. (By law, asylum cases are supposed to be completed within six months, but this provision has been violated for years). Approximately 3.8 million cases were pending at immigration courts as of June 2025, of which 63 percent (2.4 million) were asylum cases. Another 1.5 million asylum applications were pending at USCIS as of March. By expanding expedited removal, the administration appears to be trying to avoid adding more cases to these backlogs.

How the Net Has Expanded

Coming into office, the Trump administration pledged to deport a record 1 million unauthorized immigrants per year, and expedited removal was a ready tool to meet this aim. An immediate target: unauthorized immigrants who came during the Biden administration, even if they had been explicitly allowed into the country. A hallmark of the Biden administration’s immigration approach was to use humanitarian parole and other legal processes to allow certain individuals into the United States on a temporary basis, providing protection from deportation and access to a work permit but not a pathway to a green card, in order to relieve record pressure at the border.

During the two-year period beginning in September 2023, MPI estimates that approximately 1 million migrants were released into the United States after arriving without authorization between border posts. An additional 937,000 individuals were, from January 2023 to December 2024, permitted entry through the CBP One app, which the Biden administration used to allow asylum seekers and others to schedule appointments at official border crossings. Another 532,000 noncitizens were admitted through the Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan (CHNV) parole program from October 2022 through December 2024. The Trump administration terminated or ended these grants of humanitarian parole and now seeks to place former recipients in expedited removal. It has argued the law allows it to do so regardless of when the parolees entered the country. As such, these groups could theoretically be facing the prospect of fast-track deportation.

Noncitizens who entered through parole programs or via CBP One were required to provide their contact information and U.S. addresses. This now makes it easier for authorities to track and arrest them.

Furthermore, the administration has sought to end some grants of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and deferred action, which may make more people subject to expedited removal. Litigation and ensuing court orders have resulted in a confusing legal landscape, with courts blocking the termination of TPS for more than 900,000 Venezuelans and Haitians, for example. It is unclear whether the Trump administration will allow the renewal of lapsed protections for groups such as Ukrainians who fled the 2022 Russian invasion. These and other populations are not included in MPI’s calculations of those who could be subjected to expedited removal, in part because of the likelihood of overlap with parolees as well as the ongoing litigation.

Notably, expedited removal has historically been applied principally to Mexican and Central American nationals, and it is much easier to quickly remove someone across the U.S.-Mexico border than fly them to a faraway, overseas location. But as the origins of irregular immigrants have diversified in recent years, the administration’s attempts to quickly deport people through expedited removal could become complicated.

Arrests at Immigration Courts and Asylum Offices

In another shift, authorities are targeting noncitizens during their scheduled appearance in immigration court or their USCIS asylum merits interview. When a noncitizen appears for these hearings, government attorneys have in some cases moved to dismiss the case, arguing that doing so allows them to place the individual in expedited removal. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have waited in the hallways to arrest people immediately upon the case’s dismissal.

The actions have a two-fold benefit from the administration’s perspective, helping reach its deportation goal and reducing the asylum case backlog. In expedited removal, migrants expressing fear of return are referred to a USCIS asylum officer for a screening known as a credible fear interview, which can be scheduled as soon as 24 hours after arrest. Interviews are typically held by phone while an individual is detained. Asylum seekers who do not pass this interview can seek a judge’s review, which may be scheduled in the subsequent days. If a judge affirms the individual is not eligible for asylum, they may be immediately removed without further right to appeal.

On the other hand, individuals who pass the credible fear interview are taken out of expedited removal and placed in immigration court proceedings where they may apply for asylum. As such, some migrants whose court cases were dismissed so they could be put in expedited removal may end up back in immigration court, essentially restarting the process. Still a significant percentage appears to be screened out and removed.

Arrests of Long-Settled Immigrants

According to MPI analysis, most of the 13.7 million unauthorized immigrants in the United States as of mid-2023 have lived here for at least a decade. While the general understanding had been that noncitizens who have resided in the United States for more than two years are exempt from being placed in expedited removal, the Trump administration has pushed the legal boundaries. ICE has argued in court that certain noncitizens may be placed in expedited removal past the two-year mark, depending on how they initially entered the country. For instance, certain noncitizens released into the country under a monitoring program and told to check in at an ICE office may years later be placed in expedited removal, ICE said in an internal directive.

Unauthorized immigrants who have lived in the United States for long periods have also reportedly been summarily deported. In one case, a Guatemalan woman who had lived in the United States for 30 years was placed in expedited removal after a traffic stop in Phoenix. In another, a Mexican mother and her adult son, both of whom had been in the country for a decade, were deported 24 hours after their arrest during a traffic stop in Texas. Immigration attorneys have reported other cases, indicating that these may be more than isolated events.

One reason these cases may be occurring is that the burden in expedited removal is on the individual—not DHS—to show that they have lawful immigration status, have been in the country for more than two years, or have an asylum claim. This burden and the speed of the process can lead to serious errors. In the past, U.S. citizens have been removed through expedited removal, such as in a 2000 case when Sharon McKnight, a U.S. citizen with a mental disability, was deported to Jamaica a day after returning to the United States from a long trip.

The lack of legal representation can also exacerbate challenges for noncitizens who may not know how to exercise their rights. Most individuals facing deportation lack legal representation, and many have been issued removal orders before they can make a phone call. Lack of language interpretation can also create challenges, since approximately one in every 12 U.S. residents—including millions of U.S. citizens—had limited English proficiency as of 2023.

Many of these issues have been persistent. In 2005, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom found that 15 percent of requests for an asylum interview were not referred to asylum officers; follow-up reviews in 2016 and 2025 found continued issues, but did not quantify the lack of referrals. “[F]lawed screening and documentation practices, a lack of training and quality control,” and other issues “remain unaddressed 20 years later,” the commission concluded in 2025.

Court Challenges to Trump’s Expansion

The Trump administration’s expansion of expedited removal was quickly challenged in court by groups alleging the moves exceed statutory authority. In August, a federal judge in Washington, DC blocked the application of expedited removal to parolees, ruling the government had exceeded its authority. Days later, the same judge blocked the expansion of expedited removal into the U.S. interior, finding that the administration’s policies violated constitutional due-process rights. The Justice Department has appealed both rulings. In New York City, a federal judge in September allowed the administration to continue arresting noncitizens at immigration court hearings but made it harder for immigration judges to dismiss cases, declaring they needed to provide individualized reasons.

While the expansion of fast-track removal authority remains paused, officials can continue to apply expedited removal to migrants encountered within 14 days of their arrival and within 100 miles of U.S. borders, as has been policy for more than two decades. This 100-mile border zone includes the largest U.S. cities—New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston—as well as all or the vast majority of 11 states. In total, about two-thirds of the U.S. population (213 million people) reside in this zone.

A Slippery Slope

Expedited removal is key to the administration’s goal of quickly removing a maximum number of deportable noncitizens with minimal judicial scrutiny, while also addressing a large case backlog.

This approach contains inherent risks. ICE officers are being compelled to meet arrest targets, and this year the administration aims to hire more than 10,000 new officers, many of whom will arrive with no immigration experience. Combined with the Supreme Court’s order allowing stops based on characteristics such as race and ethnicity, language spoken, and workplace, there is a real risk of racial profiling and arresting U.S. citizens. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh contemplated this possibility in concurring with that order, which allowed federal enforcement operations to resume in Los Angeles. A U.S. citizen or other legally present immigrant may conceivably be caught up in enforcement, Kavanaugh reasoned, but the identity check will be fast and “that individual will be free to go after the brief encounter.”

Left unsaid is that the guarantee of a quick release necessitates all U.S. residents—including citizens and green-card holders—carry proof of their status at all times. The administration’s actions, with the Supreme Court’s assent, will almost surely lead to cases in which U.S. citizens are detained for long periods of time because they cannot quickly prove their status.

As such, by using fact-track removals as its default deportation process, the Trump administration may be changing not just the system for removing unauthorized immigrants, but altering the way in which many U.S. residents now must interact with their government.

Swalwell and Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) — who previously served alongside each other in the House — were named “at the very top” of the list “as the two worst,” Swalwell said.
But Swalwell said he’s not going to be intimidated by the Trump administration.

Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), a vocal critic of President Trump, said Thursday he “fully” expects to be prosecuted by the Trump administration over his criticism but said he refuses to shy away from exercising his right to free speech.

“I’m ready for it. I fully expect it,” Swalwell said on “CNN News Central,” when asked if he’s concerned that “down the road you may be prosecuted for your criticisms of this White House.”

Swalwell noted that FBI Director Kash Patel previously wrote a book in which he listed 60 individuals he described as “government gangsters” and said should be investigated.

Swalwell and Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) — who previously served alongside each other in the House — were named “at the very top” of the list “as the two worst,” Swalwell said.

But Swalwell said he’s not going to be intimidated by the Trump administration.

“Adam Schiff is under investigation now, so, I’m ready for it. I expect it, but I’m not going to flinch. I’m not hiding under the bed. I’m not going to shrink because that’s the aim. That’s why they do this, is they hope that dissent and oversight goes away.”

“And if I shrink and if Adam Schiff shrinks, then why wouldn’t everyday Americans shrink?” he continued. “And so, I’m not going away. And they can come at me, but it’s not going to silence me, and it’s not going to stop me from working every day to put Democrats in the majority so we can finally pump the brakes on the corruption we’re seeing in this administration.”

The remarks come after Trump said Thursday that he didn’t know if the Justice Department would be pursuing charges against former FBI Director James Comey. Comey was indicted later Thursday.

Over the weekend, Trump addressed his attorney general directly in a social media post, complaining that “nothing is being done” to bring cases against several of his political opponents, including Comey and Schiff, adding, “They’re all guilty as hell.”

The president has long called for charges against Comey, a Trump critic, based on his congressional testimony on Sept. 30, 2020, related to the investigation into possible Russian ties to Trump’s 2016 campaign. The five-year statute of limitations on the testimony expires Tuesday.

During a congressional hearing last week, Swalwell asked Patel about the list in his book and whether he would commit to recusing himself from making any decisions on potential investigations into people named on his list. But he declined.

“You identified 60 individuals in that book,” Swalwell said last week. “You put me on that list at the top of the list.”

“Thank you. My children find it flattering. Twenty of those individuals have been investigated or have had adverse actions. Director, considering that you’ve identified these people as, quote, government gangsters, will you recuse yourself from making any investigation decisions about these individuals?”

Patel said “no” he would not and lashed out at Swalwell.

“I’m going to borrow your terminology and call bulls‑‑‑ on your entire career in Congress,” Patel said.

The city located three-and-a-half hours northwest of New Orleans with a population of 43,000 doesn’t show up on terminal screens; its draw is that it is an ICE deportation flight hub.
While RIC’s activity has increased 10% overall in 2025, per FlightAware’s statistics, the ICE deportation flights may not be included in those statistics.
Immigrant Justice’s online publication “Exposing ICE Detention Contracts and Inspections Transparency Project” lists 96 ICE detention centers nation-wide that sometimes use space in government-run local or state facilities.
To watch an ICE deportation flight at RIC raises numerous questions of accountability about what just occurred and who was involved.","Hidden in plain sight, behind the Richmond Jet Center and less than a mile from the Richmond International Airport terminal, throngs of shackled people have been loaded onto airplanes with no attributed owner about 80 separate times so far this year, according to a human rights organization and Citizen observations.

Human Rights First reports that those people then have in many cases been flown (either directly or indirectly) to the country’s largest U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement hub in Alexandria, Louisiana, where more than 1,000 deportation flights from cities throughout the U.S. have landed since January.

These are not flights that RIC passengers on Delta, American Airlines or Southwest routes will see listed on the arrival or departure screens in the main terminal. These passengers never enter the terminal’s doors, since Richmond Jet Center (the fixed-base operator facilitating the flights) operates as a private terminal.

But the deportation domestic transfer – or “shuffle” – flights, which facilitate movement of ICE-detainees between a growing network of domestic immigration detention centers, share the runway with the other commercial jets.

The HRF's recently released document “ICE Flight Monitor August 2025 Monthly Report” puts RIC among the top airports this year for such ""shuffles."" Through August, according to the report, RIC had witnessed 72 inbound ICE flights, ranking it 16th in the nation between Dallas, Texas (with 75 flights) and Las Vegas, Nevada (71).

Once they land, those flights pick up their passengers and fly either to another domestic airport to do the same thing or to a final U.S. destination (often Alexandria, Louisiana) to drop those passengers off.

Determining who the passengers on these types of ICE flights are, where they were detained and what evidence exists to demonstrate their illegal presence in the U.S. has proven difficult for a number of media outlets nationwide.

But there are many more of the flights this year than there were in 2024.

From Jan. 20 to Aug. 31, the HRF report shows there were a total of 4,422 domestic transfer flights in the U.S. – up dramatically from the 2,507 such flights during the same period in 2024.

This August alone, through open-source flight tracking platforms, ICE Flight Monitor tracked 805 shuffle flights across the country.

Human rights concerns

Besides the lack of awareness that unobserved deportation flights are occurring in communities such as Henrico, the HRF flags these flights as methods for the Trump administration to achieve mass deportations by means of expedited removal – including potentially terminating protected legal status, disappearing people without due process including transferring people to high security prisons in El Salvador and forcibly transferring people to other countries of which they are not citizens.

“These actions, many of which have been determined to be unlawful by federal courts, have been carried out with little to no transparency, while thousands of people’s lives are uprooted from communities across the country and their rights are systematically violated,” according to the HRF report.

The organization also raised concerns about the conditions in which people on immigration enforcement flights typically are handled, reporting that they “are generally restrained by handcuffs, waist chains and leg irons, including during any layovers and fuel stops.”

Some, it reported, have been shackled for as long as 30 hours on multi-country flights.

Additionally, numerous national media outlets along with the American Immigration Council reported $14.4 billion is being spent on ICE arrests, detention and deportation flights, and the recently passed H.R. 1 law dramatically increased ICE’s total annual budget from $9.9 billion in 2024 to $28.7 billion.

For many groups, that number is a concern.

Shackled people loaded onto 2 separate flights Sept. 17

Last week, before an unmarked, 55-seat, white EMBRAER EMB-145XR airplane with blue tail stripes and N974DC marking touched down at 11:22 a.m. on Wednesday morning on the Richmond International Airport tarmac, its route was shown on the app FlightAware as it left the Alexandria, Louisiana airport, with the unknown identifier TYSON59.

The city located three-and-a-half hours northwest of New Orleans with a population of 43,000 doesn’t show up on terminal screens; its draw is that it is an ICE deportation flight hub.

Investigations in publications such as the The New York Times show that the name more commonly associated with a chicken producer is being used by ICE and its contractor airlines to conceal deportation flights from public logs. Simple Flying reported the many airlines contracted by ICE are flying under false, so-called “dummy” call signs to avoid being tracked by watchdog civil rights groups and members of the American public.

By the time the plane pulled up to the private Richmond Jet Center terminal on that drizzly morning Sept. 17, three unmarked white vans with darkened windows awaited it.

As observed from outside fencing topped with concertina wire surrounding the FBO area, shackled men dressed in street clothes emerged one by one from the vans to walk up the airplane steps, being frisked on the way by people in dark and fluorescent unidentified uniforms, with no clear law enforcement markings.

As this process continued, another larger airplane arrived with the Eastern airline’s logo on its side and orange and blue swirling design on its tail. The taller and longer Boeing 777-200ER, accommodates 379 economy seats and is billed on the airline's website as being built for long-haul passenger flights.

Handlers and people who appeared to be guards dropped a collection of backpacks and red plastic bags on the tarmac with what might have been the belongings of the shackled men. Those bags then were loaded into the back of the EMBRAER airplane.

Once all the shackled passengers were loaded onto the plane from the vans, a man entered the plane, emerging minutes later with shackles that hung to the ground, which he threw inside one of the vans with finality.

Once full and loaded, the crew closed the door of the smaller plane and taxied to the runway for takeoff at 12:13 p.m. into the clouds in as perfunctory a way as it arrived.

A white bus and multiple vans then neared the Eastern Boeing 777-200ER airplane then ready on the tarmac for its shackled passengers to board, repeating the process of sending shackled men from the vehicles to the plane with a pause for frisking. Delta, American Airlines and Southwest planes, as well as smaller planes, landed and took off at the airport during this process.

Again, crew dropped red plastic bags of belongings on the ground toward the rear of the plane and then loaded them as a fuel truck serviced the aircraft. Rain drizzled down. The men wearing street clothes continued to board in shackles.

Again, as the vehicles emptied and the plane filled, the red bags were loaded, and the mundane procedures of takeoff took place. A staffer wearing fluorescent clothing stood in front of the plane to wave it onto the runway as the Eastern airplane waited its turn on the runway.

At 1:12 pm, the Eastern airlines flight ascended, following an an American Airlines flight, disappearing into the clouds in the southwest direction as the rain continued to drizzle.

FlightAware again captured the route of the previous flight of the EMBRAER EMB-145XR airplane with blue tail stripes and N974DC marking, which landed in Alexandria, Louisiana not long after the Eastern plane took off.

'We don’t give information out'

Verifying if the scene was in fact a deportation “shuffle” flight proved challenging, as a special security classification was granted to ICE by the Trump administration. Though ICE did not respond by publication time to an email and Freedom of Information Act request from the Citizen seeking clarification about the scene at RIC or the numbers cited in the HRF report, it was still well within its legal 20-day window of time during which it may do so.

The receptionist at the Richmond Jet Center would not explain if the shackled men boarded onto flights on the tarmac in front of the location minutes earlier were part of an ICE deportation flight, either.

“Most of these are private and corporate jets, and these larger ones are private also. We don't give that information out,” the receptionist said.

When asked if the Richmond Jet Center records flights and could provide a record of flights directly or through the airport log, the receptionist said, “We don’t have to record anything.” Reporting movement, she said, was up to the carrier.

An RIC spokesperson also said he did not have knowledge or information about ICE deportation flights, although he said he was familiar with the The New York Times report naming Richmond as an airport from which ICE deportation flight originate.

Varina District Supervisor Tyrone Nelson (whose district includes the airport) and Fairfield District Supervisor Roscoe Cooper, III – both of whom are members of the Capital Region Airport Commission – told the Citizen Sept. 25 that they were not aware of ICE flights at RIC.

“I didn't know it was happening,"" said Nelson, who serves as vice chair of the commission. ""I need to learn more. I mean, it sucks. I don't like ICE, and I don't like these whole mass deportation efforts for political clout. I'll find out more.”

Contractor hiring transportation officers to move detainees

Vehicles and uniforms used on the tarmac point to the GEO Group, a private corrections contractor benefiting from the ICE expansion. A search into government contracts, other investigations and the GEO Group’s Richmond job listing descriptions matched the actions viewed Sept. 17.

The GEO Group is looking to hire Richmond-based transportation officers who “securely transport federal detainees between destinations in high-risk operations and high-profile federal government transportation contracts.”

The GEO Group also has job openings for flight security officers, based in Alexandria, Louisiana to perform activities seen in front of the Richmond Jet Center Sept. 17 – specifically, to load and unload people onto and off of aircraft and search the passengers. People in these roles also apply restraints and remove them as applicable.

An email response from Christopher V. Ferreira, the GEO Group’s director of corporate relations did not answer any questions posed about the company's activities at RIC – and specifically those seen Sept. 17 – and deferred questions to ICE.

An Aug. 14 report by CNN on the rise of ICE flights and the challenges of tracking them recorded similar scenes of shackled men boarding planes at the Richmond Jet Center. The reporter said the blocked tail numbers makes it impossible for families to track the detainees who might spend hours shackled.

HRF deportation flights data logged between 2020 and 2025 puts RIC in the top 20 spot of domestic departure cities, with a total of 326 ICE outbound flights. That means the number of flights tracked in 2025 compose about 25% of the total deportation flights from the airport during that time.

The HRF report concluded that in total this year through August, there had been been more than 7,700 removal, removal-related or domestic shuffle immigration enforcement flights.

The most recent ICE Air Flights tracking report by the Witness At The Border group, which bears witness to “the consequences of policies which inhibit the right of people to migrate,” documented a total of 1,214 ICE deportation flights in July 2025, with 727 being domestic shuffle flights, like the ones that flew out of RIC Sept. 17.

The report described domestic ICE air contracts with the airline broker CSI Aviation, which it said in turn subcontracts the flights to GlobalX, Eastern Air Express, Avelo Airlines, World Atlantic (Caribbean Sun), Eastern Air, OMNI Air, and Kaiser. Historically, and currently, the vast majority of the flights are operated by GlobalX, Eastern Air Express and Avelo, the report said.

International deportation flights have another set of organization and carriers.

Witness At The Border’s information is based upon securing all flight information from the publicly available FlightAware application, FlightRadar24, AirNav, and the ADB-S tracking system. Monitors then filter the flights to the likely ICE Air removal and destination locations to identify the removal flights.

The Alexandria, Louisiana airport’s activity has increased 60%, according to FlightAware. The app’s data demonstrates the role that the airport apparently plays on any given day in receiving ICE deportation “shuffle flights” from throughout the country and then deportation flights bound for destinations abroad.

While RIC’s activity has increased 10% overall in 2025, per FlightAware’s statistics, the ICE deportation flights may not be included in those statistics.

But deportation flights originating from RIC have been public knowledge for several months.

A July, investigative report produced by The New York Times explained “How Louisiana Became ICE Detention Central,” through which journalists tracked flights from around the country to the small community described as the top ICE transit hub for deportations in the country.

The video report called out RIC as a deportation flight destination.

No other Virginia airport is listed in the HRF report, and the two North Carolina airports listed received only a combined total of 10 inbound ICE flights through August this year, leading to the understanding that RIC is a hub to ship off detained people from area detention centers.

Immigrant Justice’s online publication “Exposing ICE Detention Contracts and Inspections Transparency Project” lists 96 ICE detention centers nation-wide that sometimes use space in government-run local or state facilities.

Six detention centers in Virginia, with locations throughout the state (including sites where ICE has contracts), include the Caroline Detention Facility, Hampton Roads, Immigration Centers of America Farmville, Northwestern Regional Juvenile Detention Center, Rappahannock Regional Jail and Virginia Peninsula Regional Jail.

In North Carolina, ICE has a detention contract at Henderson County.

ICE agents made 4,264 arrests in Virginia during the first seven months of the year, nearly three times the number for the entire previous year, according to an analysis of federal court records compiled by VPM, but most of those detainees did not have criminal records.

Other recent reporting cites the removal of dozens of immigration judges, raising concerns for some about the right to due process for those who are detained.

To watch an ICE deportation flight at RIC raises numerous questions of accountability about what just occurred and who was involved.

But as the Eastern Airlines flight departed RIC Sept. 17 in view of the airport administration building and the private terminals, disappearing into the clouds, few people were there to witness it.",https://www.henricocitizen.com/content/images/2025/09/Screen-Shot-2025-09-25-at-2.52.54-PM.png,N,,2025-09-25 22:56:41.224314

“If you have hundreds of thousands of fake asylum seekers, then what happens to the real asylum system?” Landau said. “Saying the process is susceptible to abuse is not xenophobic; it is not being a mean or bad person.”

Trump has sought to overhaul the US immigration system and recruit other countries to join in its efforts. Thursday’s panel included representatives from Kosovo, Bangladesh, Liberia and Panama.

Among the changes the Trump administration has sought is a reimagining of the asylum system, which started to take shape following World War II.

Landau explained that the US would like to see asylum become a temporary status, with claimants eventually returning home.

The Trump administration also emphasised that there is no right to receive asylum in a country of choice.

Under the current system — enshrined in US law in 1980 — people seeking asylum are able to apply once they are on US soil, regardless of whether they arrived through legal pathways.

To qualify, applicants have to show a fear of persecution in their home country because of specific reasons related to their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinions.

Applications can sometimes take months, if not years, to be reviewed. Still, Landau argued that the system has become vulnerable to fraud.

“The asylum system has become a huge loophole in our migration laws,” Landau said. “I think we have to be realistic that these laws are now being abused.”

But suspected fraud in asylum claims accounts for a small fraction of unsuccessful claims, according to the Arizona Center for Investigative Reporting in April.

Trump champions immigration crackdown

Since winning his second term in the 2024 elections, Trump has made stemming immigration a core focus of his presidency.

Part of that campaign has been tightening the asylum process. On January 20, his first day back in office, Trump issued a proclamation invoking the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) as a means of restricting asylum at the southern US border.

“This authority,” Trump wrote, “necessarily includes the right to deny the physical entry of aliens into the United States and impose restrictions on access to portions of the immigration system.”

The proclamation was necessary, he argued, to halt what he described as an “invasion” of immigrants.

But in July, a federal court ruled that Trump overstepped his authority by barring asylum claims.

Congress, the court explained, had established the laws governing asylum. If the president were allowed to disregard those laws and establish his own asylum policies, he risked creating an “alternative immigration system”, according to the ruling.

That same month, a federal judge ruled the president could not block approved refugees from entering the country under the guise of a wider travel ban.

Critics have long argued that Trump’s policies risk forcing asylum seekers back into dangerous circumstances where their lives and wellbeing could be at risk.

In a statement to The Associated Press, Bill Frelick, the director of refugee and migrant rights at Human Rights Watch, said the US’s plan “looks like the first step in a bid to tear down the global refugee system”.

But Trump himself has used his platform to warn of the dangers he claims are associated with immigration.

In his speech to the UN General Assembly this week, Trump argued that accepting immigrants was “destroying” other countries. He pointed to Europe as an example.

“They’re being destroyed. Europe is in serious trouble. They’ve been invaded by a force of illegal aliens like nobody’s ever seen before. Illegal aliens are pouring into Europe.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ap_68d2c00dd32e2-1758642189.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-09-25 19:57:56.258439

Ruling marks the significant milestone of winning final judgment and a permanent injunction from the District Court

September 25, 2025 (SAINT PAUL) — Attorney General Ellison today announced an important victory in a multistate lawsuit he and a coalition of other attorneys general filed against the Trump administration over its attempt to illegally coerce states into sweeping immigration enforcement by threatening to withhold billions in federal funding for emergency preparedness and preventing and addressing terrorist attacks, mass shootings, wildfires, floods, cybersecurity threats, and more.

Yesterday afternoon, September 24, U.S. District Court in Rhode Island granted a motion for summary judgement that Attorney General Ellison and 20 attorneys general requested in their May 13, 2025 lawsuit against the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The court held that the agencies violated the Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act by conditioning all federal funds from FEMA and DHS on states’ agreement to assist in enforcing federal immigration law.

In yesterday’s decision, the court agreed that DHS violated the Administrative Procedure Act in adding the conditions, including because the agency failed to consider public safety in doing so and because the conditions are overly broad and ambiguous. The court further found that the conditions violate the Constitution’s Spending Clause. The court rejected DHS’ argument that placing immigration-related conditions on the grant funding was appropriate simply because many of the grants are designed to prevent and respond to acts of terrorism. Instead, the court determined that DHS made no serious attempt to provide a fact-based reason for its action. In fact, the court found that the “vague and confusing language” used in the conditions made it nearly impossible for states to comply.

The state of Minnesota uses funds from FEMA to work with local law enforcement to fight crime, provide incident management support after natural disasters, purchase bomb squad equipment, train first responders, and more. Losing access to that funding would have jeopardized public safety across Minnesota.

""The Trump Administration tried to stop our tax dollars from coming back to Minnesota to fund law enforcement, prepare for natural disasters, and improve public safety. Fortunately, they did not succeed,” said Attorney General Ellison. “Minnesotans would be less safe if our police stepped away from their patrols, investigations, and community-engagement work to instead enforce Trump’s immigration priorities. I am pleased to have successfully blocked this unconstitutional attempt to divert police resources away from the communities they serve, and I will continue to defend the rule of law and protect the rights and safety of Minnesotans everywhere.”

In February, Secretary Noem directed DHS and its sub-agencies, including FEMA, to cease federal funding to jurisdictions that do not assist the federal government in the enforcement of federal immigration law. In March, DHS amended the terms and conditions it places on all federal funds to require recipients to certify that they will assist in enforcing federal immigration law. These sweeping new conditions would require states and state agencies to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts or lose out on billions of federal dollars that states use to protect public safety.

In filing the May lawsuit, Ellison and the coalition argued that the immigration conditions exceed DHS’s legal authority and violate the Constitution because the programs in question were established to help states prepare for, protect against, respond to and recover from catastrophic disasters, not for immigration-related purposes. The district court agreed, holding that imposing the condition on all DHS and FEMA programs, regardless of the purpose of those programs, was unlawful.

Joining Attorney General Ellison in the lawsuit, which was co-led by the attorneys general of California, Illinois, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, were the attorneys general from Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin, and Vermont.",https://www.ag.state.mn.us/_Img/Logo_SM.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 20:57:48.022602

When detainees request a bond redetermination hearing before an immigration judge, judges often deny the request on the basis that under DHS’ newest interpretation of federal law, they have no jurisdiction over the matter.
One of those cases involves Armando Garcia Picazo, who was arrested by ICE on Aug. 8, 2025, in Sioux City.
Court records indicate that after he was arrested, Garcia participated in a bond redetermination hearing in front of an immigration judge.
As part of that lawsuit, Woodbury County Sheriff Chad Sheehan is being sued due to his having physical and administrative custody over Garcia.","A western Iowa county is being sued over the federal government’s refusal to release jailed immigration detainees, even in cases where judges have ordered their release on bond.

The lawsuits claim that federal immigration officials have concocted a “scheme” whereby detainees with no criminal record can be jailed indefinitely despite judges approving their release upon payment of a bond.

The cases stem from a policy that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security adopted in July 2025, holding that all employees of DHS’ Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), were to consider anyone who is alleged to have entered the United States illegally to be subject to mandatory detention.

When detainees request a bond redetermination hearing before an immigration judge, judges often deny the request on the basis that under DHS’ newest interpretation of federal law, they have no jurisdiction over the matter.

In the past three weeks, a growing number of detainees have sought relief from such rulings by filing lawsuits that go before federal judges in U.S. District Court. That’s partly because of a Sept. 5, 2025, decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals. In that decision, the board adopted DHS’ latest interpretation of the law, finding that immigration judges lack the authority to even consider bond requests.

Now, another twist has been added to the legal conflict: Even in those cases where an immigration judge has set a bond for immigration detainees seeking release while their cases are pending, Homeland Security and ICE are refusing to accept payment of that bond and are keeping the detainees behind bars in county jails.

The result is that counties operating those jails are now being sued in federal court. In Iowa’s Woodbury County, for example, two such lawsuits were filed in the past week.

One of those cases involves Armando Garcia Picazo, who was arrested by ICE on Aug. 8, 2025, in Sioux City. According to court records, that arrest stemmed from an ICE and Drug Enforcement Administration surveillance operation that centered on another individual.

According to Garcia’s attorneys, the government has admitted that because Garcia “looked like” the individual being sought, he was detained and was later charged by ICE for having no legitimate immigration status in the United States.

Garcia has lived in Iowa for about nine years and has no criminal history, according to his lawyers.

Court records indicate that after he was arrested, Garcia participated in a bond redetermination hearing in front of an immigration judge. Citing Garcia’s lack of criminal history and his ties to the community, the judge on Sept. 12, 2025, ordered Garcia’s release upon payment of a $6,000 bond. Garcia’s family then attempted, without success, to post the bond.

“ICE will not allow them to post it,” Garcia’s lawyers argue in their newly filed lawsuit. “ICE refuses to release Mr. Garcia from custody, relying on a federal regulation giving DHS unilateral authority to block an immigration judge’s custody order.”

Garcia’s lawyers are now asking a U.S. District Court judge to intervene, rule that Garcia’s detention is unconstitutional, and order his release from jail upon payment of the bond.

As part of that lawsuit, Woodbury County Sheriff Chad Sheehan is being sued due to his having physical and administrative custody over Garcia. The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Sheehan at his office on Thursday.

“For nine years, Garcia has worked hard, paid taxes, and contributed to the Iowa community,” Garcia’s lawyers have told the court in seeking intervention. “Mr. Garcia has significant ties to the community … He has many friends and is a skilled mechanic who often helps his community while expecting nothing in return. He has no criminal record and has never had any legal issues whatsoever until the current civil proceedings. Mr. Garcia was arrested by ICE on August 8, 2025, while walking out of his home because he apparently resembled a different man the government actually intended to arrest.”

The other Woodbury County case involves Francisco Torres Aleman, 34, of Omaha, who was detained in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, on June 28, 2025.

According to his lawyers, Aleman was born in Guatemala and came to the United States at least 12 years ago. They say he has no criminal history and is the father of two daughters who are U.S. citizens.

Court papers filed by Aleman’s attorneys give conflicting accounts as to how Aleman was arrested. In their petition seeking intervention by U.S. District Court, they state that Aleman was “arrested following a traffic stop in Sioux Falls,” but in that same document they say he was “detained while washing his car on June 28, 2025.”

Court records indicate that on Aug. 19, 2025, an immigration judge authorized the posting of a $20,000 bond that would allow for Aleman’s release while his immigration case was pending. Aleman’s family then attempted to post the bond through the required computerized processing system called “ICE CeBonds,” but each attempt was allegedly denied.

Aleman remains behind bars in the Woodbury County Jail, his attorneys allege. In seeking court invention, they argue that his continued detention not only contradicts the judge’s order on bond, it also inhibits his ability to argue against his removal from the country in that he can’t communicate with potential witnesses or earn wages to afford legal representation in the case.

“This scheme,” Aleman’s lawyers argue in court, is “plainly designed by the executive branch to give DHS the power to circumvent both immigration judge and Board of Immigration Appeals orders … The regulations are written in such a way that it does not matter what either the immigration judge and Board of Immigration Appeals orders; if the government disagrees, the government can, through its own actions and per its own regulations, keep the noncitizen detained indefinitely.”

In addition to Sheriff Sheehan, the two Woodbury County cases name as defendants Peter Berg, the director of the ICE field office in St. Paul, Minnesota; Todd M. Lyons, the acting director of ICE; Kristi Noem, the secretary of Homeland Security; Pamela Jo Bondi, the attorney general of the United States and head of the U.S. Department of Justice; and President Donald J. Trump .

In recent years, with the rapid evolution of generative AI, we are entering a society where it is difficult to distinguish between humans and AI. Against this backdrop, World ID aims to provide “digital proof of human”.

The Orb, an advanced camera, is used to verify humanness of individuals without identifying them.

Once verification is complete, a verified World ID is issued and stored in World App, enabling its use across various compatible services.

Novel nonpeptide SST2 agonist PALSONIFY advances the treatment paradigm as the first once-daily, oral therapy approved by the FDA to treat acromegaly

Approval based on data from two pivotal Phase 3 trials where PALSONIFY was well tolerated and resulted in rapid, durable, and consistent biochemical control and reduced symptom burden

Launch of lead product PALSONIFY marks a pivotal milestone for Crinetics as the premier endocrine-focused global pharmaceutical company

Investor call to be held today at 6:00 pm ET

SAN DIEGO, Sept. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Crinetics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: CRNX) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved PALSONIFY TM (paltusotine) for the first-line treatment of adults with acromegaly who had an inadequate response to surgery and/or for whom surgery is not an option. PALSONIFY, a selectively-targeted somatostatin receptor type 2 nonpeptide (SST2) agonist, is now the first once-daily, oral treatment approved for adults with acromegaly.

""With the FDA approval of our lead therapy Palsonify, today marks a new era for those living with acromegaly and also for Crinetics as a company,” said Scott Struthers, Ph.D., Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Crinetics. “We are very pleased to be fulfilling our commitment to transforming patient lives. This approval is the first to come from our deep pipeline of first-in-class, small molecule drugs. This would not be possible without the help and partnership of people living with acromegaly, their caretakers, our employees, and the clinical researchers and health care professionals who contributed to Palsonify’s successful development program. Thank you to all involved.”

The approval is based on data from the PATHFNDR-1 and PATHFNDR-2 Phase 3 pivotal trials, which evaluated PALSONIFY’s safety and efficacy in previously treated and medically untreated adults with acromegaly. Across both trials, PALSONIFY consistently demonstrated rapid onset, reliable biochemical control, and sustained efficacy.

Participants also reported significant reductions in signs and symptoms associated with acromegaly as measured by the Acromegaly Symptom Diary (ASD) — an FDA-aligned patient-reported outcome tool developed to capture the symptoms that matter to people living with acromegaly. Symptoms include headaches, joint pain, sweating, fatigue, weakness, swelling, and/or numbness/tingling. PALSONIFY was generally well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported in the randomized controlled portion of the trials.

Long-term results from the open-label extension (OLE) phases of both trials were presented at this year’s Endocrine Society’s annual meeting, ENDO 2025, providing further evidence of PALSONIFY’s ability to deliver durable IGF-1 control, sustained improvements in patient symptom burden, and a consistent safety profile. Ninety-one percent of patients from PATHFNDR-1 and 97 percent of completers from PATHFNDR-2 enrolled in the OLE.

“The PATHFNDR clinical development program set a new standard for acromegaly treatment by demonstrating the ability of Palsonify to drive both biochemical and symptom control, regardless of the degree of underlying disease severity,” said Dr. Shlomo Melmed, Executive Vice President of Medicine and Health Sciences and Dean of the Medical Faculty at Cedars-Sinai. “The approval of Palsonify is a significant advancement for our patients, as there is an unmet need for an easy-to-administer and safe therapeutic option with a rapid action and durable response that can consistently manage acromegaly.”

“For people living with acromegaly, treatment once meant burdensome injections, breakthrough symptoms, and lifestyle sacrifices just to stay on track,” said Jill Sisco, President of Acromegaly Community. “What matters most to our community – maintaining consistent control so the disease doesn’t control us – led us to partner with the FDA on Externally Led Patient-Focused Drug Development meetings. This new treatment reflects that our voices have been heard in shaping the next generation of acromegaly care.”

PALSONIFY is expected to be available in the U.S. in early October. Crinetics is ensuring broad access to PALSONIFY by working closely with payers, healthcare providers, and patient advocacy organizations to support those who may benefit from this treatment.

As part of this commitment, Crinetics has launched CrinetiCARE ® , a comprehensive support program designed to assist people living with acromegaly throughout their treatment journey. CrinetiCARE provides disease and product education, benefit verification, financial assistance resources, and access to dedicated nurse educators who can offer support with treatment onboarding and ongoing adherence. For more information, visit www.CrinetiCARE.com or the PALSONIFY product website Palsonify.com .

A Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for paltusotine in acromegaly is currently under review for use in the European Union, and the current timeline for the Committee for Medicinal Products and Human Use (CHMP) opinion is the first half of 2026. Crinetics is in partnership with Sanwa Kagaku Kenkyuso (SKK) to develop and commercialize paltusotine for acromegaly in Japan.

Paltusotine is also being evaluated for the treatment of carcinoid syndrome in the pivotal Phase 3 CAREFNDR trial.

About PALSONIFY™ (Paltusotine)

PALSONIFY, a selectively-targeted somatostatin receptor type 2 (SST2) nonpeptide agonist is the first and only once-daily, oral therapy approved for the treatment of adults with acromegaly who had an inadequate response to surgery and/or for whom surgery is not an option. In Phase 3 studies, once-daily, oral PALSONIFY maintained IGF-1 levels and symptom control in patients with acromegaly who were switched from monthly injectable medications (PATHFNDR-1) and rapidly decreased IGF-1 levels and symptom burden in medically untreated acromegaly patients (PATHFNDR-2). IGF-1 is the primary biomarker endocrinologists use to manage acromegaly patients. Paltusotine is also in Phase 3 clinical development for carcinoid syndrome associated with neuroendocrine tumors (CAREFNDR). Results from a Phase 2 study in carcinoid syndrome demonstrated rapid and sustained reductions in flushing episodes and bowel movement frequency, which are the most common symptoms of carcinoid syndrome.

Beijing, Sept. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kuke Music Holding Limited (NYSE: KUKE) (“Kuke” or the “Company”), a leading classical music services platform in China, today announced that it has acquired a controlling interest in Naxos Music Group, one of the world’s largest independent classical music companies.

Transaction Overview

Under the terms of the agreements signed on September 17, 2025, Kuke acquired on the same day a controlling interest in Naxos Music Group through two transactions involving Naxos One Holding Limited (“Naxos One”) and Desun Holding Limited (“Desun”), one of the two existing shareholders of Naxos One (the other shareholder is hereinafter referred to as the “Other Existing Shareholder”):

Share Subscription Agreement : Kuke firstly subscribed for 17,500 newly issued Class B ordinary shares of Naxos One at US$6,000 per share, for an aggregate consideration of US$105 million (the “Share Issuance Transaction”).

Share Purchase Agreement : Kuke secondly acquired 108 Class A ordinary shares of Naxos One from Desun (which automatically converted into 108 Class B ordinary shares of Naxos One upon transfer) at US$12,500 per share, for an aggregate consideration of US$1.35 million (the “Share Transfer Transaction”).

The total transaction value is approximately US$106.35 million, and was settled entirely through the issuance of Kuke’s Class A ordinary shares as consideration.

Transaction Structure and Consideration

Kuke issued 652,997,260 Class A ordinary shares and 8,395,679 Class A ordinary shares (collectively, the “Consideration Shares”) to Naxos One and Desun, as consideration for the Share Issuance Transaction and the Share Transfer Transaction, respectively. Each Consideration Share was valued at US$0.1608 (“Price Per Consideration Share”) based on the average closing price of Kuke’s American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) for the 60 trading days immediately preceding September 17, 2025, discounted by 30%.

Pursuant to the terms of the Share Subscription Agreement, the consideration may be settled either in cash (if Kuke has sufficient available funds at the closing) or through the issuance of Kuke’s Class A ordinary shares. When settled through share issuance, the shares issued to Naxos One include redemption provisions allowing either party to initiate cash redemption at cost under certain circumstances, with the shares subject to lock-up and dividend waiver provisions until redemption. Kuke has committed to pursue financing to enable cash redemption as soon as reasonably practicable.

Under the Share Purchase Agreement, the Consideration Shares held by Desun are subject to a lock-up period of 24 months.

Upon completion of the transactions, Kuke holds approximately 70.43% of the outstanding shares of Naxos One, which in turn controls Naxos Music Group.

Approvals, Shareholder Rights and Contingency of Unwinding the Transactions

The transactions have been approved by Kuke’s shareholders, Board of Directors and Audit Committee, following review by the Board of Directors and Audit Committee of an independent valuation report prepared by Jones Lang LaSalle Corporate Appraisal and Advisory Limited.

The Share Issuance Transaction was subject to the preemptive right of existing shareholders of Naxos One to subscribe for up to its pro rata portion of the Class B ordinary shares proposed to be issued by Naxos One, which if exercised would reduce the number of Class B ordinary shares available for issuance to third parties (including Kuke) by such number of shares with respect to which the preemptive right was duly exercised. The preemptive right expired at the end of September 25, 2025, Hong Kong time, and neither shareholder exercised its preemptive right prior to such time. The Share Transfer Transaction was subject to the tag-along right and an additional sale right of the Other Existing Shareholder which if exercised would require Kuke to purchase such number of additional Class B ordinary shares of Naxos One that the Other Existing Shareholder decides to sell to Kuke along with the Share Transfer Transaction. These rights also expired at the end of September 25, 2025, Hong Kong time, and the Other Existing Shareholder did not exercise such rights prior to such time.

Pursuant to a Supplement Agreement entered into on September 17, 2025, Kuke, Naxos One and Desun agreed that, if the Other Existing Shareholder had validly exercised its preemptive right, the parties would have taken all actions to cancel such number of Class B ordinary shares already issued to Kuke equal to the number of shares the Other Existing Shareholder proposed to subscribe, and would have concurrently cancelled the corresponding Consideration Shares issued by Kuke to Naxos One. Additionally, if the Other Existing Shareholder had exercised its tag-along right and/or additional sale right, Kuke undertook to purchase all Class B ordinary shares that the Other Existing Shareholder proposed to sell pursuant to such rights. As the aforementioned preemptive right remained unexercised prior to its expiration, the Share Issuance Transaction is no longer subject to any contingency that would result in an unwinding of this transaction. In addition, as the Other Existing Shareholder did not exercise its tag-along right or additional sale right prior to their expiration, Kuke is no longer under any obligation to purchase additional Class B ordinary shares in Naxos One.

– KOMET-001 in R/R NPM1 -m AML met its primary endpoint with ziftomenib monotherapy demonstrating significant clinical benefit and deep responses –

– Consistent activity across pre-specified subgroups, regardless of prior HSCT, prior venetoclax, lines of therapy, or FLT3/IDH co-mutations –

– Favorable safety and tolerability profile, including a lack of clinically significant QTc prolongation or myelosuppression –

– Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date for FDA Priority Review of ziftomenib in adults with R/R NPM1 -m AML set for November 30, 2025 –

SAN DIEGO and TOKYO, Sept. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kura Oncology, Inc. (Nasdaq: KURA) and Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd. (TSE: 4151, “Kyowa Kirin”) today announced the Journal of Clinical Oncology published the full results from the pivotal KOMET-001 clinical trial ( NCT04067336 ) evaluating ziftomenib, an investigational, once-daily, oral menin inhibitor, in adult patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) NPM1- mutated ( NPM1- m) acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Although newly diagnosed patients with NPM1 -m AML have high response rates to approved standard of care, relapses are common and survival outcomes are poor. There is currently no approved therapy to specifically target NPM1 -m AML. Ziftomenib is currently under priority review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of R/R NPM1 -m AML.

“Relapsed or refractory NPM1 -mutated AML remains very challenging to treat, particularly after venetoclax-based therapy or transplant,” said Eunice Wang, M.D., Chief of Leukemia Service, Professor of Oncology, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY. “The manuscript describes deep responses, signals of clinical activity across relevant subgroups and a generally manageable tolerability profile, which is important in treatment of late line AML patients where accumulated toxicity can limit treatment options. The benefit-risk profile of ziftomenib is highly encouraging and, if replicated in additional treatment settings, has potential to be transformative for a large population of patients with menin pathway-driven AML.”

“Publication in ASCO’s Journal of Clinical Oncology is an important advancement for adult patients with NPM1 -m AML,” said Mollie Leoni, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Kura Oncology. “In addition to evidence of monotherapy activity, the safety and tolerability profile of ziftomenib from this trial is encouraging, marked by the absence of clinically meaningful QTc prolongation as well as low rates of both myelosuppression and treatment discontinuation. No clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions were observed, including with commonly used supportive-care medications, which may simplify co-administration in a polypharmacy setting. We continue to conduct studies in earlier line settings and in combination with multiple therapeutic agents in close collaboration with investigators, study teams and our partner Kyowa Kirin.”

Summary of the published data

The publication, entitled “Ziftomenib in Relapsed or Refractory NPM1 -Mutated AML”, includes positive data from 92 adult patients with R/R NPM1 -m AML in the phase 2 portion of the clinical trial as of the primary data cutoff date of October 28, 2024.

The KOMET-001 phase 2 trial met its primary endpoint with a complete remission with full or partial hematologic recovery (CR/CRh) rate of 22% (95% CI, 14 to 32; P=0.0058), which was significantly higher than the 12% historical standard-of-care response rate for patients with R/R NPM1 -m AML. One additional response of CRh occurred after the primary analysis data cutoff resulting in a cumulative CR/CRh rate of 23% (95% CI, 15 to 33). 61% of evaluable CR/CRh responders were negative for measurable residual disease (MRD). Overall response rate (ORR) was 33% (95% CI, 23 to 43), with a median duration of overall response of 4.6 months (95% CI, 2.8 to 7.4).

Median overall survival (OS) was 6.6 months (95% CI, 3.6 to 8.6). Among ORR responders, median OS was 18.4 months (95% CI, 8.6 to not estimable) vs. 3.5 months (95% CI, 2.7 to 4.2) among non-responders. Two responders received subsequent allogeneic stem cell transplant and both resumed ziftomenib maintenance after transplant. At the time of data cutoff, nine patients (two after transplantation) remained on ziftomenib treatment. Prespecified subgroup analyses showed comparable CR/CRh rates regardless of lines of therapy, prior venetoclax exposure, or presence of co-mutations, including FLT3m or IDH1/2m.

Ziftomenib was well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with previously disclosed data. The most common grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse events were febrile neutropenia (26%), anemia (20%), and thrombocytopenia (20%). Differentiation syndrome occurred in 25% of patients (15% grade 3; no grade 4-5) and was manageable with protocol-defined mitigation. Three patients (3%) discontinued treatment because of ziftomenib-related adverse events.

These findings formed part of the data set used for the New Drug Application for ziftomenib as a potential treatment for patients with R/R NPM1- m AML. The FDA target action date is November 30, 2025. There is currently no FDA-approved treatment for patients with R/R NPM1 -m AML.

“The publication of the investigational ziftomenib data adds important scientific context for clinicians and patients,” said Takeyoshi Yamashita, Ph. D., Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, Kyowa Kirin. “Together with Kura Oncology, we are committed to rigorous, globally coordinated evidence generation to support the benefit-risk profile of menin inhibition across the treatment landscape. Our shared goal is to advance development rapidly and generate the evidence needed to deliver ziftomenib to appropriate patients in need.”

The publication is now available on the Journal of Clinical Oncology website and in the Scientific Manuscripts section on Kura’s website.

Ziftomenib is currently under clinical development, and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.

Company maintains confidence in ReNu as innovative pain management therapy

Second Phase 3 trial demonstrates numerical improvement in baseline pain reduction over the first Phase 3 trial despite not meeting the primary endpoint

Statistically significant maintenance of function (p<0.0001)

Company will request pre-BLA meeting with FDA to discuss submission pathway

CANTON, Mass., Sept. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Organogenesis Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: ORGO), a leading regenerative medicine company focused on the development, manufacture and commercialization of product solutions for the Advanced Wound Care and Surgical and Sports Medicine markets, today announced that the second Phase 3 randomized controlled trial (RCT) of ReNu, a cryopreserved amniotic suspension allograft (ASA) for the management of symptoms associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA), did not achieve statistical significance for its primary endpoint, despite the ReNu results demonstrating a numerical improvement in baseline pain reduction over the first Phase 3 trial. Baseline pain reduction at six months for ReNu was -6.9 for the second Phase 3 study compared to -6.0 in the first Phase 3 study. Additionally, the ReNu results continued to demonstrate a favorable safety profile.

The primary endpoint for the study is the difference between ReNu and Saline groups in the reduction in knee pain at six months assessed by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) pain scale. The study demonstrated a numerical improvement of -0.5 1 favoring ReNu (p=0.0393 one-sided p-value, compared to p=0.023 target threshold). The first Phase 3 trial achieved improvement of -0.7 2 favoring ReNu, which was statistically significant (p=0.0177, one sided p-value, compared to p=0.023 target threshold).

“Given the first Phase 3 trial achieved a statistically significant reduction in pain compared to Saline and the second Phase 3 trial demonstrated a numerical improvement in baseline pain reduction over the first Phase 3, we believe these results support the potential approval of ReNu for pain symptoms associated with knee OA, including those patients classified as most severe,” said Patrick Bilbo, Chief Operating Officer of Organogenesis. “As a next step, we will request a pre-BLA meeting with the FDA by the end of October to discuss the submission pathway, including using the combined efficacy analysis from both Phase 3 studies to support a BLA approval.”

ReNu has now been studied in three large RCTs of more than 1,300 patients combined. Organogenesis believes the totality of this data is compelling evidence for the FDA to review in a Biologics License Application (BLA). Additionally, the FDA granted ReNu Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation based on ReNu demonstrating the potential to treat an unmet medical need related to a serious condition.

“The results for ReNu support our continued confidence in the potential of ReNu as an innovative pain management product,” said Gary S. Gillheeney, Sr., President, Chief Executive Officer and Chair of the Board for Organogenesis. “We believe ReNu, if approved, will address a significant unmet medical need for the millions of Americans suffering from symptomatic knee OA.”

Knee OA is a degenerative joint disease that is estimated to affect more than 30 million Americans. It is ranked among the most common causes of disability and poor quality of life, generally characterized by pain and functionality deficits. End stage management of the disease in these patients is typically a total knee replacement when all other treatment options are exhausted.

The fully enrolled 594 patient second Phase 3 trial is a prospective, double-blind, multicenter, saline-controlled, parallel group, RCT of ReNu ASA, for the treatment of subjects with mild to severe symptomatic knee OA. Patients were randomized to receive a single intra-articular (IA) injection of either saline control or ReNu.

Additional top-line data tables from both Phase 3 studies are available in a Current Report on Form 8-K, which the Company filed today with the SEC and can be found at SEC.gov.

About ReNu®

ReNu is a cryopreserved, amniotic suspension allograft (ASA) developed for the management of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. ReNu consists of amniotic fluid cells and micronized amniotic membrane and contains cellular, growth factor, and extracellular matrix components. ReNu received FDA Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation for Knee OA in 2021.

LAFAYETTE, Ind., Sept. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Wabash (NYSE: WNC) , a leader in end-to-end supply chain solutions for the transportation, logistics and infrastructure markets, today announced a significant expansion of its network in the Southeast. Wabash is strengthening customer access and service in the greater Atlanta region with three strategic growth moves: opening a new Parts & Service center, expanding its dealer relationship with Fleetco and adding CS Truck and Trailer to its Preferred Partner Network.

“These moves reflect how Wabash is building an extensive partner ecosystem that puts parts, service and support closer to our customers,” said Dave Hill, vice president of Parts & Services at Wabash. “Together, these Atlanta expansions mean faster turnaround, more coverage and better reliability for fleets operating across Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina and Tennessee.”

New Atlanta Parts & Service Center

Strategically located at the heart of the Southeast’s trucking corridor, Wabash’s new Atlanta-area Parts and Services center provides faster access to parts, service and truck body upfitting. It will offer Wabash’s Ready-to-Mount (RTM) truck bodies for dry freight and platform applications with rapid turnaround times for in-stock chassis. The Atlanta site joins Wabash service centers in California, Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas, with additional locations on the way. Doors opened September 18, 2025.

Fleetco Dealer Expansion

Fleetco, a long-standing Wabash dealer, will now represent Wabash in the greater Atlanta market with trailer sales. This expansion broadens Wabash’s dealer footprint in the Southeast and gives customers additional access to new and used equipment through a trusted partner.

“We’re proud to grow our existing partnership with Wabash in the greater Atlanta market,” said Bill Tirrill, president at Fleetco Inc. “With more than 14 years of experience working closely with Wabash, this new chapter in Atlanta allows us to expand our sales force across the region and provide our clients immediate access to new and used trailers. We will be able to improve the expertise and commitment our clients expect from the Fleetco/Wabash team. Together we’re creating more opportunities to serve our clients, allowing them to keep on trucking.”

Preferred Partner Network Addition

Wabash also added three CS Truck and Trailer locations to its Preferred Partner Network in Georgia, which brings expert service, maintenance and Wabash Genuine Parts to more customers through authorized third-party dealerships. The Preferred Partner Network model is central to Wabash’s strategy of making high-quality parts more accessible through a seamless national network.

“As our customer base grows, expanding our dealer and partner network is critical to delivering the speed and service customers expect,” Hill added. “Atlanta is a perfect example of how we’re executing that strategy—combining service centers, dealer partners, and the Preferred Partner Network to increase coverage and elevate the customer experience.”

The suit also argues that the DHS policy is unlawful due to the appropriations law.
Coogle pushed back and said that even the House’s seven-week continuing resolution to avoid a partial government shutdown, passed last week, contained the oversight provision.
He added that Congress has multiple tools to conduct oversight of DHS facilities, such as withdrawing funding from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or impeaching officials.
The provision later was expanded to include all immigrants detained at DHS facilities, not just children, and allowed for unannounced visits by members and the inclusion of congressional staff to enter with their members during oversight visits.","WASHINGTON — Attorneys on behalf of a dozen U.S. House Democrats Thursday pushed for a federal judge to force the Trump administration to comply with an appropriations law that allows for unannounced oversight visits at Department of Homeland Security facilities that detain immigrants.

“We don’t know what detention will look like in the future,” said Christine Coogle, a senior staff attorney for the group Democracy Forward, which represents the lawmakers.

Coogle argued before federal Judge Jia Cobb that because of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown, the number of immigrants detained has ballooned. Coogle said that Democrats’ ability to conduct oversight visits without preapproval is not only needed, but already signed into law.

The suit, filed in the District Court for the District of Columbia, charges that the Trump administration has overreached its authority in creating a policy to require members of Congress give DHS seven days’ notice, plus approval from an agency official, before visiting a facility where immigrants are detained.

The suit also argues that the DHS policy is unlawful due to the appropriations law.

DOJ argues against Dems

Appearing on behalf of the Trump administration, Department of Justice attorney Alexander Resar said that the entire case will be moot in three business days, citing the looming government shutdown by next week. He argued that because the appropriations law will expire, lawmakers will not have the authority to conduct oversight provided under that provision.

Coogle pushed back and said that even the House’s seven-week continuing resolution to avoid a partial government shutdown, passed last week, contained the oversight provision.

“We expect it to be included,” in the fiscal year 2026 appropriations, Coogle said.

Resar also argued that because that provision is attached to appropriations law, the administration views it as not as enforceable as a separate law passed by Congress.

He added that Congress has multiple tools to conduct oversight of DHS facilities, such as withdrawing funding from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or impeaching officials. Republicans control both chambers in Congress as well as the White House.

Cobb questioned why two administrations, that of Biden and the first Trump administration, signed the appropriations bills into law for the past five years if they had an issue with the provision.

Resar said because the provision is attached to an appropriations bill, the Trump administration argues that it doesn’t reach the level of statutory authority.

Blocked from entry

Democrats detailed in their suit that since June, DHS officials have blocked them from entering facilities that detain immigrants.

Coogle said members of Congress being able to show up unannounced is an important tool, as in the past lawmakers have detailed how DHS has quickly made changes in preparation for planned visits.

She said some of those changes include painting facilities and moving detainees.

Resar argued that “if the facilities are being changed for the better,” then planned visits seem beneficial overall.

The oversight policy that allows members of Congress to show up unannounced at DHS facilities that detain immigrants, including ICE field offices, stems from the first Trump administration's policy of separating children from their parents at the southern border in 2018.

At that time, Democrats such as Rep. Veronica Escobar of Texas, who represents the border town of El Paso, were unable to conduct interviews with separated immigrant families and often denied entry into the facilities.

That led to the inclusion of a provision in the fiscal year 2019 appropriations law that codified a member of Congress’ ability to conduct in-person oversight visits at DHS facilities where minors were detained.

The provision later was expanded to include all immigrants detained at DHS facilities, not just children, and allowed for unannounced visits by members and the inclusion of congressional staff to enter with their members during oversight visits.

Twelve Democratic House members are part of the suit including Joe Neguse of Colorado, Adriano Espaillat of New York, Jamie Raskin of Maryland, Robert Garcia of California, J.

Our citizens, like all Americans, are entitled to emergency relief from natural disasters without conditions.” In February, the DHS was directed to cease federal funding to jurisdictions that do not assist the federal government in the enforcement of federal immigration law.
In March, DHS amended the terms and conditions it places on all federal funds to require recipients to certify that they will assist in enforcing federal immigration law.
These sweeping new conditions would require states and state agencies to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts or lose out on billions of federal dollars that states use to protect public safety.
Instead, the court determined that DHS made no serious attempt to provide a fact-based reason for its action.","Albuquerque, NM – Attorney General Raúl Torrez, along with a coalition of 20 attorneys general, announced an important victory in the multistate lawsuit against the Trump administration over its attempt to illegally coerce states into sweeping immigration enforcement by threatening to withhold billions in federal funding – funding designated for emergency preparedness, preventing and addressing terrorist attacks, mass shootings, wildfires, floods, cybersecurity threats and more.

The District Court for the District of Rhode Island granted the motion for summary judgement in the lawsuit against the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In its opinion, the Court held that the agencies violated the Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act by putting conditions on all federal funds from FEMA and DHS based on states’ agreement to assist in enforcing federal immigration law.

“It is unconscionable that the Trump Administration would threaten to withhold emergency relief funds as a way to leverage states to participate in their reckless policy of indiscriminate immigration enforcement,” said Attorney General Raúl Torrez. “We are pleased the Court has recognized that conditioning these funds on our state’s participation in this brutal and economically misguided policy is unlawful. Our citizens, like all Americans, are entitled to emergency relief from natural disasters without conditions.”

In February, the DHS was directed to cease federal funding to jurisdictions that do not assist the federal government in the enforcement of federal immigration law. In March, DHS amended the terms and conditions it places on all federal funds to require recipients to certify that they will assist in enforcing federal immigration law. These sweeping new conditions would require states and state agencies to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts or lose out on billions of federal dollars that states use to protect public safety.

In the decision, the court agreed that DHS violated the Administrative Procedure Act in adding the conditions, including because:

The agency failed to consider public safety in doing so

The conditions are overly broad and ambiguous

The conditions violate the Constitution’s Spending Clause

The court rejected DHS’ argument that placing immigration-related conditions on the grant funding was appropriate simply because many of the grants are designed to prevent and respond to acts of terrorism. Instead, the court determined that DHS made no serious attempt to provide a fact-based reason for its action. In fact, the court found that the “vague and confusing language” used in the conditions made it nearly impossible for states to comply.

In filing the lawsuit, Attorney General Torrez and the coalition argued that the immigration conditions exceed DHS’s legal authority and violate the Constitution because the programs in question were established to help states prepare for, protect against, respond to and recover from catastrophic disasters, not for immigration-related purposes. The district court agreed, holding that imposing the condition on all DHS and FEMA programs, regardless of the purpose of those programs, was unlawful.

Opinion

The lawsuit, which was co-led by the attorneys general of California, Illinois, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, was also joined by the attorneys general from Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin and Vermont.",https://nmdoj.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Asset-2-150x150.png,N,,2025-09-26 05:56:19.727716

ICE had a policy at the time of considering U.S. military service when deciding whether to take immigration enforcement action.
The naturalization process for service members Immigrants with lawful permanent residency have long been able to gain U.S. citizenship through military service.
Completing that process can be difficult, especially when service members are moving between military bases or are stationed overseas.
Other Democrats are proposing ways to quickly extend green cards to the family members of service members.","After serving with the Marine Corps in Iraq, Julio Torres has the American flag and Marine insignia tattooed on his arms to show his pride in serving a country he calls home.

After post-traumatic stress syndrome, drug addiction and a criminal charge following his deployment, the 44-year-old has found new purpose as a pastor preaching a message of freedom to those facing similar issues.

But these days, his community in East Texas feels more like jail than the land of the free.

Torres, who was born in Mexico and migrated legally to the United States at age 5, is afraid to venture far from home as President Donald Trump works to carry out his mass deportation agenda. Torres has a green card residency permit and a record of service in the U.S. military, but he was detained by immigration authorities last year under the Biden administration. He fears that U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement raids under Trump could only mean more trouble.

“Do I want to leave this nation? No. I want to serve it. I want to continue to serve my community,” Torres told The Associated Press. “It breaks my heart that I fought for this nation to raise my children in this nation, and now I have to pull my children out of this nation if I get deported. Then what did I fight for?”

There are well more than 100,000 military veterans living in the U.S. who do not have citizenship, according to estimates in recent years by the Congressional Research Service. Despite military recruiters frequently describing service as a fast-track to citizenship for troops and their family members, the Republican administration’s immigration agenda is putting them at renewed risk of deportation.

Democrats in Congress have raised alarm about instances of military veterans either forced from the country or whose family members were detained by ICE. A bipartisan bill introduced Wednesday by Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif., would require the Department of Homeland Security to identify whether immigrants are U.S. military veterans and provide them with an opportunity to apply for lawful immigration status.

“It’s very important for Americans to understand the contributions of noncitizens to our national security,” Takano told the AP. “They’re often posed as threats to our personal safety, but this is a story about how they play an essential role — tremendous numbers of our current military forces are noncitizens.”

The legislation, backed Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, R-Fla., and the GOP delegate for American Samoa, Aumua Amata Coleman Radewagen, would also make it easier for military members to apply for citizenship.

“Fighting for America is one of the greatest, most noble acts a person can do, and it breaks my heart that noncitizen veterans might be deported despite their service,” Salazar said in a statement.

From veterans’ honors to deportation threats

Torres remembers the anger when he was taken to an immigration detention center in Texas last year after being stopped by Customs and Border Protection agents at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. He was trying to reenter the country after visiting relatives in Mexico. The criminal charges from 10 years ago for drug possession violated the terms of his permanent residency.

“I was angry that I served a nation that now did not want me. I was angry that I served a nation that broke me, and after they broke me, they wanted to just throw me away,” he said, then added, “I’m still angry that I don’t have the liberty to go to the store with my kids because I’m afraid of ICE stopping me and arresting me.”

Torres was unsure why he was released after five days in detention. ICE had a policy at the time of considering U.S. military service when deciding whether to take immigration enforcement action. The administration has issued new policy memos to do away with that kind of discretion.

Fear of being deported has worsened his PTSD symptoms. He has night terrors. He cries when out of earshot of his wife and children, then tries to convince them he is doing OK. He fears that if deported to Mexico, he would be under threat from cartels because he is a veteran and minister.

Other veterans who have been deported say that those kinds of threats are real. David Bariu was deported to Kenya in 2008 after he had served in the Army and Air Force Reserve. An Army recruiter had enlisted Bariu while he was in the U.S. on a student visa — an offense for which the recruiter was court-martialed.

Bariu said he struggled with depression while detained for one year before he was deported to Kenya, where he struggled to find work. Living in an area where the al-Shabab militant group was active, Bariu did not want to tell anyone he had served in the American military.

“I didn’t want to risk putting my life into danger,” he said, adding, that “the U.S. government is deporting veterans to hostile environments.”

He eventually was able to apply for U.S. citizenship under a program set up under the Biden administration for deported veterans. Bariu moved back to the U.S. and today helps run Black Deported Veterans of America.

The naturalization process for service members

Immigrants with lawful permanent residency have long been able to gain U.S. citizenship through military service. Completing that process can be difficult, especially when service members are moving between military bases or are stationed overseas.

Takano’s bill would allow them to apply for citizenship during their basic training and establish a review process for immigration removal proceedings. Other Democrats are proposing ways to quickly extend green cards to the family members of service members.

Trump, in his first term, took steps to make it tougher to gain citizenship. He added mandatory waiting times for service members to apply for citizenship and closed U.S. immigration offices overseas and at several military bases. A federal judge ruled that his administration could not enact the mandatory waiting times, but Trump’s second-term team has tried once again to appeal.

Homeland Security has also stood by its actions when veterans have been forced to leave the country, saying it is enforcing the law.

Salazar said she was supporting the new bill out of concern that the administration is not making a distinction between “those who came to commit crimes and destabilize our country, and those who came here to work and build.”

“The vast majority of these veterans are in that second category, and they have put their lives on the line to defend this country. Congress is the branch that can lead the way on making these key policy distinctions,” she added.

Republican leaders have so far shown no willingness to challenge Trump’s immigration policies. Still, Torres is hoping that the push to have Congress take up the issue can avoid the contentious politics of immigration and be cast as a veterans issue, where there is sometimes bipartisan agreement.

“This is about a veteran,” he said. He then added: “I love my nation. And yes, even though this nation at this moment in time does not consider me part of this nation, I consider this to be my nation. I consider this my homeland.”

Nicaraguan activist Yadira Córdoba, a prominent member of the Mothers of April association, will face a final asylum hearing in San Antonio next month that could determine whether she is allowed to remain in the U.S. or be sent back to Nicaragua.

Córdoba, whose 15-year-old son was killed by regime snipers during the 2018 “Mother of all Marches” in Managua, was detained on August 20 during a routine immigration check-in with U.S. authorities in San Antonio. She had been living in exile first in Costa Rica and later in Austin.

Her lawyer, immigration attorney Arno Lemus, said Córdoba initially entered the United States in 2022 with a temporary parole document. When it expired, she was left only with her asylum claim, forcing her to pursue her case from detention.

“The fact that they detained her and they're threatening to deport her to Nicaragua after she's taken the time to file claims at an international level against the Nicaraguan regime … knowing that those kinds of actions can lead to torture, persecution, jail time — it’s unprecedented,” Lemus told TPR.

Lemus added that this case illustrates how the Trump administration’s expedited removal policy has placed many asylum seekers in mandatory detention unless granted humanitarian parole.

He said Córdoba’s case is “very well documented and highly publicized,” stressing that it has been presented at the Organization of American States, the United Nations, and the European Union. Lemus said it should be rare for judges to dismiss claims with such strong evidence.

An ICE official confirmed to TPR that Cordoba was detained in San Antonio on August 20. According to the statement, she first entered the U.S. illegally on Jan. 5, 2022, near Eagle Pass, Texas, and was released on an order of recognizance pending immigration proceedings. ICE said she will remain in custody until her case is reviewed by a judge.

GEO Group submitted a response the following month, proposing “the continued use” of the GEO Group-owned facility in Tacoma.","The 10-year contract for the private company operating the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma is set to end this month, but secrecy shrouds whether it’s been extended.

Immigration advocates and legal experts have heavily criticized the lack of transparency over the expected renewal of the contract between Immigration and Customs Enforcement and GEO Group, which owns and manages the 1,575-bed, jail-like facility.

Neither GEO Group nor ICE officials have released information about a new contract for running the detention center. The current contract, inked in 2015 as a one-year contract with an option to renew each year for nine years, is set to expire Sept. 27. The contract awarded GEO Group a minimum of $700 million over 10 years.

“It not only puts a veil over peoples’ eyes, but also prevents people inside the detention center from knowing what the future of this detention center is going to be,” said Josefina Mora-Cheung, director of organizing at La Resistencia, a local activist group advocating for the end of mass deportations and the closure of detention centers.

GEO Group and ICE officials did not answer emailed questions about whether a new contract was signed or whether the existing contract has been extended. Officials did not respond to reporters’ requests to provide copies of the new contract, should it exist.

“We cannot confirm pre-decisional contract selections, but we can confirm that ICE is exploring all options to meet its current requirements,” said ICE spokesperson Chrissy Cuttita in an email Tuesday.

GEO Group spokesperson Christopher Ferreira referred questions about the contract to ICE.

“We are proud of the role our company has played for 40 years to support the law enforcement mission of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE),” he said in a statement.

Numerous health and human rights violations have been documented at the facility over the years: Severe medical neglect, unsanitary food, swamp-like water, the deployment of “chemical agents” against detainees, sexual abuse and assaults, and excessive uses of force and solitary confinement.

Though many of these health and safety issues are prohibited under the current contract, GEO Group has never been sanctioned by the federal government for breaching those terms, researchers with the University of Washington’s Center for Human Rights found in a July report.

Nevertheless, a contract is an important tool for advocates to track violations and hold the facility accountable, said Kiku Hughes, an organizer at Tsuru for Solidarity, a social justice and immigrant rights organization that has also called for the facility to be shut down.

“ICE isn’t going to care about (violations) but maybe local politicians can put more pressure on GEO,” Hughes said.

U.S. Reps. Pramila Jayapal, D-Seattle, and Emily Randall, D-Bremerton, have attempted to provide greater oversight at the detention center, with limited success. Jayapal on Friday called for a Government Accountability Office investigation into ICE’s detention center contracts with private corporations. State health officials have been repeatedly blocked from investigating the Tacoma facility, though they are poised to start inspections after a recent federal appeals court ruling.

While scrutiny over GEO Group’s management of the Tacoma detention center has intensified in recent months with the return of President Donald Trump to office, immigration advocates note many of the documented violations also occurred under the Obama and Biden administrations.

Still, the resources fueling Trump’s crackdown on immigration are unprecedented. Trump has vowed to double the number of beds for detained immigrants nationwide to at least 100,000, allocating $45 billion for immigrant detention over the next four years.

Trump’s immigration agenda could mean huge profits for private prison companies like GEO Group, the largest detention services operator for ICE. GEO Group has 21 detention facilities under contract across the country.

Between April and June, the number of beds used under existing ICE contracts across the country increased from about 15,000 to 20,000, “the highest level of ICE utilization in our company’s history,” GEO Group Chairman George Zoley said in an August earnings call.

In its most financial reports, GEO Group noted a 94% contract retention rate among its owned and leased properties over the last four and a half years.

ICE published a request for information to “identify possible detention facilities to house noncitizens” in Western states, including Washington, in August 2024. GEO Group submitted a response the following month, proposing “the continued use” of the GEO Group-owned facility in Tacoma.

“As the owner and operator of the Facility, GEO will continue to provide up to 1,575 beds to ICE under any subsequent contract,” the response stated, according to documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union.

But ICE never published a formal solicitation for the new contract, immigration advocates said.

In April, ICE published a “strategic sourcing vehicle” requesting proposals to help “bring an additional allotment of detention beds online” in response to Trump’s declaration of an emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border and related executive orders. It’s unclear whether this call for contractors covers the Tacoma facility.

As the current contract expires, the limited information thus far is a “missed opportunity” to assess GEO’s performance and address existing concerns, said Alejandra Gonza, executive director and founder of Global Rights Advocacy, a Seattle-based nonprofit that provides pro bono representation in human rights cases.

She, like other immigration advocates across the Seattle region, is not aware of any effort to do so publicly or with people who have raised concerns.

“We haven’t had a dialogue,” said Gonza, who also teaches human rights advocacy at UW.

The secrecy around the new contract may be connected to the enforcement of House Bill 1232, a state law signed earlier this year that imposes new health and safety standards at private detention facilities, including provisions to reduce the spread of infectious diseases and to ensure access to nutritious meals.

The state law supersedes a 2023 law that aimed to provide greater oversight at the facility, but which has been bogged down in litigation after GEO Group sued state officials over the law.

While the new state law does not apply to existing contracts signed before January 2023, it would be in effect for any new contract, said Tim Warden-Hertz, directing attorney at the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project.

While the state can’t stop the Trump administration from continuing its mass detention and deportation campaign, “it can enforce basic standards,” he said.

Mike Fault, a spokesperson in the Washington state Attorney General’s Office, said in an email the agency would enforce House Bill 1232.

Nancy Larson, the acting U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Texas, said a collection of notes found at Joshua Jahn's residence showed an animus toward ICE agents and that he had been planning the attack for some time. Jahn legally purchased the 8mm bolt-action rifle used in the shooting last month, officials said.

Larson said that early Wednesday morning, Jahn was seen driving his car with a long ladder. Officials believe he used the ladder to access the roof of an office building near the Dallas ICE facility, from where he started firing at about 6:30 a.m.

Larson said he fired rounds the length of the building and intended to damage property, as well as hurt or kill ICE personnel.

The three victims were detainees inside one of the vans Jahn targeted, Larson said. One of them died and the others are in critical condition. Officials did not provide any more specifics about the victims' identities.

Larson said law enforcement personnel from multiple federal agencies put themselves at risk to move other detainees who were in the vans to safety.

Many migrants embark on dangerous sea journeys in search of better lives in foreign countries. Too often, these voyages end in tragedy, with lives lost in the middle of the ocean far from any help. For migrants fleeing conflict or persecution, boarding an unseaworthy boat may seem like their only option when safer routes are unavailable. This form of migration creates grave risks of injury or death at sea, while presenting complex challenges for both states and private search-and-rescue organizations.

Tragic Events of Migrants Drowning

October 2013 marked a particularly devastating period for Mediterranean crossings. Two catastrophic shipwrecks within eight days claimed over 630 lives near the Italian island of Lampedusa. The first disaster occurred on October 3rd, when a vessel carrying migrants from Libya sank, killing 368 people. Just over a week later, another tragedy struck when a boat filled primarily with Syrian asylum seekers went down, drowning 268 individuals, including at least 60 children. These back-to-back catastrophes sent shockwaves through the international community and exposed the deadly consequences of dangerous sea crossings.

The crisis intensified in 2015, when the number of migrants dying at sea increased dramatically, with 3,771 reported dead, including over 1,200 migrants who perished while crossing the Mediterranean from North Africa in April alone.

Moreover, the recent data recorded by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) accentuates that 2,452 deaths of migrants were documented in the Mediterranean Sea in 2024, although not the largest annual total ever. IOM has, therefore, called for adequate search and rescue systems, as well as safer migration routes as an alternative to dangerous journeys.

The October 2013 disasters prompted Italy to take immediate action. Within two weeks, on October 18, 2013, the Italian government launched “Mare Nostrum,” an ambitious military and humanitarian operation designed to prevent further loss of life in the Mediterranean while targeting human traffickers and migrant smugglers. The program proved remarkably effective at saving lives, facilitating the safe arrival of approximately 150,000 people to European shores.

However, Mare Nostrum faced significant obstacles. The operation carried enormous financial costs, requiring over $11 million monthly to maintain. Critics argued that the rescue missions inadvertently encouraged more dangerous crossings by providing a safety net for smuggling operations. Italian officials grew increasingly frustrated, claiming that European partners had abandoned them to handle the crisis alone.

These pressures ultimately proved insurmountable. Mare Nostrum officially ended on October 31, 2014, after just over a year of operation. The European Union replaced it with Operation Triton, a border management initiative run by Frontex with significantly reduced funding and personnel. This transition marked a fundamental shift in European policy—from prioritizing rescue operations to emphasizing border security and surveillance. Tragically, migrant deaths in the Mediterranean increased following Mare Nostrum’s termination. This sudden shift in Italy’s humanitarian cause has severely impeded civilian efforts to rescue the people in distress at sea.

In 2021, 21 crew members from various NGOs were charged in Italy for aiding and abetting illegal immigration, in the context of their search-and-rescue missions conducted between 2016 and 2017. This includes four crew members of the Iuventa, which had reportedly rescued around 14,000 migrants in the Mediterranean Sea.

The preliminary criminal proceedings, which began in May 2022, were criticized by Mary Lawlor, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders. In particular, she stated that the ongoing proceedings are “a darkening stain on Italy and the EU’s commitment to human rights.” She further denounced that “They are being criminalised for their human rights work. Saving lives is not a crime and solidarity is not smuggling.”

Although an Italian court in Trapani had dismissed the charges in 2024, there has not been any significant change in Italian government’s response to NGO efforts in search-and-rescue mission.

In July 2025, Human Rights Watch (HRW) similarly criticized the Italian Constitutional Court’s ruling, which upheld a law that imposed sanctions on sea rescue groups, as “cast[ing] a dark shadow over sea rescue.” Despite that, HRW had acknowledged a silver lining in the Court’s judgment, wherein “an order that leads to a violation of the primary obligation to save human life and is likely to endanger it is not binding, and failure to comply with it cannot be sanctioned.” It follows that if an order illegitimately violates migrants’ fundamental right to life, rescuers are justified in disobeying such orders.

Who should bear the responsibility of safeguarding the vulnerable migrants at sea?

The past events raise an urgent question from a humanist perspective: why did the surrounding countries not rescue the migrants drowning in the sea? A simple, yet profound, question serves to show the paradox of the class divide between legal and illegal migration. France, Greece, Italy, Spain and other countries situated around the Mediterranean Sea are state parties to the 1951 Refugee Convention, except for Lebanon and Libya. These countries undeniably provide better treatment to legal migrants, who serve their economic interests. By contrast, there’s a stinging silence in matters pertaining to the imperilled seaborne migrants who embark on illegal voyages.

We live in a world where civilization is treading backwards, with the persistent existence of a class society – the class that divides legal and illegal migrants. Often, the former who yearn for protection are being abandoned by States merely because they travel through illegal routes. These States micro-focus on the word “illegal” by casting off the morality of saving lives.

In contemporary society, where there are numerous ways to breach the fundamental human rights of individuals, a stronger humanization of such rights is a necessity to reflect the inextricably intertwined morality. The humanization of contemporary international human rights would mean imposing the responsibility of rescuing sea migrants on the surrounding countries in whose territory the migrants are found.

Indeed, the EU Assembly, in a recent report, reinforced the right to life guaranteed to sea migrants as entrenched in Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), referring to the European Court of Human Rights’ (ECtHR) landmark decision in Safi and Others v. Greece. In particular, the ECtHR underscored the States’ positive obligation to effectively investigate violations of Article 2 in the context of migrant rescue operations, adopting the test propounded in the case of Amaç and Okkan v. Turkey.

The test requires “the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual and that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk.”

The obligation supplements the existing international legal frameworks, such as Article 98 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which stipulates that member States must ensure that shipmasters promptly render assistance to anyone who is in distress at sea. Other similar instruments include the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, and the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air (Palermo Protocol).

However, the Court refused to interpret Article 2 of the Convention as guaranteeing an absolute level of security to seaborne migrants where their right to life may be in jeopardy. This is particularly pertinent to migrants who bear a degree of responsibility for the accident that exposed them to an unjustified risk. The Court further took into account the unpredictability of human conduct and the choices of priorities and resources, to avoid imposing an impossible burden on national authorities.

From the decision, it can be discerned that although the law, as it stands today, preserves migrants’ right to life as long as they are within the constructive knowledge (or ought-to-know element) of the State authorities, it does not impose an absolute obligation on States. Besides, whether the State has violated the migrants’ right depends on the specific circumstances of each incident, having regard to the availability of resources of the country. In my opinion, while this approach balances the migrants’ right to life with States’ interests on a thin line, a comprehensive approach is required to address the root causes of the issue.

The best alternative solution to avert the tragic fate of seaborne migrants imperiled at sea is to establish safer routes for them. The question of illegality should be peripheral to the primary responsibility of protecting these vulnerable migrants. Moreover, there must be effective investigation into the deaths of the migrants, as well as swift procedures for handing over their bodies to the next of kin.

This aligns with the UNHCR’s 2015 report, in which the UN Refugee Agency urged European countries to adopt a comprehensive approach to illegal migration, reiterating that “fences and borders will not stop people fleeing for their lives. They will come. The question facing the international community is not whether to engage with this crisis, but how best to address it, and how humanely.” The UNHCR’s call substantiates the fact that toughening up border control will only contribute to more illegal migrants resorting to dangerous paths. Therefore, it is crucial for countries to adopt laws that mitigate such dangerous situations.

Furthermore, as reiterated by the Assembly, the States’ responsibility under Article 3 of the Convention extends to respecting the principle of non-refoulement, which was applied by the ECtHR in Hirsi Jamaa and Others v.

Three detainees in a van in the Dallas ICE facility’s sally port were shot.","When a Texas gunman fired on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas, he was targeting federal employees he believed were collecting a ""dirty paycheck"" and involved in ""human trafficking,"" officials said Thursday.

Federal officials said the gunman had been plotting his attack and knew how to locate the agents because of ICE tracking apps.

Joshua Jahn, 29, made his intention for Wednesday’s attack at an ICE field office in Dallas clear in writings and through a trail left on his devices, federal officials said.

“Jahn specifically intended to kill ICE agents. ... He searched for information about the office building and how to track ICE agents’ locations,” Joseph Rothrock, FBI special agent in charge.

“He knew, with a high likelihood, ICE detainees would be transported that morning in the exact location where he was facing from his perch on a nearby rooftop.”

No ICE agents were injured in the attack that left one detainee dead and two others injured.

“He wrote that he intended to maximize lethality against ICE personnel and to maximize property damage at the facility,"" said Nancy Larson, acting U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas.

“He hoped his actions would terrorize ICE employees and interfere with their work, which he called human trafficking,” she said Thursday. “And this ... is the very definition of terrorism.”

Marcos Charles, field office director of enforcement and removal operations, said the gunman's use of ICE tracking apps highlights the danger they present to law enforcement.

The crowdsourcing platforms encourage users to share information about sightings of ICE agents.

""Anyone who creates or distributes these apps that is designed to spot, track and locate ICE, officers are well aware of the dangers that they are exposing to law enforcement. ... It’s no different than giving a hit man the location of their intended target,"" Charles said.

Jahn allegedly went into this attack with the expectation of dying, and he was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, officials said.

“His handwritten notes indicate that he did not expect to survive this event,” Rothrock, FBI special agent in charge of the FBI’s Dallas field office, told reporters.

In the handwritten notes, Jahn allegedly wrote, “Hopefully this will give ICE agents real terror, to think, ‘is there a sniper with AP rounds on that roof?’” according to a statement by FBI Director Kash Patel.

Patel said the FBI also uncovered the following so far in its investigation:

A document downloaded by Jahn containing a list of various Department of Homeland Security locations.

Evidence of ""multiple searches of ballistics and the 'Charlie Kirk Shot Video.' ”

In late August, Jahn allegedly ""searched apps that tracked the presence of ICE agents.""

Further evidence “indicates a high degree of pre-attack planning,” Patel said.

Three detainees in a van in the Dallas ICE facility’s sally port were shot.

A bullet found near the shooter had the words “anti-ICE” written on it, according to the FBI.

Vice President JD Vance has said evidence indicates the shooter was “politically motivated” to go after law enforcement and those enforcing the border.

He called the shooter a ""violent left-wing extremist.""

However, the region's top federal prosecutor said there's no proof that Jahn belonged to any organization.

""His words were definitively anti-ICE,"" said Larson. ""That said, we did not find evidence of membership in any specific group or entity, nor did he mention any specific government agency other than ICE.""

No federal agents were injured in the gunfire.

Officials said Jahn likely acted alone, out of his hatred for Washington.

Investigators said they've found video footage showing Jahn driving a car with a ladder on top of it as early as 3 a.m., Larson said.

He eventually used that ladder to climb to his rooftop perch and open fire at about 6:30 a.m., officials said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250925-police-car-dallas-ice-vl-1210p-9ccddd.jpg",N,,2025-09-25 18:57:53.338593

Here are some frequently asked questions journalists should keep in mind when communicating the impact of immigration policies in their communities: Will fewer immigrants help or hurt the U.S. economy?

That was the take-home message from Julia Gelatt, associate director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute.

Immigrants accounted for 15.8% of the U.S. population in January 2025, the highest percentage ever recorded. But Gelatt said those numbers are shrinking due to reduced arrivals and increased deportations.

Here are some frequently asked questions journalists should keep in mind when communicating the impact of immigration policies in their communities:

Will fewer immigrants help or hurt the U.S. economy?

Data shows that immigrants work at higher rates than native-born people and accounted for all of the net growth in the prime working-age labor force over the past two decades, Gelatt said.

“If it weren’t for immigrants and their kids, our primary working-age population would have shrunk,” Gelatt said. “To put that in another way, immigrants contributed to U.S. population growth, contributed to all of the growth in the labor force over the past 20 or so years.”

However, mass arrests and deportations have an impact.

“If fewer people are coming to the United States because you sent the message that they shouldn’t come and they can’t come, if you’re taking away work authorization from people who were granted work authorization, you’re slowing down the legal immigration system.”

How has immigration enforcement changed?

With the Trump administration’s “singular focus” on mass deportations, Gelatt said there was a dramatic increase in 287(g) agreements, which deputized local law enforcement to perform immigration enforcement functions. Florida mandated all its agencies to sign on to this policy.

Analysts like Gelatt are keeping a close eye on these policies.

“I’m going to be curious to see when we finally get the data to explain what’s happening this year, whether most arrests are actually happening through local prisons and jails, or whether a lot of arrests are happening out in the community,” she said. “Some people have been allowed with discretion to stay in the U.S., but they have regular check-ins with ICE. A lot of those people are getting arrested. That would be like a community arrest. People who have some kind of criminal court hearing, they’re getting arrested in those courthouses. People are getting arrested at work sites out in the community.”

Gelatt noted that non-immigration federal agencies, such as the IRS, FBI and U.S. Park Police, have also become involved in immigration enforcement operations.

What about employer-sponsored immigration?

The legal system for employment-based immigration was built in 1952 and hasn’t been updated since 1990.

“it’s hard to bring more immigrants legally to the United States because we have this really old system. We also have a system that has really specific categories. We have various immigration slots that people can try to slot themselves into, but lots of workers don’t fit,” she said. “We only have 140,000 employment based green cards available each year, even though our economy is absorbing hundreds of thousands of immigrants each year. And our immigration system is plagued with backlogs.”

Gelatt specifically mentioned H-1B visas, which Trump recently targeted with $100,000 fees.

“Many of their employers want to keep them, and many of those workers want to stay, but they’re facing backlogs – that are actually, at this point, I think it’s maybe 200 years long,” she said. “People won’t survive to get to the front of the line.”

Regardless of political affiliation, Gelatt and other analysts mostly agree on one point.

“If we want to grow our economy, if we want to keep prices low, if we want to keep growing our labor force, that’s going to take immigrants given that we’re having fewer kids collectively.”

Ben HattonWashington DC

Notes written by the person who opened fire on an immigration facility in Texas indicate he was targeting ICE agents and did not intend to harm detainees, officials said.

One detainee was killed and two others critically injured after a suspected sniper opened fire at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) centre in Dallas on Wednesday.

The suspected gunman died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, law enforcement officials said.

Speaking at news conference on Thursday, acting US attorney for the Northern district of Texas, Nancy Larson, identified the shooter as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, of Fairview, Texas.

Notes found at the shooter's home show he intended to ""maximise lethality against ICE personnel and to maximise property damage at the facility"", she said.

""He hoped to minimise any collateral damage or injury to the detainees and any other innocent people,"" she added.

""It seems that he did not intend to kill the detainees or harm them. It is clear from these notes that he was targeting ICE agents and ICE personnel.""

The victims have not yet been identified.

But Mexico's foreign ministry has said one injured detainee is a Mexican national.

Officials had previously said that no law enforcement officers were injured or killed during the incident.

FBI director Kash Patel said in a post on social media earlier that evidence ""to this point indicates a high degree of pre-attack planning"".

Patel said one of the handwritten notes found said: ""Hopefully this will give ICE agents real terror, to think, 'is there a sniper with AP rounds on that roof?""

At the news conference on Thursday, Larson said the shooter ""very likely acted alone"".

""That morning gunshots sprayed the length of the building, the windows, and law enforcement vans that were in the sallyport area,"" she said, adding detainees were hit.

The notes were found at the shooter's residence, and included a ""gameplan of the attack"", she said.

The suspected shooter described ICE employees as ""people showing up to collect a dirty pay check"" according to Ms Larson.

She said the shooter had hoped his actions would ""terrorise ICE employees and interfere with their work"".

""What he did is the very definition of terrorism,"" she added.

No evidence was found of membership of any specific group, and the shooter did not mention any specific government agency other than ICE, she said, but the man did express his hatred of the federal government.

She also praised ICE and other federal agents she said worked under fire to remove detainees from vans and get them to safety.

FBI special agent Joe Rothrock said it was a ""targeted, ambush-style attack on law enforcement"" that followed months of planning.

The shooter ""specifically intended to kill ICE agents"" and fired at transport vehicles carrying ICE personnel, federal and detainees, he said.

""Jahn also acknowledged the potential for other casualties. He knew with a high likelihood ICE detainees would be transported that morning in the exact location where he was facing from his perch on a nearby rooftop,"" he said.

""The clearest motivations at this point are the harm he wanted to cause to ICE. We're not aware of any specific relationships he had with anybody in detention,"" Mr Rothrock said, but noted the investigation was ongoing.

Jahn's hand-written notes indicate ""he did not expect to survive this event"", the agent said.

Marcos Charles, ICE field office director of enforcement and removal operations, said ""violent rhetoric"" against ICE has to stop.

""In contrast to those who would demonise our men and women, yesterday our brave officers ran back into danger,"" he said, alongside other federal agents, ""to save the detainees while shots were still being fired.""

He said the shooter used apps designed to track ICE officers, and said those producing and distributing them are ""well aware of the dangers that they are exposing to law enforcement"".

The Trump administration has also signaled that deportations will rise in the future, as the recently passed congressional spending bill allocated billions toward immigration enforcement.","On the campaign trail, President Donald Trump repeatedly pledged to carry out the “largest deportation program in American history.”

Now — eight months into his second term — his administration is touting new data, revealing what officials describe as a record-breaking rate of removals.

On Sept. 23, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced that 400,000 non-citizens have been deported since Trump took office in January, setting the pace for 600,000 deportations by the year’s end.

An estimated 1.6 million non-citizens have also self-deported, according to officials.

“The Trump administration is on pace to shatter historic records,” the DHS said.

“The numbers don’t lie,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin added. “(Two) million illegal aliens have been removed or self-deported in just 250 days — proving that President Trump’s policies and Secretary (Kristi) Noem’s leadership are working and making American communities safe.”

How do these figures compare to those from past years and previous administrations?

ICE deportations

When focusing on data from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Trump administration is indeed on track to outpace deportations carried out in previous years.

In fiscal year 2024 — which encompassed much of former President Joe Biden’s last year in office — ICE deported about 271,000 non-citizens, according to the agency’s annual report.

This figure was higher than every other year in Biden’s term and all four years in Trump’s first term, according to Reuters.

By comparison, during Trump’s first seven months in office, ICE deported just shy of 200,000 non-citizens, a DHS official told CNN in August. This puts the administration on track for a record-breaking rate of removals.

Total repatriations

When examining total repatriations — people returned to their country of origin — a more ambiguous picture emerges.

The DHS website lays out annual repatriation data going back to 2014.

This data includes not only ICE deportations, but those conducted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which “also deports people, including from within the 100 mile border zone,” Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a Migration Policy Institute (MPI) policy analyst, told McClatchy News.

The data is categorized into removals, enforcement returns, administrative returns and Title 42 expulsions — which were carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Removals are only one type of deportation, which is not a legally defined category,” according to the MPI. “Returns constitute the other major type, typically occurring at the U.S. border or a lawful port of entry.”

These figures indicate Trump’s deportation program may not be record-breaking.

“For reference, in fiscal year 2024, the Biden admin deported 685,000 (non-citizens),” eclipsing the 600,000 projected deportations this year, Bush-Joseph wrote in an analysis of the latest DHS figures. To reach this figure, she combined removals and enforcement returns.

This figure climbs to 777,580 when factoring in administrative returns — which include “people turned away at airports or who came to a port of entry,” Bush-Joseph said.

A DHS spokesperson did not immediately respond when McClatchy News asked if the latest deportation figures include removals and returns. Bush-Joseph said the latest data may include both.

Shift in strategy

“The difference with Trump is more people being arrested in the U.S. interior than before,” Bush-Joseph wrote in her analysis.

This shift in focus coincides with a rapid decline in unauthorized crossings at the southern border, according to NBC News.

Under Trump, daily ICE arrests have skyrocketed, increasing 250% in June when compared to the previous year, Reuters reported. And, while Trump has indicated he wants to remove “the worst of the worst,” ICE data reveals an increase in non-criminals being detained.

As of Sept. 11, 58,381 migrants were in ICE detention facilities throughout the country, about half of whom have criminal convictions or pending charges, according to NBC News.

The mass detention program has been contested in numerous federal courts, with dozens of judges declaring it illegal, according to Politico. The White House has maintained that it is operating within the confines of the law.

The Trump administration has also signaled that deportations will rise in the future, as the recently passed congressional spending bill allocated billions toward immigration enforcement.

“DHS is just getting started thanks to President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill,” the agency said in its press release, “which is surging hiring efforts and turbocharging the arrests and deportations of illegal aliens.”

Mario Guevara, a 48-year-old Salvadoran national, ran MG News, a Spanish language news outlet in metropolitan Atlanta. When Guevara livestreamed a June “No Kings” protest against President Donald Trump, local police arrested him. He has been held in detention for more than three months.

ICE didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, but has previously said Guevara is in the country illegally and thus subject to removal.

An immigration board recently issued a final removal order, based on failing to pay an immigration bond 13 years ago. His lawyers deny the allegation, calling the board’s decision “erroneous” in a letter to a federal judge in Georgia and providing proof of payment and the bond's subsequent cancellation.

""(Immigration and Customs Enforcement) refuses to release me because I represent a headache for them; a rock in their shoe as I exposed the injustices that federal agents committed on the state's streets against members of our vulnerable Latino community,"" he said in a message in Spanish. ""My dedication to my work cost me my freedom.""

Court records indicate Guevara is held in the Folkston ICE Processing Center, a privately run facility in southeastern Georgia. Sept. 25 is his birthday, according to a GoFundMe posted by his news outlet.

Advocates point to broader attacks on press freedom in the country.

Human rights group Amnesty International USA called his detainment “arbitrary.” Guevara's imminent deportation sent a “chilling message” that “journalists can be silenced, detained, and even deported for their reporting work,"" said Paul O’Brien, the group’s executive director, in a statement.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement that Guevara's case had ""absolutely nothing to do with the First Amendment and any suggestion otherwise is laughable.""

""The Trump Administration will continue enforcing the law without apology,"" she said.

The nonprofit Committee to Protect Journalists called the decision a “miscarriage of justice.”

“This is a clear attempt to silence his reporting and livestreaming activity, using immigration law as a pretext to allow for the deportation of a vital voice in the Atlanta metro area,” Katherine Jacobsen, a North American program coordinator for the committee, said in a statement.

Guevara fled his native El Salvador after receiving death threats for his journalism, his lawyer previously told USA TODAY.

For more than two decades, he has lived in the United States, earning an Emmy Award and garnering hundreds of thousands of followers covering growing Latino communities in the South. After the federal Board of Immigration Appeals in 2012 ended removal proceedings against him, he’s obtained work authorization. He recently applied for a green card through his son, an American citizen who turned 21 this year, his lawyers said.

Why was he arrested?

Guevara had been documenting increasing immigration enforcement in the region.

On June 14, Guevara was arrested at an Atlanta-area “No Kings” protest in DeKalb County.

Videos of his arrest show Guevara, in a red shirt with a protective vest reading “PRESS,” live streaming as police faced off against demonstrators. Guevara stood on the sidewalk with other journalists until a police line began moving toward a thinning crowd of protesters. One officer in a parking lot moved toward Guevara. As Guevara moved away, another officer ran toward him and grabbed him, bodycam footage showed.

Guevara can be heard telling an officer in English that he was a member of the press. His livestream continued recording in his pocket as he was taken away in a police vehicle. He called for a lawyer in his stream.

Following his arrest, initial charges of unlawful assembly, obstruction of law enforcement and being a pedestrian on the roadway against Guevara were dropped.

In early July, a Georgia sheriff’s office charged him with separate traffic-related misdemeanors stemming from another incident a month before his arrest at the protest. Those charges were dropped about a week later, yet he remained in detention as ICE began deportation proceedings.

On Sept. 19, the Board of Immigration Appeals ordered Guevara’s removal because he didn't post the voluntary departure bond within five business days in 2012. Guevara's lawyers have provided a 2012 ICE receipt showing Guevara paid the $500 bond to the agency and a 2015 ICE notice that later cancelled the bond. The board's removal order imposes daily civil penalties of $998 for each day Guevara hasn’t left the country.

From Aug. 19-24, Patel added, the alleged shooter searched apps that tracked the whereabouts of ICE agents.

According to Patel, a handwritten note recovered from this search read, ""Hopefully this will give ICE agents real terror, to think, 'is there a sniper with AP rounds on that roof?' "" ""AP"" likely refers to ""armor-piercing rounds,"" a type of ammunition designed to penetrate armored cars and body shields.

Since the shooting, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ordered the agency to increase security at ICE facilities around the country, DHS posted online. The post also put blame on rhetoric from the ""far-left.""

Using terms with longstanding and settled meanings, Congress specifically authorized the President to impose fees, like tariffs, on certain imported goods.
“In a 1841 case, the Supreme Court described tariffs as a form of regulation.","America First Legal (AFL) has filed an amicus brief in the U.S. Supreme Court supporting President Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariffs on imported foreign goods. AFL filed this brief alongside co-counsel Boyden Gray PLLC and fellow amici Representative Darrell Issa, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Courts of the House Judiciary Committee and the Vice Chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Representative Brian Mast, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Coalition for a Prosperous America.

The consolidated cases before the Supreme Court, Learning Resources v. Trump and V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. Trump, challenge the President’s ability to exercise his national security and foreign affairs discretion by using tariffs to protect American interests.

AFL’s brief argues:

Congress clearly authorized the President to exercise the powers he did in this case. Using terms with longstanding and settled meanings, Congress specifically authorized the President to impose fees, like tariffs, on certain imported goods.

The statute at issue does not violate the separation of powers, such as the non-delegation doctrine or the major questions doctrine.

The Courts have no authority to second-guess the President’s determination here, where the determination relates to 1) whether a national emergency exists and 2) the emergency relates to the readiness of the armed forces in the context of foreign affairs. These are both core executive functions that are largely immune to judicial review.

“In a 1841 case, the Supreme Court described tariffs as a form of regulation. Given this precedent, the Court must read IEEPA as sufficiently cabining the President’s exercise of emergency discretion. This case is easily resolved by applying an over 175-year old precedent and the plain meaning of a statute,” said Dan Epstein, America First Legal Vice President.

The residents seek a court ruling to prevent the government from conducting such unlawful arrests against them and others in the future.
While the declared emergency period has expired, the federal government has continued its aggressive immigration arrests in the District.","WASHINGTON - Four Washington, D.C. community members and the national immigration organization CASA sued the Trump administration today on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly-situated individuals, alleging that the federal government has engaged in a pattern of illegal immigration arrests since August.

In their lawsuit, the residents challenge the administration’s policy of arresting people without a warrant and without probable cause of unlawful immigration status and flight risk, as required by immigration law. Agents can arrest someone without a warrant only when they’ve established probable cause that the person is in the United States in violation of the law and that they are a flight risk. The filing alleges that federal agents have systematically arrested people in Washington, D.C., without a warrant and without probable cause.

People who have experienced these illegal arrests will speak at a virtual press conference on Friday, September 26, 2025, at 12:30 p.m. Eastern time. Reporters can RSVP at the following link.

Each person who is a plaintiff in the lawsuit was indiscriminately arrested without a warrant, detained, and ultimately released. The national immigration advocacy organization CASA is also a plaintiff in the case. Its members have been impacted by the illegal arrests, and the organization has had to divert resources from its core social service work to engage in crisis response for people in detention.

The plaintiffs are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of the District of Columbia, American Civil Liberties Union, Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, CASA, National Immigration Project, the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, and the law firm of Covington & Burling LLP.

“On my way to a life-saving dialysis appointment, I was detained by ICE one mile from the hospital. They ignored my U.S. driver’s license and left me without critical treatment that day, putting my health in immediate danger,” said Elias, a CASA member. “I was detained for over eight hours without food or access to my necessary medicine. Since then, I have lived in fear that I could be torn from my family and deported to a place where I cannot get the medical care I need to survive. No one should be treated this way. I am standing up in this lawsuit to make sure ICE is held accountable and stops these unlawful arrests from destroying more lives.”

“Families should not have to live in fear that simply walking to school, going to work, or attending a doctor’s appointment will result in being abducted and dragged away by federal agents without cause,” said Adina Appelbaum, program director of the Immigration Impact Lab at the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights. “ICE’s wide-sweeping arrests in D.C. are not just cruel; they are blatantly unlawful. No one, including federal agents, can operate above the law, and the government must be held accountable. This lawsuit seeks to ensure that immigrant families in the District are treated with the dignity, fairness, and due process that every community member deserves.”

The lawsuit has been filed as a class action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The residents seek a court ruling to prevent the government from conducting such unlawful arrests against them and others in the future.

“The government’s policy and practice of arresting people without probable cause are illegal and have disrupted everyday life in the District,” said Aditi Shah, staff attorney with the ACLU of the District of Columbia. “The policy and practice disregard important limits Congress has established for immigration arrests and have sown terror among immigrant communities and neighborhoods in D.C. Federal agents, like the rest of us, must follow the law.”

In August, President Trump declared a “crime emergency” in D.C. that led to significant deployments of federal law enforcement agents, including ICE agents, to patrol the District and invoked a clause in the Home Rule Act that allowed the Department of Justice to direct the Metropolitan Police Department to assist with immigration law enforcement. While the declared emergency period has expired, the federal government has continued its aggressive immigration arrests in the District.

“For weeks, immigrant communities in D.C. have been living in a state of terror and disruption caused by a policy of indiscriminate targeting being carried out by immigration officials,” said Yulie Landan, staff attorney with the National Immigration Project. “D.C. residents deserve better. Through this lawsuit, our plaintiffs seek the court’s intervention to put an end to this dragnet enforcement, which is not only unlawful but also cruel and inhumane.”

“CASA members who live and work in D.C. are being targeted by immigration officials simply for existing,” said Ama Frimpong, legal director at CASA. “With this lawsuit, our members are making it clear: they have had enough of the federal government’s lawlessness and abuse of power. They will not be intimidated or silenced. They will continue to fight until the government is held accountable.”

“The federal government has created a culture of fear in D.C., including among U.S. citizens and immigrants with legal status,” said Madeleine Gates, associate counsel at the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs. “People are justifiably afraid to go to work or even to walk their kids to school. We are determined to end this unlawful policy.”

The complaint filed in this case, Escobar Molina et al. v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security et al., is available here: https://www.acludc.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Escobar-Molina_complaint_stamped.pdf

""Journalists should not have to fear government retaliation for doing their jobs, and showing up to work should not mean getting your family torn apart,"" said Scarlet Kim, senior staff attorney with the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, in a Wednesday statement.

Kim was one of several lawyers who sent a letter to Benjamin Cheesbro, a magistrate judge of the US District Court for the Southern District of Georgia, late Tuesday, after the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) issued an order of final removal, which authorizes Guevara's deportation.

Guevara's legal team asked Cheesbro for ""immediate relief"" on the grounds presented in a Monday motion for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction. The lawyers challenged the federal government's claims about his asylum case from 13 years ago, offering evidence that he ""posted the voluntary departure bond on June 26, 2012,"" and ""ICE issued a notice of cancellation of the bond on April, 21 2015.""

""First, because he posted the voluntary departure bond, he should be subject to a voluntary departure order, and his detention is therefore unlawful under the Immigration and Nationality Act,"" the letter explains. ""Second, his detention is intended to gag and punish his speech and therefore continues to violate the First Amendment.""

Guevara's team is seeking his release while his federal court case challenging his detention plays out. However, as the jailed journalist wrote in a Monday letter made public by the ACLU, he is prepared ""to be deported from this country, a country I have loved and respected for more than two decades.""

""If I am deported, I will leave with my head held high, because I am convinced it will be for doing my work as a journalist and not for committing crimes,"" he wrote. ""That said, I will leave with a broken heart and my dignity tarnished, because I have been humiliated by both federal and local authorities, and I don't believe I deserve it. And because my family, the thing I love most in life, will be separated, although all my loved ones know it has all been because of my passion for my work.""

The journalist's adult children have publicly advocated for his release this week. His son, 21-year-old Oscar Guevara, who suffered a stroke during a 2021 surgery for a brain tumor, shared that ""he drives me to my medical appointments, helps me manage my care and, most importantly, lifts me up when I feel like giving in to the pain.""

Katherine Guevara, who is 27, said that ""no one should have to face this fear of punishment for their free speech in this country. Still, we are holding on to hope that the government will do the right thing and release him at once. His place is with his family and his community, not behind bars or facing deportation.""

Press freedom advocates have also rallied behind the journalist, with some pointing to the case of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel—who returned to his show on Disney-owned ABC on Tuesday after being yanked off the air by the company last week amid pressure from Federal Communication Commission Chair Brendan Carr, who objected to the comedian's comments about President Donald Trump and the assassination of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk.

""If you were concerned about Kimmel, here's another for you,"" Zeteo's Prem Thakker wrote on social media Wednesday.

Free Press senior counsel Nora Benavidez similarly said on Bluesky Tuesday: ""Our opposition and upset over Jimmy Kimmel being taken off air have led to Kimmel coming back. Let's organize that much noise for reporters like Mario Guevara detained (despite being here legally) for filming police and ICE.""

On Monday, Free Press and the Committee to Protect Journalists led a coalition in releasing a statement that says in part, ""The government's prolonged detention of Guevara sends a chilling message to all journalists, citizens, and residents who record law enforcement, report on government activities, and seek to report the truth.""

President Donald Trump signed an executive order in January requiring the Department of Homeland Security and agencies under its command, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to stop providing federal funds to states that don’t cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.

The move was designed to force states like Illinois to abandon laws that prohibit law enforcement from participating in civil immigration enforcement. Trump’s order could have applied to hundreds of millions of dollars of federal funding Illinois receives for natural disaster responses and other emergencies. But a judge ruled it unconstitutional after Illinois and other states sued.

“I appreciate the court’s conclusion that DHS’ decision-making process was ‘wholly under-reasoned and arbitrary,’” Attorney General Kwame Raoul said in a statement. “The court’s ruling will ensure vital dollars that states rely on to prepare for and respond to emergencies are not withheld simply for political purposes.”

The 2017 TRUST Act, signed by Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, prohibits Illinois law enforcement from arresting a person based solely on their immigration status. In most cases, law enforcement cannot assist immigration officials with detaining people based solely on immigration status, according to Raoul’s office.

The judge ruled that the order violates the Constitution because Congress controls spending. The attorneys general filed the suit in the U.S. District Court of Rhode Island.

“Sweeping immigration-related conditions imposed on every DHS-administered grant, regardless of statutory purpose, lack the necessary tailoring,” U.S. District Judge William E. Smith wrote. “The Spending Clause requires that conditions be “reasonably calculated” to advance the purposes for which funds are expended … and DHS has failed to demonstrate any such connection outside of a few programs.”

Abortion funding

Raoul also filed a new motion on Wednesday alongside 21 other states and Washington, D.C., that seeks to stop a new federal law from blocking funding to Planned Parenthood and other health care facilities that provide abortion services.

The attorneys general originally filed the lawsuit at the end of July to challenge a provision in congressional Republicans’ “One Big Beautiful Bill” that prohibits abortion clinics from using Medicaid funding for reproductive health services for one year.

The attorneys general argue the timeline of the law and details about which providers are included is too vague.

“We are urging the court to halt enforcement of the Defund Provision, which is clearly intended to shutter Planned Parenthood,” Raoul said in a statement. “Planned Parenthood facilities play a key role in our nation’s health and wellness by providing preventative care to more than 1 million Americans.”

The motion comes as Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin announced Wednesday that it will pause scheduling abortions because of the bill, causing fears for Illinois abortion providers about a surge in demand.

CREW’s amicus brief argues that the Supreme Court does not need to weigh in on GEO’s proposed redefinition of sovereign immunity, but if it does so, it should reject this redefinition.
Government contractors cannot claim sovereign immunity because they are separate from the government and barred from exercising sovereign authority in the first place.
For these reasons, if the Supreme Court chooses to weigh in on whether government contractors have sovereign immunity, it should reject this claim.","The Supreme Court should reject GEO Group’s call to expand sovereign immunity to all government contractors, according to an amicus brief filed by CREW.

GEO Group has a contract with ICE to run the Aurora Immigration Processing Center in Colorado, where the federal government holds detained immigrants pending the resolution of their immigration proceedings. In 2014, detainees filed a class action against GEO under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act and Colorado state law against unjust enrichment, alleging that GEO unlawfully required detainees to do unpaid sanitation and janitorial work in the detention center and punished them with revocation of privileges and solitary confinement if they refused. The plaintiffs also alleged that GEO instituted a work program that was nominally “voluntary” but paid only $1 per day, which the detainees urgently needed because GEO was not providing sufficient access to food, toiletries, or telephones.

In district court, GEO argued that it could not be held liable because its treatment of detainees was directed by its ICE contract. The district court heard evidence on that defense and rejected it, determining that GEO would be liable for any damages it is found to have caused at trial. GEO immediately appealed to the 10th Circuit. GEO tried to justify appealing immediately (instead of waiting until after trial) by invoking the collateral order doctrine, which is a legal principle that allows immediate appeals of important rulings that are separate from the merits of the case and will so badly harm a party that the appeal cannot wait until after the case is over. To convince the 10th Circuit that its appeal had to be heard immediately, GEO contended that government contractors have “derivative sovereign immunity,” which would prevent them from being sued at all for work done pursuant to a government contract and put them on the same legal footing as the government itself.

The Supreme Court has now taken up the question of whether an order denying a government contractor’s claim of derivative sovereign immunity is immediately appealable under the collateral-order doctrine.

CREW’s amicus brief argues that the Supreme Court does not need to weigh in on GEO’s proposed redefinition of sovereign immunity, but if it does so, it should reject this redefinition. Government contractors cannot claim sovereign immunity because they are separate from the government and barred from exercising sovereign authority in the first place. As the brief states, “the Constitution instills sovereign authority in the federal government alone for the singular purpose of pursuing the public interest unencumbered by the corrosive effect of private interest.” Further undercutting GEO’s claims to sovereign immunity, the federal government and federal law have long barred government contractors from performing “inherently governmental functions” which include those that “involve the exercise of sovereign powers of the United States” or “requires discretion” that “commits the government to a course of action.” Instead, federal law keeps contractors at arm’s length through extensive rules and regulations that protect and serve the public interest, manage and prevent conflicts of interest and penalizing misconduct, all of which is overseen by the Congress and the executive branch.

The Constitution and federal law recognizes that contractors are external private parties driven by their own financial interest to provide services to the government, not extensions of the government. For these reasons, if the Supreme Court chooses to weigh in on whether government contractors have sovereign immunity, it should reject this claim.",https://www.citizensforethics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AdobeStock_259030820-1200x630.jpeg,N,,2025-09-25 14:56:46.275414

Instead of leaving the country based on his 1994 deportation and exclusion order under the name Dev Singh, Sohal used a different identity, with a new name, date of birth, and date of entry into the United States, to naturalize. He did not disclose his prior immigration history under the Dev Singh identity in any of his immigration applications or proceedings when he naturalized under the Gurdev Sohal identity. Expert analysis in February 2020 confirmed that the fingerprints submitted under both identities came from the same individual. The analysis was only made possible after DHS digitized the paper fingerprint submission documents from older immigration files.

“If you lie to the government or hide your identity so that you can naturalize, this Administration will find you and strip you of your fraudulently acquired U.S. citizenship.” said Assistant Attorney General Brett A. Shumate of the Justice Department’s Civil Division.

The complaint alleges that Sohal illegally procured his U.S. citizenship because he was never lawfully admitted for permanent residence and because the lies he told throughout his naturalization process rendered him unable to show the requisite good moral character to naturalize.

Days later, a man with an assault rifle fired dozens of rounds at federal agents leaving a Border Patrol facility in McAllen.","DALLAS (AP) — The gunman who opened fire on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas hated the U.S. government and wanted to incite terror by killing federal agents, officials said Thursday, offering the first hint of a motive in the attack.

The shooting at daybreak Wednesday targeted the ICE building, including a van in a gated entryway that held detainees. One detainee was killed, and two other were critically wounded. No ICE personnel were hurt.

The gunman, who fatally shot himself, “carried out a targeted, ambush-style attack on law enforcement,” said Joseph Rothrock, the agent in charge of the FBI Dallas field office. He ”specifically intended to kill ICE agents,” firing at ICE vehicles and sending multiple shots into “the windows of the office building where numerous ICE employees do their jobs every day.”

The assailant appeared to have acted alone. Nancy Larson, the acting U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Texas, said investigators found a collection of notes at his residence. One of them said, “Yes, it was just me.” Other notes were sharply critical of ICE agents and indicated he hoped to avoid hurting any detainees.

Investigators have not found that the gunman was a member of any particular group or entity, Larson said. And while he broadly wrote about hatred of the federal government, he did not mention any federal agencies other than ICE, she said.

The shooter also left behind a note saying that he hoped the attack would “give ICE agents real terror,” the FBI Director Kash Patel said on the social platform X.

The gunman, who authorities said fired indiscriminately from a nearby rooftop, was involved in a “high degree of pre-attack planning,” Patel said, and agents have seized electronic devices, handwritten notes and other evidence from a Dallas-area home.

“One of the handwritten notes recovered read, ‘Hopefully this will give ICE agents real terror, to think, is there a sniper with AP rounds on that roof?’” Patel wrote, quoting an apparent abbreviation for armor-piercing bullets.

The gunman had also downloaded a document titled “Dallas County Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Management” containing a list of Homeland Security facilities, Patel said.

Hours before the shooting, the assailant conducted multiple internet searches for ballistics information and video of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk on a Utah university campus this month, Patel said. Last month, the man searched for apps that tracked the presence of ICE agents, he added.

Joshua Jahn, 29, was identified as the shooter by a law enforcement official who could not publicly disclose details of the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

On Wednesday, Patel posted a photo on social media showing a bullet found at the scene with “ANTI-ICE” written on it. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ordered more security at ICE facilities across the U.S., according to a post by the DHS on X.

The attack was the latest high-profile targeted killing in the U.S. It happened two weeks after Kirk was killed by a shooter on the roof of a building at Utah Valley University and as heightened immigration enforcement has prompted a backlash against ICE agents and fear in immigrant communities.

The American Immigration Lawyers Association called the shootings “a stark reminder that behind every immigration case number is a human being deserving of dignity, safety and respect.”

“Whether they are individuals navigating the immigration process, public servants carrying out their duties, or professionals working within the system, all deserve to be free from violence and fear,” the group said in a statement.

FBI says attack was ‘act of targeted violence’

Authorities have given few details about the shooting and did not publicly release the names of the victims. The FBI said it was investigating the shooting as “an act of targeted violence.”

The gunman used a bolt-action rifle, according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The ICE facility is along Interstate 35 East, just southwest of Dallas Love Field, a large airport serving the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, and blocks from hotels.

Who was the gunman?

Hours after the shooting, FBI agents gathered at a home in suburban Fairview, outside Dallas, that public records link to Jahn.

The house sits on a tree-lined cul-de-sac in a neighborhood dotted with one- and two-story brick homes. The street was blocked by a police vehicle, and officials wearing FBI jackets could be seen in the front yard.

A spokesperson for Collin College in nearby McKinney, said via email that a Joshua Jahn studied there “at various times” between 2013 and 2018.

In late 2017, Jahn drove cross-country to work a minimum-wage job harvesting marijuana for several months, said Ryan Sanderson, owner of a legal cannabis farm in Washington state.

“He’s a young kid, a thousand miles from home, didn’t really seem to have any direction, living out of his car at such a young age,” Sanderson told the AP.

Calls for an end to political violence

Shortly after the shooting and before officials said at least one victim was a detainee, Vice President JD Vance posted on X that “the obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop.”

Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, who represents Texas, continued in that direction, calling for an end to political violence.

The Catholic Legal Immigration Network, an advocacy group, said the shootings are “a heartbreaking reminder of the violence and fear that too often touch the lives of migrants and the communities where they live.”

Noem says ICE agents have been targeted

Noem noted a recent uptick in targeting of ICE agents.

On July 4, attackers in black, military-style clothing opened fire outside the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, southwest of Dallas, federal prosecutors said. One police officer was wounded. At least 11 people have been charged in connection with the attack.

Days later, a man with an assault rifle fired dozens of rounds at federal agents leaving a Border Patrol facility in McAllen. The man, identified as Ryan Louis Mosqueda, injured a responding police officer before authorities shot and killed him.

In suburban Chicago, federal authorities erected a fence around an immigration processing center after tensions flared with protesters. President Donald Trump’s administration has stepped up immigration enforcement in the Chicago area, resulting in hundreds of arrests.

Dozens of immigration field offices across the country house administrative employees and are used for people summoned for check-in appointments and to process people arrested before they are transferred to long-term detention centers. They are not designed to hold people in custody.

Security varies by location, with some in federal buildings and others mixed with private businesses, said John Torres, a former acting director of the agency and former head of what is now called its enforcement and removals division.

I have brothers, sisters.
Many at the Sunday afternoon Mass told Angelus they felt helpless, hoping that God would intervene in the situation.
The Mass for Immigrants was a way to do that.
“It's important for us to stand together, to speak up, to have a loud voice to show them that they're not alone.","When Antonio Luna was 9 years old in the 1970s, his mother, out of desperation, sent him along with two brothers and two sisters from Mexico to the United States after his father had died.

Five years later, as a teenager coming home from junior high, he returned to an empty apartment. Suddenly, there was a knock at the door, and having already known the fear of immigration authorities, he peeked through the window to see the apartment manager.

She had sad news: His brothers and sisters had been deported.

“As soon as I closed the door, my stomach started just rumbling, and I had that fear,” said Luna, who afterwards had to live on the streets. “And the questions came to my mind: What am I going to do? Where am I going to go? Who is going to pick me up? Am I going to see my mom again? I have brothers, sisters. I belong to a family.”

Luna, now a deacon for the Diocese of Orange, shared his story at this year’s Mass in Recognition of All Immigrants, held Sept. 21 at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels. Luna’s tale echoed what many immigrants in LA and around the US are facing today: Fears of deportation, fears of going outside, fears of what may happen to their children and loved ones if they were sent back to their home countries.

Many at the Sunday afternoon Mass told Angelus they felt helpless, hoping that God would intervene in the situation. But being at the Cathedral on Sunday, they also felt united in prayer.

Boni Lara and his wife, Celia Zamora, parishioners at Ascension Church in South LA, have come to the annual Mass the last three years, but said they felt called in a special way to come this year.

“There are a lot of us who are scared, who don't want to leave our homes,” said Lara, an immigrant from Michoacán, Mexico. “We hope that something good comes out of this Mass, through the intercession of the Virgin Mary.”

“There are many children now without their fathers, and the father is the pillar of the home,” Zamora said. “I feel very sad for the situation, but God gives me happiness and strength for the immigrants through this Mass.”

Luna believes Catholics, especially young people, need to take action to help those immigrants in need.

“We can do so much,” he said. “Our communities, they trust us. They see the Lord in us. We can open our hearts and listen to their voices and listen to what they need. Because, after all, us as Catholics, we are here to lift the dignity of human beings.

“To those who are undocumented, let me tell you one thing: Do not be afraid. Don't lose faith, trust the Lord, and pray. Pray, because this will have an end.”

In his homily, Archbishop José H. Gomez called on immigrants to tell their own stories in appealing to government leaders to remedy the country’s broken immigration system.

“It’s the story that’s been told since the beginning of this country,” Archbishop Gomez said. “It’s the story of good, hard-working men and women, people of faith.

“Let’s make that true again. Let’s tell our story to our leaders especially, and urge them to do what is right. To make it easier to come to this country, to create a path forward for those who have been here for many years.”

Isaac Cuevas, the Archdiocese of Los Angeles’ director of immigration and public affairs, said that archdiocesan parishes and groups have been working tirelessly to support immigrants, including food banks, “know your rights” workshops, and helping them create legal plans in case of emergencies or deportation. Leaders from One LA-IAF spoke before the Mass about their Freedom Schools strategy, which teaches people how to confront assaults on their civil rights and liberties.

But while larger groups do their part, Cuevas said it was important to show that members of the Church are standing up for them and are helping in their own way. The Mass for Immigrants was a way to do that.

“I hope people understand and recognize how important it is to just stand in solidarity with one another, to recognize those who are vulnerable right now, people who've been impacted by the raids and the enforcement that's happening,” Cuevas said. “It’s inflicting harm, and it's inflicting emotional stress. And doing that knowingly is sinful. We hope that as a church, we can do our part to support people in a time of need.

“Every single one of us has an opportunity to take action in some small way.”

Benton DiPasquale, who attended the Mass with a group of fellow Loyola Marymount University students, said he was inspired by seeing so many different people at the Mass and was confident the Church would keep pushing for a peaceful solution.

“There are so many people in the nation right now, not just in Los Angeles, that are afraid to leave their houses,” he said. “It's important for us to stand together, to speak up, to have a loud voice to show them that they're not alone. To offer our prayers to God and to the Virgin Mary Guadalupe that peace is something that we're all striving for, and it's something that we have to work for together.

In a letter obtained first by NBC News, Democrats on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee urged Attorney General Pam Bondi on Wednesday to “immediately” release documents related to the probe that the Justice Department reportedly closed. Homan, who served as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during President Donald Trump’s first term, owned a private consulting business at the time.

“The fact that the incoming Trump Administration reportedly closed this investigation prematurely raises further concerns that the Administration is weaponizing our system of justice to protect the president’s friends and to persecute his political foes,” the letter, led by Sens. Gary Peters, D-Mich., Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., and Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., said.

In an operation last year, first reported by MSNBC, citing multiple sources familiar with the investigation and internal documents, FBI agents posing as business executives allegedly recorded Homan accepting a bag of cash after indicating he could help them with future federal contracts if he became the nation’s top immigration official during Trump’s second term. Trump appointees officially closed the investigation in recent weeks, MSNBC reported, citing two sources familiar with the matter.

In the letter, co-signed by Sens. John Fetterman, D-Pa., Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., Andy Kim, D-N.J., and Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., Democrats asked FBI Director Kash Patel to turn over documents and files, including any audio and videotapes of the transaction between Homan and the FBI agents.

The DOJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt denied reports that Homan took the money, telling reporters this week, “This was another example of the weaponization of the Biden Department of Justice against one of President Trump’s strongest and most vocal supporters in the midst of a presidential campaign.”

She accused President Joe Biden’s FBI of “going undercover to try and entrap one of the president’s top allies and supporters, someone who they knew very well would be taking a government position months later” and reiterated that “Mr. Homan did absolutely nothing wrong.”

Homan has dismissed the report that he accepted a bribe as a “hit piece.”

“Look, I did nothing criminal. I did nothing illegal,” Homan said on Fox News on Monday.

Senate Democrats also pointed to $170 billion that Congress recently appropriated for border security and immigration enforcement in their letter.

“It is critical that the American people be able to trust that the influence of White House and other government officials has not been bought, and that contracts will be awarded to companies based on merit, not to those willing to pay bribes,” the letter said.

The letter marks Senate Democrats’ latest attempt to probe the Homan investigation. On Tuesday, Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee demanded tapes and other materials from the DOJ and FBI.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250924-tom-homan-gk-f55eb5.jpg",N,,2025-09-25 15:56:59.540971

Suddenly, his camera was covered, and Mr. Guevara could be heard saying, “Officer, officer, I’m a member of the media, officer.” The recording continued for about 20 more minutes.","Lawyers for a journalist who has been in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement since June asked a federal judge on Tuesday for a temporary restraining order to block his deportation, which they said was “imminent.”

The journalist, Mario Guevara, was arrested on June 14 while he was livestreaming from a “No Kings” protest against the Trump administration’s policies that was taking place outside Atlanta. Charges filed in connection to his arrest were dropped, his lawyers said.

Press freedom groups and civil liberties activists said that the detention of Mr. Guevara, who is originally from El Salvador, was another example of the federal government’s trampling on independent journalism and coverage that the administration viewed as unflattering.

In an emergency request made on Tuesday, Mr. Guevara’s lawyers asked Judge Benjamin W. Cheesbro of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia to release Mr. Guevara, while the immigration case is decided. They also sought a court order barring federal authorities from removing him from the country until his status is settled.

“His detention is intended to gag and punish his speech and therefore continues to violate the First Amendment,” Mr. Guevara’s lawyers wrote, including those with the American Civil Liberties Union.

ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday about Mr. Guevara’s situation.

A spokeswoman for the Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review said that it did not comment on pending cases.

Mr. Guevara’s lawyers said in their letter to Judge Cheesbro that they received a notice on Tuesday from the Board of Immigration Appeals, also part of the Justice Department, finding that Mr. Guevara was subject to final removal from the United States.

But Mr. Guevara’s legal team argued that the board’s decision was based on erroneous information — that he had failed to post what is known as a voluntary departure bond of $500 when immigration enforcement actions against him began in 2012. Such bonds are often required of people who voluntarily leave the United States during immigration proceedings.

Mr. Guevara’s lawyers provided Judge Cheesbro a receipt from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, dated on June 26, 2012, for a voluntary departure bond that he obtained for $500.

In April 2015, D.H.S. canceled the bond, stating that its conditions appeared to have been “satisfied,” according to the department’s notice, which Mr. Guevara’s lawyers also submitted to the court on Tuesday. They argued that, in canceling the bond, the agency had administratively closed removal proceedings against Mr. Guevara.

Mr. Guevara was not a legal permanent resident or citizen of the United States, but he had a work permit and a Social Security number, according to one of his lawyers.

Mr. Guevara worked at the Spanish-language news organization Mundo Hispánico for several years before starting his own news organization, MGNews, a digital outlet that covers immigration and other topics for Georgia’s Latino community.

He is best known for chronicling immigration arrests in Georgia, and has built a large audience on social media, including more than 395,000 followers on TikTok and about 113,000 on Facebook as of Wednesday evening.

Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital justice and civil rights at Free Press, an advocacy group, said in an interview on Wednesday that Mr. Guevara’s case had reached a “dangerous inflection point.” She said that Mr. Guevara had a reputation in his community for exposing injustices perpetrated by ICE, and that his censorship was part of the Trump administration’s crackdown on dissent.

“As the government seems more and more willing to reject and ignore the rule of law, we are seeing that some of the most frontline individuals affected are reporters, and particularly immigrant reporters,” Ms. Benavidez said.

On June 14, Mr. Guevara was standing among a group of people when police officers started moving toward him, according to his livestream footage of the “No Kings” protest in Doraville, Ga., about 15 miles northeast of Atlanta.

Suddenly, his camera was covered, and Mr. Guevara could be heard saying, “Officer, officer, I’m a member of the media, officer.”

Phil Murphy and state legislators to pass the Immigrant Trust Act. The bill would limit how much state and local law enforcement and government agencies cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.

The resolution, voted on at the Sept. 17 Board of Commissioners’ meeting, marks the first time a county legislative body has made such a petition in the Garden State. Other New Jersey municipalities, including Bloomfield, Maplewood and South Orange, have approved similar resolutions.

Rebuilding Trust

The Immigrant Trust Act is built on the Immigrant Trust Directive issued by then-Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal in 2018.

The directive limits the voluntary assistance state and local law enforcement officers can provide to federal immigration agents. The directive, the office said, was meant to rebuild trust among immigrant residents who may have had fears about reporting crimes to law enforcement.

Passing the Immigrant Trust Act would codify the directive and include additional provisions, including blocking federal immigration enforcement action at “sensitive locations” such as churches, schools, and healthcare facilities, and stopping personal data from being shared with federal immigration agents outside of exigent circumstances.

‘Diverse County’

The resolution serves as a call to protect all of New Jersey’s residents, including the more than 2 million foreign-born residents, said Essex County Commissioner Brendan W. Gill, who introduced the legislation. Essex County is the second most diverse county in New Jersey.

“It provides safety and coverage for communities, so that our immigrant communities — I represent a very diverse county that consists of a large immigrant community — that they can feel safe to report things that they see which may be troubling to them and to the communities in which we all live, without fear of retribution,” said Gill. “So this is really an attempt to protect hardworking, taxpaying people of our county and of our state and making sure they don’t live in fear.”

New Jersey, and Essex County in particular, have felt the impact of President Donald Trump’s detention and deportation push.

The county seat Newark is home to Delaney Hall, the largest immigrant detention facility on the East Coast, and also where within days of Trump’s inauguration, ICE agents conducted a raid at a seafood distribution warehouse.

“In a lot of ways New Jersey is an epicenter of Trump’s mass deportation and detention agenda,” said Amol Sinha, executive director of ACLU New Jersey. “There are a lot of people that are being detained in New Jersey as they are awaiting being transferred to other facilities across the country, including Louisiana, Texas or others, as they’re coming from other states to be deported from one of the airports nearby.”

Just last month in the span of two days, three people were detained by ICE agents in South Orange and Maplewood.

Grassroots Push from SOMA Action

SOMA Action, a grass roots progressive advocacy group based in South Orange and Maplewood, has been vocal opposing Trump’s immigration enforcement agenda and was frustrated by the Immigrant Trust Act stalling in the Legislature, said Cynthia Galeota, co-chair of SOMA Action’s immigration committee.

The organization spoke to Gill about the resolution as a way to support Essex County immigrant residents and make it clear that the county legislature supported codifying the act.

“You have the power to publicly stand up for immigrants by passing this immigrant trust act resolution,” said Galeota.

Debate Intensifies Ahead of Governor’s Race

The resolution comes at a critical time for the future of the Immigrant Trust Directive and the Immigrant Trust Act.

During the runup to the gubernatorial primary election, the candidates each made clear their stance on the directive. Republican Jack Ciatarelli has said in no uncertain terms that he would repeal the directive on his first day in office.

Democratic candidate U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, of Montclair, has expressed reservations about codifying the directive, saying it had already withstood judicial review and that making it a law would open it to more legal challenges.

On Sunday night at Rider University, in Lawrence Township, at the first of two gubernatorial candidate debates, Ciatarelli and Sherrill were once again asked if they would continue the Immigrant Trust Directive.

Ciatarelli repeated his pledge to repeal the directive on his first day in office if elected. Sherrill declined to answer the question directly.

“What I’m gonna do is make sure we’re following the law and the constitution, so that’ll include due process rights and the constitution,” Sherrill responded when asked if she’d continue the directive.

Legal Challenges Expected

For immigrant advocacy groups like Make The Road NJ, codifying the Immigrant Trust Act is imperative to protect immigrant communities.

“The act that we have is a directive and so whoever comes to the next governor can either throw out the directive or create a new one,” said Diego Bartesaghi, spokesperson for Make The Road NJ. “And I think codifying it will ensure our communities are safe and that our resources and taxpayers do not go to ICE or any type of detentions here in the state.”

For Sinha, there is a strong legal basis for the Immigrant Trust Act that can withstand legal scrutiny. And while legal challenges are imminent, they should not stand in the way of codifying the act, he said.

“There’s no doubt in my mind that there’s going to be litigation,” he said. “As we saw with the Immigrant Trust Directive, as we see with every piece of legislation, there’s going to be litigation. You shouldn’t be governor if you’re afraid of litigation. We should stand firm on our principles. Do what’s right by the residents of New Jersey. And uphold it and defend it in court.”

For Make the Road NJ, the mission remains the same regardless of who wins.

“Regardless who comes to Trenton, we’re going to still to be fighting for the respect and dignity of our communities,” said Bartesaghi. “And that includes codifying the Immigrant Trust Act.”

The four were sent to Eswatini in mid-July as part of President Donald Trump’s push for the mass deportation of migrants and asylum seekers from the US.

Trump has controversially used so-called third countries to accept non-citizen deportees whose home countries are elsewhere.

Such “third countries” have included at least four African nations: Eswatini, South Sudan, Ghana and Rwanda. More than 30 people have been deported from the US to Africa since July.

But human rights advocates have questioned the constitutionality of such deportations, which leave deportees far from home, in countries where they may not even speak the language.

Some have expressed fears that the deportees will be denied their rights to due process in repressive or unstable countries abroad.

In the case of Eswatini, a small, landlocked country in Southern African, US-based lawyers claim that the four deported men who remain in custody have been denied access to legal counsel.

They have been held at the country’s top maximum-security prison, the Matsapha Correctional Complex, for more than two months.

No reason was given for Judge Titus Mlangeni’s absence from the court hearing on Thursday.

Zakhithi Sibandze — the national coordinator for the Swaziland Rural Women’s Assembly, one of the nonprofit organisations involved in Thursday’s legal challenge — accused the Eswatini authorities of using delaying tactics to avoid criticism over the case.

A second case brought by a lawyer seeking to provide legal counsel for the deportees has also been repeatedly delayed.

Eswatini is considered one of the world’s last absolute monarchies, and the king there rules by decree.

Earlier this week, on Tuesday, the nonprofit Human Rights Watch issued a statement denouncing the deportations to Eswatini and other countries, highlighting the financial transactions involved.

Human Rights Watch reported that the US has agreed to provide $5.1m to build Eswatini’s “border and migration management capacity” in exchange for the country accepting up to 160 deportees.

The nonprofit denounced the “harsh conditions” the four deported men face.

“These agreements make African governments partners in the Trump administration’s horrifying violations of immigrants’ human rights,” Allan Ngari, the group’s Africa advocacy director, said in a statement.

On September 19, Amnesty International, another human rights organisation, likewise slammed the conditions the deportees faced in Eswatini.

“Despite repeated attempts by counsel to secure confidential, in-person, unmonitored legal access to their clients, officials obstructed visits and on a later occasion proposed monitored/video-only contact, which does not meet international standards,” Amnesty wrote in a statement.

It called on officials in Eswatini to provide the men access to confidential legal counsel and “provide legal grounds for their detention”.

Originally, a total of five men were sent in the US’s initial deportation flight to Eswatini. But on Monday, the Eswatini government announced that one of the men had been repatriated to Jamaica a day prior.

The man was identified in the government statement as Orville Isaac Etoria.

“Mr Etoria has safely returned to Jamaica, where he was warmly welcomed by members of his family,” the Eswatini government said in its statement.

It added that the remaining four men are still being held in detention while efforts to repatriate them are ongoing.

Etoria, who arrived in the US as a child, had already completed a 25-year sentence for crimes in the US when he was deported to Eswatini and re-imprisoned there, according to the New York-based Legal Aid Society.

The US Department of Homeland Security said in July that the five individuals sent to Eswatini had been convicted of crimes “so uniquely barbaric that their own countries won’t take them back.”

Etoria had been convicted of murder, it said.

But Eswatini’s government said shortly after that some of the countries had reached out to say it was not true that they had rejected their citizens.

Despite Etoria’s recent return to Jamaica, groups like Amnesty International have continued to petition Eswatini to explain why he was held in prison without new charges for months.

“The safe arrival of Mr Etoria to Jamaica, cannot be an excuse for silence about what happened to him while he was held without charge and without full and confidential access to lawyers,” Tigere Chagutah, the group’s regional director for east and southern Africa, said in a statement on Thursday.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25262501672131-1758815881.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-09-25 12:56:57.555372

Is your Member of Congress a cosponsor of the Block the Bombs Act to stop taxpayer-funded weapons fueling genocide in Gaza?","As Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza continues with U.S. bombs and diplomatic cover, one bill in Congress is gaining support – the Block the Bombs Act (H.R. 3565).

Rep. Delia Ramirez (D-IL), who introduced the Block the Bombs Act, speaking in Washington D.C. (IMEU)

NIAC Action has been a proud supporter of the Block the Bombs Act which would halt the transfer of offensive weapons to Israel so long as Israel is violating both U.S. and international humanitarian law. As Iranian Americans who have witnessed firsthand the devastating consequences of militarism and war, we stand firmly behind this historic effort to end U.S. complicity in the ongoing atrocities in Gaza.

Introduced in May by Representatives Delia Ramirez (D-IL), (D-CA), Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), and Mark Pocan (D-WI) the bill is now supported by 52 Democrats and has been endorsed by the Congressional Progressive Caucus in the House of Representatives.

Urgently Upholding Law and Human Rights

This is urgently needed as the United States has provided more than $30 billion in taxpayer-funded weapons, including an additional $6.4 billion in recent days to Israel as it has conducted what UN experts have determined to be a genocidal campaign against Palestinians in Gaza. American-made bombs, tank rounds, and artillery shells—the very weapons targeted by the Block the Bombs Act —have been used to kill tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians, including children. This flagrant violation of international humanitarian law makes the U.S. not merely complicit, but a partner in these war crimes.

U.S. law is clear: security assistance is prohibited to foreign militaries that have committed gross violations of human rights. The Biden administration’s own conventional arms transfer policy states that no arms transfer will be authorized where weapons will be used to commit genocide, crimes against humanity, or other serious violations of international law. Israel’s actions in Gaza—including the systematic targeting of civilians, the use of starvation as a weapon of war, and the collective punishment of an entire population—clearly meet this threshold as underscored by many neutral observers, including the United Nations, Amnesty International and more.

Preventing More War with Iran

The civilian costs of war are borne most heavily by ordinary people, as demonstrated in Israel’s wars in Gaza, Lebanon and Iran. The toll of the June Israel-U.S.-Iran war was staggering, with at least 436 of the 1,100 Iranians killed being civilians —including dozens of children and women—and entire neighborhoods in Tehran reduced to rubble. This devastating loss and possibility for resumption of that war post snapback sanctions underscores the urgent need to confront U.S. complicity in fueling such conflicts. While the immediate priority is ending U.S. complicity in the Gaza genocide, the Block the Bombs Act also establishes crucial precedents for preventing future conflicts. The same legal mechanisms that would restrict weapons transfers to Israel could prevent a reckless U.S. war with Iran or American complicity in Israeli aggression against Iran. The principled application of arms transfer laws in one theatre of war in the Middle East could help prevent the kind of regional escalation that threatens both Iranian and American innocent lives.

The Iranian American community understands the pain of collective punishment and opposes war with Iran. NIAC polling conducted with YouGov in June 2025, before the war, found that 60% of Iranian Americans oppose Israel’s military actions in Gaza, with 44% strongly opposing them. We only expect community opposition to war with Iran to have risen after seeing the senseless human cost to the 12 day war. This opposition reflects our community’s deep commitment to human rights and our understanding that targeting civilian populations is both morally indefensible and strategically counterproductive.

Standing with the Broad Coalition for Peace and Accountability

The Block the Bombs Act has garnered unprecedented support from a diverse coalition of organizations committed to peace, human rights, and the rule of law. The Congressional Progressive Caucus—with nearly 100 members—has officially endorsed the legislation, marking the first time any major congressional caucus has backed legislation to end U.S. funding for Israel’s destruction of Gaza.

This coalition includes organizations representing millions of Americans: Jewish Voice for Peace, Veterans for Peace, AboutFace Veterans, IMEU, IfNotNow, the Center for Constitutional Rights, CAIR and Peace Action, the Friends Committee on National Legislation, Indivisible, among hundreds of others. These diverse voices share a common understanding that continuing to arm a military engaged in systematic human rights violations undermines both American values and global stability.

Recent polling data reinforces this coalition’s strength. A Quinnipiac poll from August 2025 found that 50% of voters think Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. 60% of voters oppose sending more military aid to Israel, the highest level of opposition since the question was first asked. This includes 75% of Democrats and 66% of independents who oppose continued military assistance. The American people are demanding accountability, and the Block the Bombs Act provides a concrete mechanism to achieve it.

The federal government’s practice has “sown terror in Latino and other communities,” the plaintiffs told the US District Court for the District of Columbia in a complaint filed Thursday.

The court should vacate and set aside the practice, the proposed class action complaint says.

The US Department of Justice didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

The suit is the latest salvo by immigration advocates against the Trump administration’s policies. A recent suit targets denial of bond hearings to immigration detainees. It also comes amid a challenge to the administration’s use of the National Guard in Washington.

Mass immigration stops and arrests of Latinos are the result of “blatant” racial profiling by ICE officers and other federal agents, the complaint says.

José Escobar Molina, one of the plaintiffs, says he has maintained temporary protected status for El Salvador for over 20 years. He says he was about to get into his work truck near his DC apartment in August when plain-clothed, unidentified federal agents arrested him without a warrant, and without asking him for personal information.

ICE detained him at a Virginia processing facility overnight, but then released him when an ICE supervisor realized he had a valid TPS.

This encounter, and others like it, are part of a policy that violates a federal law that says agents can make an immigration arrest without a warrant only if they have reason to believe an individual is violating an immigration law, and an individual is likely to escape before agents can obtain a warrant for an arrest, the complaint says.

Federal agents, the plaintiffs say, are making warrantless arrests in DC without making individualized determinations of immigration status.

In addition to ordering a halt to this policy, the plaintiffs want federal agents to expunge all records collected and maintained about them, and an award of costs and fees, among other relief.

The resolution also condemns President Trump and his administration, including Kristi Noem, Tom Homan, and Stephen Miller, for carrying out physically and psychologically harmful policies. While urging Congress to hold the administration accountable, members of Congress demand that the Department of Health and Human Services collaborate with nonprofits to expand culturally comprehensive mental health services to impacted communities.

“Trump and Secretary Noem are abusing the Department of Homeland Security to terrorize our immigrant communities. Men in masks, arrests without valid warrants, and no certainty of due process are all tactics that put everyone in harm's way, undermine the rule of law, and create fear, trauma, and chaos,” said Congresswoman Ramirez. “Their actions contribute to widespread feelings of depression and anxiety among immigrants, their families, and their community. That is why I am proud to have introduced this resolution with my colleague Congresswoman Salinas to ensure Congress makes it clear that our communities are suffering at the hands of an out-of-control Administration and their terror force.”

""Across the country, the Trump Administration has instructed Immigration and Customs Enforcement to racially profile, intimidate, and detain our Latino and immigrant communities. As a result, young children are missing school, parents are missing work, and families are living in fear due to the threat of deportation or, worse, separation from their loved ones,” said Rep. Salinas. ""These targeted orders from the Trump Administration are causing unnecessary stress, depression, and anxiety within our immigrant communities, and they must end. I am proud to support this resolution recognizing the negative mental health impacts of President Trump’s blatant immigration overreach.""

According to the American Sociological Association(link is external), family separation caused by incarceration can be more detrimental to children’s health, behavior, and academic achievement than parental death or divorce. Studies(link is external) also find that children impacted by deportation proceedings display higher rates of depression, anxiety, and academic withdrawal.

The building was once a U.S. Marine Corps reserve training center, but was purchased by the city in 2023 to transform into a shelter for asylum seekers, and now assists anyone experiencing homelessness in Chicago.

Organizers also re-emphasized peaceful protests and condemned the shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas, Texas, on Wednesday morning—a shooting the FBI called ""targeted violence"" by someone who ""fired indiscriminately"" at the ICE building from a rooftop.

The executive director for the Center of Immigrant Progress in Lake County said incidents like this are why their work is important, as recent events have created fear.

""We are part of a rapid response committee for Lake County and were seeing a lot of activity. There is more heightened activity and absolutely, there is more fear,"" said Jael Mejia, director of legal and civic engagement for the Center for Immigrant Progress.

In their lawsuit, the residents challenge the administration’s policy of arresting people without a warrant and without probable cause of unlawful immigration status and flight risk, as required by immigration law. Agents can arrest someone without a warrant only when they’ve established probable cause that the person is in the United States in violation of the law and that they are a flight risk. The filing alleges that federal agents have systematically arrested people in Washington, D.C., without a warrant and without probable cause.

People who have experienced these illegal arrests will speak at a virtual press conference on Friday, September 26, 2025, at 12:30 p.m. Eastern time. Reporters can RSVP at the following link.

Each person who is a plaintiff in the lawsuit was indiscriminately arrested without a warrant, detained, and ultimately released. The national immigration advocacy organization CASA is also a plaintiff in the case. Its members have been impacted by the illegal arrests, and the organization has had to divert resources from its core social service work to engage in crisis response for people in detention.

The plaintiffs are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of the District of Columbia, American Civil Liberties Union, Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, CASA, National Immigration Project, the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, and the law firm of Covington & Burling LLP.

“On my way to a life-saving dialysis appointment, I was detained by ICE one mile from the hospital. They ignored my U.S. driver’s license and left me without critical treatment that day, putting my health in immediate danger,” said Elias, a CASA member. “I was detained for over eight hours without food or access to my necessary medicine. Since then, I have lived in fear that I could be torn from my family and deported to a place where I cannot get the medical care I need to survive. No one should be treated this way. I am standing up in this lawsuit to make sure ICE is held accountable and stops these unlawful arrests from destroying more lives.”

“Families should not have to live in fear that simply walking to school, going to work, or attending a doctor’s appointment will result in being abducted and dragged away by federal agents without cause,” said Adina Appelbaum, program director of the Immigration Impact Lab at the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights. “ICE’s wide-sweeping arrests in D.C. are not just cruel; they are blatantly unlawful. No one, including federal agents, can operate above the law, and the government must be held accountable. This lawsuit seeks to ensure that immigrant families in the District are treated with the dignity, fairness, and due process that every community member deserves.”

The lawsuit has been filed as a class action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The residents seek a court ruling to prevent the government from conducting such unlawful arrests against them and others in the future.

“The government’s policy and practice of arresting people without probable cause are illegal and have disrupted everyday life in the District,” said Aditi Shah, staff attorney with the ACLU of the District of Columbia. “The policy and practice disregard important limits Congress has established for immigration arrests and have sown terror among immigrant communities and neighborhoods in D.C. Federal agents, like the rest of us, must follow the law.”

In August, President Trump declared a “crime emergency” in D.C. that led to significant deployments of federal law enforcement agents, including ICE agents, to patrol the District and invoked a clause in the Home Rule Act that allowed the Department of Justice to direct the Metropolitan Police Department to assist with immigration law enforcement. While the declared emergency period has expired, the federal government has continued its aggressive immigration arrests in the District.

“For weeks, immigrant communities in D.C. have been living in a state of terror and disruption caused by a policy of indiscriminate targeting being carried out by immigration officials,” said Yulie Landan, staff attorney with the National Immigration Project. “D.C. residents deserve better. Through this lawsuit, our plaintiffs seek the court’s intervention to put an end to this dragnet enforcement, which is not only unlawful but also cruel and inhumane.”

“CASA members who live and work in D.C. are being targeted by immigration officials simply for existing,” said Ama Frimpong, legal director at CASA. “With this lawsuit, our members are making it clear: they have had enough of the federal government’s lawlessness and abuse of power. They will not be intimidated or silenced. They will continue to fight until the government is held accountable.”

“The federal government has created a culture of fear in D.C., including among U.S. citizens and immigrants with legal status,” said Madeleine Gates, associate counsel at the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs. “People are justifiably afraid to go to work or even to walk their kids to school. We are determined to end this unlawful policy.”",https://www.acludc.org/app/themes/aclu-parent/img/press-release.png,N,,2025-09-25 11:59:23.097777

Today's top stories

At least one immigration detainee was killed and two others were injured following a shooting yesterday at the Dallas Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office. The suspect is also dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Federal authorities have described the shooting as an ""act of targeted violence"" and ""an attack"" against ICE. This marks at least the third occurrence of gun violence at immigration facilities in Texas this year, as the Trump administration intensifies its crackdown on immigration.

🎧 Authorities haven't determined a motive for the deadly shooting but have released images of five unspent bullet casings from the scene, one engraved with the words ""ANTI ICE,"" Toluwani Osibamowo of NPR Network station KERA tells Up First. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons identified the shooter as Joshua Jahn on CBS News. NPR discovered that Jahn most recently lived in a suburb about 30 miles north of Dallas, and he had no history of any violent crimes. Sherry Davis, a neighbor of Jahn's, described the community as small and tight-knit but didn't know much about him. ""I would have never imagined that such a thing, you know, someone that felt so disenfranchised would live so close to me,"" Davis said.

As a government shutdown looms, the White House has issued a memo instructing federal agencies to prepare mass firing plans in the event of a funding lapse. The plan would permanently cut jobs in programs that don't align with President Trump's priorities, instead of temporarily placing employees on unpaid leave. A key sticking point between Republicans and Democrats regarding the short-term funding bill revolves around health insurance premiums for the millions of Americans who rely on the Affordable Care Act.

🎧 On Nov. 1, open enrollment begins on the ACA marketplaces for those without employer-provided insurance. If Congress doesn't extend ACA ""enhanced premium tax credits,"" which keep premiums affordable, many people will experience sticker shock during open enrollment in the next week or two, says NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin. People will also see that the monthly amount they pay for health insurance will go up for next year. Simmons-Duffin says one West Virginia resident informed her that they plan to put money aside that would have gone to retirement to prepare for potential higher premiums next year. A Florida resident informed her that he is considering finding a new job with benefits if his premiums become unaffordable.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke at the United Nations General Assembly in New York yesterday, warning of a global arms race. He called on world leaders to help stop Russia's invasion of his country and for global rules on how artificial intelligence can be used in weapons. Zelenskyy stated that we are currently in ""the most destructive arms race in human history"" because of AI. His speech comes a day after Trump shifted his public opinion in support of Ukraine defeating Russia.

🎧 NPR's Joanna Kakissis reports that the Ukrainians she's talked to are grateful for Trump's acknowledgement that Russia is the aggressor in the war. Oleksandr Kraiev, the director of the North American program at the Ukrainian Prism Foreign Policy Council, tells Kakissis that while Trump seems to suggest that action needs to be taken to end the war, he has not provided any additional support from the U.S. Kraiev says the Trump administration might be distancing itself from the peace process and shifting the responsibility to the European Union. Meanwhile, the Kremlin has dismissed Trump's belief that Ukraine could win the war.

CASA, Inc. that nationwide injunctions must be limited to those necessary to protect parties before the court. While the ruling drew criticism from Trump opponents, the problem of nationwide injunctions is nothing new—and it reaches across partisan lines, frequently bearing on national security debates.

Judge shopping for nationwide injunctions has bedeviled the Obama, Biden, and both Trump administrations. Courts have enjoined, for example, Obama’s Deferred Action on Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) program as inconsistent with federal immigration law, Trump’s first travel ban (presented as a counterterrorism policy), and Biden’s attempt to end the Trump administration’s “Remain in Mexico” policy—each implicating national security, foreign affairs, and other important areas of executive discretion. Opponents of sitting presidents are able to virtually ensure that their suits end up before sympathetic judges who can impose provisional declarations of national policy that, if not overturned on appeal, compel the Supreme Court’s premature intervention on the emergency docket.

Empirical evidence strongly indicates a partisan skew to these injunctions: Between 2017 and 2025, 93.6 percent of national injunctions issued were issued by judges appointed by presidents of the opposing party. During the first 100 days of the second Trump administration, of 25 recorded national injunctions, 16 came from just three district courts—Maryland, D.C., and Massachusetts. The active benches on those three courts are overwhelmingly Democratic-appointed (90 percent, 73 percent, and 100 percent, respectively), underscoring the degree to which partisan judge shopping has become institutionalized.

The proliferation of nationwide injunctions has, in turn, conscripted the Supreme Court into resolving major policy disputes on its emergency docket, often with limited briefing and without a written opinion. This is bad for both parties, bad for sound government, and bad for the quality of the Court’s jurisprudence and, consequently, the law.

This problem operates across three distinct dimensions: judge shopping within district courts (including strategic refiling), circuit shopping, and premature nationalization of difficult legal issues. Both Republican- and Democratic-aligned litigants consistently exploit these mechanisms, demonstrating the widespread nature of this pathology, which is best conceived as a procedural quandary to be solved and not a partisan issue.

The Scope of the Problem

The first dimension is the ability of litigants to select single-judge (or simply small, politically homogeneous) divisions of district courts, knowing that in all likelihood their case will land before a sympathetic judge. In some cases, plaintiffs may exploit Federal Civil Rule 41(a)’s allowance of a single voluntary dismissal without prejudice—a practice the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has noted can enable forum shopping in district courts, especially in district courts that do not automatically reassign these cases to the original judge, a local practice that some but not all district courts have adopted.

The Amarillo mifepristone litigation is perhaps an extreme example: Anti-abortion groups filed in the Amarillo Division of the Northern District of Texas precisely because the division’s only active judge was Trump appointee Matthew Kacsmaryk, a former anti-abortion activist. The judge promptly issued a nationwide injunction suspending approval of the drug, which almost immediately conflicted with a contrary order from a Washington court requiring continued access. The result was not a coherent provisional national rule pending Supreme Court review but dueling injunctions, with federal law both halted and preserved depending on the courthouse.

The second dimension is venue shopping across districts—a practice incentivized by the national sweep of these injunctions. Unlike the intra-district manipulation described above, this practice turns on choosing the district in which to file in the first place. As noted, recent nationwide injunctions have clustered disproportionately in just a handful of courts, with Maryland, D.C., and Massachusetts generating the majority of such orders in the opening months of Trump’s second term. The experience ofearlier administrations suggests a similar partisan logic: Challenges to Obama’s policies were concentrated in Texas, while opponents of the first Trump administration gravitated toward California. The common thread is that litigants file where the mix of judges is most favorable to their claims. So long as litigants can select districts where the bench is ideologically aligned, random assignment within a district will not blunt venue-shopping incentives.

The third dimension is premature nationalization of contested questions, or what might be termed a Mendoza problem. In United States v. Mendoza, the Supreme Court rejected the use of nonmutual collateral estoppel against the federal government because it would “substantially thwart the development of important questions of law by freezing the first final decision rendered on a particular legal issue.” Nationwide injunctions do just that by truncating, if not effectively foreclosing, the ordinary percolation of issues across circuits. One district court’s ruling effectively becomes a national directive, dragging the Court onto its emergency docket and distorting the doctrinal development that inter-circuit dialogue is meant to foster. As Justice Elena Kagan has warned, “It just can’t be right that one district judge can stop a nationwide policy in its tracks and leave it stopped for the years that it takes to go through the normal process.”

Evaluating Responses

The principal consideration in support of nationwide injunctions is eminently understandable: If an executive order applies across the country, then the harm it causes is necessarily national, and relief must be equally broad. But immediate national decisions are not how the U.S. judicial system generally works. Yale professor Jed Rubenfeld has noted nationwide injunctions should be reserved for the narrow class of cases where government action is clearly and unambiguously foreclosed by controlling Supreme Court precedent. The devil is in the application, for what may be popularly considered “clearly established” nonetheless often remains legitimately litigable to the government.

Other proposed reforms also fail to address all three of these dimensions and so fail to provide a durable solution. The Judicial Conference has attempted to curb the most blatant forms of judge shopping by adopting a policy of districtwide random assignment for cases that seek to mandate or modify federal or state government actions. That reform targets one critical corner of the problem: It prevents litigants from guaranteeing assignment to a single judge within a division or district. It does not, however, prevent venue shopping across districts or premature nationalization of contested questions.

Members of Congress have introduced a raft of proposals. The No Rogue Rulings Act, introduced by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), would sharply curtail the authority of district courts to issue injunctions extending beyond the parties, except when two or more states in different circuits sue together, in which case a randomly selected three-judge panel could issue broader relief. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)’s Nationwide Injunction Abuse Prevention Act goes further, seeking to bar nationwide decrees altogether. Meanwhile, the End Judge Shopping Act, introduced by Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), focuses narrowly on preventing nationwide relief from single-judge divisions by mandating random assignment only in such cases.

Each of these bills addresses part of the problem, but none addresses all three dimensions we identify. They amount to partial fixes, and they risk simply redirecting litigants toward whatever loopholes remain. Entirely precluding national relief goes too far: While individual district court judges should not be able to effectively dictate or undo national policy, there does need to be a measured outlet for appropriate, relatively prompt judicial review of executive action having a nationwide sweep—especially as congressional inaction has fueled growth in both the number and the scope of executive orders and judicial corrective measures.

In Trump v. CASA, Inc., the Supreme Court took a more direct step. It curtailed nationwide injunctions at the behest of nonparties—recognizing that individuals who are not bound by a judgment should not automatically benefit from a district court’s universal order. But the Court left open two significant exceptions: nationwide class actions and suits brought by state attorneys general. These carve-outs preserve many of the incentives for forum shopping, amounting to old wine in new bottles. Judges inclined toward broad relief have already shown a willingness to certify classes at very early stages of litigation, sometimes even including future claimants. While it is unclear precisely how CASA will impact this landscape, there are hints of a more laissez-faire approach to Civil Rule 23(b)(2) certification since the decision was handed down.

State attorneys general litigation poses its own risks: A nationwide injunction can effectively be achieved whenever a coalition of attorneys general sues in a favorable forum. The Supreme Court’s original jurisdiction over interstate disputes could serve to avoid lower-court litigation and forum shopping and provide a centralized forum for resolution of such cases, though not without raising serious risks of overloading the Supreme Court’s docket (a key justification for the creation of the federal courts of appeals in the first place) and questions surrounding the suitability of the Court for fact-finding without reliance on special masters and attendant lengthy proceedings.

A Three-Step Proposal

Piecemeal reforms will not solve the problem. What is needed is a structural change that restores the benefits of percolation while still allowing meaningful checks on executive overreach. The principle is not novel. Congress embraced it with the Evarts Act, creating the courts of appeals in part so that difficult questions could be tested regionally before reaching the Supreme Court. As we note above, the Supreme Court echoed this same concern in Mendoza. In short, easy access to national injunctions (from the ruling of one district court) ultimately makes for worse law.

Our three-step proposal builds on that principle. First, district-wide random assignments should be bolstered by curbing rules that permit a party one voluntary dismissal without prejudice.

Second, broader relief should also no longer hinge on a single trial court. Any injunction against federal or state government action should be subject to immediate review by the court of appeals, and its reach should be confined geographically to that circuit. District judges could still grant party-specific relief, but circuit-limited injunctions would ensure that unsettled questions receive fuller treatment before they are nationalized.

Third, to prevent endless relitigation, once two circuits have reached the same result the government should be required to seek certiorari rather than continuing to test the issue elsewhere. At that point, the value of further percolation has been given its due, and what remains is likely strategic delay. Once the Supreme Court has granted review, it can decide whether to stay further litigation by the government outside of those circuits. Relief against unlawful executive action would remain available but be geographically confined until multiple appellate courts concur. A similar concern animated Estreicher and Revesz’s defense of agency nonacquiescence: Forcing the federal government to conform nationally to the first adverse ruling sacrifices the benefits of intercircuit dialogue and sound doctrinal development. Congress has confronted this problem before: 42 U.S.C. § 2284 requires three-judge district courts in certain cases, with direct appeal to the Supreme Court. For decades, that provision went much further than it does today: Until 1976, three-judge courts were mandatory in any suit seeking to enjoin the enforcement of state or federal statutes on constitutional grounds—with the straightforward premise that when a federal court is asked to enjoin executive action or the enforcement of a duly enacted law, the matter is too important to be left to a single, hand-picked district judge. Congress later narrowed § 2284 to conserve judicial resources, confining it mainly to redistricting and reapportionment cases. But its earlier breadth shows that the instinct behind our proposal is hardly novel.

Circuit-limited injunctions, implemented through rulemaking or statutory change, would reduce incentives for venue shopping, ease the burden on the Court’s emergency docket, and restore the judiciary’s legitimacy by ensuring that national policy reflects more than the will of one carefully chosen judge, with Supreme Court review to follow once there has been a decent opportunity for intercircuit dialogue and doctrinal development.",https://www.lawfaremedia.org/assets/icons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-09-25 10:57:57.895733

That would be a much more aggressive step than in previous shutdowns, when federal workers not deemed essential were furloughed but returned to their jobs once the US Congress approved a new financial plan.
“We will not be intimidated by your threat to engage in mass firings,” Jeffries wrote in a post on X shortly after the OMB memo was released.
Meanwhile, hundreds of federal employees who were fired in Musk’s cost-cutting blitz are being asked to return to work.
“Ultimately, the outcome was the agency was left broken and understaffed,” said Chad Becker, a former GSA real estate official.","The White House is telling federal agencies to prepare large-scale firings of workers if the government shuts down next week in a partisan fight over spending plans – prompting the Democrats to accuse Donald Trump of intimidation tactics.

In a memo released on Wednesday night, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) said agencies should consider a reduction in force for federal programs whose funding would lapse next week, is not otherwise funded and is “not consistent with the president’s priorities”.

That would be a much more aggressive step than in previous shutdowns, when federal workers not deemed essential were furloughed but returned to their jobs once the US Congress approved a new financial plan.

A mass firing would eliminate employees positions, which would trigger yet another massive upheaval in a federal workforce that has already faced major rounds of cuts this year, leading with the dramatic intervention by Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) early in the second Trump administration.

Once any potential government shutdown ends, agencies are asked to revise their reduction in force plans “as needed to retain the minimal number of employees necessary to carry out statutory functions”, according to the memo, which was first reported by Politico.

This move from OMB significantly increases the consequences of a potential government shutdown next week and escalates pressure on the US Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, and the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, both New York Democrats.

The two leaders have kept nearly all of their Democratic lawmakers united against a clean funding bill pushed by the US president and congressional Republicans that would keep the federal government operating for seven more weeks, demanding immediate improvements to health care in exchange for their votes to approve the short term plan, known as a continuing resolution (CR).

“We will not be intimidated by your threat to engage in mass firings,” Jeffries wrote in a post on X shortly after the OMB memo was released. “Get lost.”

Jeffries called Russ Vought, the head of OMB, a “malignant political hack”.

Schumer said in a statement that the OMB memo is an “attempt at intimidation” and predicted the “unnecessary firings will either be overturned in court or the administration will end up hiring the workers back.”

“It has never been more important for the administration to be prepared for a shutdown if the Democrats choose to pursue one,” the memo reads, which also notes that the GOP’s signature law, a major tax and anti-immigration spending package, gives “ample resources to ensure that many core Trump Administration priorities will continue uninterrupted.” OMB noted that it had asked all agencies to submit their plans in case of a government shutdown by 1 August.

Meanwhile, hundreds of federal employees who were fired in Musk’s cost-cutting blitz are being asked to return to work.

The General Services Administration ( GSA) has given the employees – who managed government workspaces – until the end of the week to decide, according to an internal memo obtained by the Associated Press. Those who accept must report to work on 6 October after what amounts to a seven-month paid vacation.

A Department of Homeland Security directive issued in 2021 instructed ICE not to target disaster-relief areas like Lahaina.
Joseph Campos, deputy director of the Department of Human Services, which is leading the state’s efforts at Ka La‘i Ola, said Wednesday that he was aware of the ICE visit.
“As a temporary housing site for wildfire survivors and a place of peaceful recovery, Ka La‘i Ola and all disaster recovery sites must remain safe spaces where survivors can seek shelter and support without fear or intimidation,” Bissen said in the statement.
She and other advocates helped immigrant wildfire survivors get approved to move into Ka La‘i Ola.","The federal immigration enforcement agency was in West Maui reportedly searching for a non-resident.

Members of Maui’s large immigrant population were on edge this week after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were seen knocking on doors in Lahaina, including at the largest temporary housing development for survivors of the deadly 2023 wildfires.

ICE officers approached residents on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, according to nonprofit leaders, government officials and others in the community.

Kevin Block, a longtime immigration lawyer based in Wailuku, said several of his clients who had been impacted by the fire were now afraid to leave their houses. Others were debating whether to send their children to school because for fear ICE agents might pull them from class to ask about family members’ immigration status.

A Department of Homeland Security directive issued in 2021 instructed ICE not to target disaster-relief areas like Lahaina. It grouped them with areas including churches, courthouses and hospitals that should be protected from some enforcement actions.

That directive was repealed shortly after President Donald Trump took office in January, and ICE officials were instead instructed to make “case-by-case determinations regarding whether, where and when to conduct an immigration enforcement action in or near a protected area.”

ICE officers were seen knocking on doors this week in the neighborhood near Princess Nāhiʻenaʻena Elementary School and at the state’s interim housing community for fire survivors, Ka La‘i Ola, in addition to other locations in west and central Maui, Block and Lahaina residents said.

Joseph Campos, deputy director of the Department of Human Services, which is leading the state’s efforts at Ka La‘i Ola, said Wednesday that he was aware of the ICE visit.

“They came to look for a non-resident who may have been visiting a resident,” he said. “They presented a judicial warrant.”

Ka La‘i Ola maintains a policy of not releasing information about its residents to anyone unless there is a signed and verified judicial warrant or higher documentation presented, he said.

ICE notified the Maui Police Department that they were present on the island, according to a statement Tuesday from Gregg Okamoto, assistant chief of the department’s support services division.

“But we are not given details and are not involved with their operations,” he said.

The Department of Homeland Security, including ICE, does not “comment on pending or ongoing enforcement operations,” according to a statement issued by the agency. For operational security reasons, it also “does not disclose the locations or activities of its personnel.”

Consisting of 450 modular homes spaced out across 57 acres of state-owned land overlooking downtown Lahaina, Ka La‘i Ola was built for residents displaced by the Lahaina fire who don’t meet income or background qualifications for Federal Emergency Management Agency housing. It is home to nearly 900 people and has the capacity to house up to 600 more, according to its website.

Gov. Josh Green and Maui Mayor Richard Bissen joined community leaders and families Wednesday morning to mark the project’s completion. The site is expected to be handed over to the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands by 2029 for Native Hawaiian beneficiaries.

Community advocates informed county officials earlier this week that locals were concerned about ICE activity at Ka La‘i Ola, according to a statement provided Wednesday evening by Maui County spokeswoman Laksmi Abraham.

“As a temporary housing site for wildfire survivors and a place of peaceful recovery, Ka La‘i Ola and all disaster recovery sites must remain safe spaces where survivors can seek shelter and support without fear or intimidation,” Bissen said in the statement. “Our community has faced extraordinary challenges, and these recovery sites are meant to serve as havens of stability and healing for all who need them.”

More than 2,200 structures were destroyed by the Lahaina wildfire, and approximately 12,000 people were displaced. As of Wednesday, roughly 60 homes had been rebuilt, according to the county’s recovery website.

‘Still Terrified’

Some residents are only recently returning to live in Lahaina after bouncing among emergency shelters and other accommodations during the past two years.

“They literally just moved in and are starting to feel safe and not traumatized anymore,” Block said. “And now ICE is driving around in the neighborhood and knocking on people’s doors. Even if they’re not looking for my clients, they’re still terrified.”

Some immigrants in the community have been missing work or avoiding returning to their homes because they were worried that ICE might be able to track them down, said Veronica Mendoza, the co-founder and executive director of the local immigrant advocacy group Roots Reborn.

She and other advocates helped immigrant wildfire survivors get approved to move into Ka La‘i Ola. She expressed gratitude for the housing, but said members of the immigrant community do not feel safe there right now.

Block, the immigration attorney, said the Department of Homeland Security’s shift in stance to allow enforcement actions near disaster-relief areas damages the community’s well-being.

“Because if people who need help aren’t going to the hospital, and if people who need to go to school aren’t going to school, people who want to participate in their spiritual life aren’t going to church because those places are no longer safe,” he said, “then all of us are losing our freedom and our rights.”

At least one Lahaina wildfire was previously taken into custody by ICE, according to a Honolulu Star-Advertiser story, and a GoFundMe fundraiser was set up to support his family.

Huerta, co-founder of the United Farm Workers, emphasized the urgent need for international oversight amid growing concerns over the treatment of immigrants and their families.

Background of Immigration Sweeps

Recent immigration enforcement operations have targeted multiple communities across the country, prompting the detention and deportation of several individuals. Advocates argue that these sweeps often disproportionately affect marginalized communities, raising questions about due process, family separation, and access to legal resources. Huerta’s request to the UN highlights these ongoing debates and seeks a global perspective on domestic enforcement practices.

Huerta’s Statement

In a public statement, Huerta condemned the actions of immigration authorities, calling the operations “unjust and harmful to vulnerable communities.” She urged international authorities to review the policies and practices employed during these sweeps, emphasizing that accountability and transparency are essential to uphold human rights standards.

Key Points Table

Response from Authorities

U.S. immigration officials have not formally responded to Huerta’s request but have previously defended enforcement operations as legal and necessary for public safety. The contrasting views highlight the tension between human rights advocates and law enforcement authorities, and the debate may gain international attention if the UN decides to investigate.

Public and Community Reactions

The call for a UN investigation has sparked discussions among advocacy groups, legal experts, and community members. Many support Huerta’s stance, arguing that independent oversight is crucial to ensure immigrant protections. Others believe domestic legal and policy mechanisms are sufficient to address concerns. Social media reactions reflect both strong support for immigrant rights and debates about the appropriate role of international organizations in U.S. affairs.

One of the people said the gunman was 29. The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that the gunman had opened fire from a nearby rooftop, describing him as a “sniper” who shot “indiscriminately,” hitting three detainees who were inside a transport van.

The identities of the victims have not been released, but one of the injured is a Mexican national, according to Mexico’s foreign ministry. Homeland Security officials previously said in the statement that two detainees had been killed and one wounded, but corrected the tolls in a later statement.

Officials suggested that it was a targeted attack. Kash Patel, the F.B.I. director, posted an image of the ammunition on social media, saying that an initial review of the evidence indicated an ideological motive.

The New York Times has not independently verified Mr. Patel’s description of the gunman or his motives.

The shooting comes two weeks after the assassination of Charlie Kirk, a political activist whose death prompted President Trump to threaten to silence what he described as left-wing extremists.

Mr. Trump struck a similar tone after Wednesday’s shooting, vowing on social media to crack down on “Deranged Radical Leftists.” He wrote that he would sign an executive order to “dismantle these Domestic Terrorism Networks” and called on Democrats to “STOP THIS RHETORIC AGAINST ICE.”

Here’s what else to know:

The suspect: Mr. Jahn left a long record of himself online but apparently little indication that he was politically active. On social media, he talked extensively about video games, cars and marijuana. Records show that he voted in a Democratic primary in March 2020 in Texas and was also registered to vote as an independent in Oklahoma, where he voted in 2024. Read more ›

Witness accounts: Two people who were waiting outside the facility for relatives who were going through immigration proceedings described the frantic moments of the shooting, hearing gunfire and taking cover until officers escorted them inside. “It was one shot after another after another after another,” one witness said.

Previous violence: The shooting was the second at a federal immigration facility in Texas in recent months. A police officer was shot in July outside an ICE detention facility in Alvarado, Texas. Read more ›

On the other side of a tense national immigration debate, some Democratic members of Congress in Texas and leaders with several of the top national immigrant and civil rights organizations did not disagree: the harmful rhetoric needs to stop — against law enforcement officers, and against immigrants.

The F.B.I. said the gunman in Dallas died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound and left behind ammunition that bore the phrase “ANTI-ICE” in blue writing. But The New York Times has not independently verified federal officials’ assertion that the shooter was targeting ICE.

In some social media feeds and activist circles, agents have been called “Nazis” and “fascists” while elsewhere, prominent critics have used pointed, if less inflammatory language. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California this week said that masked agents grabbing immigrants off the streets were “authoritarian actions by an authoritarian government.”

Opponents of the administration’s crackdown have said that the belligerent, incendiary tone had been set at the top by President Trump, who has referred to undocumented immigrants as “monsters” and pledged to wage war on American cities that did not bend to his administration’s hard-line immigration agenda.

“My concern is that this anti-immigrant rhetoric has led us to this point,” said Rochelle Garza, president of the Texas Civil Rights Project, an advocacy organization.

Along with the man killed, two other immigrant detainees were wounded in the shooting. No law enforcement officers were hit by the gunfire.

Battles over immigrant rights have been escalating on the streets and in the courts for months. Trump administration officials have sought to characterize many actions of immigrant rights lawyers and activists — including protests and know-your-rights presentations — as enabling illegal immigration and threatening to national security.

Law enforcement officers and federal immigration agents have faced off with activists and concerned residents who have sought to film their actions. In some of the most heated outbursts, some have yelled or cursed at agents and sought to physically block them from apprehending immigrants.

On Wednesday, Democrats and immigrant rights leaders who have heavily criticized ICE in recent months condemned the violence and urged people to lower the temperature of the immigration debate.

Representative Joaquin Castro, a Democrat from San Antonio, called for Americans to “reject extremism in our politics.”

Others also took sharp, if measured, jabs at the administration. Representative Jasmine Crockett, a Democrat of Dallas, also denounced the shooting but observed that “rhetoric used to dehumanize and demonize immigrants in this country has led to increased hate crime incidents.”

Juan Proaño, chief executive of the League of United Latin American Citizens, a civil rights group, said in an interview that the shooting — and the administration’s response — would make it more difficult to hold ICE accountable. But he added it would not deter his group from continuing to challenge its immigration actions in court.

“Our community is literally under attack — and ICE cannot escape its responsibility to keep people in detention safe,” he said. “We will not be silenced, and we will not stop demanding accountability.”

J. David Goodman contributed reporting.

Federal authorities said that the shooter had opened fire from the roof of a nearby building, firing “indiscriminately,” and hitting several victims. The gunman, identified as Joshua Jahn, 29, died of self-inflicted gunshot wounds, officials said.

Vice President JD Vance labeled the shooter as a “violent left-wing extremist” at a speaking event in North Carolina. He said that information not yet made public proved “this person was politically motivated,” without elaborating on what evidence the government had.

The Times, in interviews with authorities and others about the shooting, has not independently verified Mr. Vance’s description of the shooter or a motive; Mr. Jahn, who had an extensive online profile, had voted in a Democratic primary in 2020 in Texas, but showed little obvious interest in politics.

Mr. Vance also engaged in a high-profile clash about the Dallas shooting with Jon Favreau, a prominent progressive podcast host, as well as Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, who Mr. Vance suggested had helped foster a dangerous environment with anti-ICE rhetoric. President Trump also suggested liberals were to blame for the violence.

The reaction to the shooting is indicative of a now-common playbook in an age of violent attacks, often punctuated by hasty conclusions and righteous anger.

The online skirmish between Mr. Vance and Mr. Favreau began in the hours after the shooting in Dallas, as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced shortly after the attack that “our ICE law enforcement is facing unprecedented violence against them,” adding that a motive for the shooting had not been established.

Mr. Vance reposted Ms. Noem’s message, and included his own comment, saying that “the obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop.”

That post from Mr. Vance drew the ire of Mr. Favreau, a former speechwriter for President Barack Obama and a host of “Pod Save America,” the popular politics podcast.

Mr. Favreau said that “the vice president is not a reliable source of information,” and said that Mr. Vance had previously erred several times by voicing “a political take” only to be contradicted by law enforcement.

In the case of the assassination of Mr. Kirk, messages written on bullets found at the scene of the crime led to a great deal of conjecture after the fact, with numerous assumptions being made about what could be derived about the shooter’s motivation.

On Wednesday, Mr. Vance and others leaned on a post by F.B.I. Director Kash Patel that showed a clip of rifle-caliber ammunition, with one casing having a message on it that read “ANTI-ICE” in what appeared to be blue writing. The actual motivation behind the messages written on the bullets in both Mr. Kirk’s assassination and Wednesday’s killing are still not known, and The Times has not confirmed details shedding light on the ammunition casing in Dallas.

Still, the fight between Mr. Favreau and the vice president — which devolved into Mr. Vance calling the podcaster a profanity — was just one front in a quickly evolving battle between the right and left.

By late Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump had also begun to attack Democrats, posting on Truth Social that he was “CALLING ON ALL DEMOCRATS TO STOP THIS RHETORIC AGAINST ICE AND AMERICA’S LAW ENFORCEMENT, RIGHT NOW!” and decrying “the Left Wing Domestic Terrorism that is terrorizing our Country.”

“The continuing violence from Radical Left Terrorists, in the aftermath of Charlie Kirk’s assassination, must be stopped,” Mr. Trump wrote.

In a statement later released by Homeland Security, Ms. Noem said that the “far-left” needed to moderate its rhetoric. “Comparing ICE Day-in and day-out to the Nazi Gestapo, the Secret Police, and slave patrols has consequences,” she said.

Mr. Vance was even more outspoken, attacking Mr. Newsom in his North Carolina speech, accusing the Democrat of demonizing ICE as “part of an authoritarian government” during an interview on Tuesday night on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.”

“If your political rhetoric encourages violence against our law enforcement, you can go straight to hell and you have no place in the political conversation of the United States of America,” Mr. Vance said.

Mr. Newsom — who, like Mr. Vance, is considered a possible presidential candidate in 2028 — had said in his interview with Mr. Colbert that “the ICE issue is alarming beyond words,” and expressed concern at federal agents’ tactics, including using masks and unmarked cars.

“These are not just authoritarian tendencies, these are authoritarian actions by an authoritarian government,” Mr. Newsom said, adding, “This can’t be normalized.”

Mr. Newsom also responded on X to Mr. Vance’s remarks on Wednesday, posting: “No thanks, JD. I will not be going ‘straight to hell’ today.”

“Though when I watch you speak I certainly feel like I’m already there,” the governor wrote.

In recent months, demonstrations outside ICE facilities in Los Angeles, Illinois and New York led to confrontations with law enforcement officers and arrests. This month, an ICE officer fatally shot a man in the Chicago area whom immigration agents had tried to pull over. The Department of Homeland Security said that the man was resisting arrest during the stop and that he dragged the officer as he fled in his vehicle.

Department officials have blamed such episodes on “hateful rhetoric,” calling in a statement last week for the “media, leftist groups and sanctuary politicians” to end the “demonization” of immigration enforcement officers.

“We have to turn down the temperature before someone else is killed,” Tricia McLaughlin, the department’s assistant secretary for public affairs, said in the statement. “This violence must end.”

On Wednesday, a detainee was fatally shot when a gunman opened fire on an ICE facility in Dallas, injuring two others, investigators said. The authorities suggested that the gunman — who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound — was targeting immigration enforcement agents.

The shooting was the culmination of months of rising tensions over the Trump administration’s immigration policies, as federal officers use increasingly aggressive enforcement tactics to bring in detainees and reach arrest targets.

Anger in some cities has mounted as immigration authorities have conducted large-scale operations across the country, with Stephen Miller, a White House deputy chief of staff, saying this year the administration would strive to hit 3,000 arrests a day. ICE officers have arrested immigrants at immigration court hearings. Federal agents have swept through parking lots of big-box stores in the Los Angeles region. Videos of homeland security agents and officers breaking windows of cars belonging to targets have proliferated on social media.

Protesters, including faith leaders, community groups and liberal organizations, have held vigils, sit-ins and peaceful rallies at detention centers — though some demonstrations have turned volatile. Federal officials also report a sharp rise in threats against officers.

ICE has alleged a “more than 1,000 percent increase” in assaults against its officers this year, though the agency has not released detailed data of the episodes and it has not specified what it defines as assault. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately provide more specific information on Wednesday.

But the agency has repeatedly highlighted examples of threats it says its officers have received, such as a menacing letter with a white substance sent to a New York field office in August and pictures of injuries it says its officers have sustained while conducting arrests.

It has also sought to impose stiffer penalties. In a social media post, the agency warned last week that anyone who assaults an ICE officer would face federal felony assault charges and “prosecution to the fullest extent of the law.”

“We’re being compared to the Gestapo, to the Nazis, and that’s just not true and it’s dangerous rhetoric that puts us in situations like this,” ICE’s deputy director, Madison Sheahan, said in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday.

As the federal government’s deportation campaign has accelerated and federal agents have homed in on liberal cities with policies aimed at protecting undocumented residents, protests have at times turned tense, leading to clashes with law enforcement officers.

In June, a federal building in downtown Los Angeles used by ICE to process immigrants became a central part of the protests that roiled the city, leading to instances of vandalism and the arrests of hundreds of protesters.

Last week, more than a dozen local Democratic officials were arrested at a federal building in Manhattan used by ICE after they blocked the garage doors and tried to get into the holding cells. The officials cast their actions as urgent displays of civil disobedience. ICE denounced them as obstructionist and dangerous, not just for the safety of its agents, but also for detained migrants. The agency also said the building had to go into lockdown after someone called in a bomb threat after the arrests.

Brad Lander, the New York City comptroller who was among those arrested, said on social media at the time that officials were demanding access to the ICE field office because “NYers refuse to stand by while ICE abducts our neighbors.”

On Wednesday, after the shooting, Mr. Lander said on social media that “surging political violence threatens all of us.”

“Whatever motivated the shooter, this act is heinous, and should be condemned by people regardless of ideology,” he said, adding, “The tradition of non-violence, which we practiced last week, is key to restoring our humanity, and making democratic co-existence possible.”

In May, the mayor of Newark was arrested outside a new detention facility in New Jersey and briefly charged with trespassing, after a protest at the facility that also entangled three members of Congress.

The wearing of masks by ICE officers, which was not the norm before this year, has become a flashpoint among those opposed to President Trump’s deportation campaign, prompting lawmakers in a handful of Democratic-led states to push for legislation banning the use of masks.

On Saturday, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California signed a bill that would prevent federal immigration agents from wearing masks in the state. The move came after videos had spread online showing masked immigration agents handcuffing immigrants in Southern California. Democrats and immigration activists have argued that officers have acted with impunity knowing that their faces were shielded.

Homeland Security Department officials condemned the state law and called it unconstitutional, adding that their officers would not comply with the legislation. Federal officials have defended ICE officers’ use of masks, which they say protects them and their families from harassment or worse. Federal officials have said that officers carry badges and credentials and identify themselves when required.

“My fear is that the immigrants are the ones being targeted,” Ms. Duarte said as she sat in her car near the site of the shooting.

For weeks, Ms. Duarte has been visiting the site, which is not technically a detention center but an ICE office, for prayer vigils. She said she had heard about deplorable conditions there — dozens of detainees, men and women, crammed into what was described as a conference room, for days at time.

“They have all these people in one room, without beds, without food, without restrooms,” she said. “They have 30, 40, 60 people in one room.”

Jennifer Canadell, 34, was standing near the ICE facility Wednesday afternoon, hoping to hear from her husband, Rony Arroyo, 34, who was detained on Tuesday after an immigration appointment.

“I’m worried,” she said, holding their two-year-old. “I came down when I heard about the shooting.”

The couple, from Venezuela, showed up together for an annual check-in with immigration officials, but only he was detained, Ms. Canadell said.

“Everyone who is in there is in danger,” she said.

Other Latino leaders feared that the partisan rhetoric may only inflame tensions.

“We reject violence in any form, and we call on leaders at every level to act responsibly and stop inflaming tensions,” said Ray Mancera, the league’s vice president for the Southwest region. “Our communities deserve peace, not fear.”

Noemi Rios, co-founder of Vecinos Unidos DFW, United Neighbors, an immigration advocacy program, said that groups like hers have pressed for humane treatment of immigrants and have shunned violence.

“We don’t want to live in a world with so much violence and hatred,” Ms. Rios said. “We don’t wish violence on anyone.”

President Trump condemned “Deranged Radical Leftists” in a social media post about the shooting, linking the attack to the assassination of the political activist Charlie Kirk. “This violence is the result of the Radical Left Democrats constantly demonizing Law Enforcement, calling for ICE to be demolished, and comparing ICE Officers to ‘Nazis,’” he wrote.

D.H.S. officials said the suspect was targeting the ICE office from a nearby building. One detainee died in the shooting, and two others were critically wounded, officials said.

Mr. Jahn, who according to records voted in a Democratic primary in March 2020 in Texas, had an extensive online profile. But he showed little obvious interest in politics based on what has been uncovered so far. He has at least two Reddit accounts, where he talked about video games, cars, “South Park” and marijuana.

He was also registered to vote as an independent in Oklahoma, where his parents own property in Durant, Okla., north of Dallas, and where he voted once, in the 2024 general election.

Public records indicate that Mr. Jahn had at least a few minor scrapes with the law, including a charge for selling marijuana in 2015. He was released from court supervision for that charge a few years later, and the proceedings were dismissed.

Mr. Jahn was raised with a brother and a sister in a far north suburb of Dallas. His father retired in 2020 after spending 36 years in engineering roles at an elevator and escalator company, according to his LinkedIn profile.

Mr. Jahn lived with his parents in Texas at least as recently as a few months ago, according to public records. Their house is on a cul-de-sac in a rural area north of Dallas and Fort Worth that is rapidly developing as the metropolitan area expands. The house is a short drive from an outlet mall in Allen, Texas, where a shooter killed eight people in 2023.

Before noon on Wednesday, a blue truck drove quickly down the residential street leading to Mr. Jahn’s house. A man and woman got out of the car, quickly went into the house and did not answer the door.

According to a criminal complaint filed in the case, that shooting took place after a group of 10 to 12 people set off fireworks outside the Prairieland Detention Center that night. Not long after, one or two people from the group broke off and began spray-painting graffiti on nearby vehicles and a guard structure, scrawling the words “Ice pig” and “traitor” on a pair of cars, the complaint said.

The officer arrived at the scene around 11 p.m. After he stepped out of his car, the complaint said, two shooters opened fire from a wooded area next to the detention facility, firing numerous rounds and wounding the officer in the neck. He was flown to a hospital, where he was treated and discharged.

Investigators said later that they found spent ammunition where the shooters had been standing, of a type typically used in AR-15-style semiautomatic rifles.

A detective with the Johnson County sheriff’s office pulled over a van that had been seen leaving the scene, and the driver told the authorities about having transported several people to the detention center to “make some noise,” according to charging documents. The authorities reported finding a handgun, two AR-15-style rifles, two Kevlar ballistic-style vests and a ballistic helmet in the van.

Prosecutors have charged more than a dozen people in connection with the shooting in Alvarado, and have said that the fireworks, vandalism and shooting were part of a coordinated plan to ambush local and federal law enforcement officers. An organization that represents relatives and friends of people who were arrested over the episode disputes that characterization, saying that many of the people who were present that night believed they were attending a nonviolent protest.

A preliminary hearing in the case is scheduled for Sept. 30.

In a separate incident three days after the Alvarado shooting, a gunman opened fire at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection station in McAllen, injuring a Border Patrol employee and two officers. The gunman was fatally shot by law enforcement officers.

There have been numerous protests and demonstrations at federal facilities across the country over the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement policies. Some protests, including ones in Los Angeles, New York and Chicago, have involved vandalism and scuffles with law enforcement officers, who have sometimes deployed tear gas and flash-bang grenades against demonstrators.

Congressional members received the plan on September 12, giving them a tight time frame — only 19 days until the end of the 2025 fiscal year on September 30 — to either approve the State Department's plan or push back against it and risk losing the funding by the time the year ends, the

The State Department's proposed foreign aid funding projects have shifted from solely seeking to provide humanitarian to countries struggling with famine, disease and war to now being centered around how can these projects strengthen America's own national security and interests. For example, one of the projects the State Department is seeking to invest into is centered around supporting ""U.S. immigration priorities"" in Africa. The State Department is also seeking to fund projects combatting ""Marxist, anti-American regimes"" in Latin America, as well as “economic development and conservation work” in Greenland.

“The national security interests of the United States require that the United States utilize these foreign assistance funds to meet new challenges in ways that make America safer, stronger or more prosperous,"" the document stated.

Some of the projects laid out by the State Department have already garnered bipartisan support such as assisting United States allies in the Pacific in an effort to counter Chinese aggression. However, if Congress decides to completely agree to the Trump administration's decision to completely shift funding for projects already approved by Congress, it risks eroding their authority laid out in the Constitution over the federal budget.

In August, the Trump administration notified House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) in a letter that he intended to rescind approximately $4.9 billion from the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development and International Assistance programs, in an effort to codify cuts made under the Department of Government Efficiency.

“Any effort to rescind appropriated funds without congressional approval is a clear violation of the law,” Susan Collins (R-Maine), who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, said.

However, earlier this month the Supreme Court issued an emergency order allowing for the Trump administration's freezing of billions of dollars in foreign aid to remain in effect.

The Busan District Court said the head of the Gimhae Airport Immigration Office must cancel the decision not to process the man’s application for refugee status.

The plaintiff, who is in his 30s, reportedly applied for refugee status after arriving at Gimhae Airport in Busan on April 27. The Justice Ministry, however, decided not to refer his case for examination.

In response, the man refused to return to his home country and has since remained in a temporary holding area in the airport for those denied entry.

The man claimed refugee status, saying he fled political persecution in Guinea after participating in protests against the military dictatorship.

But the ministry did not move ahead with the refugee screening process as it found the plaintiff’s statements lacked credibility.

The man filed a lawsuit against the airport’s immigration office with assistance from local human rights organizations.

“Although we won in the first trial, we need to wait and see whether the Justice Ministry will file an appeal,” the plaintiff’s legal representative was quoted as saying by Yonhap News Agency.

Local human rights groups have also raised concerns about the man’s treatment at the airport, claiming a clear human rights violation.

According to the organizations, including the Joint Committee for Migrant Rights and Human Rights, the plaintiff received a burger for every meal. They say the Refugee Act states that basic food, clothing and shelter shall be provided to applicants in the airport’s holding area.

The human rights group also raised the concern that the plaintiff is expected to remain in the airport's holding area until the final ruling is made in a higher court.

Refugee applicants at Incheon Airport whose cases are not referred are reportedly transferred to a waiting facility outside the airport if they appeal and win their cases in the first trial. Gimhae Airport has no such designated facility.

DHS officials say this was “an attack on Ice law enforcement”.
The shooter has been identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, according to NBC News – which cited several senior law enforcement officials.
Despite the fact that no federal agents were wounded in the shooting, the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, called the attack an “assassination”.
While the FBI has said that authorities recovered shell casings with “anti-Ice messaging” near the shooter, officials have neither confirmed a motive nor corroborated Vance’s claims about the shooter’s ideological background.","A gunman fired at a Dallas immigration field office on Wednesday, killing one detainee and critically wounding two more, before killing himself in what authorities called an indiscriminate attack on US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice).

Here’s what we know about the attack so far:

One detainee has been killed, with two others in critical condition. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said previously that two detainees had been killed and one injured, but issued a corrected statement. The Dallas police chief, Daniel Comeaux, said that the FBI is investigating the incident as an act of targeted violence. The shooter died from a “self-inflicted gun wound”, according to the DHS secretary, Kristi Noem.

The DHS said no members of law enforcement were hurt in the attack. But Comeaux also said that officials would not be releasing the identities of any victims at this time.

DHS officials say this was “an attack on Ice law enforcement”. At both today’s press conference and in a statement, law enforcement said that shell casings found near the shooter had “anti-Ice” messaging on them.

The shooter has been identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, according to NBC News – which cited several senior law enforcement officials.

Dallas police said that shots were fired “from an adjacent building”. The DHS later added that the shooter “fired indiscriminately” at the Ice facility, “including at a van in the sallyport where the victims were shot”. All three victims were inside the van at the time the gunman opened fire.

The Dallas field office where the shooting occurred is used for short-term processing of people in custody. The victims may have been recently arrested by Ice. The facility is along Interstate 35 East, south-west of a large commercial airport serving the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, and just blocks from hotels catering to airport travelers.

Despite the fact that no federal agents were wounded in the shooting, the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, called the attack an “assassination”. For her part, Noem said that “these horrendous killings must serve as a wake-up call to the far left that their rhetoric about Ice has consequences”.

Donald Trump instantly politicized the shooting, claiming in a social media post that it “is the result of the Radical Left Democrats constantly demonizing Law Enforcement, calling for ICE to be demolished, and comparing ICE Officers to ‘Nazis.’”

The vice-president, JD Vance, claimed without evidence that the shooting was carried out by “a violent leftwing extremist” who was “politically motivated to go after law enforcement”. While the FBI has said that authorities recovered shell casings with “anti-Ice messaging” near the shooter, officials have neither confirmed a motive nor corroborated Vance’s claims about the shooter’s ideological background.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7d62192946c0cbd53a0731275f5decef220f32a/311_0_2084_1667/master/2084.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=893c2eef7d36ea5dc789662a1305b49d",N,,2025-09-25 03:57:11.239407

Judges are weighing ecological effects, zoning laws, and the U.S. Constitution to shape whether President Donald Trump’s administration can deliver on his promise of mass deportations.

Here’s a look at some prominent cases:

CoreCivic v. New Jersey

In 2021, New Jersey passed a law that prevents state, local and private entities from entering into or renewing contracts for immigration detention. CoreCivic, which operated the only private detention center in the state, sued on the grounds that the law was unconstitutional.

CoreCivic argued that New Jersey’s law shouldn’t apply to it because the company is effectively serving as an arm of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the U.S. Constitution blocks state laws from regulating the federal government or its agencies.

In 2023, U.S. District Judge Robert Kirsch decided partly in favor of CoreCivic. Although New Jersey could prevent state and local entities from entering into contracts with ICE, he ruled, it could not prevent CoreCivic or another private entity from doing so. Calling the law a “dagger aimed at the heart of the federal government’s immigration enforcement mission and operations,” Kirsch reasoned that allowing the full law to stand could encourage neighboring states to pass similar laws. That, he wrote, “would result in nothing short of chaos.”

A federal appeals court upheld Kirsch’s decision in July.

Newark v. GEO

In late February, GEO announced ICE had awarded it a 15-year contract, worth roughly $1 billion, to reopen Delaney Hall, a 1,000-bed facility in Newark, New Jersey. Delaney opened May 1 after months of what city officials called “irresponsible construction practices.”

In an April complaint, the city alleged Delaney Hall put detained people and staff in danger because GEO wouldn’t allow city inspectors to review the plumbing, electrical work or elevators. Newark also alleged that GEO failed to file for a certificate of continued occupancy — a form required whenever there is a change in tenant or ownership of a property. The city asked for a court order to stop Delaney’s operation while the case proceeds.

GEO called the lawsuit politically motivated and adopted a similar argument to the one CoreCivic made, saying Newark couldn’t use local codes to interfere with the federal government’s business: detaining immigrants.

Newark didn’t get the injunction it sought, so Delaney Hall remains open as the case proceeds.

City of Leavenworth v. CoreCivic

CoreCivic is seeking to reopen the shuttered Leavenworth Detention Center in Kansas under a new contract with ICE to hold up to 1,000 immigrants. The company had used the building from 1992 through 2021, primarily to hold people awaiting trial on federal charges.

The city argues the company must obtain a special use permit to operate the facility as a detention center. When the city passed a 2012 zoning law that would have required such a permit, CoreCivic was exempt because the facility already operated as a prison. But because the facility has now been idle for several years, the city maintains CoreCivic must now apply for the permit.

CoreCivic insists it doesn’t need the permit because it never abandoned the building. As it did in New Jersey, it also argues that local ordinances can’t interfere with the company when it’s doing work for the federal government.

The city’s argument won over a local judge, who issued a temporary order barring the reopening. CoreCivic has asked the judge to reconsider while the battle plays out.

Friends of the Everglades v. Noem

In late May, two environmental advocacy groups sued several federal and Florida agencies over a sprawling new immigration detention center in the Everglades. Commonly called “Alligator Alcatraz” — a term coined by Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier — the facility was constructed in a matter of days on an airfield in the heart of the Big Cypress National Preserve. Made of trailers and huge tents on the tarmac, the complex is expected to be temporary but has a capacity of up to 3,000 beds, according to state officials.

The advocacy groups want the project shut down on the grounds that authorities failed to produce the required assessment of how it will affect the environment. They’re also arguing it will harm people’s ability to use the area for recreation, science and other purposes. The Miccosukee Tribe has joined the lawsuit, saying the facility negatively affects sacred sites and other protected lands.

In court filings, defendants have sought to shift responsibility onto one another. Miami-Dade County argued the state used its emergency powers to commandeer the facility and that it was powerless to fight back. The Florida Division of Emergency Management maintains it didn’t need to produce an environmental impact report because those are required only of federal agencies.

Lawyers for ICE and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, argue the federal government can’t close the facility because it is the state’s operation.

In late August, a federal judge halted continued construction of the facility and said no additional detainees could be sent there. Additionally, officials must remove temporary fencing that prevented members of the Miccosukee Tribe from accessing the land. A separate lawsuit alleges detainees at the facility have been prevented from accessing legal counsel.

Guantanamo Bay plaintiffs v. DHS, ICE and other defendants

On Feb. 4, a plane carrying 10 immigrants landed at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay in Cuba after the White House directed officials to use the base to house immigrants being deported from the U.S. The notorious military prison there — first opened in 2002 to hold terrorism suspects — had never been used for this purpose.

Represented by the ACLU and several other organizations, immigrants sent to Guantanamo Bay sued, arguing their detention outside the U.S. was illegal and a violation of their Fifth Amendment right to due process and their right to habeas corpus, the legal principle that protects individuals from unlawful imprisonment.

The case is pending.

GEO v. Washington state

In 2023, Washington state enacted new regulations and requirements for private detention centers. Those included requiring the state Health Department to adopt new rules regarding health and safety and regular inspections of such facilities.

GEO, which operated the only private detention center in the state, sued on the grounds that the law was discriminatory and unconstitutional.

Among the state’s arguments was that GEO had no standing to sue because the law would only affect new or extended contracts — not those already in place.

A federal judge ruled mostly in favor of GEO but, on a technicality, left alone the section of the law that would affect new or extended contracts.

The state appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which heard arguments in February but hasn’t ruled.

In May, the state amended the statute to define a “private detention facility” as any operated by a private, nongovernmental entity, regardless of whether the facility is operated for profit. The new law, GEO argues, is still unconstitutional but much different in substance and scope.

Made of trailers and huge tents on the tarmac, the complex is expected to be temporary but has a capacity of up to 3,000 beds, according to state officials.

The advocacy groups want the project shut down on the grounds that authorities failed to produce the required assessment of how it will affect the environment. They’re also arguing it will harm people’s ability to use the area for recreation, science and other purposes. The Miccosukee Tribe has joined the lawsuit, saying the facility negatively affects sacred sites and other protected lands.

In court filings, defendants have sought to shift responsibility onto one another. Miami-Dade County argued the state used its emergency powers to commandeer the facility and that it was powerless to fight back. The Florida Division of Emergency Management maintains it didn’t need to produce an environmental impact report because those are required only of federal agencies.

Lawyers for ICE and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, argue the federal government can’t close the facility because it is the state’s operation.

In late August, a federal judge halted continued construction of the facility and said no additional detainees could be sent there. Additionally, officials must remove temporary fencing that prevented members of the Miccosukee Tribe from accessing the land. A separate lawsuit alleges detainees at the facility have been prevented from accessing legal counsel.

Guantanamo Bay plaintiffs v. DHS, ICE and other defendants

On Feb. 4, a plane carrying 10 immigrants landed at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay in Cuba after the White House directed officials to use the base to house immigrants being deported from the U.S. The notorious military prison there — first opened in 2002 to hold terrorism suspects — had never been used for this purpose.

Represented by the ACLU and several other organizations, immigrants sent to Guantanamo Bay sued, arguing their detention outside the U.S. was illegal and a violation of their Fifth Amendment right to due process and their right to habeas corpus, the legal principle that protects individuals from unlawful imprisonment.

The case is pending.

GEO v. Washington state

In 2023, Washington state enacted new regulations and requirements for private detention centers. Those included requiring the state Health Department to adopt new rules regarding health and safety and regular inspections of such facilities.

GEO, which operated the only private detention center in the state, sued on the grounds that the law was discriminatory and unconstitutional.

Among the state’s arguments was that GEO had no standing to sue because the law would only affect new or extended contracts — not those already in place.

A federal judge ruled mostly in favor of GEO but, on a technicality, left alone the section of the law that would affect new or extended contracts.

The state appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which heard arguments in February but hasn’t ruled.

In May, the state amended the statute to define a “private detention facility” as any operated by a private, nongovernmental entity, regardless of whether the facility is operated for profit. The new law, GEO argues, is still unconstitutional but much different in substance and scope.

Ltd, based on information that reasonably indicates forced labor use.

Effective immediately, CBP will detain bicycles, bicycle parts, and accessories manufactured in Taiwan by Giant. This WRO, the third issued in 2025 and the fourth in Fiscal Year 2025, was issued due to violations of 19 U.S.C. § 1307, the law prohibiting goods made with forced labor from entering the U.S.

“CBP has a proven track record of cracking down on companies that use forced labor to the detriment of law-abiding U.S. businesses,” said CBP Commissioner Rodney S. Scott.

CBP identified the following International Labour Organization forced labor indicators during its investigation of Giant:

abuse of vulnerability,

abusive working and living conditions,

debt bondage,

withholding of wages, and

excessive overtime.

Giant profited by imposing such abuse, resulting in goods produced below market value and undercutting American businesses by millions of dollars in unjustly earned profits. The International Labour Organization estimates that nearly 28 million workers are under conditions of forced labor worldwide.

“Importers have a responsibility to do their due diligence and know their supply chains,” said Acting Executive Assistant Commissioner of CBP’s Office of Trade Susan S. Thomas. “CBP will continue to investigate allegations of forced labor and take action when we find it in U.S. supply chains.”

The WRO against Giant is the latest action CBP has taken to address forced labor. With this WRO issuance, CBP currently oversees and enforces 53 WROs and nine Findings under 19 U.S.C. § 1307.

When CBP has evidence indicating that imported goods are made by forced labor, the agency issues orders to detain those shipments. Importers of detained shipments may seek to destroy or export their shipments or seek to demonstrate that the merchandise is admissible.

CBP receives allegations of forced labor from a variety of sources including government agencies, media, non-government organizations, and members of the public. Any person or organization that has reason to believe merchandise produced with forced labor is being, or is likely to be, imported into the United States can report detailed allegations by contacting CBP through the e-Allegations Online Trade Violation Reporting System or by calling 1-800-BE-ALERT.",,N,,2025-09-24 23:57:28.529309

Lyons, the acting director of ICE, confirmed to Fox News that officials had identified the suspected attacker as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn.
According to authorities, the gunman killed himself after opening fire, and his body was found near the ICE facility he had fired at.
In a post on Truth Social, his social media platform, President Trump said he had been briefed on the Dallas shooting.","A gunman armed with a rifle opened fire on a United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas on Wednesday, killing one detainee and critically wounding two others before taking his own life, authorities said.

Officials reported that the shooter left behind ammunition marked with the phrase “ANTI-ICE” written in blue. The FBI is investigating the attack as an act of targeted violence. Acting ICE director Todd Lyons confirmed that the suspect identified was a man named Joshua Jahn.

The shooting comes at a time when ICE has emerged as the sword arm of US President Donald Trump’s attempts to deport not only undocumented immigrants but also legal migrants seen as critical of his administration’s priorities – including for opposing Israel’s war on Gaza.

The attack on the ICE facility also comes two weeks after the assassination of conservative political activist Charlie Kirk, an event that led Trump to vow action against what he called left-wing extremists.

Here is what you need to know:

What happened and when?

Police said they got a call about a shooting about 6:40am local time (11:40 GMT) on Wednesday, September 24.

Four people were shot. One detainee died, and two others were taken to hospital in critical condition.

The gunman – authorities described him as a “sniper” – died from a self-inflicted gunshot. Officials said he fired indiscriminately at the ICE building from a nearby rooftop. The victims were either inside a van near the entrance to the building or nearby.

Authorities “found bullets throughout the entire building that had punctured into the facility”, ICE deputy director Madison Sheahan said.

No police officers were hurt, according to FBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge Joe Rothrock.

The exact motivation for the attack was not immediately known. Still, FBI director Kash Patel described the attack as “politically motivated”.

“These despicable, politically motivated attacks against law enforcement are not a one-off,” Patel said in a social media post.

“We are only miles from Prairieland, Texas where just two months ago an individual ambushed a separate ICE facility targeting their officers.” On July 4, ICE said nearly a dozen individuals armed with tactical gear and weapons attacked its Prairieland facility, injuring an officer, who survived.

What is ICE?

ICE, or US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, is a federal agency under the Department of Homeland Security that enforces immigration laws – including arresting and deporting undocumented immigrants – and investigates crimes such as human trafficking, drug smuggling and financial fraud.

In recent years, the agency has frequently clashed with protesters, particularly over detention conditions and deportation policies.

“The Department of Homeland Security reports assaults against its officers have risen eightfold since Trump began his mass deportations,” Al Jazeera’s Heidi Zhou-Castro reported from Washington.

Trump has made immigration enforcement a centrepiece of his presidency, with large-scale deportations and high-profile crackdowns.

“Now, the agency is deploying more security to its offices – while leaders warn that the US is headed in a dangerous direction if the political violence continues,” she added.

Where did the shooting happen?

The shooting took place at ICE’s field office in Dallas, which covers Texas and all of Oklahoma.

The ICE facility sits along Interstate 35 East, just southwest of Dallas Love Field, a major airport for the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and only a few blocks from hotels that serve travellers.

This is not the first attack on the facility.

Last month, 36-year-old US citizen Bratton Dean Wilkinson was arrested after arriving at the facility and claiming he had a bomb in his backpack, showing officers what he said was a detonator on his wrist.

What do we know about the suspect?

Lyons, the acting director of ICE, confirmed to Fox News that officials had identified the suspected attacker as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn.

Jahn had lived in a Dallas suburb, according to public records. According to authorities, the gunman killed himself after opening fire, and his body was found near the ICE facility he had fired at.

Court records show Jahn was arrested in 2015 for delivering marijuana to buyers. In 2016, he admitted to delivering between a quarter-ounce (7g) and five pounds (2.3kg). He was given five years of probation and a $500 fine.

Under Texas law, the charge is considered a “state jail felony”, which is the lowest level of felony offence in the state.

As Jahn’s name began circulating online, his older brother, Noah Jahn, spoke with a Reuters reporter. Noah, 30, who lives in McKinney, Texas – about 48km (30 miles) north of Dallas – said he was unaware of his brother having any negative feelings towards ICE.

“I didn’t know he had any political intent at all,” Noah said.

“He’s a young kid, a thousand miles from home, didn’t really seem to have any direction, living out of his car at such a young age,” Ryan Sanderson, who met him in 2017, told The Associated Press news agency.

“I don’t remember him being that abnormal. He didn’t seem to fight with anyone or cause trouble. He kept his head down and stayed working.”

What do we know about the victims?

Authorities have not released the identities of the victims. They said the three detainees who were shot were in the country without proper documentation and had been taken into custody and were awaiting transfer to a longer-term facility.

According to Mexico’s Ministry for Foreign Affairs, one of the injured detainees is a Mexican national. The ministry said the individual is hospitalised with serious injuries, and that the Mexican consulate has contacted the family to provide support and legal assistance.

What have been the reactions?

In a post on Truth Social, his social media platform, President Trump said he had been briefed on the Dallas shooting. He described the attacker as “deranged”, referred to the “Anti-ICE” message allegedly found on the shell casings and called that “despicable”.

Trump did not mention the victims, but instead urged, “CALLING ON ALL DEMOCRATS TO STOP THIS RHETORIC AGAINST ICE AND AMERICA’S LAW ENFORCEMENT, RIGHT NOW!”

Vice President JD Vance, without offering evidence, said the attack was politically motivated.

At an event in North Carolina, he said that California Governor Gavin Newsom and others didn’t need to support the Trump administration’s immigration policies, but “if your political rhetoric incites violence against law enforcement, you can go straight to hell”.

Newsom quickly responded.

“No thanks, JD. I will not be going ‘straight to hell’ today,” Newsom said. “Though when I watch you speak I certainly feel like I’m already there.”

Texas Senator Ted Cruz appealed for calm.

“This has very real consequences,” Cruz said.

“Look, in America, we disagree. That’s fine. That’s the democratic process, but your political opponents are not Nazis. We need to learn to work together without demonising each other, without attacking each other,” he added.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25267683160528-1758754927.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-09-24 23:57:32.816268

“For her asylum claim, Zapet contends that the BIA incorrectly affirmed the IJ’s determination that she failed to present extraordinary circumstances sufficient to warrant consideration of her untimely application. The government counters that we lack jurisdiction to review the agency’s determination. We agree with the government. …

“We next address the BIA’s denial of Zapet’s application for withholding of removal. Zapet contends that the evidence she presented compelled the BIA to find that she suffered past persecution and would more likely than not suffer future persecution. …

“Substantial evidence supports the BIA’s determination that Zapet failed to demonstrate past persecution. Zapet’s testimony regarding the threats at the core of her claim lacked specificity. …

“We similarly conclude that the BIA’s rejection of Zapet’s claim that she would more likely than not be faced with future persecution was supported by substantial evidence. Because, as already discussed, the BIA made a supportable determination that the threats themselves do not constitute persecution, Zapet’s only remaining argument is that the circumstances in Guatemala are so dangerous that she should not be required to return. In support of this contention, Zapet submitted information about country conditions in Guatemala.

“Substantial evidence supports the finding that Zapet did not show any individual circumstances that make it likely that she will face persecution were she to return to Guatemala. The country conditions reports identify difficult aspects of life in Guatemala, but the record lacks evidence showing how these difficulties apply to Zapet. …

“Additionally, the record evidence does not compel a finding that Zapet would face danger if she relocated within Guatemala from the area where she previously lived. …

“The BIA’s determination again is supported by substantial evidence. Zapet says that she was threatened with forced conscription and the risk of her children’s kidnapping. But, as we have already noted, the threats Zapet experienced did not manifest in actions against her or her children despite her refusal to comply with her perpetrators demands, and she has shown no reason to expect more severe treatment were she to return. … Moreover, Zapet’s reliance on generalized facts from country conditions reports is insufficient to establish that she would be subject to torture with the consent or acquiescence of the government. …

President Donald Trump’s administration has stepped up immigration enforcement in the Chicago area, resulting in hundreds of arrests.","DALLAS (AP) — A shooter with a rifle opened fire from a nearby roof onto a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement location in Dallas on Wednesday, killing one detainee and wounding two others in a transport van before taking his own life, authorities said.

The suspect was identified by a law enforcement official as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn. The official could not publicly disclose details of the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

The exact motivation for the attack was not immediately known. FBI Director Kash Patel posted a photo on social media showing a bullet found at the scene with “ANTI-ICE” written on it.

The attack is the latest public, targeted killing in the U.S., coming two weeks after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was killed by a rifle-wielding shooter and as heightened immigration enforcement has prompted backlash against ICE agents and fear in immigrant communities.

The American Immigration Lawyers Association called the shootings “a stark reminder that behind every immigration case number is a human being deserving of dignity, safety, and respect.”

“Whether they are individuals navigating the immigration process, public servants carrying out their duties, or professionals working within the system, all deserve to be free from violence and fear,” the group said in a statement.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that shots were fired “indiscriminately at the ICE building, including at a van in the sallyport,” a secure and gated entryway.

The wounded detainees were in critical condition at a hospital, said DHS, which previously said two detainees were killed and one was wounded before issuing a correction.

No ICE agents were injured.

By the evening, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ordered more security at ICE facilities across the U.S., according to a post by DHS on the social platform X.

‘Targeted violence’

At a midday news conference, authorities gave few details about the shooting and did not release the names of the victims or the gunman.

The FBI said it was investigating the shooting as “an act of targeted violence.”

Officers responded to a call to assist an officer on North Stemmons Freeway around 6:40 a.m. and determined that someone had opened fire at a government building from an adjacent building, Dallas police spokesperson Officer Jonathan E. Maner said via email.

The gunman used a bolt-action rifle, according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Edwin Cardona, an immigrant from Venezuela, said he was entering the ICE building with his son for an appointment around 6:20 a.m. when he heard gunshots. An agent took people who were inside to a more secure area and said there was an active shooter.

“I was afraid for my family, because my family was outside. I felt terrible, because I thought something could happen to them. Thank God, no,” Cardona said.

Cardona said they were later reunited.

The ICE facility is along Interstate 35 East, just southwest of Dallas Love Field, a large airport serving the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, and blocks from hotels.

Who was Joshua Jahn?

Hours after the shooting, FBI agents gathered at a suburban Dallas home that public records link to Jahn.

It sits on a tree-lined cul-de-sac in a neighborhood dotted with one- and two-story brick homes. The street was blocked by a Fairview police vehicle, but officials wearing FBI jackets could be seen in the front yard.

A spokesperson for Collin College in nearby McKinney, said via email that a Joshua Jahn studied there “at various times” between 2013 and 2018.

Martyna Kowalczyk, CEO of Texas-based Solartime USA, said in a statement that Jahn worked for her company for less than a few months “many years ago.”

In late 2017, Jahn drove cross-country to work a minimum-wage job harvesting marijuana for several months, according to Ryan Sanderson, owner of a legal cannabis farm in Washington state.

“He’s a young kid, a thousand miles from home, didn’t really seem to have any direction, living out of his car at such a young age,” Sanderson told AP. “I don’t remember him being that abnormal. He didn’t seem to fight with anyone or cause trouble. He kept his head down and stayed working.”

Sanderson said he tried to keep Jahn longer because he “felt bad for him.”

Calls for an end to political violence

Shortly after the shooting and before officials said at least one victim was a detainee, Vice President JD Vance posted on X that “the obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop.”

Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, who represents Texas, continued in that direction, calling for an end to political violence.

“To every politician who is using rhetoric demonizing ICE and demonizing CBP: Stop,” Cruz told reporters, referencing Customs and Border Protection.

Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson called the shooting not just an attack on law enforcement and the victims but “an attack on our community and on our nation’s heritage of civil and democratic discourse.”

The Catholic Legal Immigration Network, an advocacy group, said the shootings are “a heartbreaking reminder of the violence and fear that too often touch the lives of migrants and the communities where they live.”

“Violence must never be allowed to define how we respond to migration,” said Anna Gallagher, the group’s executive director.

The Rev. Ashley Anne Sipe, who prays outside the Dallas ICE facility every Monday said: “Violence doesn’t heal anything.”

Sipe and other local faith leaders who have decried deportations hold weekly vigils and serve as “moral witnesses.” They pray and observe for about three hours, watching as immigrants enter the building to meet with advisers and report for check-ins.

Sipe said she has noticed in recent months that people who enter are shuttled away on buses.

“They’re taking them away, and we don’t know where they’re taking them,” Sipe said.

Noem: ICE agents targeted

Noem noted a recent uptick in targeting of ICE agents.

On July 4 attackers in black, military-style clothing opened fire outside the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, southwest of Dallas, federal prosecutors said. One police officer was injured. At least 11 people have been charged in connection with the attack.

Days later a man with an assault rifle fired dozens of rounds at federal agents leaving a U.S. Border Patrol facility in McAllen. The man, identified as Ryan Louis Mosqueda, injured a police officer who responded to the scene before authorities shot and killed him.

And in suburban Chicago, federal authorities erected a fence around an immigration processing center after tensions flared with protesters. President Donald Trump’s administration has stepped up immigration enforcement in the Chicago area, resulting in hundreds of arrests.

Ahead of the latest immigration operation, federal officials boarded up windows at the center. Sixteen people have been arrested outside, according to authorities who called the activists “rioters.”

Attacks, escapes concern at some ICE offices

Dozens of field offices across the country house administrative employees and are used for people summoned for check-in appointments and to process people arrested before they are transferred to long-term detention centers. They are not designed to hold people in custody.

Security varies by location, with some located in federal buildings and others mixed with private businesses, said John Torres, a former acting director of the agency and former head of what is now called its enforcement and removals division.

Some, like Dallas, have exposed loading areas for buses, which pose risks for escape and outside attack, Torres said. Other vulnerabilities are nearby vantage points for snipers and long lines forming outside without protection.

“I would assure you that ICE, after today, is going to be a taking a hard look at physical security assessments for all of their facilities,” said Torres, currently head of security and technology consulting at Guidepost Solutions.

The Trump administration argues those jurisdictions make it harder for ICE to apprehend undocumented immigrants, including accused criminals and people who are in state or local custody.
Since then, several agencies have moved to restrict grants to ""sanctuary"" cities and states, including the Department of Justice and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.","A federal judge ruled Wednesday it is unconstitutional for the Trump administration to require states to cooperate with immigration enforcement in order to get some Federal Emergency Management Agency grants — a legal setback in the administration's push to revoke funding to ""sanctuary"" cities and states.

U.S. District Judge William Smith of Rhode Island ruled in favor of 20 mostly Democratic states that had sued FEMA, accusing the administration of ""holding critical emergency preparedness and response funding hostage"" unless they assist immigration agents.

The decision is likely to be appealed.

The states that sued — which include California, New York and Illinois — took issue with a Department of Homeland Security document issued earlier this year that says recipients of DHS grants must ""honor requests for cooperation"" with immigration authorities, including requests to detain migrants or share information. Some of the plaintiffs are ""sanctuary"" states that have laws restricting cooperation between police and immigration agents.

The states argued this move violates federal law and the Constitution, and could deprive them of billions per year in key disaster grants from FEMA, which is a sub-agency of DHS.

The Trump administration has argued its policy doesn't violate the law. Also, months after the lawsuit was filed, the government told the court it had decided most of the FEMA disaster grants that the states were concerned about losing will not be tied to immigration cooperation after all. The administration called the lawsuit moot on those grounds.

The states called the Trump administration's decision not to link disaster grants to immigration enforcement ""halfhearted and incomplete,"" arguing it's unclear if the decision was communicated to agency staff or if it will apply to years beyond 2025.

In a 45-page ruling Wednesday, Smith sided with the states and granted summary judgment, calling the policy ""both arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional.""

""Plaintiff States stand to suffer irreparable harm; the effect of the loss of emergency and disaster funds cannot be recovered later, and the downstream effect on disaster response and public safety are real and not compensable,"" Smith wrote.

The ruling follows a monthslong gambit by President Trump to punish ""sanctuary"" cities and states that limit cooperation between the police and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The Trump administration argues those jurisdictions make it harder for ICE to apprehend undocumented immigrants, including accused criminals and people who are in state or local custody. But ""sanctuary"" cities and states typically argue that requiring them to cooperate with ICE would undermine trust in local police and make some immigrants wary of reporting crimes.

CBS News has reached out to DHS, FEMA and the White House for comment.

Within hours of returning to office in January, Mr. Trump signed an executive order telling federal agencies to ensure that ""sanctuary"" jurisdictions ""do not receive access to Federal funds.""

U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the government is considering making the $1 million Trump Gold Card the only pathway to a U.S. green card—but immigration experts tell Forbes that it doesn’t pass the legal sniff test.

Key Facts

What Is The Status Of The Trump Gold Card?

The Trump administration has hyped the Gold Card but “I don't think it's happening,” Gelatt told Forbes, pointing to recent remarks by Joseph Edlow, the newly confirmed director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), that appeared to indicate the government does not yet have its ducks in a row. “We at the department will ensure that if a Gold Card does come to fruition, that there will be sufficient vetting and screening for any applicant that comes through the process,” Edlow told the Center for Immigration Studies last week. Multiple immigration experts told Forbes that creating a new visa must go through the legislative branch. “Unless Congress acts, there will never be a Trump Gold Card because it’s not consistent with current law, and it's not going to survive the invariable legal challenges,” Jorge Loweree, managing director of programs and strategy at the American Immigration Council, told Forbes. Writing in the National Law Review on Wednesday, attorneys at Ogletree Deakins, one of the country’s largest labor and employment law firms, concluded, “At this time, it is unclear whether the EB-1 and EB-2 immigrant visa programs for people of 'exceptional value' may be replaced, with the potential to eliminate or replace other immigrant visa programs in the future.” It’s strange and perhaps telling, note experts, that the Trump Gold Card is being managed by the Commerce Department and not Homeland Security. “Maybe that's an indication of how things have played out internally,” Loweree speculated. “Maybe there's been some level of pushback at DHS or USCIS in terms of the underlying legal prospects of being able to do this.”

What Is The Difference Between The Eb-5 Visa And The Trump Gold Card?

The biggest difference is who benefits from the applicant’s visa fee. The EB-5 visa is an investment immigration program that “was passed by Congress, has been on the books for many years and requires a level of investment between $800,000 and just over $1 million dollars,” Loweree told Forbes. “That money isn’t just a gift the US government. Applicants are required to invest those funds in a commercial enterprise in the U.S., and there's an important job creation component Congress instituted to create greater benefits for businesses and workers already in the U.S.” In comparison, the Trump Gold Card would require applicants to make a flat $1 million donation to the Treasury, which is a far less appealing proposition, according to Nuri Katz, founder of Apex Capital Partners, who has provided investment immigration guidance to ultra-high-net-worth clients around the world for 35 years. “Now what the government is saying is ‘we don't care about you business people. We don't care about job creation. We just want the money put into the Treasury,’” Katz told Forbes, adding the Trump administration is “basically destroying private businesses that were trying to get off the ground by raising funds from EB-5 investors. These are important projects, from hotels to hospitals, around the country that were creating thousands of jobs. By cutting off funding, many will fail, leaving half-built properties and bankrupt American businesses. It is pretty scary, actually.”

Chief Critic

Loweree scoffed at the administration’s claim that the Gold Card was designed to drive down the federal debt. “The idea that they’re concerned about the debt when they just championed and pushed through the Big, Beautiful Bill Act that's projected to increase the debt by over $3 trillion is ridiculous. This is an effort to create a new pay-to-play scheme and reorient our immigration system into something that simply favors the rich and moves away from the historical priorities of family reunification and focusing on skills and critical labor that's critical to the U.S. economy.”

Crucial Quote

“Instead of creating policies that help American businesses and families, President Trump is rolling out the welcome mat for Russian oligarchs and cartel bosses,” U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, D-Ill., ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement.

“Today, the Court ruled that the Trump Administration cannot bully states into taking part in their fear-driven, inhumane immigration agenda by withholding congressionally appropriated funds,” said AG Campbell. “I applaud the Court’s decision, which will protect billions of dollars to help states ensure public safety and prepare for, protect against, and respond to catastrophic natural disasters. We will continue to hold the Trump Administration accountable when it violates our laws and puts our residents at risk.”

In their lawsuit against FEMA, the coalition of attorneys general argued that the new terms and conditions placed on federal grant funding were unconstitutional and beyond the Department of Homeland Security’s legal authority. They argued that Congress had appropriated the funding to protect and support public safety, not for immigration enforcement. In today’s judgment, the Court agreed with the states that the safety and well-being of every American could be put at risk if states were forced to forfeit the billions in federal funding for emergency preparedness and response for failing to comply with the federal government's cruel and unlawful immigration enforcement policies.

Last year, Massachusetts alone received more than five million dollars in federal funding from FEMA, for a sum total of over 23 million dollars received over the last four years. AG Campbell and the coalition argued that using federal funding to bully states into submission would cause irreparable harm to the delicate bond and carefully built trust between law enforcement and the very communities they vow to serve and protect.

The provider, Home Care Staffing, filed the first lawsuits of this kind that 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS has seen, one in Ramsey County District Court and the other in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota weeks after CEO Twyla Martin received a letter from DHS at the beginning of August, which served as notice the state agency was suspending HSS reimbursements to the provider.

Martin is asking the courts for a temporary injunction that would require DHS to resume payments while officials continue their investigation into alleged “credible allegation of fraud.”

“I felt like it was a huge injustice. It was unfair. And not only that, people’s lives are being impacted,” Martin said on Tuesday, when asked why she turned to legal action.

She said the payment suspension forced Home Care Staffing to lay off staff and suspend HSS-related services for more than 500 clients.

“I wasn’t able to pay my staff. I had to lay off 35 people,” Martin said.

5 EYEWITNESS NEWS met with Martin and client Jessica Cronquist on Tuesday at a home she said she was able to get into with the help of Home Care Staffing.

“They help us so much. They really do. And I feel lost without them, because they’ve been a good support system,” Cronquist said.

Cronquist was mentioned in the August Notice of Payment Withhold from DHS. The letter said that Home Care Staffing overbilled for her services, citing that as a “credible allegation of fraud.”

Cronquist signed a letter days later, saying the billing was “true, accurate, and a full reflection of the services I actually received.”

Renée Cooper: “You don’t believe that home care staffing has over-billed on your behalf?”

Cronquist: “Nope.”

Cooper: “And you’ve seen it all?”

Cronquist: “Yes.”

Cooper, turning to Martin: “And I’ll just ask you directly, has Home Care Staffing overbilled on any clients?”

Martin: “No, not at all.”

Martin said she appealed the payment suspension, but it was denied.

Martin: “It pretty much just said, based upon what their findings were, from the first letter, it still remains.”

Cooper: “Until they can complete their investigation?”

Martin: “Correct.”

A recent change to state policy allows payments to be stopped when there’s a credible allegation of fraud, amid growing fraud investigations across several DHS programs.

Asked on Tuesday, DHS said it has suspended payments to 115 HSS providers, 55 have appealed, and DHS has not resumed payments to any as of this report.

Asked if she supports the policy changes, including DHS’s ability to stop payments quicker, Martin said, “I do support it if there’s a credible allegation of fraud that’s been backed by some sort of evidence that they are doing their due process correctly by making sure it really is fraud.”

“And I don’t think it’s DHS’s intention to hurt, but someone has to stand up to say, ‘Hey, I know you’re trying to be helpful and stop fraud, as you should, but you are missing a step that is hurting a lot of people.'”

Martin said 20-30 other HSS providers were also considering legal action.

DHS has made motions to dismiss the district court and federal lawsuits filed by Home Care Staffing.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security confirmed in a press release at least one detainee was shot and others may be in critical condition. It's unclear if more were killed in the shooting. The department previously stated two detainees were killed and one was in critical condition but updated their release online.

However, DHS issued a statement Wednesday afternoon announcing the correction. No one from law enforcement was injured in the shooting, DHS said.

The shooter's motives and targets are unclear, but Joe Rothrock, the special agent in charge of the Dallas FBI field office, said at a press conference Wednesday morning the agency is investigating the shooting as ""an act of targeted violence."" Investigators found bullet casings they said contained anti-ICE messages.

The fatal shooting comes amid President Donald Trump's immigration crackdowns since taking office in January and the nationwide responses to his measures, including protests across the country.

It also comes after a year of high-profile, political incidents involving gun violence, including the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk exactly two weeks ago and the killings of two Minnesota Democratic lawmakers in June.

U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, pointed out Wednesday’s shooting is the third in Texas involving ICE or U.S. Customs and Border Protection and called on political violence to end.

""To every politician who is using rhetoric demonizing ICE and demonizing CBP, stop,"" Cruz told reporters. ""To every politician demanding that ICE agents be doxxed and calling for people to go after their families, stop.""

But U.S. Senator John Cornyn, R-Texas, was more direct in blaming the uptick in political violence on ""anti-law enforcement rhetoric from the radical left.""

“Texans back our men and women in blue. ANY attack on an officer WILL BE investigated & prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" Cornyn wrote in a post on X. ""We must stop this dangerous rhetoric & break this disturbing trend of political violence.”

This isn’t the first incident at the ICE field office in recent months. The building, which sees detainees as well as people with ongoing immigration cases checking in with officers, received a bomb threat last month.

In a statement, Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson said it shouldn't be a partisan issue, calling on the public to pray for the victims and their families and condemn political violence.

""Dallas did not deserve what transpired this morning,"" the statement reads. ""We are better than this craven act of violence. In moments like this, our city must stand together and support one another. We must heal.""

Dallas City Council Member Adam Bazaldua expressed his sorrow over the shooting in a statement Wednesday, saying the country's immigrants are ""bearing the brunt"" of hate and violence spreading within the United States. Bazaldua also condemned any politicization of the incident.

""At a time when our communities are desperate for healing, leadership, and real solutions, we are instead met with more division and finger-pointing,"" Bazaldua said. ""We cannot continue down this path of hate and violence. Our country and all of its people deserve better.”

Alvarado ICE detention center shooting

Seventeen people have been arrested over the course of two months in connection with a July 4 shooting at the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, about 30 miles south of Fort Worth. About a dozen people arrived outside the detention center that night, setting off fireworks outside the facility, according to court documents.

ICE correctional officers called Alvarado police. When an officer arrived, several people started fleeing on foot and ignored verbal commands, court documents show. Then a person in the woods began shooting, hitting an Alvarado officer who has since recovered, according to court documents.

The initial complaint by the U.S. Justice Department said two people — one wearing a black mask, another wearing a green one — shot at correctional officers and the Alvarado officer 20-to-30 times.

But a more recent complaint obtained by KERA News states new evidence suggests there was only one shooter and 11 shell casings recovered from the scene.

The defendants allegedly had cans of spray paint and wrote “ICE Pig” and “Traitor” on cars in the parking lot. Police found firearms, magazines with ammunition, body armor and flyers that said “fight ICE terror with class war” and “free all political prisoners” on the suspects and their cars.

Ten people were arrested the night of the shooting and seven more have been arrested since on charges including attempted murder, aggravated assault and terrorism. That includes former Marine Corps reservist Benjamin Song, who was arrested after more than a week after a police and FBI manhunt.

Federal authorities have called the incident a coordinated attack against law enforcement. Some arrestees and their attorneys have said the incident was only intended to be a protest, and the alleged shooter acted alone.

Political scientists told KERA News the incident is indicative of an uptick in political violence on both sides of the political aisle.

Fourteen defendants made their first appearances in Fort Worth federal court Monday and Tuesday for their federal charges. Several will be back in court next Tuesday for hearings to determine probable cause in their charges and whether they should be kept in detention.

The arrestees had been held in the Johnson County Jail on million-dollar bonds, but they’ve now been moved to the Wichita County Jail as of Wednesday morning, jail records show.

Dario Sanchez, a Dallas teacher who was arrested for removing some of the defendants and their texts from a Discord group chat — then bonded out — was rearrested this week after law enforcement monitoring his devices said he made “explosive construction internet queries” in violation of his bond conditions. He and his attorney say his searches related to batteries and melting plastic were research for his hobbies: making anime figurines, building a remote-controlled car and fixing his Game Boy.

He’s scheduled to appear in court Wednesday afternoon for a bond hearing.

July 7 McAllen shooting

Days after the Alvarado shooting, a man fired dozens of rounds at federal agents with an assault rifle at a U.S. Border Patrol facility in McAllen, injuring a police officer before authorities shot and killed him.

Authorities identified the gunman as Ryan Louis Mosqueda, a Michigan man around 27 years old, who was shooting at agents leaving the building.

According to an incident report obtained by ValleyCentral, Mosqueda’s father reported his son as a missing person hours before the shooting and told authorities his son was armed.

Mosqueda’s brother told TV station WOOD that Mosqueda had been dealing with mental health issues, and the attack came “out of the blue.”

Sept. 12 Chicago shooting

An ICE agent fatally shot a suspect who tried to evade arrest in a suburb of Chicago by driving at officers and dragging one of them, the Associated Press reported. The Department of Homeland Security said the officer was trying to arrest a man with a history of reckless driving who had entered the country illegally, but he refused orders and drove his car at officers.

ICE identified Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez as the suspect who later died in the hospital.

In an email statement, CoreCivic spokesperson Brian Todd thanked the DOJ for weighing in on the company’s behalf.","The U.S. Department of Justice is backing CoreCivic in its legal battle with the city of Leavenworth as the company seeks to reopen a shuttered prison it owns there as an immigrant detention center over the objection of local officials.

The DOJ filed a statement of interest in federal court on Tuesday, characterizing the city’s resistance as an illegal effort to undermine the federal government’s immigration enforcement.

“The United States submits this Statement of Interest to address an aggressive and unlawful effort by the City of Leavenworth, Kansas … to interfere with federal immigration enforcement,” begins the eight-page filing, signed by Brett Shumate, assistant attorney general over the DOJ’s Civil Division.

The DOJ filing was also signed by Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign and Anthony Nicastro, acting director of the Office of Immigration Litigation.

The show of support for CoreCivic comes as the private prison company has suffered a string of legal defeats in Kansas state court in recent months.

Leavenworth District Court Judge John J. Bryant issued and upheld a temporary restraining order blocking CoreCivic from accepting detainees at the 1,033-bed facility under a contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement while the lawsuit plays out.

The case landed in Bryant’s courtroom after CoreCivic successfully argued that Leavenworth’s initial lawsuit in federal court lacked jurisdictional standing. But the company later filed its own claim in federal court against the city, alleging that local officials were unlawfully interfering with the federal government’s prerogative to control immigration policy.

The DOJ built off of that argument in its own filing, invoking the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which places federal laws above conflicting state and local laws.

“Defendants have violated the Supremacy Clause by attempting to stymie the Federal Government’s immigration-related operations at 100 Highway Terrace,” the filing states, referring to the address of CoreCivic’s Leavenworth facility. “Under the doctrine of intergovernmental immunity, the Constitution ‘prohibit[s] States from interfering with or controlling the operations of the Federal Government.’

“This foundational principle means that Defendants cannot regulate the United States’ contracts for private detention facilities,” the filing adds.

ICE prison lawsuit

In court filings and hearings, the city has argued that to maintain legitimacy, it must be allowed to enforce its own laws, including a 2012 ordinance that requires jail and prison operators to secure a special use permit before opening.

CoreCivic initially applied for a special use permit, but withdrew its application in March, saying it could operate the ICE detention center by right.

The facility at 100 Highway Terrace was previously operated as a private prison under contract with the U.S. Marshals Service through 2021, but a Joe Biden executive order barred the DOJ from renewing contracts with private prison companies.

Several previous efforts by CoreCivic to reactivate the prison in the years after its closure — including under an earlier proposed agreement with ICE — faced pushback from community members, in part because of the facility’s history of chronic violence, rampant drug use and dangerously low staffing levels.

CoreCivic attorney Taylor Concannon Hausmann argued during an August hearing that the local government’s adversarial stance toward CoreCivic reopening without a permit is “fueled by political discourse and polarization” over whether immigrant detainees should be brought to Leavenworth.

City officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday.

In an email statement, CoreCivic spokesperson Brian Todd thanked the DOJ for weighing in on the company’s behalf.

“CoreCivic appreciates the Department of Justice’s support as we continue to pursue all avenues to find a successful conclusion to this matter,” Todd said.",https://www.kansascity.com/public/latest-news/vjccst/picture301410574/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/KCM_LeavenworthICEdetention%20(2),N,,2025-09-24 19:57:59.278244

Lawyer Oliver Barker-Vormawor told Reuters after a court hearing in Accra that six of the group had already been forced into neighbouring Togo, while the whereabouts of the other five remain unclear.

Only three of those sent to Togo are Togolese. The nationalities of the others has not been disclosed.

He described the development as a breach of legal protections, noting that at least eight of the deportees previously held U.S. court orders shielding them from removal to their home countries due to risks of torture and persecution.

The group included four Nigerians, three Togolese, two Malians, one Liberian and one Gambian.

Ghana’s uneasy role in US deportation policy

Ghana’s President John Dramani Mahama recently confirmed that his government had agreed to receive deportees from across West Africa under President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.

The arrangement meant Accra was not only accepting Ghanaians but also nationals from Nigeria, Mali, Togo, Liberia, and The Gambia.

Officials in Accra have stressed that Ghana is not endorsing Washington’s policy and has not received compensation for hosting these deportees.

Still, the move has made Ghana a frontline state in the U.S. strategy of outsourcing deportations to African partners.

While Ghana has accepted returnees, other African governments have taken a more defiant stance.

Nigeria has publicly rejected U.S. attempts to offload non-Nigerian deportees on its territory, insisting it will only receive its own citizens. Similar hesitancy has been expressed in Kenya and South Africa, where concerns about security and integration remain high.

The mixed response further reflects how U.S. immigration policies are straining relations with African nations, many of whom see the returnees as victims of a politicised crackdown rather than simply failed migrants.

Human rights concerns linger

Barker-Vormawor’s failed court bid highlights the limits of legal protections for deportees once they are transferred from U.S. custody to African soil.

He argued that the new expulsions “are precisely the injury we were trying to prevent,” adding that the case he filed was now moot since the deportees had already been forced out.

Rights advocates warn that deporting people with established protection orders violates international law and could expose them to torture, imprisonment, or persecution in their home countries.

Illinois’ Democratic members of Congress have been seeking answers from ICE and U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials about their operations in the Chicago area with little success. Durbin told reporters in Springfield on Wednesday that he has reached out to Homeland Security several times seeking a meeting.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has left Illinois officials from Gov. JB Pritzker down to local police chiefs almost entirely in the dark about the government’s “Operation Midway Blitz.” Federal officials say the operation is meant to arrest violent people illegally in the United States who are living in the Chicago area.

Durbin said prior presidential administrations have always kept members of Congress updated on their plans, but President Donald Trump’s second administration is leaving lawmakers searching for answers.

“That is routine in my service in Congress over the last 40 years,” Durbin said. “Routine for the administration of either political party to be asked to explain what they are doing and how they are spending tax funds. And they did it, but not this time.”

Durbin said there is a “chance” that changes this week, adding he has a lot of “basic” questions for ICE.

“What’s happening to the people that you’re sweeping off the streets, the detainees?” Durbin said. “Many times, their families don’t know what happened to them and can’t come up with any information as to where they’re even located.”

Transparency concerns

Illinois leaders have faulted ICE for a lack of transparency about its work in the Chicago area, which also includes teams from Customs and Border Protection.

Illinois’ Democratic members of Congress sent a letter to Noem on Tuesday with 13 questions about DHS’ operations. The letter also expressed concerns about the tactics federal agents are using to arrest people and manage protests outside an ICE detention center in Broadview.

Last week, Pritzker released his own list of 22 questions he wants reporters to ask DHS about immigration enforcement, including how people detained by ICE are receiving legal information.

Illinois leaders said several incidents heightened their concerns, including last week when Noem shared a video of herself at a raid of an Elgin home where two U.S. citizens were briefly detained by immigration authorities.

Franklin Park police released body camera footage following a deadly shooting by ICE in the near west suburb that appeared to contradict DHS’ narrative about the incident. The footage captured by a Franklin Park police officer after the shooting shows an ICE agent saying he had no major injuries. A previous DHS statement said an agent was dragged by a car and sustained “serious injuries,” according to the Chicago Tribune.

It’s unclear how many people have been arrested by immigration authorities in their Chicago area crackdown or how long the operations will last. Many people who have been arrested have no criminal history, news outlets including NBC Chicago have reported.

“This notion that we’re dealing with rapists and murderers and terrorists and criminally insane is a hoax, is a fraud,” Durbin said. “If there’s a person who is dangerous in the community, remove them.”

Durbin added it’s “not American” for masked agents to arrest people who have followed the country’s laws.

Trusting the Trump administration

Durbin also discussed the Trump administration’s decision to close an FBI investigation of Tom Homan, a previous acting director of ICE who is now overseeing the Trump administration’s immigration policies.

MSNBC reported Homan took a $50,000 bribe last year from undercover FBI agents posing as business executives before Trump’s election last year in exchange for government contracts if Homan earned a job in Trump’s administration.

Trump’s Justice Department ended the investigation. The White House said Homan did nothing wrong and accused the Biden administration of entrapment and political motives.

“This $50,000, particularly as it relates to this mass deportation effort, is embarrassing,” Durbin said.

He said the incident raises more questions about how much Trump’s administration can be trusted.

“If we want to have confidence in government, we have to fight corruption in government,” Durbin said. “And the notion that someone coming into the administration takes a $50,000 payment so good word will be expressed to the White House is troubling.”",https://capitolnewsillinois.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/250924-Dick-Durbin-Gaggle.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 11:59:42.717957

The City of Eureka is among a group of plaintiffs that prevailed over the Trump administration in federal court Tuesday.

The plaintiffs, a group of local organizations and governments that receive millions of dollars of federal grant money, accused the Trump administration of imposing “unauthorized and vague conditions” on their grant funding. Yesterday, a federal judge agreed, issuing a preliminary injunction that bars the administration from making grants conditional upon fulfilling Trump’s policy goals.

The president’s administration was trying to force grantees to comply with a series of recent executive orders that prohibit recipients from promoting “woke” beliefs and practices, such as DEI, “gender ideology” and elective abortion, while requiring them to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts. The City of Eureka is among many jurisdictions to have passed a sanctuary ordinance prohibiting the sharing of immigration-related information with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The plaintiffs in this suit, led by the City of Fresno, challenged the actions on constitutional grounds, arguing that they violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Fifth Amendment, Separation of Powers, the Spending Clause and the Tenth Amendment.

The City of Eureka joined the lawsuit last month. City Manager Miles Slattery told the Outpost via phone that while the city has not yet received any grants that would have been contingent on those new conditions, it regularly received Community Development Block Grants and federal transportation grants.

“We’re looking at a $5 million grant for transportation [currently],” he said.

With yesterday’s ruling, which follows a temporary restraining order granted last month, Judge Richard Seeborg found that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their case. Only Congress has the authority to impose conditions on federal grant funding, he noted. And he found that the administration’s grant conditions likely violate the Separation of Powers; they’re unrelated to the expertise of the granting agencies; and the vagueness of the conditions would encourage “arbitrary and discriminatory” enforcement, among other issues.

The order applies to these federal agencies:

The Herrera case, alongside deportations to CECOT, has become a rallying point for legal challenges and human rights scrutiny of the administration’s immigration enforcement policy.","The sudden detention of Carmen Herrera, a longtime San Antonio resident, has drawn widespread attention after video of her being detained by federal immigration agents went viral on social media.

Herrera, a mother of six U.S. citizen children and married to a U.S. citizen, appeared at San Antonio’s Immigration Court earlier this year seeking relief in her case. Instead, she was met by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, who detained her immediately after her hearing. She was later deported to her native Mexico.

Witnesses captured the moment on cell phones, and the footage spread rapidly online, sparking outrage from immigrant-rights advocates.

Supporters say Herrera had lived in the United States for years, held steady employment, and had no criminal record.

ICE officials defended the arrest, stating Herrera had a final order of removal and that the agency was acting within its authority. “Individuals subject to deportation orders are priorities for enforcement,” an ICE spokesperson said.

The viral video has reignited debate over courthouse arrests and the Trump administration’s broader immigration crackdown, which critics say targets families and longtime residents without due process.

Al Jazeera’s Fault Lines series recently released an episode titled “Crackdown,” which tells the story of Herrera and the impact her detainment and deportation has had on her family. It also examines the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement tactics, including court arrests and deportations conducted without full due process.

According to the documentary, Herrera had long lived in the U.S. and was pursuing legal relief but was unexpectedly handcuffed and shoved into an ICE van after being called into court.

Her attorneys say she had multiple paths to legal status; her arrest and removal came as families across the country report similar takedowns at courthouses.

More broadly, ""Crackdown"" frames Herrera’s case as part of a sweeping deportation campaign under Trump. The documentary underscores how the administration has used measures such as in-court ICE arrests, redefinition of enforcement zones, and transfers of migrants to foreign penal facilities.

One of the most controversial elements exposed is the mass deportation of migrants, including those with no U.S. criminal convictions, to El Salvador’s new Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT), a maximum-security prison built for gang detainees.

The administration invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act in March 2025 to justify shipping about 238 Venezuelan migrants from Texas to CECOT, despite internal records showing many lacked criminal records. The U.S. Supreme Court later found that this was a misuse of the Alien Enemies Act and was unlawfully applied.

Supporters of the administration argue that the policy is aimed at removing dangerous gang actors and closing legal loopholes exploited by criminals. They assert that broad powers are necessary to prevent criminal networks from exploiting sympathetic rulings or delays in the immigration system.

Critics counter that the campaign overshoots its intent: thousands of nonviolent immigrants, asylum seekers, and individuals with no criminal records risk being lumped in, deprived of due process, and sent to foreign prisons. The Herrera case, alongside deportations to CECOT, has become a rallying point for legal challenges and human rights scrutiny of the administration’s immigration enforcement policy.

At least three people were shot, two of whom were killed, in a shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas, Texas on Wednesday, Fox News confirmed.

The FBI says it is investigating the incident as a ""targeted attack"" against ICE, and multiple sources familiar with the investigation have identified the alleged shooter as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn. Representatives for the FBI at a Wednesday morning press conference in Dallas said that preliminary investigations uncovered anti-ICE messaging on bullet rounds found near the shooter.

The shooting reportedly occurred as ICE officers were transferring detainees into the facility. The shooter died due to a self-inflicted wound shortly after the attack, authorities say. The three individuals who were shot were all detainees, and two of them have died.

The three detainees were shot while inside a law enforcement van, ICE sources told Fox News' Brooke Taylor.

Authorities say Jahn fired on the facility from a nearby rooftop, striking both the van and other parts of the ICE facility.

Authorities say Patel was in Dallas for a ""prescheduled visit"" on Wednesday morning. The FBI says he visited law enforcement at the ""incident command location"" following the attack.

The Dallas Police Department sources told Fox News the shooting occurred at roughly 6:30 a.m. local time. They say no law enforcement officers were injured, but that three detainees were shot and two were killed.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed there were ""multiple fatalities.""

""There was a shooting this morning at the Dallas ICE Detention Facility,"" Noem wrote on X. ""Details are still emerging but we can confirm there were multiple injuries and fatalities. The shooter is deceased by a self-inflicted gunshot wound.""

""While we don’t know motive yet, we know that our ICE law enforcement is facing unprecedented violence against them. It must stop. Please pray for the victims and their families,"" she added.

Authorities say the shooter opened fire when the sally port to the facility was open during the transfer of detainees, attempting to force his way in.

Associated Press

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — As President Donald Trump’s administration imposes new restrictions on the legal immigration system, U.S. adults are more likely than they were a year ago to think these immigrants benefit the country, according to a new poll.

The survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that Americans are more likely than they were in March 2024 to say it’s a “major benefit” that people who come to the U.S. legally contribute to economic growth and help American companies get the expertise of skilled workers. The survey also shows that Americans are less likely than they were in January to say the number of legal immigrants to the U.S. should be reduced. Slightly fewer than half of Americans say the number should remain the same, a similar percentage from earlier this year.

At the same time, perceptions of illegal immigration haven’t shifted meaningfully. Americans continue to see fewer benefits from people who come to the U.S. illegally, and they’re more likely to see major risks from these immigrants, including the concern that they’ll commit crimes while in the U.S.

Trump, a Republican, has focused much of his attention on arresting and deporting those in the country illegally, but new screenings, vetting and increased costs are also impacting people who want to come to the U.S. legally to work or study. On Friday, Trump signed a proclamation to overhaul the H-1B visa program, one of the most common pathways for highly skilled foreign workers, requiring now a $100,000 fee for applications. The Trump administration is also subjecting green card applicants to “anti-Americanism” screening, and students applying for visas now need to adhere to social media vetting.

Even Republicans are less likely to say legal immigration should be reduced than they were earlier this year and more likely to say it should remain as is.

Philip Steers, of St. Petersburg, Florida, is a Republican and feels the U.S. makes it too difficult for people to migrate legally. His nephew married a woman from Cambodia, and they have been trying for months to secure a spouse visa.

“If you are pushing all those people who are illegal out, why not make it easier for people who want to come here legally?” said Steers, 76. “We need to speed up the process for those who want to come here to benefit our country.”

Republicans less likely to want to reduce legal immigration

While slightly fewer than half of U.S. adults say the number of legal immigrants should stay as it is, about one-quarter say the number of legal immigrants to the U.S. should be reduced “a lot” or “a little.” That marks a decrease from January, when about one-third said this.

The drop is largely driven by Republicans. About 3 in 10 Republicans now say that legal immigration should be reduced, down from 45% in January.

About 3 in 10 U.S. adults say the number of legal immigrants to the U.S. should be increased “a lot” or “a little,” up slightly from January, when 24% of Americans wanted an increase in legal immigration.

“If you don’t have immigration as a culture, the culture will stagnate. You have to have that balance,” Steers said.

More see benefits from immigrants for economic growth and companies

Americans are more likely to see “major” benefits from people who come to the U.S. legally and less likely to see “major” risks, compared with an AP-NORC poll conducted early last year.

About 6 in 10 U.S. adults say a “major” benefit of immigrants in the country legally is that they contribute to economic growth, which went up from about 4 in 10 in March 2024. Similarly, 51% of U.S. adults say a “major” benefit of legal immigration is that American companies get the expertise of skilled workers in fields like science and technology, compared with 41% in March 2024.

Carlos Gonzalez, who was born in the U.S. to Panamanian parents, said immigrants “provide a lot to the economy of the United States.”

“They bring different ideas that help the economy,” said Gonzalez, 53, a Democrat from Waterbury, Connecticut, adding his mother served as a military nurse in Vietnam. “A lot of people don’t realize that when they do come over here, they try to enrich the country and not take away from it.”

Some of the perceived benefits are economic, but some are cultural, with about 46% saying a “major” benefit of legal immigrants is that they enrich American culture and values, up from 38% in the previous poll.

Shifting views don’t extend to immigrants in the country illegally

Jeff Witoszczak, of El Paso, Texas, identifies as a moderate Republican and supports Trump’s efforts to conduct large-scale deportations of people in the country illegally, saying he does not think the focus needs to be on those who have committed violent crimes. Witoszczak is married to a woman from Mexico who came to the U.S. legally when she was a child.

“Coming here illegally, that’s a crime in and of itself,” Witoszczak said. “They didn’t follow due process coming in. They don’t need due process going out.”

Americans tend to see greater risks — and smaller benefits — from immigrants who are in the country illegally, and these views largely haven’t shifted since last year.

About 4 in 10 U.S. adults now say it’s a major benefit that immigrants in the country illegally will take jobs Americans don’t want, up from about one-third last year. And 42% say that immigrants in the country illegally contribute to economic growth, and 32% believe that they enrich American culture and values. Those findings have remained steady since last year.

About half of U.S. adults say it’s a major risk that immigrants in the country illegally will burden welfare and safety net programs. Studies have shown that immigrants who work in the country illegally pay local, state and federal taxes and generally do not qualify for federal benefits.

The AP-NORC poll of 1,183 adults was conducted Sept. 11-15, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.",https://sanfernandosun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25262782616454-scaled-e1758748260116.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 18:57:11.944846

Sen. Ossoff is spearheading a new inquiry into numerous Federal courts’ reported failures to uphold Americans’ civil rights as they await a full trial.

According to a recent studyThis is an external link, in numerous Federal courts across the country, judges jail defendants without lawyers at initial appearance hearings, in violation of their civil rights.

“Ensuring that every person is afforded legal counsel at their first appearance before a federal judge is not only a statutory requirement—it is a foundational protection for our adversarial legal system,” wrote Sen. Ossoff. “Given the gravity of these findings, I urge the Judicial Conference to prioritize this issue as a matter of urgent concern and bring the offending district courts into compliance with federal law immediately to ensure that no individual is jailed without the benefit of legal representation at the outset of their case.”

According to the study, proceeding unrepresented at an initial appearance severely disadvantages defendants, leading to increased pretrial detention rates.

Sen. Ossoff continues working to ensure civil and human rights are safeguarded.

In May, Sens. Ossoff and Ted Cruz (R-TX) introduced the bipartisan Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Reauthorization Act to help secure justice for civil rights cold case victims and their families.

In 2024, President Biden signed into law Sen. Ossoff’s bipartisan Federal Prison Oversight Act, prison reform legislation to overhaul independent oversight of the Federal Bureau of Prison’s 122 facilities nationwide.

… The reclassification of Eduardo’s visa petition to the F1 category was therefore in error, as Carlos was not, by statute, an adult.
Appealed from a decision by O’Toole, J., in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.","Where a complaint was filed in U.S. District Court alleging that the reclassification of a parent’s petition for a visa on behalf of his son has unlawfully delayed the visa process, it was error to dismiss the complaint under the doctrine of consular nonreviewability.

Reversed and remanded.

“In this appeal, we confront a challenge to a judgment of dismissal in a suit against the U.S. Secretary of State and the Consul General of the U.S. Consulate in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It was brought in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The plaintiffs are a naturalized U.S. citizen and his noncitizen son. They are challenging the reclassification of the parent’s petition for a visa on behalf of his son. They allege that this reclassification has unlawfully delayed the visa process in their case.

“The merits of the claims hinge on whether the son, despite turning 21 years old during the visa process, must be treated as under ‘21 years of age’ and, therefore, a ‘child’ for purposes of the visa petition classification under the Child Status Protection Act (CSPA), Pub. L. No. 107-208, 116 Stat. 927 (2002). If so, then the reclassification of the visa petition would be unlawful, with the consequence that the son would be entitled to a much speedier resolution of whether he is entitled to a visa than if the reclassification were to remain in place.

“The District Court did not address whether the reclassification was lawful because it dismissed the complaint under the doctrine of consular nonreviewability. We first conclude that the District Court erred in doing so, at least given the arguments that the appellees have advanced, both below and to our Court, for concluding that the doctrine applies. We then address whether, as the plaintiffs allege, the reclassification of the visa petition is unlawful. We conclude that it is. We thus reverse the claims’ dismissal and remand for further consideration consistent with this decision. …

“The plaintiffs are Eduardo Teles de Menezes and his son, Carlos Eduardo Rodrigues Menezes. …

“… The doctrine of consular nonreviewability prohibits ‘judicial review of a consular officer’s denial of a visa.’ …

“If the appellees are right that the doctrine precludes review in this case, then our analysis is at an end. The appellants contend, however, that the doctrine has no application here for either of two reasons. First, they contend that their claims do not allege that a consular officer’s denial of a visa even occurred, let alone that any such denial was wrongful. Second, they contend that, in any event, their claims concern only the proper interpretation of the CSPA and therefore ‘do[] not implicate the independent judgment of [a] consular officer[].’ For the reasons we will explain, we agree with the appellants’ first contention and so do not address the second. …

“There remains to address whether appellants are right that the reclassification of the visa petition into the F1 category (adult sons and daughters of U.S. citizens) was unlawful. In their view, rather than reclassifying the petition into the F1 category, it should have been reclassified, upon Eduardo’s naturalization, into the ‘immediate relatives’ category (children of U.S. citizens). They contend that is so because Eduardo had become a U.S citizen and, under the CSPA, Carlos had to be treated as if he were under 21 years of age, notwithstanding that he had turned 21 during the visa process.

“Appellants’ contention turns, in the end, on the proper construction of a single phrase in 8 U.S.C. §1151(f)(2) — the provision of the CSPA that addresses the conversion of an F2A petition into an ‘immediate relatives’ petition. That phrase instructs that the determination of whether the noncitizen beneficiary satisfies the age requirement to be reclassified as an immediate relative ‘shall be made using the age of the alien on the date of the parent’s naturalization.’

“Appellants contend that ‘age,’ as used in §1151(f)(2), refers not to the beneficiary’s ‘biological age.’ Instead, they argue, ‘age’ refers to the ‘age’ of the noncitizen as determined by a formula that applies to all F2A beneficiaries, as set forth in §1153(h)(1). They contend that is so because §1153(h)(1), in setting out a formula to calculate the age of an F2A applicant, must be understood to interact with §1151(f)(2), which concerns potentially reclassifying an F2A applicant (based on their age) into an immediate relative applicant.

“The District Court did not address this issue given its reliance on the doctrine of consular nonreviewability to dismiss the claims. Nevertheless, the issue presents a question that ‘is purely a matter of statutory interpretation, and therefore, a question of law, which we can review in the first instance.’ … The parties have also fully briefed and argued this question. We thus proceed to address it. As we will explain, we agree with the appellants and so construe ‘age’ in §1151(f)(2) just as the only two circuits to have construed that term in §1151(f)(2) have. …

“In sum, we conclude that, ‘[i]n the case of a petition … initially filed’ in the F2A category, and ‘later converted, due to the naturalization of the parent, to a[n] [immediate relatives] petition,’ the ‘age of the [beneficiary] on the date of the parent’s naturalization,’ 8 U.S.C. §1151(f)(2), is the beneficiary’s ‘statutory age’ as provided in §1153(h)(1). Based on the allegations in the complaint, Carlos was a ‘child’ on the date of Eduardo’s naturalization because his statutory age was frozen at twenty. … The reclassification of Eduardo’s visa petition to the F1 category was therefore in error, as Carlos was not, by statute, an adult. We leave it to the District Court to determine the proper remedy on remand. …

“The judgment of the District Court is reversed, and this case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.”

Smith permanently blocked enforcement of the grant conditions, granting summary judgment to a coalition of states including Illinois, California, and New York.

The states sued in May, alleging the new strings attached to emergency-preparedness funds were illegal. The administration wanted grant recipients to certify they don’t “operate any program that benefits illegal immigrants or incentivizes illegal immigration” and promise to “honor requests for cooperation” in immigration enforcement.

The conditions were imposed to comply with an executive order calling for cutting funds to so-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions.

But in court, the administration “made no attempt to claim that it examined the relevant data or articulated a fact-based reason for its actions,” and gave no “actual explanation of why it is necessary to attach sweeping immigration conditions to all the grants at issue here,” Smith wrote, finding the conditions “arbitrary and capricious” in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act and unconstitutional under the spending clause.

The states risked losing billions in essential public-safety funding if they didn’t comply with “hopelessly vague” conditions that were unlawfully coercive, Smith wrote.

“Denying such funding if states refuse to comply with vague immigration requirements leaves them with no meaningful choice, particularly where state budgets are already committed,” he wrote.

CPC Member and Ranking Member of the House Rules Committee Rep. Jim McGovern (MA-02) joined as an original cosponsor.
“There was no legal justification for the Trump Administration’s military escalation in the Caribbean,” said Rep. Ilhan Omar, Deputy Chair of the Progressive Caucus.
For decades, successive administrations of both parties have expanded presidential war powers while Congress has abdicated its constitutional role.
We are proud to support Congresswoman Omar's War Powers Resolution to end these horrific attacks.""","WASHINGTON – Today, Rep. Ilhan Omar (MN-05) introduced a War Powers Resolution to terminate unauthorized U.S military hostilities against Venezuela and transnational criminal organizations that the Trump administration has unilaterally designated as foreign terrorist organizations. The resolution follows the administration’s repeated strikes on vessels in the southern Caribbean carried out without congressional authorization or clear legal justification.

Omar, who serves as Deputy Chair of the Progressive Caucus and Chair of its Peace & Security Taskforce, was joined by CPC Chair Rep. Greg Casar (TX-35) and CPC Whip Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García (IL-04). CPC Member and Ranking Member of the House Rules Committee Rep. Jim McGovern (MA-02) joined as an original cosponsor.

“There was no legal justification for the Trump Administration’s military escalation in the Caribbean,” said Rep. Ilhan Omar, Deputy Chair of the Progressive Caucus. “It was not self-defense or authorized by Congress. That is why I am introducing a resolution to terminate hostilities against Venezuela, and against the transnational criminal organizations that the Administration has designated as terrorists this year. All of us should agree that the separation of powers is crucial to our democracy, and that only Congress has the power to declare war.”

“Donald Trump cannot be allowed to drag the United States into another endless war with his reckless actions,” said Rep. Greg Casar, Chair of the Progressive Caucus. “It is illegal for the president to take the country to war without consulting the people's representatives, and Congress must vote now to stop Trump from putting us at further risk.”

“The extrajudicial strike against a vessel in the Caribbean Sea is only the most recent of Trump’s reckless, deadly, and illegal military actions. Now, he’s lawlessly threatening a region already profoundly impacted by the destabilization of U.S. actions,” said Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García, the Whip of the Progressive Caucus. “With this War Powers Resolution, we emphasize the total illegality of his action, and—consistent with overwhelming public opposition to forever war—reclaim Congress’ sole power to authorize military action.”

“The people that I represent are sick and tired of this country being dragged into one endless war after another,” said Rep. Jim McGovern. “Trump’s reckless, unlawful, and extrajudicial strikes were in flagrant violation of both international and U.S. law. And his military escalation in the Caribbean—a region already destabilized by decades of U.S. intervention—threatens to release even more chaos and violence at our doorstep. Only Congress has the power to declare war, and we must stand up for the constitutional separation of powers before it is too late.”

The War Powers Resolution directs the President to withdraw U.S. Armed Forces from hostilities against Venezuela and against transnational criminal organizations unless explicitly authorized by Congress. It makes clear that the President retains the ability to respond to sudden attacks or imminent threats, but stresses that the trafficking of illegal drugs does not itself constitute an armed attack.

For decades, successive administrations of both parties have expanded presidential war powers while Congress has abdicated its constitutional role. Rep. Omar’s resolution reasserts Article I authority, making clear that neither the 2001 nor the 2002 Authorizations for Use of Military Force provide legal cover for new conflicts in Latin America. It underscores that a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) designation, as defined by U.S. law, does not authorize the use of military force, contrary to recent claims from the Trump Administration and some Members of Congress.

""The Trump administration has appointed itself judge, jury, and executioner, in a series of blatantly illegal strikes,"" said Sara Haghdoosti, Executive Director of Win Without War. ""People struggling through the overdose crisis need healthcare, not warfare. We're proud to support Representative Omar's resolution to stop these strikes and we urge her colleagues to join her.""

""We abhor the recent unlawful strikes on Venezuelan boats, which have killed more than a dozen people,"" said Lauren Brownlee, the Friends Committee on National Legislation's Deputy General Secretary. ""As Quakers, we share the conviction that all creation has worth and dignity. Those suspected of crimes deserve due process, not summary execution. We are proud to support Congresswoman Omar's War Powers Resolution to end these horrific attacks.""

""It could not be more clear that Americans across the political spectrum do not want to fight and fund another war,"" said Dylan Williams, Vice President of Center for International Policy Advocacy. ""Trump's illegal, extra-judicial killings off the coast of Venezuela are an unauthorized and unconstitutional use of military force that put our servicemembers at risk. Lawmakers have a duty to stand up for their voters and their prerogatives to prevent another unnecessary and costly war of choice.""

""The President is claiming the authority to kill people outside of armed conflict and without due process,"" said Annie Shiel, US Director for the Center for Civilians in Conflict. ""The recent airstrikes in the Caribbean are unlawful executions during peacetime, not war. Rep. Omar's leadership in forcing an end to these unlawful strikes is sorely needed. Everyone else in the House should join her.""

""The Trump administration appears intent on dragging the United States into war with Venezuela. Between the extrajudicial killings of Venezuelan citizens, the threat of drone strikes on Venezuelan soil, and the amassing of military equipment in the region, Trump has given lie to his claims of being 'anti-war' and aligned himself decisively with the neoconservative camp,"" said Alex Main, Director of International Policy at the Center for Economic and Policy Research. ""This follows years of efforts to enact regime change in Venezuela by other means, including through broad economic sanctions that have devastated the Venezuelan economy and fueled a humanitarian crisis, triggering the migration of millions of Venezuelans. We must be clear: a war with Venezuela would be catastrophic for both the people of Venezuela and the United States, while doing nothing to solve the drug crisis in our nation.""

“The American people, across the political spectrum, don’t want their tax dollars funding unauthorized regime change wars overseas,” said Erik Sperling, executive director of Just Foreign Policy. “Americans are grateful to Rep. Omar and others in Congress who insist on upholding the Constitution — war must be authorized by Congress after a debate and vote, not unilaterally dictated by the same neocon zealots responsible for peddling one disastrous regime change after another.”

Ismael Ayala-Uribe was transferred Sunday from the Adelanto ICE Processing Center to a regional hospital for surgery on an abscess on his buttock, according to an ICE statement.

Hospital staff found him unresponsive and “initiated lifesaving measures” but he was declared dead around 2:30 a.m. Monday, the statement said. The cause of death is under investigation.

In addition to the abscess, Ayala-Uribe suffered from hypertension and tachycardia, an abnormally fast heart rate, according to ICE.

Federal records show that more than a dozen people have died in immigration detention since January, when immigration officials began to implement President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda.

His family said Ayala-Uribe had high blood pressure but was otherwise healthy. His brother told the Los Angeles Times that Ayala-Uribe got sick with a cough and a fever shortly after he arrived at the Adelanto facility on Aug. 22.

Mexico’s Foreign Relations Department offered its condolences to the man’s family and said the Mexican Consulate in San Bernardino would follow up with authorities at the immigration detention center to ensure a thorough investigation to “fully clarify” the cause of the death. Mexican officials are in contact with the family to offer legal assistance and other help.

Mexico also reiterated its commitment to protect and defend the human rights of Mexicans abroad.

According to ICE, Ayala-Uribe entered the United States at an unknown date and location. He applied for, and received, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals protection in 2012. In 2016, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services denied his application to renew his DACA status.

On September 12, Louisiana-based immigration judge Jamee Comans ruled that foreign-born activist-agitator Mahmoud Khalil can be removed to either Algeria or Syria due to material omissions on his green card application. Although the decision will be appealed – further dragging out what should be a simple and quick process – the immigration judge’s ruling is consistent with America’s national interests, national security, and the law.

Khalil, of Palestinian origin, was born in Syria and raised between there and Lebanon. He also holds Algerian citizenship. In 2024, as a graduate student at Columbia University, he became a leading organizer of pro-Palestinian/anti-Israel protests and campus encampments that followed the October 7, 2023 Hamas terrorist attacks. This, according to DHS, created a climate of harassment and intimidation toward Jewish students at Columbia.

Originally arriving in the U.S. on a student visa in 2022 and obtaining a green card in 2024, Khalil was taken into custody by ICE in March at his apartment. The arrest was, as DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin explained, “in support of President Trump’s executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism” because Khalil had “led activities aligned [with] Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.”

On March 10, referring to Khalil and others, President Trump warned in a Truth Social post that “[i]f you support terrorism, including the slaughtering of innocent men, women, and children, your presence is contrary to our national and foreign policy interests, and you are not welcome here.” The president was referring to Section 237(a)(1)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which states that “[a]n alien whose presence or activities in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States is deportable.” From the moment of his arrest, however, anti-borders activists turned Khalil into a martyr and a symbol of an alleged attack against free speech.

The pro-Palestinian activist spent about three months in ICE custody in Louisiana until federal district judge Michael Farbiarz ordered his release on bail on June 20. But the litigation was far from over, with Judge Comans’ being the most recent chapter in the saga.

Rejecting three motions from Khalil’s lawyer, Judge Comans ruled that the activist intentionally committed fraud in his green card application by omitting important information about his political associations, thus rendering him deportable. Khalil specifically left out his work for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA) and Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD). As FAIR pointed out previously: “By its own admission, UNRWA employees participated in the Hamas attacks of Oct. 7 and that the terror group used UNRWA facilities in Gaza to hold hostages who were taken captive in those attacks. CUAD was one of the leading groups behind the violent takeover of Hamilton Hall on Columbia’s campus last year as well as engaging in activities that denied Jewish students access to parts of the campus.”

“The evidence shows the Respondent knew of the potential immigration consequences for his involvement in protests organized by varying organizations on campus, including CUAD,” emphasized Judge Comans. Moreover, “[t]he waiver [requested by Khalil’s legal team] was not designed to reward a lack of candor by applicants admitted as immigrant visa holders who then intentionally engage in dishonesty by misrepresenting facts in the application process to adjust status, post entry.”

She further emphasized the foreign policy argument as well, stating that “[a]s previously found by this Court, the Immigration Judge lacks authority to question foreign policy determinations made by the U.S. Secretary of State,” but “[t]he Court finds this factor alone outweighs the positive equities in the Respondent’s case [such as Khalil having a young child], and the Court denies the waiver as a matter of discretion on that basis.” Other negative factors working against Khalil included in Judge Comans’ ruling were the fact that he holds no property or business interests in the U.S. and had held no other employment other than internships.

Khalil was thus ordered deported to Syria, where he emigrated from in 2022, or to Algeria, where he also holds citizenship due to his mother’s descent from anti-French revolutionaries in that country. The law (INA Section 241) makes it clear that the U.S. government has many options when it comes to removing deportable aliens, who cannot only be sent back to countries in which they hold citizenship or have previously resided but also to other nations willing to accept them.",https://www.fairus.org/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/images/iStock-691789288.jpg.webp?itok=hRgeex2A,N,,2025-09-24 16:58:08.090278

As of September 15, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) confirmed that no individuals remain detained in provincial correctional facilities. Ontario had historically held the largest number of immigration detainees in provincial jails, drawing intensified scrutiny after a 2023 coroner’s inquest into the 2015 death of Abdurahman Hassan revealed concerning conditions within these facilities.

Human rights advocates welcomed the decision as a major victory. Samer Muscati, Disability Rights Deputy Director at Human Rights Watch, emphasized that Ontario’s move upholds the dignity and rights of people seeking safety in Canada and increases pressure on the federal government to end the broader system of rights-violating immigration detention. Similarly, Ketty Nivyabandi, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada’s English-speaking section, noted that migrants deserve respect and safety, not incarceration, as they build new lives in Canada.

British Columbia had been the first province to end its immigration detention contract with the CBSA, setting an example for other provinces. The #WelcomeToCanada campaign, launched by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International Canada in October 2021, alongside advocates, legal experts, healthcare providers, faith leaders, and people with lived experience, has consistently pushed for the closure of immigration detention facilities in provincial jails. More than 30,000 Canadians have written directly to authorities in support of this cause.

The practice of using provincial jails for immigration detention has been widely criticized for violating international human rights standards and harming mental health. Reports have highlighted that racialized individuals, particularly Black men, face harsher conditions and longer confinement periods, while people with disabilities experience systemic discrimination throughout the detention process. In recent years, UN bodies including the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention have called on Canada to end immigration detention entirely and respect the rights of detainees.

Despite provincial progress, the federal government has moved in the opposite direction, opening a temporary designated immigrant detention facility in a federal prison at Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines, Quebec, in July 2025. Advocates urge Ottawa to follow the provinces’ lead by abolishing immigration detention, halting its expansion into federal prisons, and scaling up humane, community-based alternatives that respect human rights and Canada’s international obligations.",https://news.fundsforngos.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cropped-icon-32x32.png,N,,2025-09-24 16:57:36.402718

Trump administration fires immigration judges, even as it seeks to hire more of them

The Trump administration fired nearly 20 immigration judges this month, following the dismissal of more than 80 judges earlier this year.

The dismissals come as the administration is seeking to add immigration judges by filling jobs with up to 600 military attorneys. The current backlog in the courts is nearly 4 million cases, NPR reports in its article on the latest firings.

Matt Biggs, the president of the union that represents immigration judges, said in a statement to NPR the dismissal of more judges “is an illogical and costly setback for the nation’s immigration courts.”

“At a time when the backlog has reached historic levels and the administration has made immigration enforcement a central issue, the removal of experienced judges is hypocritical, undermines the law, wastes taxpayer dollars and further delays justice for citizens and immigrants alike,” said Biggs, who is the president of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers.

The number of departing immigration judges swells when the dismissals are combined with voluntary resignations. The loss was more than 125 immigration judges in the last nine months, down from 700 judges at the start of the year, according to NPR.

In San Francisco, seven immigration judges have been fired as of Sept. 11, amounting to about one-third of the judges there, the San Francisco Chronicle reports.

Immigration judges preside in courts overseen by the Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review. They decide whether noncitizens accused of violating immigration laws should be removed or granted protection from removal.

San Francisco immigration courts grant relief to immigrants in 71% of the cases, one of the highest rates among the nation’s largest courts, the article says.

Five of the seven judges fired in San Francisco grant relief at higher rates than their colleagues. One fired judge had the lowest rate of granting relief in the court.

Sirce Owen, the acting director of the Executive Office for Immigration Review, said in an August memo “statistically improbable outcome metrics” could indicate bias or failure to adhere to the law, warranting “close examination and potential action.”

Executive Office for Immigration Review leadership has also criticized judges for failing to manage their caseloads efficiently, according to NPR.

The suspect has been identified by a law enforcement official as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn. The official could not publicly disclose details of the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

The exact motivation for the attack was not immediately known. The head of the FBI, Kash Patel, released a photo on social media that shows a bullet found at the scene with the words “ANTI-ICE” written in what appears to be marker.

The attack is the latest public, targeted killing in the U.S. and comes two weeks after conservative leader Charlie Kirk was killed by a rifle-wielding shooter on a roof.

“The shooter fired indiscriminately at the ICE building, including at a van in the sallyport where the victims were shot,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a release about the Dallas shooting.

The detainee who survived was in critical condition at a hospital, DHS said.

No ICE agents were injured.

‘Targeted violence’

At a news conference earlier in the day, authorities gave few details about the shooting and did not release the names of the victims or the gunman.

The FBI said it was investigating the shooting as “an act of targeted violence.”

Officers responded to a call to assist an officer on North Stemmons Freeway around 6:40 a.m. Wednesday and determined that someone opened fire at a government building from an adjacent building, Dallas police spokesperson Officer Jonathen E. Maner said in an email.

Edwin Cardona, an immigrant from Venezuela, said he was entering the ICE building with his son for an appointment around 6:20 a.m. when he heard gunshots.

An agent gathered people who were inside, took them to a more secure area and explained that there was an active shooter, Cardona said.

“I was afraid for my family because my family was outside. I felt terrible because I thought something could happen to them. Thank God no,” Cardona said.

Cardona said his family was brought into the building, and they were later reunited.

The ICE facility is along Interstate 35 East, just southwest of Dallas Love Field, a large commercial airport serving the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, and blocks from hotels catering to travelers.

Officials call for end to political violence

Shortly after the shooting and before officials said at least one victim was a detainee, Vice President JD Vance posted on the social platform X that “the obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop.”

Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz from Texas continued in that direction, calling for an end to politically motivated violence.

“To every politician who is using rhetoric demonizing ICE and demonizing CPB: stop,” Cruz told reporters, referencing Customs and Border Protection.

The Rev. Ashley Anne Sipe, who prays outside of the Dallas ICE facility every Monday, called the shooting heartbreaking.

“Violence doesn’t heal anything,” Sipe, a pastor in Lewisville near Dallas, told AP.

Sipe and other local faith leaders who have decried deportations hold weekly vigils and serve as “moral witnesses.” They pray and observe for about three hours, watching as immigrants enter the building to meet with advisers and to report for check-ins.

Over the past couple of months, Sipe said she has noticed that people who walk into the building are shuttled away on buses.

“They’re taking them away, and we don’t know where they’re taking them,” Sipe said.

Noem: ICE agents targeted

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem noted a recent uptick in targeting of ICE agents.

Attackers dressed in black military-style clothing opened fire July 4 outside the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, southwest of Dallas, federal prosecutors said. One police officer was injured. At least 11 people have been charged in connection with the attack.

Days later, a man with an assault rifle fired dozens of rounds at federal agents leaving a U.S. Border Patrol facility in McAllen on July 7. The man, identified as Ryan Louis Mosqueda, injured a police officer who responded to the scene before authorities shot and killed him. Police later found other weaponry, ammunition and backpacks inside Mosqueda’s car.

In suburban Chicago, federal authorities erected a fence around an immigration processing center after tensions recently flared with protesters. President Donald Trump’s administration has stepped up immigration enforcement in the Chicago area, resulting in hundreds of arrests.

Ahead of the latest immigration operation, federal officials boarded up windows at the center.

Sixteen people have been arrested outside the center, according to federal authorities who characterized the activists as “rioters.”

The report by Georgetown Law’s Center on Privacy and Technology is based on data released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection in February. The data came from forms that immigration agents fill out when they send genetic information to an F.B.I. database of convicted criminals, missing persons and evidence from crime scenes.

The report’s authors argued that border agents were exceeding their authority with the collections, accusing them of violating U.S. citizens’ rights under the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures.

The report analyzed data from October 2020 to December 2024, a period covering a few months of the first Trump administration and most of the Biden administration. The researchers found that of the 2,000 Americans subjected to cheek swabs agents from Customs and Border Protection, more than 800 were not arrested or charged with a crime at the time.

Law enforcement officers in the United States are allowed to collect DNA from citizens arrested in connection with serious crimes.

The Georgetown report said that federal agents sending genetic information to the F.B.I. had provided “legally questionable, nonsensical, or altogether absent” justifications for collecting DNA samples.

Neither U.S. Customs and Border Protection nor the F.B.I. responded to requests for comment overnight.

A February directive from U.S. Customs and Border Protection said that federal agencies are required to collect DNA samples from Americans who were under arrest, facing charges or convicted, and from noncitizens in U.S. detention. The directive said that DNA collection by agency was a “routine booking measure parallel to fingerprinting.”

The authors of the Georgetown report said that data on DNA collection by U.S. Customs and Border Protection during Mr. Trump’s second term was not yet available. They said they expected it to “reveal an even broader and more reckless approach” because of the Trump administration’s immigration policies.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/24/multimedia/24xp-dna-kfzc/24xp-dna-kfzc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 16:57:15.352095

What is the H-1B visa?
Typically, the initial duration of an H-1B visa classification is three years but may be extended up to six.
The current annual statutory cap is 65,000 visas, with 20,000 additional visas for foreign professionals who graduate with a master’s degree or doctorate from a U.S. institution of higher learning.
H-1B workers are often in the mathematics, engineering, technology, and medical science fields, ranging from software engineers and doctors to architects and financial analysts.","President Donald Trump announced that his administration will impose a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa petitions. The new fee went into effect as of September 21, 2025, and will greatly impact employers’ ability to secure the highly educated foreign workers who come to the United States on the H-1B visa.

Employers will now be required to pay a one-time $100,000 fee per new petition. Previously, it cost employers between $2,000 to $5,000 per petition, depending on the size of the employer.

What is the H-1B visa?

The H-1B visa category allows employers to petition for highly educated foreign professionals to temporarily work in “specialty occupations.” These jobs require at least a bachelor’s degree or the equivalent and include positions like civil engineers, software developers, and researchers. Typically, the initial duration of an H-1B visa classification is three years but may be extended up to six.

Since creating the visa program in 1990, Congress has limited the number of H-1Bs made available each year. The current annual statutory cap is 65,000 visas, with 20,000 additional visas for foreign professionals who graduate with a master’s degree or doctorate from a U.S. institution of higher learning.

Who are H-1B workers?

H-1B workers are often in the mathematics, engineering, technology, and medical science fields, ranging from software engineers and doctors to architects and financial analysts. The majority, however, (nearly 65%) had computer-related jobs as of 2023 data.

Over 70% of H-1B visa holders are Indian citizens. Though the move could lead to issues for U.S. businesses with Indian ties, the impact extends beyond the financial.

India’s Ministry of External Affairs issued a response to President Trump’s new fee, stating that the measure will likely have “humanitarian consequences by way of the disruption caused for families.” The statement went on to say that the Indian government “hopes that these disruptions can be addressed suitably by the U.S. authorities.”

In the immediate aftermath of the fee announcement, families were left behind as H-1B visa holders scrambled to reach the United States before the fee went into effect, fearing they would be locked out of the country. Though the White House later clarified that the fee would not apply to existing visa holders, confusion had already gripped visa holders, their families, and the companies that employ them.

Some have canceled their plans to return to their home countries, believing that even a vacation is too risky right now.

How will U.S companies be impacted?

Some of the largest tech companies and top banks in the U.S. will be hit particularly hard by the change.

Amazon was the biggest sponsor of H-1B workers for fiscal year 2025, employing over 10,000 people with the visa, followed by other household names like Microsoft, Meta, Apple, Google, Cognizant Technology Solutions, JPMorgan Chase, and Walmart.

Economists are already sounding the alarm that the astronomical fee will likely hurt the U.S. economy, resulting in a “brain drain” of qualified workers moving to other countries and slower economic growth overall.

Do H-1B workers take jobs from Americans?

No, they do not take jobs from U.S. workers. Before an employer can file a petition with USCIS, they must take specific steps to ensure that hiring an H-1B worker will not harm U.S. workers.

Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson thanked the Dallas Police Department for its quick response to the shooting and urged people to “exercise a little bit of restraint” as authorities continued their investigation.

“Let’s be patient, let’s remain calm and let’s let our law enforcement partners, our police department do their job,” he said, adding there were “lots of unanswered questions” in the active investigation.

Here’s the latest on what we know.

Where and when did the Dallas shooting happen?

The Dallas Police Department responded to a call to assist an officer at the facility at about 6:40 a.m. local time, according to a social media post.

The preliminary investigation showed that a person had opened fire “from an adjacent building,” the post said. DHS later said a sniper “fired indiscriminately” from a nearby rooftop toward the ICE building, including at a van in a secured entryway where the victims were shot.

It is not yet clear if the suspect had an intended target.

Live news footage of the scene showed a phalanx of emergency vehicles around the facility, which sits alongside Interstate 35 East and is surrounded by restaurants and hotels.

What do we know about the suspect?

Authorities didn’t provide details about the suspect in Wednesday morning’s briefing and law enforcement is still working to isolate a motive for the shooting.

FBI Director Kash Patel posted a photo on X that he said were the unused bullet casings recovered at the scene. “ANTI-ICE” can be seen in blue writing on one of the casings in the photo.

“While the investigation is ongoing, an initial review of the evidence shows an idealogical [sic] motive behind this attack,” wrote Patel, who previously faced criticism for how he provided updates to the ongoing investigation into the killing of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk.

Authorities did not provide additional details about the weapon used in the attack.

With no motive yet determined, officials claim attack was fueled by hatred of ICE

Before Wednesday’s briefing on the shooting, Noem took to social media to acknowledge that details were still emerging, adding “we know that our ICE law enforcement is facing unprecedented violence against them.”

Noem claimed in a later statement without providing evidence that this “vile attack was motivated by hatred for ICE.”

The shooting in Dallas, she added, ought to be a “wake-up call to the far-left that their rhetoric about ICE has consequences.”

Vice President JD Vance echoed the homeland security secretary’s sentiments.

“The obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop,” Vance wrote on X. “I’m praying for everyone hurt in this attack and for their families.”

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, also called for a stop to rhetoric “demonizing ICE” and other immigration enforcement agencies.

“Violence is wrong,” the senator said. “Politically motivated violence is wrong.”

“We should not be putting language out there that inspires madmen,” he added.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/09/2025-09-24T155217Z_1447950275_RC2EYGANYO1I_RTRMADP_3_USA-SHOOTING-ICE-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 15:57:04.340570

The Justice Department's attorneys described Abrego Garcia's claims as ""procedurally barred and meritless – even unserious.""

Abrego Garcia, who sued the government in Maryland in August to prevent his deportation to Uganda, now faces potential removal to Eswatini. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) intends to pursue this course of action.

emphasized that immigration law restricts district court judges' authority to review deportation decisions.

Abrego Garcia is part of a nationwide class action certified in Massachusetts, where a preliminary injunction was granted to halt deportations to third countries.

Although the Supreme Court stayed this injunction, it maintained an order requiring DHS to offer class members a chance to seek protection under the Convention Against Torture.

Abrego Garcia has accused the government of violating the law by not honoring his request to be deported to Costa Rica, a country initially offered by the Trump administration in exchange for a guilty plea in his human smuggling case in Tennessee. He has expressed fear of torture or persecution in over 20 countries where the U.S. might deport him. The DOJ claims this indicates ""gamesmanship"" on his part.

The Trump administration argues that Abrego Garcia did not designate Costa Rica as his preferred destination in a timely manner, allowing the government to disregard his choice. Abrego Garcia's attorneys announced his intention to seek asylum in the U.S., although a previous asylum petition was denied due to his extended stay in the country.

Despite a final order of removal, Abrego Garcia remained in the U.S. due to a withholding granted by an immigration judge, barring deportation to El Salvador because of gang violence threats. He was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, where he claimed torture in CECOT prison, before being returned to the U.S. to face federal charges related to a migrant smuggling scheme. He has pleaded not guilty.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, who temporarily blocked Abrego Garcia's removal in August, will hear the government's motion for dismissal. Xinis has criticized the Trump administration's handling of the case but acknowledged her jurisdictional limits over immigration matters.

In Tennessee, Abrego Garcia's attorneys have requested the dismissal of criminal charges against him, citing vindictive prosecution.

Federal dollars to help Northwest tribes bolster their infrastructure against the increasing threats from wildfire, drought and sea-level rise could also be slashed.
In 2024, Clean Air Act related funds were used to fund 15 projects for 12 Northwest tribes.
Of the $20.15 billion in federal funding that went to tribes between 2010 and 2024, tribes within the boundaries of Idaho received a total of $304.56 million, Washington tribes $1.81 billion, Oregon tribes $690.76 million, and Alaska Native tribes received $2.35 billion.
In 2024, Native American tribes received just 1.7% of federal energy and environment spending, despite Native people making up 2.9% of the U.S. population.","A new report from Portland State University found that budget cuts under President Donald Trump’s new spending bill threaten nearly half of federal funding allocated to federally recognized Native American and Alaska Native nations last year.

Roughly $530 million of the $1.19 billion allocated to Northwest tribal nations in fiscal year 2024 — used to fulfill the federal government’s trust and treaty obligations to Native American and Alaska Native tribes — is at risk of being cut. The congressionally allocated funds serve myriad functions for tribes in the Northwest, including providing clean drinking water, affordable housing, schools, transit and land management. Funding is decided by Congress on a yearly basis and can be disbursed over a period of time that exceeds the calendar year it is allocated.

“All across the board tribes are worried about the funding cuts that are happening right now,” said Serina Fast Horse, who is Lakota and Blackfeet and serves as the co-director of the Northwest Environmental Justice Center, which provides grant application assistance and advising to Indigenous communities in the Northwest.

Fast Horse says there are serious concerns among Northwest tribes about further cuts to vital programs ranging from health and wellness to early childhood education. The report warns of vulnerabilities to programs and grants that tribes rely on for resilience in the face of climate change, like improving home weatherization, managing forestland and renovating aging homes. Federal dollars to help Northwest tribes bolster their infrastructure against the increasing threats from wildfire, drought and sea-level rise could also be slashed.

The Portland State report found millions in Clean Air Act funding could also go away — the Environmental Protection Agency earmarked nearly $2 million in 2024 for Northwest tribes in a series of grants for monitoring air quality and pollution. Much of the congressionally allocated funding has yet to be distributed to tribes and is now at risk of being cut altogether.

The report demonstrates how proposed major reductions across the federal government, including at the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of the Interior and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, could reverberate across Indian Country.

Tribal officials shared concerns that drastic cuts could cause the federal government to fall short of trust and treaty obligations that mandate the federal government support tribal services, uphold tribal sovereignty and protect tribal treaty resources — responsibilities that courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, have repeatedly upheld.

“All the funding reductions addressing clean water, air and dealing with climate change have impacts on the Tribes’ culture and treaty protected resources,” said William E. Ray Jr., chair of the Klamath Tribes.

Researchers declined to disclose specific projects at risk of elimination for fear of retaliation, and a number of tribes and tribal organizations declined to comment to InvestigateWest, citing similar concerns.

“Trump and Congressional Republicans are wreaking havoc on Tribal communities with their ‘Big, Ugly BETRAYAL’ of a law that arbitrarily cuts many programs supporting folks in Indian Country, where chronic underfunding is already impacting services and exacerbating disparities,” said Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat.

He added that the federal government plays an outsized role in funding essential services to tribal communities, including health care, education and public safety, and that the Inflation Reduction Act took important steps in advancing funding for water infrastructure and environmental programs for tribes.

In 2024, Clean Air Act related funds were used to fund 15 projects for 12 Northwest tribes. The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, and the Tulalip Tribes are some of the Native American nations set to receive research grants for improving air quality and pollution monitoring. Among 12 tribes selected for funding, several of them focus on minimizing exposure to poor air quality and harmful pollutants to their elderly and medically vulnerable residents. Other tribes intend to study impacts of pollutants on important first foods — culturally significant staple foods consumed before colonization — that officials say are critical to improving health outcomes for their citizens.

Researchers at PSU examined 469 programs impacted by President Trump’s reversal of former President Joe Biden’s Executive Order 14008, which sought to address climate change and created a number of environmental justice initiatives. Sixty of the programs identified by researchers were specifically named in the Republican-led spending bill for cuts, and 17 of those provided funding directly to tribes. The programs accounted for roughly 35% of all federal investments in tribes in 2024. The report says not all of the funding will be cut, but a significant portion of it could be.

The cuts come at a time when Native Americans and Alaska Natives already have limited access to federal services and funds, according to a December 2024 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog. It found when tribes had to compete with other entities for federal funding, they may receive a small portion of the total amount, and that limited access to federal services and funds contributes to known disparities for Native Americans and Alaska Natives compared to other Americans.

Of the $20.15 billion in federal funding that went to tribes between 2010 and 2024, tribes within the boundaries of Idaho received a total of $304.56 million, Washington tribes $1.81 billion, Oregon tribes $690.76 million, and Alaska Native tribes received $2.35 billion.

Other programs at risk of being cut include the EPA’s embattled Environmental Justice Government-to-Government Program, which funded initiatives by states, tribes and local governments to support activities that lead to measurable environmental or public health impacts.

Under that program, in 2023, the EPA awarded the Tulalip Tribes $977,000 to work in conjunction with the Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakama Nation to create a tool to detect which homes are at greatest risk from wildfire smoke infiltration and dangerously hot weather, which are growing issues affecting both communities.

While the federal government has repeatedly affirmed its obligations to tribes, actual allocations remain disproportionately small compared to population figures. In 2024, Native American tribes received just 1.7% of federal energy and environment spending, despite Native people making up 2.9% of the U.S. population.

Between 2010 and 2024, tribes within the bounds of Idaho, Washington and Oregon received roughly $2.81 billion in federal investments in energy and environmental infrastructure, which represents roughly 14% of the $20 billion in allocations made to tribes nationwide.

The researchers determined that programs funded under the Inflation Reduction Act, Biden’s 2022 climate, health and tax law, are at particular risk of being eliminated. The funding allocated to tribes under the IRA represented a historic investment in infrastructure in Indian Country, more than doubling energy and infrastructure investment from $1.51 billion nationwide to $3.94 billion in 2024, around .04% of total federal grant spending obligations for 2024.

“When you put them in the context of how much money the federal government actually spends on certain things, it’s pennies on the dollar,” said Sophie Lalande, a co-author of the PSU report.

Soon after taking office and without consulting Congress, the Trump administration suspended some grants that tribal communities used heavily, such as community change grants, distributed by the EPA's Offices of Environmental Justice and of External Civil Rights Compliance during the Biden administration, to support climate resilience and clean energy. Distributed as a part of the Inflation Reduction Act, the grants were suspended as part of the Trump administration's anti-diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.

The grants helped tribal communities in the Northwest tremendously, according to Fast Horse.

“They were providing hundreds of thousands of dollars to communities for infrastructure improvements, like access to clean drinking water and climate resilience hubs, just really essential pieces of community development for health and safety of communities,” she said.

The report stresses a multiplier effect from investments made in tribal communities. Infrastructure dollars invested on tribal lands often serve as anchors for broader local development, since tribal lands often share regional infrastructure like power grids, roads or water systems with non-Native communities, with the power of dollars rippling outward into surrounding rural towns and cities.

Bobby Cochran, a researcher with Portland State University and senior project manager at the National Policy Consensus Center, co-authored the report.

Following his Tuesday speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Trump declared that Ukraine could regain land lost to Russia, suggesting that Moscow was actually a “paper tiger.” The shift in perspective surprised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and drew ire from Russia.

The permit limits the number of detainees Ice can hold at the facility each day to fewer than 15, and the duration for which they can be held, to less than 12 hours.
A small group of Portland residents have protested outside the Ice facility for more than 100 consecutive days, and an online petition calling on the city to revoke a permit has garnered nearly 18,000 signatures since February.
According to Portland’s mayor, Keith Wilson, the city opened a preliminary investigation in July after it received multiple formal complaints about potential violations at the facility.
In August 2011, a hearings officer initially denied the local conditional use credential needed for Ice to operate its facility.","Portland authorities are in a standoff with Donald Trump’s administration over an Ice detention facility in the Oregon city, after an investigation found the administration is using the facility for overnight detentions, in violation of its city-issued permits.

The standoff comes amid threats from Donald Trump to dispatch troops to the city, and residents protesting nightly outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) field office in question.

The city office that oversees land use and zoning notified the owner of the building that Ice leases on 18 September that the federal agency had violated a conditional use permit approved in 2011. The permit limits the number of detainees Ice can hold at the facility each day to fewer than 15, and the duration for which they can be held, to less than 12 hours. The permit also bars the agency from “housing” anyone overnight.

But Ice data the city obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request, included in the official notice, shows 25 instances since January in which Ice held a person for more than 12 hours. On 26 January alone, agents held 16 people – listed as citizens of Venezuela, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico and other countries – for over 27 hours before transferring them, according to public records obtained by Street Roots and the Guardian.

The city’s notice also said the building was illegally altered when exterior windows were boarded up without proper approval. An Ice spokesperson did not respond to a question asking when the wood was installed, but photos and video taken at protests and posted on social media show the boarded up windows first appeared around 16 June.

The field office in southwest Portland sits two blocks from the Willamette river, across the street from an affordable housing complex and next door to a K-8 school that moved in August, citing the dangers of federal agents’ response to protests with teargas and pepper balls as the reason for the move.

A small group of Portland residents have protested outside the Ice facility for more than 100 consecutive days, and an online petition calling on the city to revoke a permit has garnered nearly 18,000 signatures since February.

According to Portland’s mayor, Keith Wilson, the city opened a preliminary investigation in July after it received multiple formal complaints about potential violations at the facility. The city sent official notice after substantiating those complaints.

Wilson said in a video statement last week that Ice has the opportunity to remedy the infractions before penalties are imposed, but placed the responsibility squarely at the feet of the federal government.

“We must remember this review was triggered by the federal government breaking promises to our community regarding the detention of human beings,” Wilson said.

The building’s landlord has 30 days to correct the violations, but if it fails to comply, the city will assess a monthly fee. Ice is allowed to continue operations as the process continues.

While the city cannot simply revoke any permit outright, the notice of violation is the first step in a process that could provide some level of accountability for the federal government’s operations in Portland.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, said the mayor’s claim was based solely on records obtained by the city without an effort to verify facts with Ice, and claimed without evidence that the mayor is preventing Ice agents from removing criminals.

“Another day, another sanctuary politician attempting to prevent the brave men and women of ICE from removing the worst of the worst, including rapists, murderers, pedophiles, and gang members from the U.S.,” McLaughlin said in an email. “Mayor Wilson’s claims of substandard conditions at ICE facilities are categorically FALSE. All detainees receive proper meals, medical care, and access to family and legal counsel.”

DHS declined to offer evidence to substantiate McLaughlin’s claims.

Federal immigration data made available by Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (Trac) shows that, as of 7 September, over 70% of Ice detainees have no criminal conviction, and many who do were convicted of minor offenses, including traffic violations.

The Portland mayor’s office declined to respond to McLaughlin’s comments.

In August 2011, a hearings officer initially denied the local conditional use credential needed for Ice to operate its facility. But the city council adjudicated the matter on appeal, and unanimously approved it despite concerns raised in public testimony during the initial hearing. Local residents worried about the possibility that immigration-related protests could occur in the neighborhood, and that the safety plan – including how many and for how long people can be detained – might not be enforceable.

The local land use investigation is not the first time Portland has clashed with the second Trump administration, and at times Wilson has uneasily acceded to Trump’s demands.

In July, Wilson issued an executive order directing city employees to align with Trump’s executive order revoking federal diversity, equity and inclusion policies, preserving $380m in federal funding that could have been at risk if city policy did not align with Trump’s new reading of federal anti-discrimination laws.

Portland was among dozens of sanctuary jurisdictions – including the state of Oregon – that received letters from the US justice department in August, threatening federal action if it did not alter its sanctuary policies.

Earlier this month, Trump told reporters he was considering sending the national guard to Portland, citing a TV news report which mixed images from the city’s mass protests in 2020 with images from the current small protests at the local Ice facility.

“Like other mayors across the country, I have not asked for – and do not need – federal intervention,” Wilson said in response to Trump’s threat. “Portland will continue to rise to the moment as a proud sanctuary city, taking legal action to stand up for our community and our rights.”

Last week, Trump doubled down on his threat to send troops to Portland.

The deadly attack at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in Dallas, Texas, is being investigated as an act of ""targeted violence"".

There are conflicting reports about the number of victims. The Department of Homeland Security said two detainees had been killed and another was in a critical condition.

Earlier, Dallas police said one victim had died.

The attacker also died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Officials have named the suspect as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, Sky's US partner NBC News reported.

Jahn's brother Noah told NBC his sibling ""didn't have strong feelings about ICE as far as I knew"".

""I didn't think he was politically interested,"" he added. ""He wasn't interested in politics on either side as far as I knew.""

How did the attack unfold?

The gunman opened fire on the office from an adjacent building at about 6.40am local time, officers said.

Dallas FBI Special Agent Joseph Rothrock said it was a ""coordinated attack"" and ""just the most recent example we've seen of targeted violence"".

Early evidence suggested the incident was ""anti-ICE in nature"", he added.

A recovered, unspent shell casing was engraved with the phrase ""ANTI ICE"", said FBI director Kash Patel.

Multiple rounds were fired just before 7am local time, Mr Patel said.

An initial review of evidence shows an ""ideological motive behind this attack"", he added, describing the assault as ""despicable"".

The ""whole of government"" will respond, Mr Rothrock said.

""There will be no resource not utilised to bring all those individuals who are responsible to justice and to hold them accountable.""

No police officers had been hurt, Mr Rothrock added.

The victims were being led into the building to be processed and repatriated, Fox News reported, citing Dallas police Department sources.

Greg Abbott, the governor of Texas, said the shooting would ""NOT slow our arrest, detention, and deportation of illegal immigrants"".

He added: ""We will work with ICE and the Dallas Police Department to get to the bottom of the assassin's motive.""

Go deeper: Multiple injured in shooting at Dallas ICE facility","Top Trump administration officials and MAGA world personalities quickly blamed Wednesday's shooting at a Dallas Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility on anti-law enforcement rhetoric.

The big picture: The rush to point fingers before local police confirmed a motive or the identity of the victims mirrors the rush to assign blame following Charlie Kirk's death, and reflects the fears of rising political violence in America.

What they're saying: ""While we don't know motive yet, we know that our ICE law enforcement is facing unprecedented violence against them. It must stop,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a post on X.

Vice President JD Vance reposted Noem's message, adding, ""the obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop.""

The White House singled out Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) for recently comparing ICE to ""slave patrols"" in a post on X Wednesday afternoon.

""It's rhetoric like this that leads to violence — and it MUST STOP,"" the White House wrote. Crockett's office did not immediately respond to Axios' request for comment.

Of note: Texas Gov. Greg Abbott characterized the shooter as an ""assassin"" in a post on X.

""This assassination will NOT slow our arrest, detention, & deportation of illegal immigrants,"" he added.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said his office will continue to ""combat the alarming increase of targeted attacks against ICE and all law enforcement by evil, twisted individuals.""

The other side: Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin wrote on X that he was ""immensely grateful"" for the first responders.

""I'm praying for the victims and their families. This kind of violence has no place in our democracy,"" he wrote.

Driving the news: Preliminary information indicates that a sniper fired shots into the ""secure detainee location"" of the facility, acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told CNN early Wednesday.

Law enforcement confirmed in a midday press conference that multiple people were shot, and two, including the shooter, are dead.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News that the people shot were ICE detainees, and that no officers were involved in the shooting.

The intrigue: The Department of Homeland Security slammed the ""media, leftist groups and sanctuary politicians"" for ""hateful rhetoric"" in a press release last week.

The release referenced two DHS agents who were assaulted in the line of duty in recent months, and encouraged the country to ""turn down the temperature before someone else is killed.""

Zoom in: Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson urged the public to hold off on drawing any conclusions about the shooter and their motive in a press conference on Wednesday morning.

""There's still a lot of unanswered questions, and I want to encourage all of you to exercise a little bit of restraint and allow them to do their job to help make sure this continues to be a safe city,"" Johnson said.

Later in the conference, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) added that the violence ""needs to stop"" and warned that America's ""divisive rhetoric"" has ""real consequences.""

Zoom out: Some prominent MAGA figures more directly blamed Democrats for the shooting.

In a post on X, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) questioned if the shooter was a member of ""antifa,"" or ""another psycho that has been brainwashed"" by Democrats and the media.

Conservative podcaster Benny Johnson blamed leftists for violence, citing celebrations of Charlie Kirk's death, people vandalizing a memorial for Kirk and the August shooting at a Minneapolis church that killed two and injured 18.

The president has said his “blitz” on Chicago is meant to make the city safer for its residents.

But the rush of federal immigration agents into the area has stoked fears and upended routines — and the results haven’t decisively proven the federal government’s claim that it’s arresting “the worst of the worst” criminals.

After a chaotic few weeks, here’s more on what has happened so far, where things stand and what could come next.

How long will this immigration operation last?

President Donald Trump’s administration has not said how long it plans to continue its deportation campaign in the Chicago area.

The Chicago Sun-Times has reported the operation could last at least through the end of September. But the federal government’s plans have constantly changed. And Trump’s continued on-and-off threats to deploy National Guard troops to the city have left those plans unclear.

How many people have been arrested?

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said this week that 550 people have been taken into custody in the Chicago area during the September operation.

But that figure can’t be verified because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials haven’t released comprehensive arrest data since January. Other groups that obtain and publish immigration enforcement records only have data through the end of July.

ICE has said that it’s arresting “the worst of the worst” in its Chicago-area campaign and named dozens of immigrants who have been taken into custody. Some of those arrested here have violent criminal histories, including a man convicted of murder who served decades in jail and another who sexually abused a child. Others were previously deported from the country.

But a Sun-Times analysis found some were arrested in other states, and about half of the names and alleged charges released by Homeland Security couldn’t be definitively matched to court records.

How and where have arrests happened?

Largely following a playbook they first used in Los Angeles earlier this year, federal immigration authorities have increasingly used more aggressive tactics in the Chicago area over the past few weeks, both during arrests and in response to protests.

ICE officers started the deportation campaign this month by arresting a small number of people in public places, such as a flower vendor in a parking lot on the Southwest Side.

Then ICE started conducting traffic stops in the city and suburbs — one of which saw a federal agent shoot and kill a man in Northwest Suburban Franklin Park. Videos obtained by the Sun-Times have since revealed new details that depart from the DHS narrative after that shooting.

They’ve also gone after immigrants at their workplaces, and public spaces such as outside Home Depot stores where people are waiting for manual labor jobs.

In a major escalation led by U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Mexican Independence Day, Border Patrol agents in a militarized vehicle and fatigues busted into an Elgin house in the early morning hours. They arrested four men and briefly detained two more, including one who was a U.S. citizen.

What are the impacts?

The federal operations have caused widespread fear in city and suburban immigrant communities.

People have changed their habits in some cases, such as staying home from work or skipping doctor appointments.

Some parents have had their older children or neighbors walk younger siblings to and from school because ICE sightings have been reported at school pickup and dropoff times.

The service industry has helped mitigate risk, too. Some barbershops have started giving haircuts at people’s private residences and grocery stores have offered home deliveries.

Immigration advocacy organizations that run a legal hotline are receiving 250-400 calls per day in September, according to a spokesman for the The Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. That’s the highest call volume this year and has led the groups to hire more operators.

The operation, meanwhile, has created opportunities for the Trump administration to demonstrate the aggressiveness of its operation to the president’s political base. Trump and the DHS have posted social media videos styled after action movies showing raids and arrests throughout the Chicago area.

What have protests been like?

There have been plenty of demonstrations in downtown Chicago and some suburbs, most of which have remained peaceful.

People have also gathered outside an ICE facility in west suburban Broadview, where immigration authorities take immigrants who have been arrested.

That’s where confrontations have increased in intensity. Protesters have tried to block an entrance to a parking lot to disrupt ICE operations.

In return, ICE and Border Patrol agents have started using tear gas and pepper spray against demonstrators, some of whom have been struck by pepper balls or exposed to gas without warning. Agents have also shoved protesters, including a congressional candidate. Some protesters have thrown objects or slashed tires on ICE vehicles.

What do we know about the conditions in ICE facilities?

Federal authorities haven’t let out much information about their immigration facilities — even to elected officials — so the full picture of the conditions inside is unclear.

But people who were detained in the Broadview facility have described troubling conditions.

Gladis Yolanda Chavez Pineda, a Honduran woman detained in June, said she stayed in “inhumane” conditions at the facility for four days and was one of 30 women held in a room with no beds, no blankets and little food.

Rosalio Pelayo Salgado, a Mexican man arrested in September, said he was kept in a room with 150 people, where they were called slurs and only given food and water for good behavior. He was at Broadview for at least a week.

One way to learn more about conditions in a detention center would be through inspection records published by ICE. But that doesn’t include the Broadview facility because it’s technically not a detention center.

It’s supposed to only be a place where people are processed into detention after they’re arrested. An Illinois law prohibits the feds from operating immigration detention facilities in the state, so ICE isn’t supposed to keep people at Broadview for long.

The Sun-Times and WBEZ continue to ask for more information from officials and families of those who are detained.

How have politicians reacted?

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson have forcefully slammed Trump’s immigration enforcement as a scare tactic targeting immigrant communities. They’ve said his National Guard threats are unconstitutional and have threatened legal action. Johnson recently accused Trump of “auditioning to become a dictator,” while Pritzker compared Trump’s policies to the “early days of Nazi Germany.”

Other Democrats in federal, state and local office have condemned Trump, too. And some, including many running for Congress, have shown up to protests outside ICE’s Broadview facility.

The three Republican members of the Illinois congressional delegation, meanwhile, have all voiced support for Trump’s efforts, especially Rep. Mary Miller, who has been an outspoken critic of Pritzker and the state’s sanctuary policies.

Have there been legal challenges?

There have been mixed results on the legal front.

A federal judge in Chicago this summer tossed a lawsuit brought by Trump’s Justice Department seeking to invalidate sanctuary laws in Chicago and Illinois that help protect immigrants.

Pritzker and Johnson have said they will sue, as California Gov. Gavin Newsom did, if Trump sends the National Guard troops to Chicago. But while a lower-court judge has sided with Newsom, appellate judges in California have been deferential to Trump.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court has allowed federal agents to continue stopping people based on race, language and other factors in California amid the same immigration campaign that expanded into Chicago, called “Operation At Large.”

In Chicago, there have been individual lawsuits filed by people who have been detained since these operations began. But litigation aimed at the broader campaign has yet to materialize.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c514b2f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1713+0+215/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F06%2Faf%2F808b476d47beb78df48fa4508a22%2Fbroadview-092325-14.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 12:57:35.800825

On August 6, journalists from Fox News embedded with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents for the now infamous “Trojan Horse” raid on a Home Depot in Los Angeles. Their exclusive report opens from inside a Penske truck (rented against company policy) as agents burst out and detain 16 undocumented immigrants lured there by the offer of work.

Two days later, a different set of journalists were injured and arrested by Los Angeles law enforcement officers while reporting on protests against that and other immigration raids in the area.

The contrast illustrates the dilemma media organizations face as the Trump administration escalates its crackdown on a free press: get safe access to events as they’re happening but run the risk of compromising basic standards of journalistic integrity, or do the challenging work of reporting—potentially putting one’s body on the line.

More from Matthew Cunningham-Cook

The report from Fox follows a trend. Journalists from that network, NBC, ABC, CBS, The New York Times, the New York Post, and Newsmax have all embedded with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and CBP operations over the past nine months under the umbrella of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), giving the operations a publicity boost while leaving key claims about DHS enforcement policies unquestioned.

At the same time, the government has violently cracked down on journalists covering ICE raids and protests against DHS operations, with federal agents and local law enforcement officers seriously injuring reporters in Los Angeles as the Trump administration has pursued a broad-based immigration and civil liberties assault in and around the city. In mid-July, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem claimed that videotaping ICE officers doing their work is an act of “violence,” and in August a spokesperson for DHS told the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) that making videos of ICE agents at work and posting them online is “doxing” and will be prosecuted.

Using embedded reporters has allowed DHS to shape its own narrative about what it wants Americans to hear—that the department is only targeting the “worst of the worst” immigrants who have committed violent crimes, even though they rarely provide supporting evidence.

Among recent examples of embedded reporting on ICE by these major news outlets:

On September 9, Fox News reporters embedded with an ICE raid in Chicago called “Midway Blitz.” The footage shows ICE agents piling on top of a Mexican man who Fox reported had been charged with assault and felony re-entry to the U.S. At the end of May, Fox News reporter Bill Melugin joined ICE agents in Boston as they made a broad sweep in which they touted the arrest of a Salvadoran immigrant who allegedly was convicted of child rape, along with a fugitive allegedly wanted for murder and kidnapping. Fox reporters also rode along with ICE agents in Maryland last December (before Trump took office), in Boston in January, in Colorado in April, in Florida in May, and in Connecticut in August. In its reporting on each operation, Fox dutifully reinforces DHS messaging that ICE is only rounding up “egregious criminal alien offenders” who endanger American citizens.

In December 2024, NBC reporter Gabe Gutierrez rode along with now-acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, who at the time was the agency’s assistant director of field operations. The report voluntarily blurred ICE agents’ faces, and granted anonymity to two ICE officials who claimed that the agency was facing a $230 million shortfall, an amount that NBC did not appear to independently verify. Gutierrez did not challenge or ask follow-up questions when Lyons claimed that sanctuary states and cities put ICE agents at risk.

Rachel Scott from ABC embedded with ICE agents and Secretary Noem in March as they raided a home in Virginia to arrest an immigrant who had allegedly been charged with sexual battery and who had re-entered the U.S. illegally after being deported twice. They also detained another undocumented relative in the house who was ordered to report to ICE in 48 hours after he had placed two minor children who are American citizens with other family members.

In July, CBS’s Camilo Montoya-Galvez tagged along with ICE agents in Maryland, where ICE arrested an Ethiopian man who had purportedly been prosecuted for second-degree rape. CBS repeated a DHS claim that there had been an 800 percent increase in violence against ICE officers. A few days later, a DHS spokesperson told CMD that that number had risen to “1,000 percent” but refused to provide any data to support that claim. CBS host Tony Dokoupil reported in the segment that “people on the far left think that everyone should be able to stay,” without providing any corroborating evidence for that misleading generalization.

Reporters for The New York Times’ popular podcast The Daily embedded with an ICE raid in early June. While the podcast raised major concerns and questions about the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, it is unclear whether reporters independently verified that the prime target of the operation, an immigrant named Jerlien Iswola Rivera, had actually committed sexual battery on a minor.

In January, reporters from the New York Post joined a team of ICE agents in Chicago to “arrest criminal illegal migrants,” as they put it, but arrested only two Venezuelan nationals despite the efforts of roughly 100 agents to round up more deportees. The Post article blames a “left-wing ecosystem” of “local activists, legislators and school administrators” for helping immigrants evade ICE. It also rehashes the DHS narrative that its agents are the victims of this resistance in a city it vilifies as a sanctuary space.

None of these news organizations responded to questions from CMD about whether they independently verified DHS claims about the people who were detained in these operations, nor can CMD find evidence of follow-up reporting about the specific individuals affected by the operations.

Kelly McBride, senior vice president and chair of the Craig Newmark Center for Ethics and Leadership at the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, said that embedded journalism raises concerns, especially if statements made by government officials go unchallenged or uninvestigated.

“There’s no way you get a full and accurate picture of what ICE is doing in an embed. There’s just no way,” McBride said. “The question is: What’s the journalistic purpose of the story you’re trying to tell? And what is the value of the material you get out of the embed?”

Footage is a major motivator for broadcast news organizations, McBride argued. “For TV it’s to get footage, but that can be very irresponsible. That footage is very powerful and can misrepresent the totality of the picture.”

McBride placed particular emphasis on the need for news organizations to verify claims made by government officials.

“Any information that law enforcement provides needs to be verified,” she said. “If they say they arrested this person, where are the records of that arrest? If they say this person has a prior charge, where are those charges documented? Who can you talk to … to find out more information about that crime?”

McBride explains that embeds must be placed in the context of being able to develop a more complete picture of law enforcement operations as a whole—that the embed itself shouldn’t constitute the entire story. “I’m not going to say never ever go on an embed,” she added, pointing out that “you might be able to develop relationships with ICE officers.” As a former police reporter, she says she “used to go on ride-alongs all the time, but it was to [find and develop new] sources.”

“Not telling the [full] story is not an option,” McBride concluded. “As a journalist you do not want to be a mouthpiece for the government. Whatever you portray the government saying, you have to be able to [substantiate it]—to tell your audience that we believe this is true, or we believe this is a distortion, or we believe this is not true.”

While ICE has failed to provide evidence supporting its claims of a 1,000 percent increase in violence against its officers, there is extensive documentation of government officials using violence against immigrant detainees. Earlier in August, a report from U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA) found 510 credible reports of human rights violations in immigration detentions since Trump retook office on January 20, 2025.

The administration has repeatedly misled the public about prior claims of detaining only “the worst of the worst” migrants charged with criminal behavior. When 238 ICE detainees were deported to an infamous supermax prison in El Salvador in March, officials claimed they were mostly gang members, murderers, and rapists. But a review by Bloomberg News found that 90 percent of the men deported without due process had no criminal record other than minor traffic or immigration offenses. NPR found that one-third of the 177 Venezuelans who were initially held at the U.S.’s notorious Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba and then flown back to Venezuela in February had no criminal record. And an analysis by FactCheck.org concluded that more than a third of the 600,000 immigrants border czar Tom Homan claimed were violent criminals only had histories of traffic or immigration offenses.",https://prospect.org/downloads/23575/download/Cunningham-Cook-DHS%20embeds%20092425%20teaser.png?cb=2519ce382741f7a422e81032a21c4dfb&w=923,N,,2025-09-24 16:57:41.777692

How The New Immigration Rule Changes The H-1B Lottery Under the current system, U.S.
Although the proposed rule retains a lottery, it differs significantly from the current system.
He disputes the central premise of the proposed rule, that higher wage levels in the DOL system equate to higher skill and greater economic value.
However, under the proposed rule, someone at Level I would see their selection chances drop to only 15.29%.","The Trump administration has proposed a new immigration rule to change the H-1B selection process to favor people in senior positions. The new method uses “weighting” to fulfill a longstanding goal of Trump officials to hinder or prevent recent international students from gaining H-1B status. The proposed rule, which is subject to a 30-day comment period, is likely to be challenged in court on the grounds that U.S. immigration law does not permit selecting H-1B petitions based on salary or seniority.

The changes, if implemented, will take the U.S. immigration system further away from the goal expressed by Donald Trump in 2024, when he said international students should stay and work in the United States after graduating from U.S. universities. Analysts say this indicates that Trump is not closely involved in immigration policy, and White House and agency staff are pursuing their own agendas.

The latest move follows a presidential proclamation that imposed a $100,000 fee on the entry of H-1B visa holders. During the Oval Office signing ceremony, staff assured Trump that U.S. companies favored the $100,000 fee. However, interviews with attorneys did not find major companies that communicated prior support for the policy. Instead, many companies scrambled to bring employees back to the United States so they would not be barred from the country or subject to the fee.

H-1B temporary visas are important because they are typically the only practical way for a high-skilled foreign national to work long term in the United States and later gain permanent residence (a green card). The H-1B annual limit is 65,000, with a 20,000 exemption for individuals with a master’s degree or higher from a U.S. university. At U.S. universities, international students account for 73% of full-time graduate students in electrical and computer engineering. Under U.S. law, in addition to government fees often exceeding $5,000, employers must pay the higher of the actual or prevailing wage paid to U.S. professionals with similar experience and qualifications. A large body of research has concluded that H-1B visa holders are paid the same or higher than comparable U.S. professionals (i.e., people with similar degrees and experience).

How The New Immigration Rule Changes The H-1B Lottery

Under the current system, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services conducts a lottery when it receives more H-1B registrations than the 85,000 annual limit. Although the proposed rule retains a lottery, it differs significantly from the current system. Under the current system, all registrants have an equal chance of being selected for an H-1B petition. However, under the proposed rule, USCIS would employ the four Department of Labor salary levels used for prevailing wage determinations to “weight” the lottery in favor of individuals holding positions that require more experience.

The proposed rule would give registrants who are offered a position that corresponds to a Level IV salary four chances to be selected, a Level III registrant three chances, a Level II registrant two chances and a Level I registrant one chance. (A July 21, 2025, Forbes article discussed the likelihood the rule would use “weighting” based on the DOL system.)

“The method chosen to rank H-1B petitions does not measure skill level, as the proposed rule implies, but is a Department of Labor tool to divide job classifications based on the experience and related factors needed to perform in the position,” according to a new National Foundation for American Policy analysis of the proposed rule.

Immigration attorneys agree that the DOL’s Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics is a bad fit for the H-1B selection process. “The Department of Labor’s OEWS wage levels are designed as a job classification tool that reflects the amount of experience, supervision and responsibility required for a position, not an assessment of whether the worker is ‘highly skilled’ or ‘less skilled,’” said Vic Goel of Goel & Anderson in an interview. “A Level I role is simply an entry-level version of the occupation, while Level IV is a senior-level position requiring greater judgment and independence.”

Goel said USCIS used these DOL levels for purposes they were never intended. He disputes the central premise of the proposed rule, that higher wage levels in the DOL system equate to higher skill and greater economic value. “USCIS used its framing to justify weighting the lottery in favor of Level III and IV beneficiaries. Wage levels don’t correspond to skill in the way USCIS suggests, and instead they correspond to how DOL has structured job progression for prevailing wage purposes.”

According to Goel, the two systems are incompatible because the DOL wage levels are only focused on ensuring that employer pay for foreign nationals is fair relative to the job requirements. “USCIS lottery weighting attempts to twist those same levels into a proxy for ‘skill’ and ‘best and brightest,’” he said.

The New Immigration Rule Produces Significantly Different H-1B Lottery Outcomes

Critics point out a significant shortcoming of the weighting system in the proposed rule is that it establishes, for H-1B selection purposes, that foreign nationals paid a Level IV wage are four times more valuable to the United States than people paid a Level I wage, or twice as beneficial as someone paid at a Level II wage, without evidence in the proposed rule to support this contention. Employers and attorneys argue that the four DOL wage levels primarily consider an individual's current level of experience in the labor market, not their talent or potential contributions. DOL lists employees at Level IV as people who “generally have management and/or supervisory responsibilities.”

As a practical matter, the proposed rule makes it much more likely that a U.S. company could hire foreign-born senior managers on H-1B petitions than promising recent international students graduating from U.S. universities with degrees in a field such as artificial intelligence. Analysts say shifting the H-1B selection using a Department of Labor salary scale that identifies the amount of experience to fill a position changes the country’s talent acquisition policy toward mid-career professionals rather than encouraging companies to foster more innovation within the United States.

As the NFAP analysis notes, the percentage change in the probability of being selected in the H-1B lottery may be the best indicator of the rule’s impact. Under the proposed rule, the probability of USCIS selecting an individual at Level IV for an H-1B petition would increase by 107% but fall by 48% for individuals at Level I. The probability of USCIS selecting an H-1B petition would increase by 55% for individuals at Level III and by 3% for individuals at Level II.

Another way to compare the current and proposed systems: Currently, individuals at all four salary levels have a 29.59% chance of being selected for an H-1B petition, according to USCIS. However, under the proposed rule, someone at Level I would see their selection chances drop to only 15.29%. In comparison, individuals at Level IV would see the probability of being selected surge to 61.16%. Individuals at Level III would see their opportunity of being selected increase to 45.87% under the proposed rule, and H-1B registrants at Level II would experience a slight increase to 30.58%.

The National Foundation for American Policy discovered an error in calculations in Tables 13 and 14 of the proposed rule that resulted in USCIS understating the negative impact of the new system on individuals at Level I and the benefit the proposed rule provides to individuals at Level III and Level IV. (Table 13, line F was incorrectly calculated.) After correcting for the USCIS error, NFAP found that, compared to the current system, individuals at Level I would receive 11,518 fewer H-1B selections, while people at Level IV would gain 4,426 more, Level III would receive 5,528 more H-1B selections and Level II would get an additional 1,564.

The more USCIS gears H-1B selection against Level I, the fewer international students are likely to gain H-1B status. An examination of data on 170 F-1 students from the law firm Curran, Berger & Kludt, provided to NFAP, found 53% of international students were paid at level I and 37% were paid at Level II (i.e., 90% combined) in applications for H-1B cap selection from FY 2018 through FY 2021. A survey of international graduate students at U.S. universities conducted by the Institute for Progress and NAFSA: Association of International Educators found “53% of respondents said they would not have enrolled in the first place if access to H-1B was determined by Wage Levels.”

Legal Challenges Expected To The Immigration Rule

The proposed rule to change the H-1B lottery, like many other Trump administration policies, is expected to be challenged in court. The Trump administration unsuccessfully attempted to finalize a similar rule in 2021. Comments made to that rule, which used a different mechanism to shift H-1B selection toward individuals paid at Level III and Level IV, asserted that it violated U.S. immigration law.

“Congress spoke directly and clearly by stating that H-1B petitions were subject to a numerical limit and would be considered not by order of skill or wage levels, by relative value to the U.S. economy, or by any other prioritizing criterion other than filing order,” according to a comment signed by the American Immigration Lawyers Association and other organizations. “This is unambiguous in the statute where the INA establishes that consideration for an H-1B visa or status ‘shall’ be ‘in the order in which petitions are filed.’” The Compete America Coalition, FWD.us, NAFSA, National Immigration Forum, TechNet, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and others also signed the comment.

In January 2019, DHS established by regulation the H-1B registration system. When a commenter suggested the Trump administration prioritize H-1B petitions based on salary or other criteria, officials responded that it would be unlawful under U.S. immigration law: “DHS believes, however, that prioritization of selection on other bases such as those suggested by the commenters would require statutory changes.”",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65b9e6a6c908553e9aa5344b/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-09-24 12:57:39.824299

Three weeks ago, federal and state agents conducted an immigration raid at a multi-billion-dollar Hyundai-LG battery plant under construction in Ellabell, Georgia and detained some 475 workers. About 300 of these workers were South Korean citizens. 14 were from China, Japan, and Indonesia. Another 145 were from Mexico and other Latin American countries.

As has become common in such ICE operations, the raid involved masked men and firearms in an aggressive show of force. In South Korea, the public has been outraged at the site of shackled workers “perp walked” before cameras and held in prison-like conditions. The South Korean government chartered a plane that transported 316 Koreans and 14 others from the various Asian countries to Seoul and has commenced a human rights investigation to assess ICE treatment of its citizens.

Some observers initially saw this as a purposeful strategy to target several groups at once, including undocumented immigrants, the electric vehicle sector, and potentially political opponents like Georgia Governor Brian Kemp (who refused to help Trump overturn the 2020 election results in his state).

Subsequent developments suggest that the Trump administration actually sees the operation as a mistake, an “own goal” that inadvertently undermines the administration’s stated efforts to revive American manufacturing. Christopher Landau, the US deputy secretary of state, even expressed deep regret over the detainment of Korean citizens. Although ICE officials have framed this as an instance of companies breaking the law and giving away jobs that would otherwise go to Americans, it seems as though the Korean workers were here temporarily to help install equipment at the battery plant and train American workers and that the project is creating American jobs. Many workers reportedly entered the US on B-1 or ESTA visa waivers, which prohibit most work activity but include exceptions such as for specialized workers engaged in equipment installation. ICE has not specified how these workers violated the terms of their visas and its warrant only included limited information about 4 Hispanic individuals – with no reference to the more than 400 other people they eventually detained.

There is no easily obtainable visa category for the types of expert workers needed to support these foreign investments. H1-B visas would more clearly cover the range of expertise needed, but these are capped at 85,000 a year and issued via lottery. There is simply no way companies can be certain of obtaining such visas on the timelines needed for these investment projects. Trump himself posted on Truth Social about the dynamic, recognizing that foreign investors will need to bring in their own experts to establish facilities and train US workers. Georgia Governor Kemp has said the raid should be a catalyst for visa reform.

Green Investment and American Jobs

The ICE raid raises serious concerns about the treatment of a major economic partner, given Georgia’s significant investment in attracting foreign direct investment. The battery plant is part of Hyundai’s $5 billion Metaplant investment, which includes an EV assembly facility that began to produce Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9 EV models in late 2024. It is the largest economic development project in Georgia history, and is expected to generate 8,500 jobs by 2031. There are apparently contractual clawback provisions that require Hyundai to pay back government subsidies if 80% of that figure is not met. Hyundai’s overall investment in Georgia has since expanded to US$12.6 billion and includes another battery manufacturing facility in partnership with SK On in Bartow County. One estimate suggests that the plant could create 38,000 indirect jobs in Georgia over the next decade. The groundbreaking for the facility back in 2023 was a bipartisan affair including Republic governor Kemp and Democratic Senators Warnock and Ossoff. This is seemingly the type of investment that Republicans (including Trump) and Democrats alike can all support.

The case here is strong evidence of the potential for green development in the US, but it also serves as a clarion call to reform laws that hinder such development. First, the Hyundai investment was driven by anticipated demand for EVs in the United States and its business case was only helped by Inflation Reduction Act incentives that Republicans have now rolled back. The project here merely reminds us of a fact that we have known for a few years now. Green industrial policy has been a boon for Republican states, even more so than Democratic states. Despite that effort by Democrats to share the wealth produced by the policy, most Republicans have turned against this opportunity, whether due to anti-environmental ideology or the special interest lobbying of the fossil fuel industry or American car companies who have largely had trouble producing competitive EVs. Although bipartisanship seems to be dead these days, major job-creating, tax dollar-generating projects like this should be something both parties can get behind.

Second, if we are interested in promoting green development of all sorts, we are going to have to figure out a way to harness various kinds of law and policy – tax, trade, national security, environmental regulation, and immigration law – in ways that support our broader economic and social goals. The Hyundai-LG plant raid highlights a problem in our visa system – the lack of temporary visas to fill jobs that Americans can’t easily assume; here, expert workers to help stand up manufacturing facilities and train American workers. If we like what these projects bring to the US, then we need to design accompanying policies that facilitate more investment and development.

Instead, the ICE raid has antagonized an important trade partner in South Korea, added cost and delay to a major value-creating investment from Hyundai and others, and created a less hospitable environment for future foreign investments in American manufacturing. We can certainly do better than this.

At the same time, the Hyundai project also shows us the bipartisan appeal in a decidedly un-bipartisan age of clean transportation and energy investments that bring jobs and new capabilities to parts of the US in need of greater development.",https://legal-planet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Drain-Sept-3.png,N,,2025-09-24 11:59:23.965114

“In fact, ICE has higher detention standards than most US prisons that hold actual US citizens.","A Bay Area congressperson said he remains deeply concerned over possible mistreatment of detained immigrants after a visit to an immigration holding facility in San Francisco on Monday.

Rep. Mike Thompson, a North Bay Democrat, said he scheduled the visit to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office at 630 Sansome St. in San Francisco after getting reports that detainees were mistreated there.

His inspection comes on the heels of a class action lawsuit, filed last week, that alleged conditions at the facility are so inhumane they violate the U.S. Constitution. The suit accused ICE of turning 12-hour holding cells in the downtown office building into a jail where people are detained for days with no beds, hygiene or medical care.

Thompson said he did not observe egregious conditions on Monday, but he noted that his visit was planned in advance. It was not a response to the lawsuit.

“While the conditions shown to me appeared orderly and maintained, leadership at the facility was given prior notice of my visit,” he told KQED in a statement. “I will continue to closely monitor reports of undue detainments and improper conditions at the immigration facilities near our community.”

Under federal law, members of Congress have the right to conduct inspections of immigration detention facilities without providing advance notice. However, in recent months, ICE has repeatedly blocked members of Congress from entering detention facilities. In July, a dozen lawmakers who were denied access sued the Trump administration.

Until recently, the sixth-floor cells at the Sansome Street ICE office were intended for temporary custody while immigrants awaited transfer or processing for release, according to the lawsuit. But in January, ICE rescinded a national policy that limited the use of such temporary “hold rooms” to a maximum of 12 hours.

Since then, people arrested at Northern California immigration courts, at ICE check-in appointments and elsewhere have been locked up overnight — some as long as six days — and have nowhere to sleep but a metal bench or the floor, with the lights on around the clock, the suit alleged. They must share a toilet with no privacy, have nowhere to bathe and are denied soap and toothpaste, according to the lawsuit, which was filed on behalf of several people who were held there.

“Defendants do not conduct a medical intake or use a medical questionnaire to identify the needs of people being detained in the hold rooms,” the suit said. “Defendants routinely fail to provide for the proper administration of prescription medications, and they do not allow detained people to make arrangements to access their prescription medications or keep medication with them.”

ICE spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin denied the charges in a statement to KQED.

“Any claim that there are subprime conditions at ICE detention centers are false,” she wrote. “In fact, ICE has higher detention standards than most US prisons that hold actual US citizens. All detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with lawyers and their family members. It is a longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters ICE custody.”

The lawsuit, which also challenged ICE’s recent practice of arresting people at immigration courthouses, was brought by the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area, the Central American Resource Center of San Francisco and the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, as well as attorneys with the firm Coblentz, Patch, Duffy & Bass.

In her statement, ICE’s McLaughlin wrote: “The ACLU should just change its name. It’s clear they only care about illegal aliens—not Americans.”

Thompson said he would continue to work with immigrant service organizations “to ensure members of our immigrant community know their rights and are treated with dignity.”

Texas governor Greg Abbott has posted the following on X:

Texas fully supports ICE. Both the Texas Dept. of Public Safety & Texas National Guard work closely with ICE. This assassination will NOT slow our arrest, detention, & deportation of illegal immigrants. We will work with ICE & the Dallas Police Dept. to get to the bottom of the assassin’s motive. We will offer ICE additional support to assist their operations.

Abbott, and vice-president JD Vance, have been quick to frame the shooting as an attack on Ice, even though the DHS has already confirmed that no federal agents were wounded and the only confirmed victims have been detainees.

We’ll learn more of the facts in the press conference due to begin shortly.

The case for a trusted form of digital ID, which can help us access digital public services and prove who we are online, has shifted.
The extent of these risks and the opportunities of a digital ID system entirely depend on the policy choices the government makes.
Government research ahead of introducing voter ID requirements found more than 2 million UK voters lacked appropriate photo identification.1 This would be compounded by digital exclusion in the case of digital ID.
Technological advancements mean that digital ID systems pose an even greater risk to privacy than they did when last proposed in the 2000s.","Next year will mark the twentieth anniversary of Tony Blair’s Identity Cards Act. The scheme was hotly debated for almost a decade, cost over £250 million, and was promptly abandoned by the following government. The conversation surrounding Blair’s scheme would look eerily familiar to anyone who has read the papers in the last year. The ID cards of the 2000s were a policy silver bullet, championed in the various battles against terrorism, welfare fraud, and immigration depending on the issue of the day. The scheme proposed to retain biometric data and track every use of the ID in a central database. It collapsed under the weight of its expense and controversy.

Liberty was a key member of the NO2ID Coalition that led the fight against Blair’s ID scheme. As Labour reportedly readies itself to announce another ID scheme, Liberty must consider what has changed and what has not. The world has transformed since the 2000s. Much more of our lives now takes place online. Huge swathes of the state are digitised, including our health service, housing, and welfare access. In a world of online shopping, banking, and streaming, proving who we are in a safe and secure way has become a vital need. The case for a trusted form of digital ID, which can help us access digital public services and prove who we are online, has shifted.

However, the human rights concerns associated with such a scheme have not. The extent of these risks and the opportunities of a digital ID system entirely depend on the policy choices the government makes.

Liberty has long opposed the introduction of compulsory identity cards. A compulsory system would fundamentally change the relationship between individual and state. It would also exclude the most vulnerable members of our society. Government research ahead of introducing voter ID requirements found more than 2 million UK voters lacked appropriate photo identification.1 This would be compounded by digital exclusion in the case of digital ID. Four per cent of Britons, 2.1 million people, are offline according to a report by the House of Lords Communications and Digital Committee.2 3Poverty is a key predictor of digital exclusion, as is old age. We must always retain the right to verify our identity offline to limit the harms of this digital exclusion.

Technological advancements mean that digital ID systems pose an even greater risk to privacy than they did when last proposed in the 2000s. A single and unique ‘digital identity’ and centralising databases would remove much of the individual’s agency in managing their data. This information could be used to profile individuals across multiple datasets and would pose particular risks to marginalised communities (such as those unknowingly included in police databases).4

A digital ID system designed to reduce irregular migration would be plagued by the above human rights and discriminatory problems. It would likely be mandatory, give the Home Office huge surveillance powers over our lives (including our interactions with our employers, landlords, and public services), and would make migrants lives even more difficult and dangerous. There are many countries that have mandatory ID systems, and it’s been shown there is no clear correlation between irregular migrant population, underground economies and ID policies. Before doubling down on this cruel and ineffective approach, the government should analyse how digital ID has worked elsewhere and examine if the supposed benefits in reducing migration stand up to scrutiny before rushing to introduce it here.

David Eaves, a digital government expert, recommends that ‘digital technologies are harnessed by the state to focus on the creation of public good and support individual liberty.’5 Liberty supports a digital identification system that meets these aims. Such a system would need robust human rights safeguards, adhere to the strictest data privacy and security standards, retain minimal user data, establish firewalls around sensitive state databases, be unlinkable (i.e. making it impossible to link different transactions or functions carried out by a user), and be voluntary.

The UK will benefit from not being first movers in this space; we now have examples of technology, policy design, and safeguards from around the world to draw upon – including the EU’s new system.

Liberty awaits the Government’s proposals. We hope that the Government learns from both the mistakes of the 2000s and the good work done in Europe and beyond to research and build rights-respecting ID systems. Digital ID could be an essential tool for every digital citizen, or a nightmarish surveillance system – we’ll be following how Labour takes forward their plans, ready to respond and make the case for a human rights respecting system.",https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/o-CELL-PHONE-facebook-1-copy.jpeg,N,,2025-09-24 13:57:49.964266

ICE, a federal agency under the Department of Homeland Security, is tasked with enforcing immigration laws and conducting criminal investigations.

Its operations have been the subject of controversy and protests in recent years, particularly since the re-election of President Donald Trump and his subsequent crackdown on migrants and refugees, a cornerstone of his administration’s policies.

Human Rights Watch has previously said ICE detention officers and private contractor guards treat detainees in a “degrading and dehumanizing manner”.

While there have been no confirmed reports of ICE activity in Beardstown or at the JBS plant, fear still lingers.","Beardstown, Illinois, is an example of how immigration crackdowns are impacting Midwestern communities and the nation’s food supply.

In Beardstown, Illinois, the Cuban couple had spent the past year building a life they were proud of.

Their arrival in the U.S. had followed a long and uncertain path: a northbound journey through Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala, followed by seven months in Monterrey, Mexico, as they waited for their appointment with Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

Aware of the growing hostility toward immigrants in the U.S., they were determined to enter legally.

In Cuba, they barely made ends meet — he worked in maintenance, she worked in a clothing store. But in the rural west central Illinois town, life started to feel promising.

They found work last year as forklift operators at DOT Foods, the largest food redistributor in the country. The pay was decent and the benefits generous, and the couple had begun to set aside savings.

Then, in June, they were abruptly let go.

“We were on the right track,” the husband said in Spanish, seated in the living room of their one-bedroom rental. The couple asked Investigate Midwest not to use their names for fear of deportation. “We were comfortable in our jobs, earning a decent salary. And suddenly everything collapsed — the castle crumbled.”

They are among hundreds of immigrants in Beardstown who arrived through humanitarian parole programs that have since been rescinded by the Trump administration, leaving them undocumented and out of work. Many of them were employed at DOT Foods and JBS, the world’s largest meat processor. These workers were part of a workforce that has long sustained both the town’s economy and its key role in the country’s food supply chain.

For decades, Beardstown has been a case study in how immigrants have revitalized once-decaying rural towns, particularly in the Midwest. But the Trump administration’s crackdown on both documented and undocumented immigration threatens the stability of communities that have long relied on foreign-born workers.

The previous administration’s humanitarian parole initiatives — which allowed individuals to enter the U.S. temporarily to seek safety or escape political persecution — significantly increased the pool of authorized workers. That influx helped major food companies fill staffing gaps and keep operations running during pandemic-era labor shortages.

Roughly 2.1 million immigrants power the nation’s food supply chain — planting, harvesting, processing and selling the food that ends up on American tables. So far, there is no evidence that Trump’s immigration agenda has created an “America First” labor market with higher wages to attract U.S.-born workers to slaughterhouses or farm fields. Instead, labor experts say the more likely outcome is an expansion of guestworker programs like H-2A and H-2B — often criticized for enabling exploitation — or a shrinking workforce that leaves remaining workers stretched even thinner.

“We’re not seeing any evidence yet of improved conditions for [domestic] workers,” said Daniel Costa, director of immigration law and policy research at the Economic Policy Institute. “Some employers, especially in certain industries, have been ready to make a push for more H-2A and H-2B visas… They see that the only way they are going to replace that workforce is with these programs.”

In Beardstown, it’s unclear how employers like JBS and DOT Foods will address the labor shortage. Neither company responded to requests for comment.

Investigate Midwest spoke with dozens of workers, local residents, city officials and immigration advocates to examine how tougher immigration policies, including the rollback of parole programs, are impacting not just the local economy, but also the nation’s food system. Many Beardstown residents requested anonymity, fearing that speaking out could put them at risk of deportation.

Just a few steps from the slow-moving waters of the Illinois River, the Western Illinois Dreamers Immigrant Welcome Center sits beside the weathered storefront of a local radio station in downtown Beardstown. Inside, “Know Your Rights” flyers in Spanish line the walls.

A staff of three helps connect newly arrived migrants with legal services, food pantries, clothing banks and other local resources.

Kate Cruz, who co-directs the center, said her office has heard from many of the recently terminated workers at DOT Foods and JBS. Most are scrambling to find legal pathways to stay in the country and return to work. Some are reaching out in fear.

“We have more people coming in or calling who are fearful,” Cruz said. “Or they’re sending family members because they’re afraid that if they leave their homes, they’re going to be deported.”

Many of these workers are from Haiti, another country that, like Cuba, was included in the Biden administration’s humanitarian parole program in response to ongoing political and humanitarian crises.

Starting in 2021, the Biden administration expanded its use of parole authority, a long-standing legal tool that allows individuals to enter the U.S. temporarily for urgent humanitarian reasons or public benefit.

Both Republican and Democratic administrations have used parole for decades. Under Biden, new programs were set up to grant parole to people fleeing crises in Afghanistan, Ukraine, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

The administration also extended parole to some migrants who scheduled appointments at the border using the CBP One app and met certain requirements after an interview, allowing them to enter legally through official ports — a strategy aimed at tracking arrivals and reducing illegal crossings.

“Many people fled their home country because it just simply wasn’t safe for them to stay there anymore,” said Sara Dady, an immigration attorney based in Rockford, Illinois.

Haiti, like parts of Central America and Mexico, has also been plagued by gang violence and instability in recent years.

Cruz said that at the beginning of the year, JBS hired hundreds of Haitian immigrants, most of whom have now been terminated. They want to stay in Beardstown, Cruz says, because it still feels safer than home despite their fear of deportation.

But for the terminated workers, finding a way to remain in the U.S. without risking deportation will look different for everyone — and it means navigating a constantly changing immigration system that can be complex, costly and slow.

For example, the Cuban couple hopes to remain in the U.S. under the Cuban Adjustment Act, a 1960s law that allows Cuban nationals to apply for permanent residency after one year of physical presence in the country.

They applied with the help of an immigration lawyer they found online. But with both of them out of work, their savings are quickly being depleted by the legal fees, on top of rent and daily expenses.

For Elizabeth Amezcua, 39, an immigrant from Mexico, hiring a lawyer is not an option right now. Without the money for legal help, she is left to navigate the system on her own.

Amezcua was recently let go from the JBS slaughterhouse, where she worked as a cook in the facility’s cafeteria. The income supported her in Beardstown and helped provide for her son back in Mexico.

She entered the U.S. nearly 18 months ago through the CBP One process, like the Cuban couple. She says she was granted parole that allowed her to stay legally for at least one more year.

But after the Trump administration began dismantling parole programs — including converting the CBP One app that had allowed Amezcua to enter the country into a “self-deportation app” — she lost her job in June.

“I don’t have any family here. I don’t have anyone to help me,” Amezcua said in Spanish. “But God is almighty. And I know He’s going to help all of us who were left without jobs.”

On August 1st, a federal judge blocked the Trump administration from rapidly deporting immigrants who had been paroled into the country.

For nearly two centuries, Beardstown’s economy has been rooted in agriculture, shaped from the start by immigration.

In the early 19th century, Dutch immigrants drained the region’s marshlands, transforming it into farmland. By 1834, Beardstown had become a key river port shipping grain, hogs and provisions to downstate markets. With tens of thousands of hogs slaughtered each spring — more than in Chicago — it earned the nickname “Porkopolis,” home to the most extensive pork trade west of Cincinnati.

Beardstown’s industrial rise continued into the mid-20th century. In 1967, Oscar Mayer opened a large meatpacking plant, employing over 800 workers, most of them white men from the area. Jobs at the plant were stable, unionized and paid well.

The mayor of Beardstown, Tim Harris, remembers graduating from high school and dreaming of working at the Oscar Mayer plant.

“It was fairly difficult to get a job there,” said Harris, sitting in his City Hall office across the street from the town square, where speakers play music and ads in Spanish for jobs at JBS. “Unless you really had an in with somebody, a reference, you usually didn’t get a job there.”

But in the 1980s, industry consolidation, weakened labor unions and automation led to declining wages. By 1990, meatpacking jobs paid 24% less than the average manufacturing wage.

When Oscar Mayer closed its plant in 1987, Beardstown had already lost hundreds of jobs from other factory shutdowns. As families moved away, the town’s future looked bleak.

Cargill eventually bought the facility that same year and reopened it under a new model — cutting wages and benefits. But with the new jobs failing to attract the local population, which had dropped from 6,338 in 1980 to 5,270 in 1990, Cargill had to look elsewhere to build its workforce.

The company turned to immigrant labor, first from Mexico and later from other countries. The shift transformed the plant’s workforce from nearly all-white to one with dozens of nationalities and languages; Beardstown went from a declining town, with shuttered storefronts and an aging population, into a multicultural hub.

But this transformation was not without tension. In 1995, just 45 miles north of Beardstown, the Ku Klux Klan held a rally to protest the hiring of immigrants at the Cargill plant.

Thirty years later, Beardstown’s nearly 6,000 residents make up a far more integrated community, and Mayor Harris welcomes newcomers. “We need workers. The whole country does,” Harris said.

Beardstown’s story mirrors a broader transformation that has swept through the rural Midwest over the past four decades.

Immigration, global corporate consolidation, and the relentless drive for efficiency have reshaped the meat industry and the communities built around it.

The Beardstown slaughterhouse changed hands again in 2015, when it was purchased by JBS, a Brazilian conglomerate that is now the world’s largest meat company. The plant, which processed 7,000 hogs a day during the Oscar Mayer era, now slaughters over 20,000.

According to USDA data, pork production in the U.S. increased by over 75% between 1980 and 2020, now topping 28 billion pounds annually. Over the same period, the number of plants fell and line speeds accelerated. Modern meat processing plants can slaughter over 1,100 hogs per hour.

Industry profits have soared alongside this productivity boom, especially in recent years.

The top meatpacking companies — including JBS and Tyson Foods — more than doubled their profit margins during the pandemic.

However, the industry’s rapid growth and increasing profits have not always translated into improved working conditions for its frontline workers.

Real wages have decreased since the 1980s and injuries remain common today. And now, under a Trump administration that benefited from industry donations, thousands of these workers are at risk of deportation.

JBS subsidiary Pilgrim’s Pride, the second-largest poultry processor in the U.S, made a $5 million donation to Trump’s Inaugural Committee — the largest single contribution, far exceeding the $1 million given by corporations like Meta and Amazon.

Some critics argue that JBS’s political donations and aggressive lobbying helped clear the way for its recent listing on the New York Stock Exchange, despite a controversial track record that includes corruption and bribery scandals in Brazil.

In the U.S., the company’s record has also drawn scrutiny.

During the early months of the pandemic, JBS kept its plants open without proper safety measures, and they quickly became COVID-19 hotspots.

At its Greeley, Colorado, plant, nearly 300 workers were infected and six died. By July 2020, the plant accounted for 65% of all COVID-19 cases in Colorado. Most of the affected workers were older immigrants.

JBS did not respond to requests for an interview or comments on its political contributions, COVID-19 safety protocols, and the recent termination of immigrant workers on humanitarian parole.

Neither JBS nor other major meat companies and industry groups have publicly opposed Trump’s immigration policies. However, the North American Meat Institute, a powerful trade group, has formally urged the administration to expand the H-2A visa program — originally intended for seasonal farmworkers — to include meat and poultry processors.

“You’ve seen some action in Congress and the Appropriations Committee,” said Costa, with the Economic Policy Institute. “There are amendments being considered that would change the rules in the work visa program so that they’d apply for additional industries. So I do think that is going to be the main strategy.”

About 740,000 immigrants on humanitarian parole were part of the U.S workforce between 2021 and 2024, according to FWD.us, a bipartisan immigration advocacy group.

Of those, 30,000 worked in agriculture and 90,000 in manufacturing, including meatpacking and food processing.

The organization projects that eliminating their work authorization, alongside other immigration policy changes, could increase prices for food, beverages and tobacco by 14.5% between 2024 and 2028.

But the economic impact is only part of the story. In places like Beardstown, the new immigration policies have stoked anxiety and discouraged civic life.

The annual celebration for Mexican Independence Day on Sept. 16, which draws hundreds to Beardstown’s town square with music, food and costume contests, has been cancelled. Even residents with visas or green cards say they’re hesitant to leave their homes.

While fears of deportation have increased under the Trump administration, for many immigrants, that fear is nothing new. Many advocates argue the system has been broken for decades: the Obama administration deported more immigrants than any U.S. president, and the largest workplace immigration raid in the country’s history happened under President George W. Bush at a meatpacking plant in Iowa.

Martin Pineda has lived through these shifting policies.

A native of Mexico, Pineda spent years working in strawberry fields in California and later at a Missouri slaughterhouse. When that plant closed, he moved to Beardstown to work at the slaughterhouse there — then owned by Cargill — and stayed for more than a decade.

He left in 2007, after an immigration raid during the Bush administration led to the arrest of 62 undocumented night-shift workers and the company began enforcing stricter documentation checks.

Pineda, who has a wife and three children, is outspoken in support of immigrant rights. In 2023, he traveled to Washington, D.C. to advocate on behalf of undocumented workers.

“We are contributing heavily to the economy and we don’t get any recognition,” Pineda said. “That’s what makes me sad about this country. In my case, I’ve worked more than 30 years, and I don’t have Social Security to retire.”

In recent months, ICE agents have detained dozens of migrants in Chicago — at court appearances, during mandatory check-ins and in a high-profile South Loop operation that swept up at least 10 people.

While there have been no confirmed reports of ICE activity in Beardstown or at the JBS plant, fear still lingers. Some residents are reluctant to go outside, scared by false rumors spreading quickly on Facebook and WhatsApp.

But Pineda refuses to live in the shadows.

Each summer, he organizes a youth soccer tournament that brings together over 280 children from different ethnic backgrounds. It’s become a much-anticipated event, held at the town’s soccer fields — owned by JBS — against a backdrop of cornfields.

Pineda sees the tournament as more than just a game. It’s a show of resilience in a time of fear, and a reminder that immigrants contribute to a community in ways that go far beyond labor.

“It’s a lot of work — but I enjoy it. I like doing something productive,” said Pineda about the tournament. “This is something I wish I could have done in my own country, but I couldn’t. So I’m doing it here, with the children in my community, in this town. Most of them are Latino, but we also have kids from other backgrounds — African, white. And like I said, I enjoy it. I’m a volunteer.”",https://ipmnewsroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/BEardstown_main.webp,N,,2025-09-24 13:57:12.447343

Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said on CNN earlier Wednesday three people were shot, all of whom were taken to a hospital. He did not specify who the three people were.

“Preliminary information is a possible sniper,” Lyons said.

Wednesday’s shooting marked at least the third instance of an ICE or Customs and Border Protection facility being targeted by gunfire in Texas this year.

On July 4, a group of assailants targeted the Prairieland Detention Center, near Fort Worth, in what authorities described as a coordinated attack that left a local police officer shot in the neck. The officer survived, and more than a dozen people have been charged for their alleged roles in the attack.

Days later, a 27-year-old man with a rifle and tactical gear was killed by police after he opened fire on a Border Patrol facility in McAllen. Two officers and a Border Patrol employee were injured, and dozens of rounds were exchanged between the shooter and law enforcement.

And in August, law enforcement arrested a man who authorities said claimed to have a bomb in his backpack at the same Dallas ICE facility that was targeted in Wednesday’s shooting, the Department of Homeland Security said.

Bomb threat at ICE facility in August

The backstory:

An individual was arrested in late August for threatening ICE officers with what the individual claimed to be a ""detonator"" on his wrist in Dallas, Texas.

On Monday, August 25, 2025, the Federal Protective Service reported a bomb threat against an ICE facility in Dallas. The facility houses ICE’s Dallas Field Office as well as Enforcement and Removal Operations.

A male identified as 36-year-old Bratton Dean Wilkinson, arrived at the reporting entrance of the Dallas Field Office and claimed to have a bomb in his backpack at approximately 6:37 p.m.

Wilkinson showed the security officer what he claimed to be a ""detonator"" on his wrist, which issued a shelter-in-place for the facility. The officer called 911 and local police responded with a bomb squad.

Wilkinson was taken into custody by local law enforcement and charged with making terroristic threats.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox4news.com/www.fox4news.com/content/uploads/2025/09/1280/720/good-day-clean-wednesday-2025_09_24-kdfweme001_03__00.21.53.54-e1758716922856.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-09-24 09:57:11.622201

No ICE agents were shot, a source told CBS News Texas' Ken Molestina.

""My hearts and prayers go out to my officers and agents, [that's] my biggest concern as well as everyone in that area but this just shows the violence has been increased against ICE officers and agents,"" Lyons told CNN.

Texas Department of Transportation cameras near the facility showed a heavy first responder presence with dozens of units.

""While we don't know motive yet, we know that our ICE law enforcement is facing unprecedented violence against them. It must stop,"" Noem said on X.

""Please join me in prayer for the injured and their families from this morning's active shooter incident at the ICE facility in Dallas,"" Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said on X. ""Violence and terror is never the answer to anything.""

The facility is located at 8101 N. Stemmons Fwy. in Dallas. Law enforcement officials said ATF and FBI agents were on scene to assist DPD in the investigation.

Second ICE facility attack in Texas in 2025

A Fourth of July attack at a Texas immigration detention center injured a police officer, who was shot in the neck.

Attackers dressed in black military-style clothing opened fire outside the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, southwest of Dallas, federal prosecutors said. At least 11 people have been charged in connection with the attack.

""The obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop,"" Vice President JD Vance said on X. ""I'm praying for everyone hurt in this attack and for their families.""

That was in the 1930s, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt fired FTC commissioner William Humphrey over policy disagreements tied to his New Deal.

Do you have déjà vu?

The Supreme Court said Monday it will take up another FTC commissioner’s firing at the hands of President Trump.

But as the court reconsiders the 90-year precedent set by the earlier case, it’s a different landscape. The 1935 Supreme Court overruled Roosevelt’s firing, but Trump is betting the current conservative majority will agree the modern FTC wields too much executive power to be shielded from presidential control.

Let’s wind back the tape: Humphrey was nominated to the FTC by former President Herbert Hoover, a Republican, and commissioned for a seven-year term. After Roosevelt, a Democrat, took the White House, he sought Humphrey’s resignation so that the New Deal could be “carried out most effectively” with his own personnel at the FTC.

Humphrey declined to resign, and Roosevelt fired him, prompting the legal challenge. However, Humphrey died before the Supreme Court could decide the case.

Still, the executors of his estate pressed on and won. The court ruled in Humphrey’s Executor v. United States that the FTC’s removal protections were constitutional, so his firing was not allowed.

Fast-forward to today: Trump fired FTC commissioner Rebecca Slaughter in March. Slaughter was initially nominated to the FTC by Trump in 2018, but former President Biden tapped her for a second term in 2023, which would expire in 2029.

Many court watchers already believed Humphrey’s Executor was at death’s door prior to the Supreme Court’s announcement Monday that it will review Slaughter’s firing.

The court in 2020 struck down removal protections at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in Selia Law LLC v. CFPB. The following year, the court in Collins v. Yellen invalidated similar protections at the Federal Housing Finance Agency.

In both, the conservative majority rooted its reasoning in how a single director leads each agency. It limited the reach of Humphrey’s Executor to only multimember agencies without outright overruling the precedent.

“There certainly has long-been tension between the court’s holding in Selia Law and the existence of independent agencies — there’s been tension between the court’s holding and the continued existence of the civil service,” Julian Davis Mortenson, a University of Michigan law professor, told The Gavel.

“But for the court to eliminate the recognition of the validity of the tenure protections of the FTC would undo not only a case from the 1930s but would undo important elements of quite recent precedent, as well,” he said.

Trump’s second-term firings tee up what’s left. Like the FTC, Trump has attempted to fire officials without cause at the multimember National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board, Federal Labor Relations Authority, Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, National Credit Union Administration, Consumer Product Safety Commission and National Transportation Safety Board.

All of them sparked lawsuits, and the Supreme Court has so far sided with the administration.

Trump’s argument raises Humphrey’s Executor’s other limitation: an agency must exercise “quasi-judicial” or “quasi-legislative” power, not executive power, for Congress to shield it from the president’s at-will firing authority.

The Supreme Court in 1935 found the FTC met the criteria, pointing to its function making reports and recommendations to Congress.

Today’s conservative-majority court has cast doubt.

“The Court’s conclusion that the FTC did not exercise executive power has not withstood the test of time,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in a footnote when deciding Selia Law.

Even if the ruling was sound 90 years ago, the justices will confront whether the federal bureaucracy’s increased power in the intervening years changes the equation.

The Trump administration’s primary argument is that the Supreme Court can keep the logic of Humphrey’s Executor intact and merely hold that it doesn’t cover the FTC.

It would follow a series of cases in which the conservative majority has already taken aim at the rise of the so-called “fourth branch of government.” Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump’s first appointee to the court, explained the view perhaps most succinctly during 2023 argument involving the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

“This is not your grandfather’s SEC, right?” Gorsuch quipped.

IN FOCUS

Another US attorney bites the dust

Erik Siebert, former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, resigned Friday amid pressure to prosecute one of Trump’s most prominent adversaries.

Enter Lindsey Halligan, a senior White House aide and former Trump defense attorney, who was tapped by Trump to lead the office on an interim basis — and, it seems, to push ahead with taking on the president’s foes.

“Lindsey Halligan is a really good lawyer, and likes you, a lot,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post directly addressed to Attorney General Pam Bondi.

“We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility,” the president continued. “They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!”

Halligan assumed the post Monday, according to a post on X by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, another ex-Trump attorney.

It’s the latest installation of a Trump loyalist into the important federal prosecuting offices as the president has vowed to seek legal retribution against his perceived enemies.

Siebert’s resignation came after he resisted pursuing mortgage fraud charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James (D). Trump said Friday that he wanted Siebert “out.”

The president said he didn’t approve of Siebert because he had the support of Virginia’s Democratic senators. However, several news outlets reported the pressure campaign and the office’s apparent failure to uncover enough incriminating evidence to support bringing an indictment against New York’s top prosecutor.

James’s civil fraud case against Trump and his business empire made her a focus of his ire. She won a nearly $500 million penalty against him that was recently wiped by an appeals court, though her office’s victory was otherwise kept intact. Both Trump and James’s office have appealed to the state’s highest court.

The allegations against James stem from a Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) criminal referral that suggested she claimed a Virginia home as a primary residence while holding public office in New York and residing there.

The FHFA also lodged mortgage fraud allegations against Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Federal Reserve board of governors member Lisa Cook, who Trump attempted to fire over the matter, prompting a legal challenge now pending before the Supreme Court.

Trump has installed his preferred top federal prosecutors without congressional approval at least four other times, in New Jersey, Nevada, Central California and Northern New York.

In New Jersey, Trump selected his former personal lawyer and White House aide Alina Habba to serve as interim U.S. attorney, but when judges declined to extend that status, he circumvented their say by withdrawing her formal nomination to the post and putting her in the role on an acting basis.

Habba still holds that post today, even though a judge last month ruled that she has been unlawfully serving in it after lawyers for two New Jersey criminal defendants argued she did not have the authority to prosecute their case after the 120-day clock on her interim status ran out. The Trump administration has appealed that decision.

A similar maneuver occurred in the Northern District of New York, where judges refused to extend the interim term of Trump’s chief federal prosecutor there, John Sarcone III. Sarcone was made acting U.S. attorney.

Both Sigal Chattah, the U.S. attorney in Nevada, and Bill Essayli, the U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, which covers Los Angeles, saw their titles swapped to “acting” so they could remain in their posts longer without Senate confirmation, as well.

Though Trump’s moves have raised the specter of a politicized Justice Department, the president’s allies insist that the moves should be seen as par for the course.

Mike Davis, a Trump ally and head of the conservative Article III Project, wrote on X after Siebert’s resignation that DOJ’s chain of command goes straight up to the president and that checks, like judges and jurors, are already built into the system.

“This post-Watergate fiction the duly elected President doesn’t run the executive branch is both unconstitutional and dangerous,” Davis said. “And it seems to only apply to Republican presidents.”

And at a press conference Monday, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro rejected the notion that the president’s whims would affect her office.

“Politicization!” Pirro interjected in response to a reporter’s question about the matter. “No, I am not — I am not worried about that at all.”

Kirk killing response fuels free speech debate

The Trump administration’s quest for punishment in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s killing has sparked a debate surrounding free speech.

Attorney General Pam Bondi last week said the administration will go after people for hate speech, and her deputy, Todd Blanche, has suggested that protestors who interrupted Trump’s recent dinner at a seafood restaurant could face racketeering charges.

Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chair Brendan Carr has pressured ABC to suspend late-night comedian Jimmy Kimmel after he accused conservatives of trying to score “political points” off Kirk’s assassination.

And on Monday, Trump formally designated antifa as a domestic terror organization.

“The Department of Justice is also investigating networks of radical-left maniacs who fund, organize, fuel and perpetrate political violence,” Trump said at Kirk’s funeral this past weekend. “And we think we know who many of them are. But law enforcement can only be the beginning of our response to Charlie’s murder.”

Antifa, short for “anti-fascists,” is not a single organization; it’s a decentralized movement, or ideology, whose far-left adherents have often tangled with far-right groups at demonstrations.

Trump’s order pertains only to applicable law — and no one statute targeting domestic terrorism exists. It specifically states that it does not create “any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States.”

As many of Trump’s allies voice support, the administration’s pressure on Kimmel’s show has led to push back from some conservatives who’ve long raised alarm about the federal government trampling on free speech.

“I got to say, that’s right out of ‘Goodfellas,’” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said on his podcast of the FCC chair’s pressure on Kimmel.

“That’s right out of a mafioso coming into a bar, going, ‘Nice bar you have here, it would be a shame if something happened to it,’” Cruz continued.

Many Republicans remain behind Trump, but Cruz’s comments were later endorsed by two other GOP senators, Dave McCormick (Pa.) and Mitch McConnell (Ky.), and The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board.

The debate has marked a homecoming moment for Murthy v. Missouri, when the Supreme Court last year declined to rule that the Biden administration’s jawboning of social media platforms to take down certain content violated the First Amendment.

The decision is making the rounds on social media again, but the court merely ruled those plaintiffs had no legal right to sue, known as standing. It didn’t reach the free speech issues.

The true, relevant case is National Rifle Association v. Vullo, which was also decided last year. The justices ruled a New York regulator couldn’t encourage insurers and banks to sever ties with the gun rights group without violating the First Amendment.

“Government officials cannot attempt to coerce private parties in order to punish or suppress views that the government disfavors,” liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the unanimous court.

Kimmel, ABC and its parent company, Disney, haven’t mounted any legal challenges. If one arises, expect Vullo to play a dominant role.

A key hurdle for any lawsuit, however, is that some of the pressure was driven by companies, which unlike the government are not covered by the First Amendment.

Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair, which each own various ABC affiliates and have condemned Kimmel over his recent remarks, announced hours before he was set to return they will not air his show. Nexstar also owns The Hill.

Another key front to watch: Bondi’s suggestion that the government will “absolutely target” hate speech.

She has cleaned up her comments, writing that “Hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence is NOT protected by the First Amendment. It’s a crime,” pointing to federal statutes banning threats against public officials.

Hate speech is generally protected under the First Amendment. As recently as 2017, conservative Justice Samuel Alito called it a “bedrock” First Amendment principle that “speech may not be banned on the ground that it expresses ideas that offend.”

Supreme Court precedent only leaves room for narrow exceptions, like unprotected “true threats.” The court ruled in 2023 the speaker must be aware they are acting recklessly for prosecutors to charge it as a crime.

One source close to the White House told our colleague Brett Samuels that the controversy was the latest instance in which Bondi “overspoke.”

Fight over DOJ’s voter data demands intensifies

The Trump administration’s effort for states to turn over voter data is heating up.

Many Democratic election officials are resisting, and the Justice Department has started to sue.

Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson (D) and Nevada Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar (D) confirmed their offices received a letter from the Justice Department seeking copies of their statewide voter registration lists.

Federal law requires states to make “available for public inspection” certain voter records. But the officials pushed back against the demand as “unprecedented,” a move they framed as another example of executive overreach by the Trump administration.

“These requests from the DOJ are not normal,” Aguilar said during a press briefing held by the nonpartisan States United Democracy Center. “On the surface, it may seem like regular oversight, but it’s not.”

The DOJ’s demands come in response to Trump’s election integrity executive order he signed in March.

Judges have halted some of the more dramatic overhauls concerning documentary proof-of-citizenship requirements and mail-in voting after the Democratic National Committee, blue states and private groups sued.

But another section remains in effect that directs Bondi, the attorney general, to take appropriate action against states that fail to make reasonable efforts to maintain their voter rolls, as required by federal law.

The Justice Department says the voter data is needed for Bondi to determine if the states are complying.

After sending letters over the summer, the Trump administration escalated the fight earlier this month by suing two Democratic-led states that resisted — Oregon and Maine — to force them to turn over the data.

“I reiterate my deep concern with DOJ’s unexplained request for sensitive personal data concerning roughly one million Maine voters – a request that far exceeds what would be necessary for legitimate evaluation of Maine’s compliance with our obligations under law,” Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows (D) told government lawyers in an Aug. 8 letter recently made public in court filings.

The Justice Department wrote in court filings last week, “Maine has violated three federal statutes and is actively thwarting the Attorney General’s performance of her duties to ensure that States fairly administer Federal Elections.”

Benson, the secretary of state for Michigan, said the effort comes amid other bids by the Trump administration to “change the voting processes” ahead of the 2026 elections.

“That, alongside this power grab, is extremely alarming,” she said, “and we believe should concern all Americans, when the president directs the Justice Department to intimidate state election officials in a way that would pressure us to turn over personal information about registered voters in our state that we are under oath to protect.”

Benson added that pushback has come from election officials from both political parties across the country.

“It’s something that we, as secretaries of state, will not allow and will not stand for,” she said.

PETITION PILE

Petitions to take up cases that the justices are keeping a close eye on.

This marks our third week of previewing cases the Supreme Court will consider granting at its “long conference,” when the justices work through the build-up of petitions over the summer.

We’ll have one final list of previews in next week’s edition, but this week, we focus on petitions filed by state officials:

Clean Water Act (Ohio): Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost (R) wants to revive the state’s lawsuit seeking penalties against a natural-gas pipeline in the state for allegedly discharging millions of gallons of diesel-laced fluid into Ohio waters. The case concerns Section 401 of the Clean Water Act. It gives states a role in certifying projects meet water-quality standards, but states waive the power if they don’t act within a year of a certification “request.” The lower courts ruled Ohio waived its claims, but the state wants the justices to review whether the pipeline’s “request” was valid and a second legal question. The case is Ohio ex rel. Yost v. Rover Pipeline.

New Orleans prison (Louisiana): Represented by Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill (R), New Orleans’ sheriff hopes to wipe the court-ordered construction of an 89-bed facility for detainees with mental health needs. The order stems from a 2012 lawsuit filed by inmates claiming inadequate housing that violated their constitutional rights. The federal government has long been involved in the case and urged the justices to stay out, noting the facility was already nearly 70-percent complete and would likely be finished, anyways. Louisiana’s appeal concerns thorny questions over if it is entitled to end the court order under the Prison Litigation Reform Act. The case is Hutson v. United States.

Qualified immunity (Pennsylvania): Pennsylvania Attorney General Dave Sunday (R) requests the Supreme Court grant qualified immunity to John Wetzel, the state’s former top corrections official who was sued by death-row inmate Roy Lee Williams. A convicted murderer with a history of mental illness, Willams says his constitutional protection against cruel and unusual punishment was violated when he spent 26 years in solitary confinement under a former state policy. Wetzel is entitled to qualified immunity unless he violated Williams’ “clearly established” constitutional right. The courts have now cast doubt on the constitutionality of the old policy, but Pennsylvania it was blessed decades ago by an appeals court. The case is Wetzel v. Williams.

Wiped conviction (Maryland): Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) seeks to reinstate Charles Martin’s attempted murder conviction, which was wiped because prosecutors failed to turn over a computer analysis report before trial. A state appellate court ruled Martin was not entitled to a new trial given the strength of other evidence. The federal courts overruled it, ordering the new trial. Maryland’s appeal points to Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, which instructs federal judges to be highly deferential in evaluating state criminal convictions. The case is Klein v. Martin.

Moot death-row case (California Supreme Court justice): California’s chief justice and a lower judge want to wipe a ruling that they violated the due process rights of death-row inmate Stephen Redd by failing for 26 years to appoint postconviction counsel as required by law. In 2023, an appeals panel ruled Redd had presented a plausible claim, but he died two months later, rendering the case moot. The court refused to wipe its decision, and the justice believes it should be tossed because she didn’t get an opportunity to appeal it further. The case is Guerrero v. Redd.

Elections (Pennsylvania legislators): 27 Republican Pennsylvania state legislators want to revive their challenge to voter registration orders by Biden and Gov. Josh Shapiro (D). The lawmakers claimed it usurped their authority under the Constitution’s Elections Clause, which gives state legislatures substantial authority over federal elections. Lower courts ruled the legislators had no legal standing to bring the case. It does not appear the high court is giving this one much attention. The case is Keefer v. Trump.

The shooter is also dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after the incident in Dallas, said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

The attack unfolded on Wednesday morning at a detention centre for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The incident follows a string of attacks on ICE facilities across the US in recent months.

The motive or targets of the attack are unclear. Fox News quoted officials as saying no law enforcement officers had been injured.

""While we don't know motive yet, we know that our ICE law enforcement is facing unprecedented violence against them,"" Noem said. ""It must stop.""

Dallas police said on X: ""The preliminary investigation determined that a suspect opened fire at a government building from an adjacent building.

""Two people were transported to the hospital with gunshot wounds. One victim died at the scene. The suspect is deceased.""

Preliminary information suggests a sniper carried out the shooting from outside the facility and hit victims in a ""secure detainee location"", Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told CNN.

He said three individuals were ""down"", including the suspected shooter.

""We're not sure on their condition,"" Lyons said.

The ICE field office in Dallas has been targeted by a series of protests this summer.

A justice department official told the BBC's US partner CBS that there was a bomb threat in late August at the facility. A suspect was arrested.

Last month shots were fired at ICE offices in San Antonio, Texas, in what investigators described as a ""targeted attack"" against federal employees.

No injuries were reported in that incident, which ICE blamed on ""political rhetoric"" and ""misinformation"" about the Trump administration's detention policies.

Another shooting occurred on the 4 July public holiday at an ICE facility in Alvarado, Texas, after a protest escalated into a faceoff with police. An officer was shot in the neck, and survived.

A curated weekday guide to major news and developments over the last 24 hours. Here’s today’s news:

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

Climate change is the “greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world” and “stupid people” created the scientific consensus on global warming, President Trump told the U.N. General Assembly yesterday. In a meandering speech, Trump also told the attendees of the summit that their countries “are going to hell,” accused the United Nations of “funding an assault on Western countries and their borders,” and questioned the global body’s purpose. Following his speech, Trump told the U.N. Secretary-General, António Guterres, that the United States is “behind the United Nations 100%.”Somini Sengupta and Lisa Friedman report for the New York Times; Franco Ordoñez reports for NPR; UN News reports.

Trump yesterday suggested he plans to meet with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva next week, stating that the two leaders had “excellent chemistry” when they briefly met during the ongoing U.N. summit. The Brazilian presidency has since confirmed the two leaders may meet. Ana Ionova reports for the New York Times; Reuters reports.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa yesterday said that South Africa is in talks with a U.S. trade representative, seeking to reduce tariffs levied by Trump on the African country. In remarks delivered at the U.N. General Assembly earlier in the day, Ramaphosa said that “trade is now being used as a weapon against a number of countries.” Doyinsola Oladipo reports for Reuters.

The U.S. military’s attacks on drug trafficking vessels are “only for television” and will not stop the world’s drug trade, Colombian President Gustavo Petro had told the Washington Post. The Trump administration should be targeting powerful Mexican and European drug cartels to effectively counter narcotics trafficking, Petro added. Samantha Schmidt reports.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR — INTERNATIONAL RESPONSES

In a shift in rhetoric, Trump posted yesterday on social media that Kyiv can “win all of Ukraine back in its original form,” elaborating that “Putin and Russia are in BIG economic trouble, and this is the time for Ukraine to act.” Earlier on, Trump confirmed in a press conference alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that NATO countries should shoot down Russian aircraft that enter their airspace. Ruth Comerford and Anthony Zurcher report for BBC News; Eli Stokols reports for POLITICO.

Zelenskyy said yesterday evening that he was surprised by Trump’s social media post but supported the “big shift” in Trump’s position. Zelenskyy said he believed that he and Trump will have a “better relation than before” and suggested that “the fact that Putin was lying to President Trump so many times also made a difference between us.” Pranav Baskar reports for the New York Times.

A Kremlin spokesperson responded today to Trump’s remarks by stating that Russia’s economy is stable and that the Russian army is advancing in Ukraine. The spokesperson said in an interview that “of course, President Trump heard Zelenskyy’s version of events. And […] this is the reason for the assessment we heard.” Anastasia Lyrchikova and Gleb Stolyarov report for Reuters.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

Gaza City’s al-Shifa hospital, one of the last functioning hospitals in the city, is overwhelmed with casualties from Israeli strikes, according to healthcare workers. A medic told BBC News that the hospital staff are operating on severely wounded patients in filthy conditions and with “minimal to hardly no anaesthesia.” Separately, the Palestine Red Crescent Society said that Israeli gunfire also rendered a key oxygen station at the Al-Quds Hospital unusable, and that Israeli military vehicles are preventing anyone inside the hospital from leaving. Jon Donnison and Rushdi Abualouf report; Abeer Salman, Ibrahim Dahman, Khader Al Zaanoun, Tareq Al Hilou, Oren Liebermann, and Tim Lister report for CNN.

Israeli tanks have moved into multiple neighbourhoods in Gaza City in the past day, according to geolocated images. Journalists working for CNN report heavy shelling and drone presence, explosions, and the sounds of gunfire in the city. Abeer Salman, Ibrahim Dahman, Khader Al Zaanoun, Tareq Al Hilou, Oren Liebermann, and Tim Lister report.

Starting today, Israel will indefinitely close the only crossing between the occupied West Bank and Jordan “at the direction of the political leadership,” a spokesperson for the Israeli authority overseeing the crossing said. Reuters report.

A group protesting Israel’s siege of Gaza by sailing to the territory on a flotilla carrying humanitarian aid early today said that it was attacked by drones, had its communications jammed, and that explosions were heard from some boats. The group suggested Israel could be behind the attack. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the incident. Ephrat Livni reports for the New York Times.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

U.N. Secretary General António Guterres said yesterday in his opening speech at the U.N. General Assembly that “the principles of the United Nations that you have established are under siege” as “we have entered an age of reckless disruption and relentless human suffering.” Guterres addressed the wars in Gaza, Ukraine, and Sudan, while adding that “the scale of death and destruction [in Gaza] are beyond any other conflict in my years as secretary general.” Farnaz Fassihi reports for the New York Times.

U.N. Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory reported yesterday that the Israeli government has shown clear intent to establish permanent control over Gaza and to annex the entire West Bank. The Israeli mission in Geneva dismissed the report’s findings, stating “Hamas has genocidal intent towards Israel, the report has everything backwards.” Olivia Le Poidevin reports for Reuters.

The U.S. Special Envoy for Syria, Tom Barrack, said yesterday that Syria and Israel are close to agreeing a “de-escalation” deal, wherein Israel will cease attacks on Syria and Syria will agree not to move machinery near the Israeli border. Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa yesterday expressed concern that Israel might be stalling talks, saying “we are scared of Israel. We are worried about Israel. It’s not the other way around.” Humeyra Pamuk reports for Reuters.

On 5 October, Syrian electoral colleges selected by regional committees will elect two-thirds of the 210-member People’s Assembly, in the first election since the overthrow of the Assad government earlier this year. The remaining third of the Assembly will be selected by al-Sharaa. Tom Perry, Suleiman al-Khalidi, Timour Azhari, Firas Makdesi, and Orhan Qereman report for Reuters.

Chinese Premier Li Qiang announced yesterday that China will no longer seek new special treatment for developing countries in World Trade Organization negotiations. Qiang presented the decision as coming from “a responsible major developing country,” signalling that Beijing will continue to claim status as a developing nation. The Wall Street Journal reports.

U.S. TECH DEVELOPMENTS

OpenAI announced yesterday that it will work with Oracle and SoftBank to open five new data centers in the United States as part of the Stargate Project. The announcement makes up 80% of the $500 billion that the companies pledged to spend on AI building facilities under a plan they unveiled in January at the White House. Cade Metz reports for the New York Times; Megan Morrone reports for Axios.

Chinese tech company Alibaba announced today that it is integrating Nvidia’s AI tools for so-called physical AI into its Cloud Intelligence software platform. Alibaba’s announcement came after its CEO Eddie Wu revealed plans to increase Alibaba’s investment in AI infrastructure in excess of the $50 billion pledged in February. Luz Ding reports for Bloomberg; Tracy Qu and Sherry Qin report for the Wall Street Journal.

Alphabet’s subsidiary, YouTube, said yesterday that it will allow accounts previously banned for spreading Covid-19 and election-related misinformation to apply for reinstatement, overriding its previous policy of treating the violations as permanent. Alphabet’s lawyer Daniel Donovan wrote to the House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-OH) yesterday, stating that the Biden administration had sought to influence the actions of platforms like YouTube and that “it is unacceptable and wrong when any government […] attempts to dictate how the Company moderates content.” Zach Vallese reports for CNBC.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

The Secret Service yesterday announced that it had seized and dismantled a cache of sophisticated equipment that was capable of shutting down the cellular network in the New York region. Officials said the network included more than 100,000 SIM cards and 300 servers and could be used for encrypted communication or to interfere with emergency response services. That there was no specific information that it posed a threat to the ongoing U.N. General Assembly, the officials said, adding that initial analysis of the data on some of the SIM cards identified ties to at least one foreign nation, as well as to criminals known to U.S. law enforcement. Eileen Sullivan reports for the New York Times.

A Florida jury yesterday found Ryan Routh guilty of attempting to assassinate Trump, assaulting a Secret Service agent, and three federal gun charges in connection with an incident on a golf course last year. Routh tried to stab himself in the neck with a pen after the verdict was handed down, and was restrained by court bailiffs. He is set to be sentenced in December. Juliette Arcodia, Carmen Gonzalez, and Corky Siemaszko report for NBC News.

Former FBI agent Peter Strzok yesterday lost a long-running lawsuit in which he alleged the first Trump administration violated his First Amendment rights by dismissing him over text messages critical of Trump. In her ruling, the judge overseeing the case said that the evidence in the case had failed to prove his constitutional rights were violated. The judge stressed that she was not ruling on whether Strzok’s firing “was the appropriate sanction” for his conduct. Josh Gerstein and Kyle Cheney report for POLITICO.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

FBI agents found documents marked as classified while executing a search warrant at former national security adviser John Bolton’s office last month, according to a court filing released yesterday. The filing suggests the documents included materials that referenced weapons of mass destruction, the U.S. mission to the U.N., and records related to the federal government’s strategic communications. Josh Gerstein and Kyle Cheney report for POLITICO.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has disbanded the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services, a long-standing committee that provided recommendations concerning women serving in the military. A Pentagon spokesperson said Hegseth decided to terminate the advisory panel as it “focused on advancing a divisive feminist agenda that hurts combat readiness.” Idrees Ali and Phil Stewart report for Reuters.

Attorney General Pam Bondi’s Chief of Staff, Chad Mizelle, is set to leave the Department of Justice, Axios reports. He currently oversees the DOJ’s Civil Division and Civil Rights Division. Mizelle said that he would continue “exposing the left-wing groups responsible for violence” across the United States and supporting the Trump administration’s work. Mike Allen reports.

The General Services Administration is seeking to rehire hundreds of federal employees responsible for managing government workspaces who were fired during Elon Musk’s downsizing effort earlier this year, according to an internal memo obtained by AP News. Joshua Goodman and Ryan J. Foley report.

The Trump administration has launched an internal investigation into FEMA employees who signed a letter to Congress warning that FEMA’s present leadership threatens effective emergency management and endangers the public. According to internal emails seen by CNN, FEMA has ordered the employees to sign non-disclosure agreements and schedule interviews with investigators as part of the probe. The disaster relief agency has placed several of the staffers who signed the letter on paid administrative leave in August. Gabe Cohen reports.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

Government officials in Eswatini and Jamaica said this week that a Jamaican citizen who was deported from the United States to a prison in Eswatini, a country to which he has no ties, has now been repatriated to Jamaica. Orville Etoria’s deportation to a prison in Eswatini generated alarm among rights groups, who argued that he had been unlawfully detained as he faced no criminal charges. John Eligon reports for the New York Times.

14 immigration judges were fired last Friday, adding to over 80 judges already let go by the Trump administration this year, sources told NPR. “The dismissal of more immigration judges is an illogical and costly setback for the nation’s immigration courts,” Matt Biggs, the president of a union that represents immigration judges, said. Ximeno Bustillo reports.

Trump was inaccurate about a wide variety of subjects. They included inflation in the US, climate policies both in the US and abroad, immigration, his role in settling international conflicts, and his standing in opinion polls. Here is a fact check of some of his remarks.

Trump’s accomplishments and popularity

Trump and wars: The president claimed, “I ended seven wars, and in all cases, they were raging, with countless thousands of people being killed. This includes Cambodia and Thailand, Kosovo and Serbia, the Congo and Rwanda — a vicious, violent war that was — Pakistan and India, Israel and Iran, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Armenia and Azerbaijan.”

But Egypt and Ethiopia were not actually at war during Trump’s time in the White House. They have a long-running and unresolved dispute about a major Ethiopian dam project on a tributary of the Nile River, but this is not a war, so Trump couldn’t have ended one there. Similarly, while Trump has previously claimed to have prevented the eruption of a new war between Serbia and Kosovo — providing few details about what he was talking about — those countries weren’t in an actual war either during Trump’s current term or during his first term, when they signed an economic normalization agreement brokered by Trump’s administration in 2020.

In addition, Trump hasn’t actually ended the conflict involving the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. The peace agreement brokered by the Trump administration and signed by the DRC and Rwanda in June did not involve the rebel coalition, allegedly backed by Rwanda, that has seized territory in the eastern DRC, and CNN reported from the ground this week: “The scores of militia groups that have fought for three decades in one of the most protracted and complex conflicts in the world are still engaging in deadly fighting, and US President Donald Trump’s claimed peace deal for the nation feels like a distant dream.”

Trump’s importance and success in addressing the other four conflicts he mentioned can be debated. Notably, while Pakistan has heaped praise upon Trump for playing a critical role in brokering its May ceasefire with India, India has rejected the claim that he did so and said it resolved the conflict directly with Pakistan.

Trump’s poll numbers: The president claimed, “I was very proud to see this morning I have the highest poll numbers I’ve ever had. Part of it is because of what we’ve done on the border. I guess the other part is what we’ve done on the economy.” It’s theoretically possible Trump saw some private polling that gave him dramatically better numbers than public polling has produced, but his standing in public polling is nowhere near his highest ever — in fact, it’s down substantially from the beginning of this year.

A New York Times polling average put Trump’s approval rating at about 43% as of Tuesday (with 54% disapproval), down from 52% approval in the first week of his second term in January (with 43% disapproval).

Similarly, a polling average produced by data journalist G. Elliott Morris put Trump’s approval rating at about 42% as of Tuesday (with about 54% disapproval), down from about 51% approval in the first days of his second term (with about 39% disapproval). And a polling average produced by data journalist Nate Silver put Trump’s approval rating at about 44% as of Tuesday (with about 53% disapproval), down from about 52% approval in the first days of the term (with about 40% disapproval).

CNN’s Poll of Polls average had Trump at 41% approval as of Tuesday (with 57% disapproval), down from 48% approval in our first average of this term in early February (with 49% disapproval). And Trump’s average ratings for his handling of immigration and the economy have both fallen from positive territory to negative territory since the beginning of the term, the averages from Morris and Silver show.

Inflation and the economy

Inflation: Trump baselessly claimed that “inflation has been defeated” under his leadership. This is vaguer than his frequent false claim that there is now “no inflation,” but there’s no basis even for the vaguer version. Inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index, has been worsening since May after hitting a four-year low in April. It was about 2.9% in August, up from about 2.7% in July; the August figure was nearly identical to the 3% rate in January, the last partial month of the Biden administration Trump said left him an “economic calamity.”

Grocery prices: Trump also claimed that under his leadership, “grocery prices are down.” False. Average grocery prices have increased during Trump’s presidency, though the prices of some individual items have fallen; Consumer Price Index figures show that average grocery prices were about 1% higher in August than they were in January, when Trump returned to the White House. And while we should be careful not to read too much into any single month of data, the increase in grocery prices from July to August was about 0.6%, which was the highest month-to-month jump since late 2022.

Electricity bills: Trump said electricity in Europe is much more expensive than in China or the US, which is generally correct. But then he added, “And our bills are coming way down.” In fact, US electricity prices are spiking, rising more than twice as fast as overall prices; Consumer Price Index figures show they were about 6.2% higher in August than they were a year prior and about 4.9% higher in August than they were in January.

Foreign investment: Trump, talking about “new investment into the United States,” claimed, “In just eight months since I took office, we have secured commitments and money already paid for $17 trillion.” This figure is unproved at best. Just a day ago, Trump’s own White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, used a much lower figure, saying Trump “has secured nearly $9 trillion in US investment.” She did say “we expect that number to be upwards of $15 trillion very soon,” but Trump didn’t explain how an additional $8 trillion supposedly materialized in a day — and even Leavitt’s $9 trillion figure should be treated with skepticism, since it is heavily based on vague semi-commitments from foreign countries that may never materialize.

Environment and energy

Global warming and climate change: Trump called climate change “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world,” and he also referred to “the global warming hoax.” He didn’t precisely explain what he was calling the con job or hoax, but global warming is a demonstrated fact. Trump also baselessly suggested that scientists now use the phrase “climate change” instead of “global warming” so that they can’t be accused of getting things wrong if the world ends up cooling; in reality, climate scientists use both phrases, often saying “global warming” when referring to the long-term trend of increasing global temperature and “climate change” when referring to the numerous effects the world is experiencing because of that trend.

NASA says on its website: “‘Climate change’ encompasses global warming, but refers to the broader range of changes that are happening to our planet. These include rising sea levels; shrinking mountain glaciers; accelerating ice melt in Greenland, Antarctica and the Arctic; and shifts in flower/plant blooming times.”

For example, a 2023 report from the UN’s climate change panel, titled “Climate Change 2023: Synthesis Report,” said this: “Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850-1900 in 2011-2020.” In a section titled “Future Climate Change,” the report also said this: “Continued greenhouse gas emissions will lead to increasing global warming, with the best estimate of reaching 1.5°C in the near term in considered scenarios and modelled pathways. Every increment of global warming will intensify multiple and concurrent hazards (high confidence).”

China and wind power: Trump repeated his false claim that although China is the leading manufacturer of wind turbines, “they have very few wind farms” themselves. He added, “So why is it that they build them and they send them all over the world, but they barely use them? You know, they use coal, they use gas, they use almost anything, but they don’t like wind. But they sure as hell like selling the windmills.” In reality, China is the world leader in the generation of wind power and has massive wind farms onshore and offshore; it continues to install additional wind capacity much faster than the US.

Coal and renewables: Trump referred to coal as “clean, beautiful coal,” as he usually does, but coal is just not clean; its use as a power source creates polluting emissions that harm humans and the environment, even with technological improvements that can reduce the emissions levels. Trump also wrongly said renewable energy sources “don’t work,” saying that “they’re not strong enough to fire up the plants that you need to make your country great” and that “the wind doesn’t blow.” But energy generated by wind is still a useful power source when the wind isn’t blowing, just as solar energy is still a useful power source when the sun isn’t shining — since the energy can be stored in industrial batteries or using other methods, allowing it to be deployed as part of a power mix along with energy from traditional fossil fuels.

The Paris climate accord: Trump repeated some false claims about the Paris climate accord from which he has withdrawn the US during each of his presidencies.

At one point, he wrongly said the US was “supposed to pay like $1 trillion” under the accord. It wasn’t. The US has never spent or committed anywhere close to $1 trillion in connection to the accord; Biden pledged upon taking office to pay $11.4 billion per year toward international climate financing, but Congress appropriated less than even that.

Trump also said, “China didn’t have to pay until 2030.” This was confusing, but it appeared to be a reference to his previous false claim that the accord gave China more time than the US to hit its targets for reducing carbon emissions. In reality, the accord came into effect for all participating countries at the same time, November 2016, but allowed each country to set its own voluntary targets for reducing carbon emissions. China picked 2030 as the year it planned to meet its primary targets while the US picked 2025, but this was simply a choice of each country.

Immigration

Biden and migrants: Touting his efforts to secure the southern border, Trump said, “Just a year ago, millions and millions of people were pouring in, 25 million all together over the four years of the incompetent Biden administration.” The “25 million” figure is fictional; even Trump’s previous “21 million” figure was a wild exaggeration. Through December 2024, the last full month under the Biden administration, the federal government had recorded under 11 million nationwide “encounters” with migrants during that administration, including millions who were rapidly expelled from the country; even adding in the so-called gotaways who evaded detection, estimated by House Republicans as being roughly 2.2 million, there’s no way the total was even close to what Trump has said.

Biden and migrant children: Trump repeated his misleading claim that “the previous administration also lost nearly 300,000 children,” then quickly said it was “more than 300,000 children.” He continued to say that many of these children “have been raped, exploited and abused and sold,” while others are dead.

He appeared to be referring to a 2024 report from the Homeland Security Department’s Office of Inspector General, which said Immigration and Customs Enforcement reported more than 32,000 unaccompanied migrant children failed to appear as scheduled for immigration court hearings after being released or transferred out of custody between fiscal years 2019 and 2023. The report also said that 291,000 unaccompanied migrant children during this period were not given notices to appear in court.

There are two key things to note here. First, the period covered by the report includes two years and four months under the first Trump administration. Second, while the report said immigration authorities have “no assurances” these children “are safe from trafficking, exploitation, or forced labor,” it did not definitively assert that any of them were being exploited or had been killed.

Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, told CNN last summer: “Long story short, no, there are not 320,000 kids missing. 32,000 kids missed court. That doesn’t mean they’re missing, it means they missed court (either because their sponsor didn’t bring them or they are teenagers who didn’t want to show up). The remaining 291,000 cases mentioned by the OIG are cases where ICE hasn’t filed the paperwork to start their immigration court cases.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-09-23t150419z-431107609-rc2rxgafv1i8-rtrmadp-3-un-assembly-trump.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-09-24 09:56:52.404126

The July documents included proposals from private companies — among them The GEO Group, which operates the Aurora Detention Center — seeking a government contract.
“Current immigration detention sites, including the GEO detention facility in Aurora, are already notorious for their inhumane conditions, including persistent medical negligence, inadequate nutrition, and routine rights violations,” Macdonald has said.
In August, the ACLU filed another FOIA request, this time requesting ICE documents that show the agency’s “ramp-up plans for adding detention capacity” in Colorado and Wyoming.
The Colorado Springs Migrant Detention Facility in Colorado Springs.","The ACLU of Colorado filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) seeking records on the government’s plans for expanding its detention capacity in the state.

“Already, our previous requests and subsequent lawsuit have revealed how ICE may spend some of its record $45 billion budget intended for immigration detention,” said Tim Macdonald, ACLU of Colorado legal director, in a statement.

The complaint follows ICE’s July release of more than 100 pages of records, which came only after the ACLU sued the agency for failing to respond to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.

The July documents included proposals from private companies — among them The GEO Group, which operates the Aurora Detention Center — seeking a government contract. Those documents were heavily redacted, including portions describing the housing units for detainees.

Last year, the minor children of a Nicaraguan asylum seeker who died in the Aurora Detention Center in 2022 filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the for-profit company and its medical director.

“Current immigration detention sites, including the GEO detention facility in Aurora, are already notorious for their inhumane conditions, including persistent medical negligence, inadequate nutrition, and routine rights violations,” Macdonald has said. “It is unconscionable to go on to expand this cruel, for-profit detention machine.”

The ACLU of Colorado identified at least two other deaths at the facility since 2012 in a 2019 report titled “Cashing in on Cruelty.” The ACLU found multiple incidents reflecting a lack of care or competence.

The GEO Group operates 18 facilities that are under contract to provide services for ICE across the country, including the Cheyenne Mountain Center, a 700-bed facility in Colorado Springs originally designed as a reentry facility for the state until closing in 2020.

Headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida, the GEO Group operates private for-profit prisons and mental health facilities in seven U.S. states.

In August, the ACLU filed another FOIA request, this time requesting ICE documents that show the agency’s “ramp-up plans for adding detention capacity” in Colorado and Wyoming.

According to the lawsuit filed Tuesday, ICE has not yet responded.

After an inquiry seeking comment on the lawsuit Tuesday, an ICE spokesperson told The Denver Gazette that the agency does not comment on pending or ongoing litigation.

ICE owns five detention facilities, but relies on private prison companies to hold the majority of those in its custody.

The Trump administration told Colorado’s congressional delegation in August that it plans to reopen the shuttered Hudson Correctional Facility as an immigration detention center.

Located about 30 miles northeast of Denver in Weld County, the Hudson Correctional Facility was a medium-security prison built in 2009. The facility had held inmates from Alaska until 2014, when it closed.

Owned by a real estate investment firm, the prison is operated by The GEO Group.

With space for 1,250 inmates, the prison could house about three-quarters of Hudson’s 1,651 residents.

The ACLU has noted that many of the proposed sites — including Hudson — have not been operational for years.

Among the facilities identified:

Huerfano County Correctional Center in Walsenburg.

Cheyenne Mountain Center in Colorado Springs.

The Baptiste Migrant Detention Facility in La Junta.

The Colorado Springs Migrant Detention Facility in Colorado Springs.

One of the most charming aspects of the United States of America is the immense diversity. There is a unique culture behind every individual and family, and the U.S. is a place where those cultures get the opportunity to connect.

Our country was founded on a notion of giving people the chance to find better opportunities, so why are we throwing that aim away now?

Growing up, I was taught that the most essential principles of the U.S. Constitution were the amendments that guarantee our freedom, liberty and individuality. However, it appears the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration policies are moving the U.S. farther and farther away from those principles. It is heartbreaking to realize Hispanic families like mine are being treated as if we are unwanted in the country we call home.

This reality hit even harder when the Supreme Court decided to lift restrictions on immigration enforcement’s practices in June, combatting a ruling made in a lawsuit filed after three men were unreasonably arrested near a Pasadena bus stop.

According to the lawsuit, The arrests were targeted — the men complied with officers and confirmed their citizenship but were profiled as immigrants and detained regardless. U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong ruled in favor of the men in July, determining that stops and searches in Southern California could no longer be based on race or language and required reasonable suspicion.

Despite this, Trump’s administration filed an emergency request that put a hold on the ruling and allowed the case to go to the Supreme Court. In early September, the initial decisions were overruled with little explanation. Federal officers were once again allowed to racially profile in Southern California, and the ruling makes it easier for other states to follow suit.

Communities like mine know all too well what these practices look like: discrimination disguised as law enforcement.

I have always been proud to say my immigrant parents built a stable life for me and my siblings by sacrificing much of themselves during their journey. I have never hesitated to celebrate my cultural traditions or raise my voice when needed. But with this Supreme Court decision, my confidence has begun to waver. Expressing my cultural identity feels less like a celebration and more like a risk.

The ruling, combined with the Trump administration’s ever-increasing federal pressure to deliver on deportation quotas, has shot fear through every immigrant community in America, but especially my own Hispanic community. Detention means silence, no communication with your loved ones and even uncertainty of your survival. Many are dragged through the unknown and forced to abandon everything they have ever built — families are torn apart, uncertain if they will ever reunite.

If the Supreme Court can ignore the freedoms of thousands, what will stop it from ignoring yours?

Though ICE is allegedly targeting immigrants with criminal records, everyday people are being caught in the crossfire. The Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee every individual protection against unreasonable searches and the right to equal protection under the law. Today, anyone walking the streets of Los Angeles risks unreasonable detention for nothing more than their skin color or the language they are speaking on the phone.

The U.S. has always been a cultural melting pot. This country was founded on the hopes of achieving big dreams, and was pioneered by those seeking a better future. This freedom means little if it can be stripped away at any moment, and that is the reality we are currently living in.

I still want to keep believing in my country’s promise, but this alone will not protect me. The change we need can only occur if people stay informed. History has shown that when one group is met with injustice, it doesn’t just stop there.

Today, it is my community at risk — tomorrow it could be yours.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthtimes.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DaniMurphy_ICEProfiling_RGB_JPG_BG.jpg?fit=1900%2C1056&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-24 12:57:51.591469

Joint Committee on Human Rights

Transnational repression in the UK

Seventh Report of Session 2024–25 HC 681 / HL Paper 160

[…]

4 INTERPOL and visa applications

The International Criminal Police Organisation (INTERPOL)

64. INTERPOL's Notice [126] and Diffusion [127] mechanisms are vital tools for global safety. [128] Yet, despite INTERPOL's constitutional prohibition on politically motivated Notices, these mechanisms are being systematically exploited by authoritarian states as TNR tools. [129] Red Notices [130] are routinely used to pursue political opponents, human rights defenders, and journalists beyond national borders. [131] We heard Red Notices likened to ""the sniper rifle of autocrats… long-distance, targeted, and highly effective"". [132] States also often coordinate their efforts, with multiple countries supporting each other's abusive requests. [133] Currently there is no requirement or mechanism for INTERPOL or the Home Office to alert people at risk of politically motivated reprisals by foreign governments of a Red Notice being issued against them. [134]

65. Politically motivated Red Notices have a profound and far-reaching impact on the individuals targeted. [135] Such Notices may severely restrict a person's ability to travel, access financial services or maintain legal residency abroad. Rhys Davies, Barrister, Temple Garden Chambers, told us that a Red Notice:

Can ruin your life… You will be in constant fear that, if you were to go on holiday to Spain, an overzealous passport control officer might think they have an international super-criminal… and will detain you. There is no aspect of your life that this will not touch upon. [136]

There is often no way for an individual to know whether they are subject to a Red Notice. Individuals are often required to make direct enquiries to INTERPOL to determine whether they are subject to a Red Notice, a process that can take several months. This lack of transparency can leave individuals uncertain as to whether they can travel safely without risking detention. [137]

66. The Committee received evidence on the conduct of individual member states alleged to have engaged in systematic misuse of INTERPOL mechanisms. We were told that misuse of INTERPOL Notices was widespread, but that China, Russia, and Turkey were the most prolific abusers of INTERPOL's Notice system. [138] China was said to employ a distinct strategy, using INTERPOL Notices to locate individuals and then applying coercive pressure, through threats to family members, to compel their return. The Committee also heard that Turkey had begun to misuse Interpol's Stolen and Lost Travel Documents database by falsely reporting documents as stolen, thereby facilitating the return of targeted individuals.

67. In recent years, INTERPOL has undertaken a number of measures to strengthen the integrity of its systems. Despite confidence by the organisation that these measures work, [139] attempted Red Notice abuse continues. In 2016, a dedicated Notices & Diffusions Task Force (NDTF) was created within INTERPOL's General Secretariat, with responsibility for conducting a robust quality and legal compliance review for all incoming Notices and Diffusions prior to their publication. The Government has also seconded two individuals to the NDTF. [140] A Home Office official told us that this is ""an effective way of helping to ensure that Interpol's processes and safeguards are properly adhered to"". [141] However, we were told that despite the creation of the NDTF very few Red Notices (around 6%) are refused in the first instance. [142]

68. INTERPOL has also set up a Commission for the Control of Interpol's Files (CCF), an independent body which is responsible for deciding on a request for deletion and/or correction of data related to an INTERPOL Notice. However, the CCF has been ""experiencing delays in meeting its deadlines due to increases in [its workload]"". In addition to managing this increase, the CCF faces the task of clearing its backlog of cases. [143] We were told that this means it can take ""years"" for politically motivated Red Notices to be removed, [144] during which time these individuals face severe restrictions on travel and are at risk of detention. [145]

69. The Home Office and the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) often work closely together on lobbying and diplomatic engagement. However, we were unable to establish in any detail how coordination is conducted on INTERPOL related issues and no details were given on how individuals who have been subject to a politically motivated Red Notice might be supported by the Government. Whilst there may be many legitimate reasons why some individuals should not be informed of the existence of Red Notices against them, we were told that there may be some circumstances where the Government should consider making exceptions to the rule of non-disclosure. Rhys Davies told us:

There must be a way to devise appropriate checks and balances—such as enabling a judge to scrutinise which Red Notices are extant against British nationals and say whether those could be disclosed. [146]

70. International human rights lawyers Ben Keith and Rhys Davies told us that the UK could help prevent abuse of INTERPOL mechanisms by engaging more proactively with INTERPOL and advocating for reform. [147] While the UK has previously demonstrated its diplomatic influence and lobbying ability, working alongside its 'Five Eyes' partners [148] to block the election of controversial candidates to the role of INTERPOL President, witnesses expressed concern that the UK's role in shaping INTERPOL's strategic direction remains limited. [149] Rhys Davies told us that when it comes to international leadership on INTERPOL, often ""the ship is being steered by others', with the UK's role in shaping INTERPOL's strategic direction appearing limited. [150]

71. CONCLUSION

We are deeply concerned by the misuse of INTERPOL Red Notices by certain member states. Refusal by the INTERPOL secretariat to acknowledge that there is a problem and to take remedial action poses a significant threat to the rights and freedoms of individuals targeted by authoritarian regimes and sends a message that this behaviour is acceptable.

72. RECOMMENDATION

We recommend the Government works with 'Five Eyes' and other partners to track and expose malicious, vexatious, and politically motivated use of Red Notices by member states. In doing so, the Government should advocate for greater transparency and accountability within INTERPOL's procedures and advocate for the use of corrective measures and suspensions for systematic abusers of INTERPOL mechanisms.

73. CONCLUSION

Currently there is no requirement for INTERPOL to alert people at risk of politically motivated reprisals by foreign governments of a Notice being issued against them. This lack of transparency is particularly problematic in cases where individuals face credible risk of TNR, effectively restricting their ability to travel freely. Whilst there may be many legitimate reasons why some individuals should not be informed of the existence of Red Notices against them, we see a need for greater support for those whose lives are impacted by attempts to use this system maliciously.

74. RECOMMENDATION

While the option exists for individuals to request access to or removal of their data via INTERPOL's independent oversight body, the Commission for the Control of INTERPOL's Files, this process is often significantly delayed and may not offer timely protection to those at immediate risk. The Government should undertake a review of existing procedures to consider whether it is possible to introduce a formal mechanism by which the Home Office or the National Crime Agency (NCA) may alert individuals of the existence of a Red Notice or Diffusion where there is a strong basis to believe it has been politically motivated.

75. RECOMMENDATION

In addition, the Government should take proactive steps to protect individuals facing an extradition risk due to a politically motivated Red Notice. A voluntary mechanism should be introduced to allow targeted British Nationals to notify the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) of planned travel to high-risk countries. This would give UK missions advance notice and allow them to prepare for early intervention if needed.

Impact on visa applications

76. INTERPOL Red Notices can have a significant impact on immigration and asylum applications. The presence of a politically motivated Red Notice may lead to an automatic presumption of criminality, resulting in the refusal of applications for asylum or citizenship. The Government told the Committee that:

There are clear procedures in place to ensure that INTERPOL notices do not unfairly influence immigration decisions. Where an asylum claim is refused and the Notice comes from the applicant's country of origin, the case may be referred to the National Crime Agency (NCA) or extradition authorities. [151]

77. However, witnesses argued that there was a need for enhanced training for Home Office officials on the use and implications of politically motivated INTERPOL Red Notices in asylum and immigration cases. Ben Keith, Barrister at 5 St Andrew's Hill, said that:

If somebody applies for a visa to come to the United Kingdom with a Red Notice against them, you might assume they were a criminal. It might be from Russia; it might be from another state. They might have been a former politician. There is a significant lack of education [in the Civil Service] about trying to analyse whether a Red Notice is in fact genuine. [152]

Country Policy and Information Notes, used in assessing asylum claims, do not contain specific information on threats related to TNR. [153] We heard that once a Red Notice was in place, it required significant funding, expertise and time to properly to challenge it in relation to an immigration or asylum decision.

78. CONCLUSION

The presence of a politically motivated INTERPOL Red Notice can have serious implications for individuals seeking asylum or applying for visas, often resulting in automatic refusal without due consideration of the underlying political context.

79. RECOMMENDATION

The Home Office should ensure that all relevant immigration staff are adequately trained and informed about the potential misuse of Red Notices. In addition, the Country Policy and Information Notes used in assessing asylum claims should be revised to explicitly address the threat of transnational repression. The Government should update the Committee within six months, outlining what specific steps it has taken to improve training for Home Office staff around politically motivated Red Notices.

The video shows agents trying to get Hip Mejía to come outside the house to show them identification.
However, two days later, ICE returned to their home and took Hip Mejía into custody, his wife said.
The family's experience is part of an attempt by ICE to deliver on US President Donald Trump's promise of mass deportations.","A video of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents with a 5-year-old autistic girl outside her family home in Leominster, Massachusetts generated alarm after it was published Monday by NBCUniversal's Spanish-language Telemundo Nueva Inglaterra.

While Telemundo first reported that the family accused Immigration and Customs Enforcement of holding the girl in an effort to pressure her father, 22-year-old Edward Hip Mejía, to surrender to ICE, and the agency initially did not respond to a request for comment, the outlet updated the article on Tuesday, including with a comment from a government spokesperson.

The video from last Tuesday shows the little girl seated outside an open vehicle, drinking from a water bottle while surrounded by law enforcement. A man can be heard shouting ""Don't touch her!"" and a woman identified as the girl's mother tells one agent that the others took her daughter, who is 5 years old and on the autism spectrum. She also says, ""Give me my daughter back.""

The mother, who did not want her name shared, told Telemundo that her husband called her while driving with their daughter because he thought they were being followed. Her husband ""managed to run back into the parking lot of my house,"" she said, and her daughter was left with the agents. The video shows agents trying to get Hip Mejía to come outside the house to show them identification.

According to NBC Boston, ""Leominster police arrived at the scene, recovered the child, and returned her to the family.""

The couple has two children who were born in the United States. Neither parent was taken into custody that day. However, two days later, ICE returned to their home and took Hip Mejía into custody, his wife said. He is now being held at a detention center in Plymouth.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the US Department of Homeland Security, responded to NBC News' English version of the initial reporting, calling it ""a disgusting smear."" She claimed that Hip Mejia ""ignored law enforcement emergency lights to pull over and drove back to his house,"" and then ""abandoned his 5-year-old daughter in the car.""

The family's experience is part of an attempt by ICE to deliver on US President Donald Trump's promise of mass deportations.

The initial reporting and footage sparked swift outrage, with critics across the United States and beyond condemning agents' treatment of the family as ""fascism,"" ""truly evil,"" and ""a fucking abomination.""

Joanna Kuebler, chief of programs at the advocacy group America's Voice, said in a Tuesday statement that ""this visceral event is just another frightening example of a broader and deeply disturbing pattern by this administration.""

""The combination of cruelty and impunity in pursuit of a mass deportation crusade is dangerous for America and all of our safety,"" Kuebler added. ""Smashing car windows, ripping families apart, and traumatizing children threatens the public safety of American communities and the stability of our nation.”

“Your countries are going to hell.” In his remarks, Mr. Trump lectured the United Nations and other countries about how they were failing, and aired a list of grievances.
Soon after his speech, Mr. Trump made news in another forum.
“‘No more cows — we don’t want cows anymore.’ I guess they want to kill all the cows,” Mr. Trump said.
But at the same time, Mr. Trump has inserted America into peace negotiations in conflicts across the globe, including the war in Gaza.","He accused environmentalists of wanting to “kill all the cows.” He personally insulted the Muslim mayor of London. He bashed allies and foes across the globe. He questioned whether the United Nations should even exist.

“What is the purpose of the United Nations?” President Trump asked a gathering of the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, in a meandering, 56-minute speech that extended nearly four times as long as his allotted time limit.

“I’m really good at this stuff,” Mr. Trump said. “Your countries are going to hell.”

In his remarks, Mr. Trump lectured the United Nations and other countries about how they were failing, and aired a list of grievances. Those included but were not limited to: a malfunctioning escalator at the U.N.; his not winning a renovation contract at the United Nations during his time as a real estate developer; windmills; other countries’ immigration policies, which he claimed were leading them to ruin; and the way Brazil is being run.

Soon after his speech, Mr. Trump made news in another forum. In a social media post, he made a stunning pivot on Ukraine, saying the country, with the support of Europe, was “in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form.”

His declaration, a welcome development to European allies, was made shortly after a meeting in New York with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.

But what appeared to be a major foreign policy shift in the afternoon came only after a lengthy morning lecture by the American president.

The White House had billed Mr. Trump’s address to the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly as a chance for the president to lay out his vision for how America should wield its power abroad.

But Mr. Trump’s day did not start well. An escalator he was riding on broke as he entered the building, and his teleprompter malfunctioned early in his speech. (The White House accused U.N. staff of potentially attempting to sabotage him.) While he appeared to be reading from prepared remarks, he often broke into ad-libs.

There was some policy discussed. He announced a new effort to enforce the biological weapons convention that would use “A.I. verification,” and said he wanted “a cessation of the development of nuclear weapons.”

Mr. Trump also issued a new warning: that the U.S. military would continue to play the role of judge, jury and executioner in killing suspected drug smugglers operating in international waters. “We will blow you out of existence,” he warned anyone moving drugs out of Venezuela.

But he spent nearly a quarter of his speaking time attacking efforts to address climate change.

Mr. Trump undermined the scientific consensus on climate change, saying it was “made by stupid people.” He celebrated the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate accord and “clean, beautiful coal.” He talked about American energy exports and added that “the United States has been taken advantage by much of the world, but not anymore.”

And Mr. Trump called climate change the “greatest con job” ever perpetrated on the world and claimed environmentalists are out to eliminate America’s cows.

“‘No more cows — we don’t want cows anymore.’ I guess they want to kill all the cows,” Mr. Trump said.

He briefly turned to the topic of religion, falsely claiming that Muslim leaders in the West are planning to institute Shariah law, while proclaiming Christianity to be the “most persecuted religion on the planet.”

According to the White House, Mr. Trump had always planned to target “globalist institutions” in his speech. Since taking office, he has made drastic changes to America’s approach to foreign policy.

He has largely eschewed the use of nonmilitary “soft power,” severely cutting foreign aid and dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development. He has declined to pay for more aid to help Ukraine fight off Russia’s invasion or try to put any limits on Israel’s broadened military campaign in Gaza. And he has told strongmen leaders of other countries that the United States would no longer sit in judgment of them.

Several close U.S. allies issued what amounted to a reprimand this week of his go-it-alone vision, joining most of the U.N. body in recognizing Palestine as a state and risking the ire of the president, who has adamantly opposed such a move.

The president, for his part, has made it clear he wants little to do with much of the U.N. mandate. He has withdrawn the United States from the U.N.’s Human Rights Council, and ordered a review of America’s role in the organization. The Trump administration clawed back $1 billion in funding for the U.N. and informed Congress of its intent to cut another $1 billion, adding to a funding shortfall at the United Nations.

But at the same time, Mr. Trump has inserted America into peace negotiations in conflicts across the globe, including the war in Gaza. The president has also shown a willingness to use a quick show of force, as he did when he ordered airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities.

Mr. Trump, who is in open pursuit of a Nobel Peace Prize, trumpeted his role in bringing about several peace agreements or cease-fires during his speech, including a deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan and Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Then he argued he was doing, as a side job, what the U.N. should. “Sadly, in all cases, the United Nations did not even try to help in any of them,” he said, adding that “all I got from the United Nations was an escalator on the way up that stopped right in the middle.”

He claimed that all the United Nations does is write “strongly worded letters” and speak in “empty words.”

“It’s sad I had to do these things instead of the United Nations doing them,” he said.

Still, the reaction to Mr. Trump’s bashing of the U.N. and other countries was muted. Long gone were the days when he was openly laughed at in the chamber. His speech was greeted with polite applause. Afterward, world leaders clamored to meet with him one-on-one, a format in which the American president is known to be less bellicose and more accommodating.

The Court of Federal Claims: A Friendly Forum for Funding Challenges What, then, is the COFC, and how can funding recipients take advantage of it?
* * * As you or your organization continue to navigate the federal funding landscape and the Supreme Court’s decision in APHA, consider whether strategic litigation in the Court of Federal Claims may be appropriate.","The Administration’s dramatic cutbacks to federal funding have changed the landscape and presented new and unprecedented challenges for funding recipients across a range of industries.

The Supreme Court’s decision last month in National Institutes of Health v. American Public Health Association (“APHA”) and Massachusetts v. Kennedy, is the Court’s latest word on the evolving landscape for challenging grant terminations.[1] In those cases, the Supreme Court left in place a district court’s order invalidating NIH directives that served as the basis for nearly $1 billion in grant terminations. But the Court stayed the same court’s order vacating the ensuing grant terminations, noting that challenges to terminations likely should be brought in the Court of Federal Claims (COFC) rather than in district court.

This leaves grant recipients to navigate an increasingly fraught judicial landscape, alongside the executive branch’s ongoing actions to limit, suspend, revoke, and terminate federal funding, which may only be getting started, if Executive Order 14332, Improving Oversight of Federal Grantmaking—issued last month[2] —is any indication. In this environment, funding recipients are well advised to familiarize themselves with litigation in the COFC as it may help your organization recover funds unlawfully withheld by the government.

Two factors make exploring potential relief at the COFC timely:

First, the Supreme Court’s decision in APHA has made district court challenges to individual grant terminations more difficult and made it more likely that many suits requiring the payment of money by the government will be funneled to the COFC.

Second, some organizations have been reluctant to sue in COFC during a funding pause, with the hope that the flow of money could be restarted before the grant’s period of performance ends. However, the end of the government fiscal year (September 30) is a common deadline for grant renewal. Should grants be non-renewed, strategic considerations may change, shifting the focus instead to recovering non-payment of grant funds.

Due to these twin pressures, organizations should explore whether breach-of-contract actions in the COFC could help them recover any unpaid federal funds.

Jurisdictional Battle: Federal District Courts v. the Court of Federal Claims

The COFC—an Article I court created by Congress—is a court of limited jurisdiction that was created as a forum for private parties to sue the federal government for money damages.[3] Under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1), the COFC has jurisdiction over contract claims against the United States, and courts have held that it has exclusive jurisdiction over contract claims seeking more than $10,000 in damages.[4]

Under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), federal courts have jurisdiction to hear challenges to unlawful agency actions. But when the COFC has exclusive jurisdiction over a contractual claim, litigants cannot pursue relief under the APA in district courts for that claim.[5] This creates a tension between the jurisdiction of district courts under the APA and that of the COFC under the Tucker Act for suits challenging unlawful agency actions that may implicate a contract or agreement with the federal government—an issue that has played a significant role in the dozens of lawsuits challenging adverse federal funding actions taken by the current Administration.

In April, the Supreme Court addressed the line between the APA and the Tucker Act in Department of Education v. California,[6] where it concluded—albeit in a brief, expedited, stay-stage decision—that certain grant-termination claims likely had to be brought in the COFC under the Tucker Act rather than in district court under the APA.[7] That decision created much uncertainty, and various stakeholders in the research community have been waiting for further guidance from the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court’s Decision in APHA: Another Roadblock to Challenging Individual Grant Terminations in District Court

Additional guidance has come in the APHA and Massachusetts cases, in which researchers at public universities challenged grant terminations pursuant to a number of agencywide directives targeting research into certain topics. The district court determined that the claims belonged entirely in district court—not the COFC—and, finding that the agency’s actions were arbitrary and capricious under the APA, vacated both the directives and the ensuing grant terminations.[8] The government appealed, and the First Circuit denied a stay pending appeal.[9]

The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision with multiple separate writings, granted in part the government’s stay application, which sought to stay the district court’s orders vacating (1) the agencywide directives targeting disfavored research topics and (2) individual grant terminations taken pursuant to those directives.

The Court stayed the district court’s judgments reinstating individual grant terminations. But the Court rejected the stay request as to the agency-wide directives, meaning those directives remain vacated while the case proceeds on appeal.

The Court was divided. Justice Barrett was the only Justice who concurred in the Court’s ultimate bottom line, meaning she was the deciding vote and her opinion effectively controls going forward.[10] In her view, the district court likely lacked jurisdiction to hear the APA challenges to the individual grant terminations because those challenges belong in the COFC under the Tucker Act. She would not stay the judgments as to the agencywide directives, however, because those challenges are more like classic APA claims.

Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson would have denied the stay in full and allowed the challenges to both the directives and terminations to proceed in district court. Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh would have granted the stay in full, requiring all of the claims to be brought in the COFC.

The decision in APHA tends to confirm what California left uncertain: certain challenges to terminations of individual grants likely must proceed in the COFC, while challenges to agencywide directives remain viable in district courts. APHA and California centered on claims that the terminations were arbitrary and capricious; neither focused on claims that terminations violated governing statutes, regulations, or the Constitution—and thus, guidance from the Supreme Court as to this latter category remains sparse.

The Court of Federal Claims: A Friendly Forum for Funding Challenges

What, then, is the COFC, and how can funding recipients take advantage of it?

The COFC has limited authority: It may hear claims based in either contracts with the US government, or “money-mandating” statutes or constitutional provisions—i.e., laws that require the United States to compensate for harm via money damages.[11] And for litigants with successful claims against the US government, the COFC can grant money damages.

To the extent that federal grants and awards are considered contracts with the US government—an issue that has been litigated to some degree in recent funding challenges—the COFC would have jurisdiction to hear breach-of-contract claims arising out of the terms and conditions of those agreements. And because the COFC’s jurisdiction extends to both express and implied-in-fact contracts, litigants may also have arguments for implied contracts based on the government’s prior conduct.[12]

Accordingly, federal funding recipients may consider bringing claims with respect to frozen or terminated grants, alleging that the government has failed to comply with the terms or conditions of those agreements, which may also incorporate federal regulations governing grant terminations. Litigants may argue, for instance, that the government has failed to follow closeout-cost procedures, has failed to pay for work already performed but not yet paid for, or has failed to pay for expenses legitimately incurred, which could include salaries, costs for wasted materials, rent, or other facilities upkeep that would not have been incurred but for the government’s breach. Broader recovery may also be possible in certain cases, depending on the facts on the ground and legal theories available.

While cases in the COFC proceed against the federal government, the COFC is an impartial, business-driven court, and it rules against the government in contract cases with some regularity—indeed, historically, it has imposed some extremely large judgments.[13]

Key Considerations for Potential Litigation in the Court of Federal Claims

To determine whether the COFC may be a good option for you or your organization to seek damages based on unpaid federal funding, it is important to consider the following as you begin to strategize and weigh your options.

What are your damages and what can you reasonably expect to recover?For federal grants, damages will likely be governed largely by the cost-allowability rules applicable to those grants, but they may include actual losses and costs associated with terminations or suspensions that are otherwise allowable.

For federal grants, damages will likely be governed largely by the cost-allowability rules applicable to those grants, but they may include actual losses and costs associated with terminations or suspensions that are otherwise allowable.

Parties may not be able to obtain the full value of lost grants, though that may depend on factors such as whether there is a money-mandating statute creating a right to those funds—and on the terms of the grants themselves.

Expectation damages might be available in certain scenarios but are not a guarantee.

What litigation timeline is acceptable for you or your organization?

The COFC utilizes a judge-supervised alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process that is held in high regard and works to expedite settlements. But, as with most civil litigation, litigation in the COFC can otherwise be a lengthy process that may last for years before a final judgment.

We anticipate a wave of funding-termination litigation in the COFC in the coming months, so there may be a time advantage to bringing strategic litigation earlier rather than later.

""Every 15 seconds, per line, I've got a dishwasher coming off the line,"" Bill Good, the vice president in charge of the plant, told CBS News.

But back in May, nearly 150 workers, mostly Cuban immigrants, were laid off after the Trump administration abruptly changed their legal immigration status.

The Biden-era parole program, known as CHNV, temporarily protected roughly 532,000 Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians and Venezuelans from the risk of deportation. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem moved to terminate the program back in March. After a lower court temporarily halted the end of the program, the Supreme Court in May allowed the administration to move forward with its plan to terminate the program while the rest of the legal battle plays out.

The Department of Homeland Security in June began delivering notices via email informing recipients living in the U.S. under the CHNV program that their permission to remain in the U.S. had been rescinded. Those who have not secured another lawful immigration status, such as Temporary Protected Status, were told to leave the country.

""We're still short people. We're still training people every day on jobs,"" said Nathaniel Schultz, who works at the GE Appliances plant in Louisville.

Jaelin Carpenter, another worker there, told CBS News, ""They put us on overtime from that point on to the beginning of the year.""

""It's more pressure on everybody,"" Schultz added.

Asked if they felt those immigrants were taking jobs from Americans, Carpenter, Schutlz and another worker, Oliver Smith, all said no.

""They applied like anybody else,"" said Smith.

And Carpenter said they won't be easy to replace.

Schultz added, ""These people were one of the vertebrae in the backbone that is American manufacturing.""

About 200 immigrant employees still work the lines at the plant, according to GE Appliances. Many of them are worried they, too, are one more policy change away from not being considered legal anymore.

Those remaining immigrant workers now live in fear their Temporary Protected Status could be revoked, with some already set to expire in the coming months.

""It's just very hard to predict,"" Good said.

Fully 55% of registered voters disapprove of Trump’s overall job performance with 46% saying that they strongly disapprove. Sixty percent of female voters disapprove of Trump’s job performance while Independent voters (67% disapprove) render an even harsher judgement. Trump receives his highest scores among his base of white non-college voters (60% approve, 40% disapprove).

On Trump’s signature issue of immigration, 55% disapprove including just under two-thirds of Independents (64%). Once again, Trump’s base of non-college white voters back him on immigration (62% approve).

Trump does even more poorly on his handling of the economy (40% approve, 59% disapprove) than he does overall. A decisive 70% of Independent voters disapprove of Trump’s handling of the economy.

Voters are clearly telling the Democrats it is not enough to be just the anti-Trump. Democrats need to tell voters in no uncertain terms how they would make their lives better.

Even on the issue of crime which the Trump administration has focused on in the last several weeks does not generate any good news for the president. A 54% majority disapprove of his job performance on crime while 44% approve. Trump’s job performance on crime does resonate with voters ages 50 to 64 (54% approve, 45% disapprove).

Trump’s job performance numbers clearly indicate that he has been playing to his base among non-college white voters and ignoring the rest of the electorate. For a candidate who ran on the economy, his economic job performance numbers must be worrying. The logical thing for Trump to do would be to pivot from his focus on crime and immigration and focus on the cost of living. While this is the politically smart thing to do, Trump seems unlikely to take this path. Instead, he will continue to focus on his base. This is a real gamble because it is unlikely that there will be enough non-college white voters to enable the GOP to keep the House in Republican hands.

Fifty-three percent of respondents say that in 2026 they would vote to support Democrats to oppose Trump while 42% say they would vote for the GOP to support Trump’s agenda. Fully 59% of Independents say they would vote Democratic for Congress to oppose Trump’s agenda.

All this so far, is exceptionally good news for the Democrats. However, Democrats still have far to go with voters on key issues. On the question of which political party can best handle the economy, 32% prefer the Democrats, 39% the Republicans, and 28% say neither. A 47% plurality of Independents say neither party while 25% say the Democrats and 26% the Republicans.

On the issue of immigration, Republicans have a clear advantage as 42% of voters prefer the GOP while 29% support the Democrats and 28% say neither. Independent voters offer a very mixed picture on the question of which party can handle immigration (20% Democrats, 30% Republicans, and 48% neither).

Thirteen months from the 2026 midterms, Democrats have many things to feel good about in these polling numbers. However, they also face a challenge. Voters do not trust them on immigration and the economy. The Democrats may be able to triumph next year without winning the majority of voters on immigration. It is likely that they will not be able to win without winning voters on both the economy and immigration.

Job No. 1 for the Democrats for the 2026 midterms is to produce an economic message. Given Trump’s poor economic job performance numbers, this would seem an easy task. However, it was something that they failed to do in 2024, and I would argue that it cost them the White House. Voters are clearly telling the Democrats it is not enough to be just the anti-Trump. Democrats need to tell voters in no uncertain terms how they would make their lives better. If the Democratic Party fails here, they will hand GOP control of Congress for at least two more years.

Read the Bill Here(link is external)

NEW YORK, NY – Congressman Dan Goldman’s (NY-10) No Secret Police Act today reached 100 cosponsors in the House of Representatives, a major show of support from Democrats in Congress for legislation to rein in the Trump administration’s use of masked, anonymous federal agents engaged in border security and civil immigration enforcement. Goldman introduced the bill with Congressman Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) in June.

“As Donald Trump continues to send masked, unaccountable ICE agents into our city, I’m proud that the Democratic caucus is united in support for this critical legislation that would put an end to the Trump administration’s use of masked agents to terrorize immigrant communities,” Congressman Dan Goldman said. “While Republicans bend the knee to this administration as it establishes a militarized ICE police force, Democrats are standing firm in opposition to these authoritarian tactics.”

The No Secret Police Act would amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require law enforcement officers and agents of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to clearly display identification and insignia when detaining or arresting individuals. Specifically, the bill would:

Prohibit DHS officers from wearing face coverings or any item that conceals their face during detentions or arrests.

Require that DHS officers identify the specific component they work for (such as ICE or CBP).

Mandate that officers wear or display official insignia or uniforms clearly visible to others.

The bill also directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to invest in research and development to ensure visibility of DHS insignia and uniforms under a wide range of conditions, from different locations and times of day to weather circumstances.

Goldman has led the charge against Trump’s escalation of authoritarian immigration enforcement tactics, standing with immigrant communities across New York and the nation who are demanding accountability, transparency, and the basic democratic principle that law enforcement must not operate in secret.

In July, Congressman Goldman and 11 other Members of Congress filed a lawsuit against the Trump Administration last month over its continued refusal to allow members of Congress to access ICE detention facilities, including the 26 Federal Plaza, which is also located in the Congressman’s district.

In August, Congressman Goldman and Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) led over 50 of their colleagues in demanding an immediate investigation into alarming reports that U.S. citizens are being wrongfully detained and deported by federal immigration agents under the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement policies. In a letter sent to the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) internal oversight offices, the lawmakers raised urgent concerns about a growing pattern of civil rights violations against U.S. citizens during immigration sweeps.

British Columbia (Attorney General), 2022 BCSC 1146, and British Columbia (Attorney General) v. Le, 2023 BCCA 200.

However, the petitioners argued that the amendments led to new concerns. They alleged that s. 5(8)(a) of DEER:

amounted to an unauthorized or unreasonable exercise of the lieutenant governor in council’s (LGIC) authority under s. 12.1(9) of BC’s Evidence Act, 1996

lacked force and effect under s. 52 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms because it unjustifiably breached plaintiffs’ s. 15 Charter rights

Provision upheld

The Supreme Court of British Columbia dismissed the petition upon finding that s. 5(8)(a) of DEER fell within the LGIC’s regulation-making power, aligned with the proportionality goals of s. 12.1 of the Evidence Act, and did not infringe plaintiffs’ s. 15 Charter rights.

The court noted that the parties had resolved the action seeking to recover damages for injuries allegedly arising from the motor vehicle accident after the present petition’s hearing.

The court rejected the petitioners’ argument that s. 5(8)(a) of DEER disproportionately prejudiced plaintiffs by requiring them to make an application before incurring a disbursement and forced them to prematurely disclose their case to the defendant, thus diminishing litigation or solicitor-client privilege.

The court said the petitioners exaggerated their concerns about disclosing privileged information. The court determined that DEER did not compel plaintiffs to open their litigation files to an extent that seriously eroded litigation or solicitor-client privilege.

The court explained that s. 5(6) of DEER simply offered plaintiffs the option to apply to exclude disbursements from the six-percent cap and required them to meet the conditions and criteria in ss. 5(8) and (9) of DEER if they chose to file such an application.

The court added that the case law interpreting ss. 5(8) and (9) of DEER did not support the petitioners’ claims that s. 5(8)(a) of DEER jeopardized litigation or solicitor-client privilege and instead showed the court’s liberal application of the evidentiary requirements and avoidance of interpretations compelling the plaintiffs to open their files or divulge privileged information.

Next, the court ruled that s. 5(8)(a) of DEER did not infringe s. 15 of the Charter. The court said DEER’s pertinent provisions applied equally to all plaintiffs, whether disabled or not, and drew no distinction between those with physical or mental disabilities and those without disabilities.

The court saw no disproportionate impact under part one of the test in Fraser v. Canada (Attorney General), 2020 SCC 28. The court listed five points to support this conclusion.

First, the court said the majority in British Columbia (Attorney General) v. Le, 2023 BCCA 200, pointed out that the six-percent limit would be proportionate in most cases.

Second, the court acknowledged that plaintiffs with more severe injuries were more likely to incur disbursements exceeding the six-percent cap. However, the court found no evidence that disabled persons were more likely to exceed the limit.

Third, the court saw no evidence of adverse impacts on persons who needed accessibility services.

Fourth, the court noted that plaintiffs could ask the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia if they could exclude disbursements if they were likely to go over the six-percent limit.

Fifth, the court said requiring plaintiffs to file a s. 5(6) application would not onerously burden them and would generally entitle them to the application costs if they succeeded.

Lastly, the court accepted that s. 5(7) of DEER required a plaintiff seeking to tender the evidence of over three experts and exclude disbursements from the six-percent cap to file the applications together before incurring the disbursement.

However, the court did not consider this requirement inconsistent with s. 12.1 of the Evidence Act in general or s. 12.1(5) in particular. The court went over three points to support this finding.

First, the court pointed out that the petitioners ultimately did not assail the validity of s. 5(7) of DEER.

Second, the court saw no explicit conflict between s. 12.1(5) of the Evidence Act and s.5(8)(a) of DEER.

Third, the court noted that proportionality was a primary goal of s. 12.1 and part of a broad purpose to reduce motor vehicle litigation costs. The court deemed it potentially wasteful and disproportionate if plaintiffs incurred disbursements before the determination of their status or separately filed two related applications.",https://cdn-res.keymedia.com/cms/images/cl/bern_638942318847499495.png,N,,2025-09-24 08:57:20.751857

Ismael Ayala-Uribe, 39 was pronounced dead Sunday at the Victor Valley Global Medical Center, according to an ICE statement.

Ayala-Uribe is now the 14th detainee to die in immigration detention since January, when federal immigration officials began to carry out President Trump’s mass deportation agenda.

News of his death comes on the day that two Democratic senators from Georgia sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Todd Lyons, the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, raising concerns about the rise in the number of deaths in ICE custody, in particular two that occurred at the Stewart Detention Center in Georgia. NPR was the first to report on the letter.

In July, Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga) released the findings of a probe into alleged human rights violations that have occurred at immigration detention centers, including dozens of reports of physical and sexual abuse, and mistreatment of pregnant women and children. DHS rejected the senator’s allegations in a statement.

In California, the Adelanto Detention Center, one of the largest in the state, has long been the focus of complaints from detainees, attorneys and state and federal inspectors about inadequate medical care, overly restrictive segregation and lax mental health services.

In June, critics — including some staff who work inside — told The Times that conditions inside the detention center were unsafe and unsanitary. The facility, they said, was unprepared to handle the large waves of detainees pouring into the center.

That month, U.S. Rep Judy Chu (D-Monterey Park), toured the detention center with four other Democratic members of Congress from California amid concern over the increasing number of detainees and deteriorating conditions inside.

The facility’s manager “has to clearly improve its treatment of these detainees,” Chu said at a news conference after inspecting the facility.

Some of the detainees told lawmakers they were held inside Adelanto for 10 days without a change of clothes, underwear or towels, Chu said. Others said they had been denied access to a telephone to speak to loved ones and lawyers, even after repeatedly filling out forms.

A spokesperson for DHS could not immediately be reached for comment on Sunday’s death. But the agency said in its statement about Ayala-Uribe that immigration agencies such as ICE and Customs and Border Protection are committed to ensuring the safety of people who are in their custody.

“Comprehensive medical care is provided from the moment individuals arrive and throughout the entirety of their stay,” the agency’s statement read. “All people in ICE custody receive medical, dental and mental health intake screening within 12 hours of arriving at each detention facility, a full health assessment within 14 days of entering ICE custody or arrival at a facility, access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care. At no time during detention is a detained illegal alien denied emergent care.”

According to the agency statement, Ayala-Uribe, a Mexican national, was being held at a processing center in Adelanto where he had been seen by an on-call medical provider, who prescribed medication to him, although immigration officials did not say why.

But three days later, Ayala-Uribe was sent to the Victor Valley Global Medical Center to further evaluate an “abscess on his buttock” and was scheduled to undergo surgery for it, the statement said.

“Ayala was also hypertensive and displayed abnormal tachycardia,” immigration officials wrote in the statement. “At 1:48 a.m. the [medical center] declared Ayala unresponsive and initiated lifesaving measures. He was declared deceased at 2:32 a.m. by medical staff.”

According to ICE, Ayala-Uribe entered the United States at an unknown date and location. He applied for, and received, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals protection in 2012. He was sentenced to three years probation after he was convicted of driving while under the influence in 2015, the agency said.

In 2016, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services denied his application to renew his DACA status. He was convicted of his second DUI in June 2019 and sentenced to 120 days in jail, plus five years of probation, according to ICE.

Ayala-Uribe was arrested by U.S. Customs and Border Protection on Aug. 17 and transferred to Adelanto on Aug. 22.

Immigration officials said the cause of death is still under investigation. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill of 2018 requires that ICE make public reports regarding any in-custody deaths within 90 days.

ICE officials said they make official notifications to Congress, nongovernmental organization stakeholders and the media about a detainee’s death and post a news release with relevant details on its website within two business days per the agency’s policy.

Introduction

On September 19, 2025, President Donald Trump signed a Presidential Proclamation that significantly restructures the H-1B visa program, one of the most widely used pathways for high-skilled foreign professionals to work in the United States. While the H-1B program has long been a lifeline for industries facing talent shortages, the Proclamation introduces a new $100,000 application fee that will make it cost-prohibitive for many employers to utilize it, reshaping the landscape of U.S. immigration and labor markets. This explainer unpacks the key provisions of the Proclamation and what these changes mean for employers, foreign workers, and the broader economy.

Key Provisions of the Presidential Proclamation

The new Presidential Proclamation introduces the most restrictive measures on the H-1B program in decades:

Significant New Fee: Employers sponsoring H-1B workers must now pay a $100,000 “visa integrity fee” per application. This represents an unprecedented escalation in costs. After the Proclamation was published, employers expressed confusion over its scope, questioning whether the $100,000 fee applied retroactively to existing H-1B workers and whether the fee had to be paid annually. In the days following its publication, administration officials clarified that the fee applies only to new petitions filed after the effective date. They also clarified that it was a one-time fee, not an annual fee.

Exemptions Based on National Interest: The Proclamation allows DHS to grant case-by-case or industry-wide exemptions to the $100,000 fee if employing H-1B workers is deemed in the U.S. national interest. However, the criteria for these exemptions remain unclear.

Increased Compliance Burdens: Employers face heightened reporting requirements, audits, and penalties for violations. Parallel to the Proclamation, the Department of Labor (DOL) announced Project Firewall, a new enforcement initiative targeting employers who rely heavily on the H-1B visa program.

The administration frames these changes as necessary to “protect American workers” and ensure that companies prioritize domestic hiring. Critics argue that the measures will undermine U.S. competitiveness and innovation.

What Industries Benefit from H-1B Visas?

The technology sector is by far the largest beneficiary of the H-1B program. This sector relies on a steady influx of international talent to sustain research, product development, and global competitiveness.

Beyond Silicon Valley, H-1Bs are vital in:

Healthcare: Hospitals and clinics employ foreign doctors, nurses, and medical researchers to address staffing shortages.

Higher Education and Research: Universities sponsor professors and researchers whose expertise strengthens the U.S. academic system.

Finance and Business Services: Banks, consulting firms, and accounting companies hire specialized workers to handle complex global operations.

Engineering and Manufacturing: From aerospace to automotive industries, H-1Bs fill roles where U.S. talent is scarce.

In short, the visa program supports industries at the core of the U.S. economy while bridging persistent labor gaps.

Old vs. New Application Costs

Before the Proclamation, the cost of applying for an H-1B visa included several mandatory fees:

Applicant registration for the H-1B lottery: $215

Filing Fee (Form I-129): $460

American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act (ACWIA) Fee: $750 or $1,500, depending on company size

Fraud Prevention and Detection Fee: $500

Public Law 114-113 Fee (for H-1B dependent employers only): $4,000

Premium Processing (optional): $2,805

Altogether, most employers spent between $5,000 and $10,000 per H-1B worker.

Under the Proclamation, employers must now pay an additional $100,000 visa integrity fee per petition. This brings the total cost to well over $105,000 per worker, pricing out many small and medium-sized businesses and significantly burdening even large corporations that hire hundreds of H-1B workers annually.

Likelihood of Litigation

The new Proclamation on H-1B visas is almost certain to face legal challenges. Immigration lawyers, business associations, and affected industries have already signaled that the policy is vulnerable in court, and litigation is expected to begin almost immediately.

Several aspects of the Proclamation are likely to be tested in court:

Statutory Authority: The White House relies on sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to justify the $100,000 supplemental fee and related entry restrictions. Critics contend Congress never authorized such high fees or broad restrictions, arguing the Proclamation exceeds presidential powers under the INA.

Administrative Procedure Act (APA): The Proclamation may be challenged for bypassing required notice-and-comment rulemaking. Additionally, the vague criteria for exemptions and the undefined concept of “essential” workers risk arbitrary enforcement, heightening the chances of an APA violation.

Complications for Employers and Workers

The new policy introduces wide-ranging challenges for employers and foreign-born workers who rely on the H-1B program.

For Employers

Cost Barriers: The fee increase will create financial, compliance, and workforce challenges for companies of all sizes, universities, and hospitals that cannot afford to pay $100,000 per application.

Hiring Delays: Stricter labor market tests and compliance checks will slow down hiring processes.

Reduced Global Competitiveness: Companies may relocate operations abroad to access the talent they can no longer bring to the U.S. affordably.

For Foreign Workers

Fewer opportunities for workers: The steep costs make employers less willing to sponsor H-1Bs, narrowing opportunities for talented workers.

Limited availability of H-1B visas for entry-level positions: Parallel to the Proclamation, the administration published a notice of proposed rulemaking that would lower the chances for international students and entry-level workers to be selected in the H-1B lottery.

Legal and personal strain: Heightened scrutiny and procedural delays increase uncertainty for workers and their families.

The Department of Labor’s “Project Firewall”

In addition to the Proclamation, on September 19, 2025, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) announced Project Firewall, a new enforcement initiative targeting employers who utilize the H-1B visa program. According to the agency, the program aims to “protect the rights, wages, and opportunities of U.S. workers,” while strengthening oversight of H-1B hiring practices and cracking down on abuse. The initiative is a parallel development to the Proclamation, signaling that the administration intends to increase both the cost of obtaining H-1B visas and the regulatory scrutiny of companies that use them.

Conclusion

The Proclamation on H-1B visas represents one of the most consequential changes to U.S. immigration policy in decades. By drastically raising costs and imposing new restrictions, the policy threatens to limit the flow of high-skilled talent that has long powered U.S. innovation, scientific discovery, and business growth. While the administration argues that these measures protect American workers, critics warn that they could instead drive investment and talent abroad, undercutting the nation’s competitiveness. For employers, the new Proclamation means higher costs, longer delays, and difficult strategic decisions about whether to utilize the H-1B program and/or relocate jobs overseas. For foreign workers, it means fewer opportunities and greater uncertainty. And for the U.S. economy, it raises pressing questions about whether protectionism can coexist with the nation’s tradition of welcoming global talent to fuel progress.",https://forumtogether.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/facebook-tag-image.png,N,,2025-09-24 02:57:32.918339

Mohammad Rahimi worked as an attorney with the U.S. Army in Afghanistan and later served in the Afghan government.
Meanwhile, Rahimi said arrests of Afghan refugees at routine immigration appointments — one at immigration court in San Diego — have Afghans across the country afraid and feeling targeted.
""It's reprehensible that we're failing our Afghan allies now,"" said California Democrat Rep. Scott Peters, one of the bill's co-sponsors.","More than 200,000 Afghans previously eligible to apply for asylum in the United States now find themselves without options or answers from the U.S. government, community advocates said.

On President Trump's first day back in office in January, he ordered a halt to all refugee travel. That included Afghans and their families screened and approved by the State Department to relocate to the United States.

""They're just being abandoned,"" said Jessica Bradley Rushing, who worked as a deputy director in the Department's office of the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts, or CARE.

When the U.S. fought a 20 year war in Afghanistan, thousands of those Afghans fought alongside them. They served as interpreters, engineers, and in other roles - and many now face the threat of retribution from the Taliban.

The U.S. promised to help those Afghans come to America, but many are now caught up in President Trump's immigration crackdown. Thousands are still housed at U.S.-run sites in third-party countries, such as one in Doha, Qatar.

""I know people, literally personally, whose cases were right at the finish line on Jan. 20,"" Bradley Rushing said. ""And now their families are stuck in Afghanistan, and they don't know when or if they'll ever be reunited.""

The January suspension of refugee resettlement was followed by a travel and VISA ban that included Afghanistan and the end of Temporary Protected Status for Afghans. In July, the State Department closed the CARE office. And the White House plans to end Operation Enduring Welcome - the Biden Administration's Afghan resettlement initiative - Sept. 30.

Mohammad Rahimi worked as an attorney with the U.S. Army in Afghanistan and later served in the Afghan government. He immigrated to the U.S. more than a decade ago and is now a U.S. citizen. Living in El Cajon, California, he serves as executive director of nonprofit Afghan Family Services.

He said many of the more than 100,000 Afghans who made it to the U.S. since August 2021 came alone, hoping to bring their spouses, siblings, parents or children later.

""Unfortunately, with this travel ban ... this president killed that hope,"" Rahimi said. ""So now, the majority of these Afghans who came to the United States but left part of their families in Afghanistan — they are hopeless, they are voiceless, and they're unsupported.""

A State Department spokesperson said the functions of the CARE office were assigned to another office, part of a reorganization to make the department ""more efficient and more focused on an America First foreign policy.""

A senior Trump Administration official said Special Immigrant Visas for Afghans are still being processed with hundreds of decisions per week.

""President Trump has a humanitarian heart, and the Trump Administration remains committed to protecting those who supported our mission, while ensuring rigorous security standards,"" the official said in an email. ""These measures make certain that refuge is provided only to those credibly at risk while maintaining broader U.S. national security priorities.""

Shawn VanDiver is president and co-founder of #AfghanEvac, a nonprofit that helps Afghans with relocation. During the Biden Administration, he worked with the State Department to craft Operation Enduring Welcome.

""Enduring Welcome is, by miles and miles, the safest, most secure legal immigration program in our country's history,"" VanDiver said. ""We wanted to build this thing to stand the test of time and stand any sort of security scrutiny. And we did.""

VanDiver said the current administration sees Afghanistan as a ""political problem.""

""They want to wipe their hands of it,"" VanDiver said in an interview.

With roughly a quarter-million Afghans somewhere in the relocation pipeline, VanDiver said his organization will continue to press Congress to pass legislation to restart relocation.

Meanwhile, Rahimi said arrests of Afghan refugees at routine immigration appointments — one at immigration court in San Diego — have Afghans across the country afraid and feeling targeted.

""They are asking me ... how can they go to their appointments, finish the appointment and leave the courthouse safely without being detained?"" Rahimi said. ""We have no answer.""

In San Diego this summer, more than a dozen U.S. military veterans showed began a volunteer effort, showing up in court to support an Afghan at his immigration hearings.

Marine Corps veteran Jonathan Liu served with Afghans as a fire support officer during the war. He said the courthouse effort was a continuation of that service.

""These were people who fought for us — they put their lives on the line,"" he said. ""We shouldn't be turning our backs on them.""

Several major veterans groups are supporting bi-partisan legislation in Congress that would provide a path to permanent residency for many Afghans already in the U.S. It also would expand and extend the opportunities for more Afghans to come here.

The Enduring Welcome Act builds upon several policy goals previously brought before the House under the Afghan Adjustment Act. Together, the bills would provide a legal pathway for former U.S. allies in Afghanistan to relocate to the U.S. and offer those already in the country a legal path toward residency.

""It's reprehensible that we're failing our Afghan allies now,"" said California Democrat Rep. Scott Peters, one of the bill's co-sponsors.

Lowenstein said Trump must realize the ""sheer force of his personality"" will not bring about an end to those conflicts.","In a fiery speech at the United Nations on Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump attacked some of the key principles of the world body, and urged Western countries to adopt MAGA-style policies on migration and climate change.

Trump used the stage of the UN General Assembly to deliver a nearly hour-long address that was short on substance about ending the world's two biggest ongoing wars — in Ukraine and Gaza — but long on critique of two of his favourite targets: immigration and green energy.

The U.S. president slammed what he called the ""globalist migration agenda"" and criticized efforts to tackle what he called ""the global warming hoax."" Near the end of his speech, he called the global push against climate change ""the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world"" — a remark that drew gasps from some in the audience.

European leaders ""must take control strongly and immediately of the unmitigated immigration disaster and the fake energy catastrophe before it's too late,"" he said.

""You're destroying your heritage,"" Trump added in arguably the most strongly worded part of his speech. ""Your countries are going to hell.""

Given UN-backed treaties on climate change and the rights of refugees, it would mean a profound shift in the global order if other nations heeded Trump's calls.

The White House had promised a UN speech that would take aim at global institutions. But some observers believe his words struck at the heart of what the UN is supposed to do — namely, make life better for people of all nations.

Dave Harden, founder of Georgetown Strategy Group and a senior adviser on Middle East peace in the Obama administration, told CBC News the speech ""signals the closing of the era of the United States as being a beacon of hope"" to the international community.

'A torrent of falsehood on migration'

While some observers expected Trump to slam UN bureaucracy and spending in his speech, his sharpest critique of the international body focused on immigration.

""The UN is supposed to stop invasions, not create them and not finance them,"" Trump said, blaming the UN for fuelling what he called ""the No. 1 political issue of our time: the crisis of uncontrolled migration.""

The president claimed the UN ""provided food, shelter, transportation and debit cards to illegal aliens"" to gain access to the U.S. via its southern border.

""In the United States, we reject the idea that mass numbers of people from foreign lands can be permitted to travel halfway around the world, trample our borders, violate our sovereignty, cause unmitigated crime and deplete our social safety net,"" said Trump.

Jeremy Konyndyk, president of Refugees International, an advocacy group that doesn't rely on UN or U.S. government funding, called Trump's speech ""a torrent of falsehood on migration"" in a comment posted to X.

Hugh Dugan, who served on the National Security Council in Trump's first term, doesn't think the speech called for ""tearing apart the multilateral order.""

""In fact, he did reiterate that the UN has potential,"" Dugan told CBC. ""I think he went mild on the UN by just sticking with the use of U.S. funds to bring immigrants across our border illegally ... he could have been even harsher about how our dues are being used.""

U.S. withdrawal from UN agencies

While Trump pulled some financial support from the UN and its agencies over the course of his first term as president, he has done so far more quickly in his second.

On the day of his inauguration in January, for example, Trump announced plans to withdraw the U.S. from the World Health Organization and pull out of the UN-backed Paris Agreement on climate change.

Two weeks later, Trump signed a sweeping executive order to end U.S. involvement in the UN Human Rights Council and launch a full-fledged review of U.S. funding and participation in all UN bodies and other international organizations. Meanwhile, his administration moved quickly to obliterate the U.S. Agency for International Development, wiping billions of dollars in funding from aid projects worldwide, jeopardizing such programs as HIV/AIDS prevention in Africa.

At Trump's urging, Congress proposed in August to withhold more than $1.4 billion US in funding for UN dues and peacekeeping operations.

The UN is now planning a 15 per cent cut to its core budget, its biggest in decades, including eliminating more than 2,600 posts, roughly one out of every five UN jobs worldwide, as part of a broader reform called UN80.

Tom Weiss, a retired professor emeritus at the City University of New York who has written extensively about the UN, says Trump's funding cuts have already made it harder for the UN to deliver humanitarian assistance

""This administration is very good at destroying things. It's not very good at building anything, so I suspect the downward slide of the [UN] is only going to be accelerated,"" Weiss told CBC News.

'Almost no progress' on Gaza, Ukraine

Trump's decision to focus on migration and green energy while only giving the Israel-Hamas and Russia-Ukraine conflicts passing mention drew plenty of attention from political observers.

During the speech, the U.S. president reiterated his claim that he has ended several wars — including a diplomatic conflict over water resources that isn't actually a war (Egypt-Ethiopia); a long-running dispute between Kosovo and Serbia in which no peace deal has been signed; and a Rwanda-backed rebel uprising in eastern Congo that hasn't actually stopped.

""I ended seven wars and in all cases they were raging with countless thousands of people being killed,"" said Trump. ""No president or prime minister, and for that matter, no other country, has ever done anything close to that.""

Notably, he said the UN ""did not even try to help"" end the conflicts.

In addition to Casten and Durbin, the letter was signed by all Democratic members of the Illinois congressional delegation, including U.S.","Downers Grove, Illinois – U.S. Congressman Sean Casten, Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), and all Democratic members of the Illinois delegation sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem demanding answers about the extreme immigration enforcement operations in Illinois under “Operation Midway Blitz” and “Operation at Large.” In the letter, the lawmakers reprimanded DHS, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials for violating due process as they continue to advance President Trump’s mass deportation scheme by targeting immigrants with no criminal convictions.

Citing lack of congressional oversight, indiscriminate arrests of immigrants, and the escalation of tensions during protests at Broadview ICE processing facility (Broadview), the lawmakers called for an immediate end to both Operation Midway Blitz and Operation at Large.

“While this operation [Operation Midway Blitz] supposedly targets ‘criminal illegal aliens,’ our constituents report that DHS officials are arresting individuals in their neighborhoods, at bus stops, and near schools. These enforcement operations do not reduce crime or make our communities safer. As we have seen throughout the implementation of President Trump’s mass deportation scheme, DHS is not focusing on the ‘worst of the worst’ as claimed, but has instead mostly arrested hardworking immigrants with no criminal convictions,” the lawmakers began their letter. “DHS and the Department of Justice (DOJ) have skirted or outright violated due process and other constitutional requirements intended to protect individuals in the United States from arbitrary arrests, detention, and deportation.”

“We urge you to end your dangerous operations in Illinois and provide our residents with transparency into these operations, including how they have siphoned resources from other federal law enforcement agencies that combat public safety threats in our communities,” the lawmakers wrote.

The lawmakers condemned the secrecy surrounding Operation Midway Blitz, noting that Members of Congress have repeatedly requested access to detention facilities, including Broadview, and been denied by DHS without justification.

“Operation Midway Blitz has been shrouded in secrecy, with little notice to state and local officials as to the nature of the operation, the types of people targeted, where DHS is detaining people, and which agencies are required to detail officers to conduct immigration enforcement. DHS officials have avoided meeting with Members of Congress and have not responded to repeated congressional inquiries about recent enforcement activities. Furthermore, DHS has denied Members of Congress the opportunity to conduct lawful oversight at facilities where noncitizens are being held. DHS has also used military-style tactics and equipment to break down doors in suburban homes, with little transparency into the basis for such raids,” the lawmakers continued their letter.

The lawmakers underscored that the tactics DHS used in Southern California, headed by Gregory Bovino, will not be tolerated in Illinois, especially as DHS faces several lawsuits for its treatment of protesters in California. In Illinois, DHS and ICE masked agents have reportedly escalated tensions at Broadview by indiscriminately deploying tear gas and chemical agents on protestors. Reports have detailed a dangerous lack of communication between local law enforcement and ICE agents that led to injuries and further distrust between federal agencies, local law enforcement, and community members.

“Gregory Bovino, an official originally diverted from his responsibilities at the border to lead controversial operations in Southern California, announced a second operation in Illinois—'Operation at Large’—on social media. This operation will reportedly include indiscriminate raids, including at Home Depots and car washes. Mr. Bovino’s reckless and dangerous tactics in California should not be extended to Illinois, as they are already the subject of multiple lawsuits alleging abuses against citizens and noncitizens alike,” the lawmakers wrote. “Masked officers have arrested and detained U.S. citizens and lawful noncitizens without making attempts to verify—or even ignoring attempts to establish—U.S. citizenship or lawful presence.”

“These tactics are already being utilized by your agents in Illinois. While DHS has yet to provide Congress with current information on arrests in Illinois, your officials are estimating in the media that between 400 and 550 arrests have already occurred. Last Friday, ICE reportedly escalated tensions by indiscriminately using tear gas and chemical agents on peaceful protestors,” the lawmakers continued their letter.

“A spokesperson for the Broadview Police Department (BPD) said that BPD and ICE had an agreement that ICE would inform BPD before the agency used any chemical arms, but ICE did not provide such advance notification. As a result of your officials’ dangerous and reckless tactics, an officer was reportedly exposed to mace and tear gas used by ICE. While your spokesperson claims that ICE officials called local law enforcement multiple times for assistance, BPD says that the agency ‘did not receive ‘multiple calls for assistance’ from the leadership of the ICE detention facility in Broadview. That is false,’” the lawmakers wrote.

The lawmakers exposed the Trump Administration’s failure to uphold due process as ICE agents carry out arbitrary arrests and detentions. Further, the Trump Administration has eliminated a longstanding requirement that ICE officers provide a written justification before targeting individuals for immigration arrests.

“We are already seeing improper arrests of U.S. citizens in Illinois, and are deeply disturbed by these indiscriminate arrests coupled with renewed efforts to gut due process and indefinitely detain people who have spent decades in the United States without committing any crime. While some attempts to fulfill President Trump’s mass deportation scheme have been struck down in courts, these efforts have nonetheless resulted in unlawful arrests, detentions, and, in some cases, deportations before courts can intervene,” the lawmakers wrote.

The lawmakers concluded their letter by denouncing the fear and division created by these operations and demanding transparency surrounding immigration enforcement activity in Chicago. Requesting a response by October 7, the lawmakers submitted questions about reports that DHS has brought in social media influencers to promote immigration raids; reports about the use of military weaponry, including drones, during raids; and about the training that federal officials have received on responding to and de-escalating protests.

“Your extreme immigration enforcement operations in Illinois have already devastated families and torn at the social fabric of our communities,” the lawmakers concluded their letter.

In addition to Casten and Durbin, the letter was signed by all Democratic members of the Illinois congressional delegation, including U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Jonathan Jackson (D-IL-01), Robin Kelly (D-IL-02), Delia Ramirez (D-IL-03), Jesús G. “Chuy” García (D-IL-04), Mike Quigley (D-IL-05), Danny Davis (D-IL-07), Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL-08), Jan Schakowsky (D-IL-09), Brad Schneider (D-IL-10), Bill Foster (D-IL-11), Nikki Budzinski (D-IL-13), Lauren Underwood (D-IL-14), and Eric Sorensen (D-IL-17).

Vorbe was in custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Tuesday, according to online records.
His arrest comes two months after ICE agents in Florida arrested Réginald Boulos, a businessman, doctor and former Haitian presidential hopeful.

The Vorbe family is not only economically powerful, but politically as well.","SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Federal immigration agents have arrested Dimitri Vorbe, one of Haiti’s most powerful businessmen and the latest elite figure from the troubled Caribbean country to be detained on U.S. soil.

Vorbe was in custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Tuesday, according to online records. He was being held at Krome North Service Processing Center in Miami.

It wasn’t immediately clear why Vorbe was arrested or if he faces any charges. A search for court records in Florida on Tuesday showed no formal charges. An ICE spokesperson did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

His arrest comes two months after ICE agents in Florida arrested Réginald Boulos, a businessman, doctor and former Haitian presidential hopeful. Authorities have accused Boulos of supporting violent gangs in Haiti that the U.S. government has deemed terrorist groups.

“With the arrests of Boulos and Vorbe, you are seeing a strata of Haitian society touched in their places of exile,” said Michael Deibert, author of “Notes From the Last Testament: The Struggle for Haiti,” and “Haiti Will Not Perish: A Recent History.”

“A message is being sent to the upper echelon of Haiti’s political and economic elite that they’re not untouchable anymore,” he said.

A wealthy scion

Vorbe and his family own Société Générale d’Énergie S.A, a private power company that was one of the biggest suppliers of electricity to Haiti’s state-owned company.

The Vorbe family also was known for securing major government construction projects for the building of roads and other infrastructure under former President René Préval.

“They were getting lots of money from the state,” said Jake Johnston, international research director at the Washington-based Center for Economic and Policy Research. “Both Boulos and Dimitri Vorbe were the two members of the elite, the oligarchs that Jovenel went after.”

In 2020, the administration of slain former President Jovenel Moïse seized Vorbe’s power company following accusations of corruption.

“There is not much love lost in Haiti either for Dimitri Vorbe or Réginald Boulos, or many of the elite families,” Johnston said of the arrests. “Many people will cheer it in a country with a broken judicial system as it’s some sliver of accountability, (but) we don’t know what any of this is for. … How does this all fit together into a strategy that actually benefits Haiti?”

A US crackdown

Vorbe was taken into custody a day after the U.S. government designated two former Haitian public officials who were close to the Vorbe family for involvement in “significant corruption” while in office.

The designation against Arnel Belizaire, a former member of Haiti’s Chamber of Deputies, and Antonio Cheramy, a former senator, means that they and their immediate family are “generally ineligible” to enter the U.S.

“The U.S. government will remain relentless in pursuing those supporting terrorist gangs through indictments, arrests, sanctions, arms seizures and other immigration restrictions,” Christopher Landau, deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of State, said Monday.

The Vorbe family is not only economically powerful, but politically as well.

These are common-sense necessities that safeguard all law enforcement agencies as they keep us safe and protect our communities.","The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has said it will defy California's new ""No Secret Police Act,"" which restricts law enforcement officers from masking their identities during operations.

California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill on Saturday that prohibits local and federal law enforcement officers from wearing ski masks, neck gaiters, or other face coverings while performing official duties. He made the post hours after his press office wrote in an X post that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem ""is going to have a bad day today.""

""Governor Gavin Newsom is fanning the flames of division, hatred and dehumanization of our law enforcement. At a time that ICE law enforcement faces a 1,000% increase in assaults and their family members are being doxxed and targeted, the sitting Governor of California signs unconstitutional legislation that strips law enforcement of protections in a disgusting, diabolical fundraising and PR stunt,"" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a press release.

She added: ""He signed this piece of legislation the same day his team made a menacing threat against Secretary Kristi Noem online. The violent rhetoric and demonization must stop. To be crystal clear: we will not abide by Newsom's unconstitutional ban.""

Why It Matters

ICE has come under increased scrutiny for deploying agents in plain clothes and wearing face coverings during operations, a measure officials say is essential to protect both agents and their families from threats. Under the new legislation, California becomes the first state to prohibit enforcement agents from covering their faces, with limited exceptions for undercover operations and medical masks.

What To Know

Newsom signed a series of legislative bills aimed at curbing ICE's ability to conduct raids in sensitive locations such as schools and churches.

Under state law, schools must notify families when immigration officers are present on campus. Student records and classrooms are protected from access by ICE without a judicial warrant or court order, per the new legislation. Similarly, emergency rooms and other nonpublic areas of hospitals are off-limits to immigration enforcement without court authorization, and information collected by health care providers is treated as protected medical data.

The laws also require that law enforcement and immigration officers be clearly identifiable by name or badge number, with exceptions limited to situations where identification is not possible. The use of masks by officers is restricted to cases where it is absolutely necessary.

Additionally, impersonating a federal agent is explicitly defined as a criminal offense, under the bill.

Acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli told CBS News in an interview on September 22 that California has no jurisdiction to regulate the federal government. His remarks came in response to the recently signed law, which is set to take effect next year. Essayli's statement reflects the federal government's position that state law cannot override federal operations, and he indicated that federal agents in California would not be bound by the state mask restrictions.

DHS has repeatedly claimed that ICE officers have faced a surge in assaults, including attacks using vehicles, as well as online doxing campaigns targeting officers and their families. However, the agency has refused to release a detailed breakdown of the alleged assaults.

Despite the new restrictions, DHS has said that ICE will continue its immigration enforcement operations in California.

The confrontation highlights growing tensions between federal law enforcement agencies and California's state leadership over President Donald Trump's hardline immigration agenda.

Newsom has repeatedly squared off and gone toe to toe with the Trump administration, particularly over immigration raids and the federal deployment of thousands of National Guard troops and hundreds of U.S. Marines to quell immigration protests in Los Angeles in June, despite objections from state leaders.

What People Are Saying

Newsom said on Saturday: ""It's like a dystopian sci-fi movie—unmarked cars, people in masks, people quite literally disappearing. This is a disgrace. This is an outrage, what we've allowed to happen in this country.""

Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin: ""He signed this piece of legislation the same day his team made a menacing threat against Secretary Kristi Noem online. The violent rhetoric and demonization must stop. To be crystal clear: we will not abide by Newsom's unconstitutional ban.""

Acting U.S. Attorney Bill Eassayli told CBS News: ""The law has no force or effect on federal agencies. The State of California has no jurisdiction to regulate anything that we do in the federal government and I've instructed our agents to disregard it.""

Jason P. Houser, former chief of staff, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and former CBP counterterrorism official, said in a press release: ""Ensuring that officers are clearly identified, while providing sensible exceptions, helps protect both the public and law enforcement personnel. These are common-sense necessities that safeguard all law enforcement agencies as they keep us safe and protect our communities.

Alvaro Mejia Ayala, now 22, was arrested and charged with strangulation Sept. 17, the day he’s accused of choking his baby sister, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

Leesburg police are not releasing the child’s identity at the request of the family.

Officers responded to Hancock Place NE in Leesburg around 10 a.m. on Sept. 17 for a call involving an infant in medical distress. Despite extensive efforts from first responders and medical professionals to save her life, the child died just after midnight on Tuesday.

Ayala left the scene before officers arrived, according to Leesburg Police Chief Thea Pirnat, but was found several hours later and will face additional charges, including murder. He is currently being held at the county’s detention center.

“The entire process may take several months and this is considered a very active investigation,” Pirnat said during a news conference Tuesday. “Let me be clear, this was not an accident. A child was murdered in a deliberate act. The Leesburg Police Department and our criminal justice partners are fully committed to ensuring that the person responsible is held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.”

Police did not release additional details about the circumstances of the child’s death.

“We will continue to provide information when it is legally and ethically appropriate to do so, but we will not be prematurely releasing details that could compromise the integrity of this investigation or derail the pursuit of justice,” Pirnat said.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has also issued an immigration detainer for Ayala, according to Pirnat, which requests the jail to hold him for 48 hours longer than the time he’d be released so ICE can take him into federal custody.

In a news release, the Department of Homeland Security said Ayala entered the U.S. with his family in 2016 from El Salvador and that his immigration case was dismissed in October 2024.

“The death of a child is an unbearable loss, and this one has deeply affected the involved family, our community and every first responder that was called to help,” Pirnat said.

Ayala is expected in court in November.

The class action lawsuit filed this week could affect immigrants who have been detained under similar circumstances in Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont and Rhode Island.","The ACLU of Maine has joined a class action lawsuit alleging that federal immigration officials are violating the constitutional rights of many individuals caught up in the nationwide crackdown on non-citizens.

The lawsuit focuses on whether non-citizens who are detained far from the border are entitled to bond hearings before an immigration judge. That was the practice for nearly 30 years, according to the national ACLU and their state affiliates in Massachusetts, Maine and New Hampshire.

But the class action lawsuit filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts accuses the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security of illegally reversing that precedent by denying detainees the ability to seek release on bond while their immigration cases play out. The groups contend that the agencies are ""systemically misclassifying people arrested inside the United States"" by treating them the same as individuals who are stopped at the border or at ports of entry — a group who can be held without bond hearings under current law.

""This statute has never been applied to people arrested in the interior of the United States and placed in removal proceedings, and this practice blatantly goes against its plain language,” Max Brooks, an immigration attorney for ACLU of Maine, said in a statement. “However, CBP and ICE have begun indefinitely jailing people who are undergoing civil immigration proceedings that can take months or years. This is a clear violation of the due process rights of immigrants as outlined by federal law.""

The lawsuit is just the latest legal challenge of the Trump administration's detention and mass deportation campaign against non-citizens, including many who have been living and working in the U.S. for years and who have no criminal records. Multiple other lawsuits have been filed across the country against the current practice of holding immigrants in detention facilities while their cases work through the immigration courts.

Earlier this month, the Board of Immigration Appeals within the DOJ issued a decision allowing immigration judges to deny detainees access to a bond hearing even if they were stopped far from the border. In its decision, the board noted that judges cannot hold bond hearings for non-citizens who are detained after presenting themselves at the border or at a port of entry.

The board added that interpreting the Immigration and Nationality Act otherwise ""would require reading the (law) to conclude that Congress intended that aliens unlawfully entering the United States without inspection, particularly those who successfully evaded apprehension for more than 2 years, be rewarded with the opportunity for a bond hearing before an Immigration Judge, whereas aliens who present themselves to officers at a port of entry are ineligible for a bond hearing.

Last week, a federal judge in Maine ruled that Customs and Border Patrol agents likely violated a man's due process rights by denying him a bond hearing after he was arrested near Waterville. The judge then prohibited the federal government from transferring the man to a distant detention facility.

The class action lawsuit filed this week could affect immigrants who have been detained under similar circumstances in Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont and Rhode Island.

President Donald Trump scolded the European nations during his United Nations address on Tuesday morning, specifically over immigration policies in several countries.

Europe has dealt with a major influx of people coming from Africa and the Middle East in recent years, with critics raising concerns about everything from resources to cultural assimilation.

""The U.N. is supposed to stop invasions, not create them and not finance them,"" Trump said.

""You're destroying your countries. They're being destroyed. Europe is in serious trouble. They've been invaded by a force of illegal aliens like nobody's ever seen before. Illegal aliens are pouring into Europe. Nobody is doing anything to change it to get them out. It's not sustainable. And because they choose to be politically correct, they're doing just absolutely nothing about it,"" he added.

Trump compared the situation to the United States’ own border crisis under the Biden administration, which led to millions of people entering the country illegally.

""In the United States, we reject the idea that mass numbers of people from foreign lands can be permitted to travel halfway around the world, trample our borders, violate our sovereignty, cause unmitigated crime and deplete our social safety net. We have reasserted that America belongs to the American people, and I encourage all countries to take their own stand in defense of their citizens as well,"" the president said.

In a May letter, several European countries slammed the European Court of Human Rights for restricting the ability to deport migrants who have committed crimes, saying that it hurts individual countries' ability to make their own choices on immigration policy.

""Many have come here via legal pathways. They have learned our languages, believe in democracy, contribute to our societies and have decided to integrate themselves into our culture,"" the letter signed by Denmark, Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Italy and Poland stated.
