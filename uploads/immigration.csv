“The town has received no official communication from ICE or any federal agency regarding such a proposal,” the Merrillville Town Council said in a release Wednesday.
“Upon learning of the report, Merrillville officials immediately began reviewing the matter.
Currently, the town has no information confirming the accuracy of the Washington Post report.
This wouldn’t be the first time an immigration detention facility tried to set down roots in Northwest Indiana.","A plan by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to deport immigrants “like Prime, but with human beings” may include a Merrillville location — to the town’s complete surprise.

Town officials have been seeking clarification from federal sources since they got wind of a Washington Post article that ran on Christmas Eve saying the Trump administration “is seeking contractors to help it overhaul the United States’ immigrant detention system in a plan that includes renovating industrial warehouses to hold more than 80,000 immigrant detainees at a time.” Its plan, based on an unfinalized document the paper obtained, is to “speed up deportations by establishing a deliberate feeder system.”

“Newly arrested detainees would be booked into processing sites for a few weeks before being funneled into one of seven large-scale warehouses holding 5,000 to 10,000 people each, where they would be staged for deportation,” the Washington Post article said. “The large warehouses would be located close to major logistics hubs in Virginia, Texas, Louisiana, Arizona, Georgia and Missouri. Sixteen smaller warehouses would hold up to 1,500 people each.

“The new facilities will ‘maximize efficiency, minimize costs, shorten processing times, limit lengths of stay, accelerate the removal process and promote the safety, dignity and respect for all in ICE custody,’ the solicitation said. ICE plans to share it with private detention companies this week to gauge interest and refine the plan, according to an internal email reviewed by The Post.”

While not mentioned in the article outright, Merrillville was included and named in a graphic published with it. The revelation, however, came as a complete shock, town officials said.

“The town has received no official communication from ICE or any federal agency regarding such a proposal,” the Merrillville Town Council said in a release Wednesday. “Upon learning of the report, Merrillville officials immediately began reviewing the matter. Currently, the town has no information confirming the accuracy of the Washington Post report.

“Officials will keep the community informed as verified information becomes available.”

Council President Rick Bella, D-5, told the Post-Tribune that he believes Merrillville was included only as a “possible” location and not as an official one.

“It’s kind of like people who mention to us a possible Data Center: It’s just talk until something more formal happens,” Bella said.

Officials downstate also appeared to have been kept in the dark about any processing center plans for Northwest Indiana. Governor Mike Braun’s spokesman Griffin Reid said he had inquiries out on the matter, but did not respond by deadline.

This wouldn’t be the first time an immigration detention facility tried to set down roots in Northwest Indiana. Florida-based GEO Group in 2016 saw its plans for an $80 million private immigration detention center in Gary go up in smoke after nine months of wooing because at least six council members opposed it, the Post-Tribune previously reported.

GEO operates similar detention facilities across the country and some have drawn fire from human rights supporters and the ACLU over the treatment of immigrants. In response, GEO officials say some of the claims have been inflated by activists and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency holds its detention centers to high standards and procedures that are regularly audited.

Although no plans were ever revealed, GEO owns a 40-acre site in Hobart on West 49th Avenue where strident opposition from residents and city officials continues. GEO still owns the property.

ICE held more than 68,000 people at the beginning of this month, agency data shows, the highest number on record, according to the Washington Post article. Nearly half, or 48 percent of these people, have no criminal convictions or pending criminal charges, ICE data shows.

“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” ICE acting director Todd M. Lyons said at a border security conference in April, according to the Arizona Mirror. He would prefer the deportation process operate “like Prime, but with human beings.”

Adelina Pruneda, an ICE Public Affairs Officer out of Central & South Texas, was on vacation and did not return a request for comment.

And in both instances officers allegedly retrieved Venegas' Alabama-issued REAL ID from his pocket but claimed it could be fake.
Lavoie's declaration says that the agents ""needed to further verify his U.S. citizenship because each state has its own REAL ID compliance laws, which may provide for the issuance of a REAL ID to an alien and therefore based on HSI Special Agent training and experience, REAL ID can be unreliable to confirm U.S.

But that's what the federal government has accomplished with the REAL ID, which the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) now considers unreliable, even though getting one requires providing proof of citizenship or lawful status in the country.

In a December 11 court filing, Philip Lavoie, the acting assistant special agent in charge of DHS' Mobile, Alabama, office, stated that, ""REAL ID can be unreliable to confirm U.S. citizenship.""

Lavoie's declaration was in response to a federal civil rights lawsuit filed in October by the Institute for Justice, a public-interest law firm, on behalf of Leo Garcia Venegas, an Alabama construction worker. Venegas was detained twice in May and June during immigration raids on private construction sites, despite being a U.S. citizen. In both instances, Venegas' lawsuit says, masked federal immigration officers entered the private sites without a warrant and began detaining workers based solely on their apparent ethnicity.

And in both instances officers allegedly retrieved Venegas' Alabama-issued REAL ID from his pocket but claimed it could be fake. Venegas was kept handcuffed and detained for an hour the first time and ""between 20 and 30 minutes"" the second time before officers ran his information and released him.

Lavoie's declaration says that the agents ""needed to further verify his U.S. citizenship because each state has its own REAL ID compliance laws, which may provide for the issuance of a REAL ID to an alien and therefore based on HSI Special Agent training and experience, REAL ID can be unreliable to confirm U.S. citizenship.""

It's the punch line to a bad joke with a 20-year windup. When Congress passed the REAL ID Act in 2005. It was sold as a post-9/11 security measure to create uniform standards for state IDs, including clearly listing citizenship or lawful immigration status. State IDs that conformed to the requirements would be marked with a star. Contrary to the cheeky first sentence of this story, DHS insists that REAL ID is not a national ID system, and that it doesn't involve a centralized national database. (Civil liberties groups say it amounts to a de facto national ID system anyway.)

The rub was that REAL IDs would be required for entry to federal property, including, most significantly for the average American, airport security checkpoints. But the law was widely unpopular. There was such low compliance from states that enforcement was delayed seven times over the years, until finally beginning this May.

The project should have been scrapped years ago. America somehow survived two decades of terrorism-free air travel without REAL IDs. As Reason's Scott Shackford wrote in 2021, ""The government is demanding that Americans give up more of their privacy to the feds, subject themselves to additional inane bureaucracy, and carry around proof that we're citizens to be able to fly, even though none of that makes us more secure.""

And now we discover that DHS doesn't even consider the thing proof of citizenship.

In a court filing in response to DHS, the Institute for Justice noted how incredible this position is. ""REAL IDs require proof of citizenship or lawful status,"" the Institute for Justice wrote. ""DHS is the very agency responsible for certifying that REAL IDs, including Alabama's STAR IDs, satisfy this requirement.""

The law firm argues that DHS' policy of allowing officers to disregard proof of lawful presence likely violates the Fourth Amendment and DHS' own regulations.

When asked to comment on Lavoie's declaration, a DHS spokesperson said in a statement to Reason: ""The INA requires aliens and non-citizens in the US to carry immigration documents. Real IDs are not immigration documents—they make identification harder to forge, thwarting criminals and terrorists.""

But of course, Venegas is a U.S. citizen, so he is not required to carry non-existent immigration documents.

DHS' statement to Reason when Venegas' lawsuit was first filed insisted that, ""What makes someone a target for immigration enforcement is if they are illegally in the U.S.—NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity.""

The agency never responded to a follow-up question asking why, then, Venegas was targeted.

This is the cynical two-step that the Supreme Court allowed this September when it overturned a ruling by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which found that the Trump administration was likely violating the Fourth Amendment rights of citizens by seizing them based solely on factors such as ""apparent race or ethnicity.""

Justice Brett Kavanaugh released a concurring opinion in which he waved away concerns that allowing such profiling would lead to citizens and legal residents being unduly harassed.

""As for stops of those individuals who are legally in the country, the questioning in those circumstances is typically brief,"" Kavanaugh wrote, ""and those individuals may promptly go free after making clear to the immigration officers that they are U. S. citizens or otherwise legally in the United States.""",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/12/REAL-ID.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 04:56:26.262020

While those with TPS status can’t be deported and can work legally in the U.S., they do not have a path to U.S. citizenship.

On July 31, Thompson postponed the termination of the TPS program for Nicaragua, Honduras and Nepal until Nov. 18.
However, a federal appeals court stayed that ruling, greenlighting the Trump administration to go ahead with its termination of TPS status for the three countries while litigation played out.","SAN FRANCISCO (CN) — Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem’s decision to terminate temporary protected status for more than 60,000 immigrants from Nicaragua, Honduras and Nepal was unlawful, a federal judge ruled Monday.

U.S. District Judge Trina L. Thompson found that Noem’s termination of the three countries’ protected status was “preordained” and did not follow the proper process, including consulting with other federal agencies or considering all country conditions.

The Joe Biden appointee further found that Noem “inexplicably departed from prior practice” by limiting the transition period for Nepali, Honduran and Nicaraguan TPS holders to 60 days, an unexplained change from 22 years of DHS practice of allowing at least six months’ transition after a TPS termination notice.

“Unilateral power has never been American. Nor has this country ignored the importance of humanitarian relief,” Thompson said in the opening of her 52-page order.

She continued: “By complying with the Constitution and enforcing the purpose of the temporary protected status statute, this nation’s economy becomes strengthened and our society united.”

The TPS program protects individuals from certain countries due to violence or economic duress. While those with TPS status can’t be deported and can work legally in the U.S., they do not have a path to U.S. citizenship. The National TPS Alliance and individual TPS holders from Nicaragua, Honduras and Nepal sued after Noem ordered the termination of protected status for the three countries, claiming her actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act and were motivated by racial animus.

The order vacates Noem’s terminations, restoring protections for thousands of TPS holders in the country.

“Consistent with virtually every District Court decision in the last year, the court found that the administration failed to follow the law as it pursued its vendetta against these immigrant communities,” UCLA Center for Immigration Law and Policy Co-Director Ahilan Arulanantham said in a statement to Courthouse News.

National TPS Alliance coordinator Jose Palma said the decision “brings hope” to the TPS community but acknowledged that the government will most likely appeal the ruling.

“Today’s victory, we have to celebrate it; it gives hope that respect for the law is still strong and the court will continue being strong on the side of the law,” he said.

A representative for the Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment.

In the order, Thompson said Noem’s decision to terminate TPS to Nicaragua, Honduras and Nepal was arbitrary and capricious because her decision was “preordained and not based on an objective review of the country conditions, after consultation with the appropriate interagency department, as required by the TPS statute and the APA.”

Thompson also found that Noem deviated from past practices by not considering all country conditions when she made her decision, writing that the government’s decision to only consider conditions under the initial designation for TPS would go against the intent of the statute.

“Defendants’ interpretation to only include the initial designation would grant the secretary unfettered discretion to terminate TPS for a country in the midst of destabilizing and destructive civil war so long as a historic flood for which an antecedent TPS designation was made (even just months earlier) had dissipated,” the judge wrote, adding, “Such a perplexing result is a natural consequence of defendants’ interpretation of the TPS statute; and this court need not ‘read the statute to usher in such a bizarre and half-baked scheme.’”

Further, Thompson said there was “substantial evidence” that the termination decisions for Nicaragua, Honduras and Nepal were motivated by racial animus, referring to multiple public statements by Noem and President Donald Trump that referred to TPS holders as criminals.

“These statements reflect a stereotyping of the immigrants protected under the TPS program as criminal invaders and perpetuate the discriminatory belief that certain immigrant populations will replace the white population,” the judge said.

On July 31, Thompson postponed the termination of the TPS program for Nicaragua, Honduras and Nepal until Nov. 18. However, a federal appeals court stayed that ruling, greenlighting the Trump administration to go ahead with its termination of TPS status for the three countries while litigation played out.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2025/01/kristi-noem-speaks-to-homeland-security-employees.jpeg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2025-12-31 23:56:32.766476

Arquette was responding to White’s post slamming Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tennessee) for re-sharing an AI-generated video of the White Stripes musician threatening Trump voters.

The pro-Trump X account MAGA Response posted a video Monday of an AI-generated clip of White telling Trump supporters, “Don’t even think about listening to my music, you fascists.”

A day later, Burchett retweeted the video and mocked White’s appearance, writing, “That cute little girl from the Addams Family got really ugly and angry.”

White responded on Instagram, calling out the congressman’s “playground” bully behavior.

“Can you believe that a U.S. congressman, that’s right, a CONGRESSMAN (from my state no less), a once hallowed and respected position in our society, would repost an AI-generated video, containing a false comment that I never said and refuted (without researching that I might add) and like a 10 year old on a playground, add to it attempted insults to my physical appearance?” White asked his Instagram followers. “What kind of joke are we all living in now?”

White went on to bemoan how “low class playground bullies” like Trump and Burchett have lowered the standards for America’s elected officials, writing, “It’s really sad how embarrassing our leadership has become, I so wish the average American conservative could have a conversation with any intelligent people in other countries around the world, just for one brief moment, and actually see just what a joke our government (and by proxy our country) has become.”

The musician concluded his fiery post Monday by predicting a future when officials like Burchett refuse to “admit to being a part” of the MAGA “cult” and “well-spoken leaders” have replaced them in power.

“All the MAGA hats will be in landfills and actual intelligent and honorable leadership will take their place.

Governors react The Supreme Court in December refused to allow the Trump administration to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area.
A judge permanently blocked the deployment of National Guard troops there in November after a three-day trial.
Tina Kotek said in a statement Wednesday that her office had not yet received ""official notification that the remaining federalized Oregon National Guard troops can return home.
Trump's decision to federalize National Guard troops began in Los Angeles in June, when protesters took to the streets in response to a blitz of immigration arrests in the area.","SAN FRANCISCO -- President Donald Trump said he's dropping - for now - his push to deploy National Guard troops in Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland, Oregon, a move that comes after legal roadblocks held up the effort.

""We will come back, perhaps in a much different and stronger form, when crime begins to soar again - Only a question of time!"" he said in a social media post Wednesday.

Governors typically control states' National Guardsmen, and Trump had deployed troops to all three cities against the wishes of state and local Democratic leaders. He said it was necessary as part of a broader crackdown on immigration, crime and protests.

The president has made a crackdown on crime in cities a centerpiece of his second term - and has toyed with the idea of invoking the Insurrection Act to stop his opponents from using the courts to block his plans. He has said he sees his tough-on-crime approach as a winning political issue ahead of next year's midterm elections.

Troops had already left Los Angeles after the president deployed them earlier this year as part of a broader crackdown on crime and immigration.

In his post, Trump said the troops' presence was responsible for a drop in crime in the three cities, though they were never on the streets in Chicago and Portland as legal challenges played out. When the Chicago deployment was challenged in court, a Justice Department lawyer said the Guard's mission would be to protect federal properties and government agents in the field, not ""solving all of crime in Chicago.""

Portland Mayor Keith Wilson's office in a statement said the city's reduction in crime was due to the efforts of local police and public safety programs. Chicago officials echoed the sentiment, saying in a release Tuesday that the city had 416 homicides in 2025 - the fewest since 2014.

Trump's push to deploy the troops in Democrat-led cities has been met with legal challenges at nearly every turn.

Governors react

The Supreme Court in December refused to allow the Trump administration to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area. The order was not a final ruling but was a significant and rare setback by the high court for the president's efforts.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker wrote on X Wednesday that Trump ""lost in court when Illinois stood up against his attempt to militarize American cities with the National Guard. Now Trump is forced to stand down.""

Hundreds of troops from California and Oregon were deployed to Portland, but a federal judge barred them from going on the streets. A judge permanently blocked the deployment of National Guard troops there in November after a three-day trial.

Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek said in a statement Wednesday that her office had not yet received ""official notification that the remaining federalized Oregon National Guard troops can return home. They were never lawfully deployed to Portland and there was no need for their presence. If President Trump has finally chosen to follow court orders and demobilize our troops, that's a big win for Oregonians and for the rule of law.""

Trump's decision to federalize National Guard troops began in Los Angeles in June, when protesters took to the streets in response to a blitz of immigration arrests in the area. He deployed about 4,000 troops and 700 Marines to guard federal buildings and, later, to protest federal agents as they carried out immigration arrests.

The number of troops slowly dwindled until just several hundred were left. They were removed from the streets by Dec. 15 after a lower court ruling that also ordered control to be returned to Gov. Gavin Newsom. But an appeals court had paused the second part of the order, meaning control remained with Trump. In a Tuesday court filing, the Trump administration said it was no longer seeking a pause in that part of the order.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on Wednesday ordered the Trump administration to return control of the National Guard to Newsom.

""About time (Trump) admitted defeat,"" Newsom said in a social media post. ""We've said it from day one: the federal takeover of California's National Guard is illegal.""

Troops will remain on the ground in several other cities. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in December paused a lower court ruling that had called for an end to the deployment of National Guard troops in Washington, D.C., where they've been deployed since August after Trump declared a ""crime emergency.""

Trump also ordered the deployment of the Tennessee National Guard to Memphis in September as part of a larger federal task force to combat crime, a move supported by the state's Republican Gov. Bill Lee and senators. A Tennessee judge blocked the use of the Guard, siding with Democratic state and local officials who sued. However, the judge stayed the decision to block the Guard as the state appeals, allowing the deployment to continue.

In New Orleans, about 350 National Guard troops deployed by Trump arrived in the city's historic French Quarter on Tuesday and are set to stay through Mardi Gras to help with safety. The state's Republican governor and the city's Democratic mayor support the deployment.

“This reflects a clear misalignment with the values I expect our elected officials to uphold,” posted tribal member and former Oneida Nation attorney Rebecca Webster. “This is mind boggling that anyone thought this was a good idea.”

Others posted that ICE is targeting mostly Indigenous people from Turtle Island (North America) who happen to be from Mexico or Central America.

There have been incidents in which ICE briefly detained tribal members of reservations in the U.S. in apparent cases of racial profiling.

These incidents have drawn ire from Indian Country because the ones being arrested have ancestors who were among the first people in what is now the U.S., going back at least 10,000 years.

A similar situation of a tribal nation facing the ire of Indian Country after it entered into a contract with ICE occurred earlier this month with the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation of Kansas.

Dallas Goldtooth, a popular Indian Country actor, comedian and activist spoke out against that nearly $30 million contract.

“This is a clear example of where economic development without any base values grounded in Indigenous philosophy and human dignity leads you into some dark places,” he wrote on social media about the issue.

Prairie Band officials fired the senior members of the tribe’s LLC, which made the contract with ICE. Potawatomi tribal officials later announced they were able to cancel the contract with ICE.

On Wednesday, Oneida tribal officials issued a statement saying they condemn OESC’s actions to enter into the contracts with ICE because “we believe such actions hinder teaching our values to the next seven generations of its employees, representatives or corporations if we do not abide by those values today.”

The leadership of OESC is scheduled to meet with the tribal business committee, which just passed a resolution to provide clarity of the tribe’s position on the issue.

“Passing this resolution is an initial step to implementing clarity about the Nation’s expectations that our employees, representatives, businesses and tribal corporations align with our core values,” Oneida Chairman Tehassi Hill said in a statement. “The Oneida Business Committee will consider other appropriate steps needs to prevent future misalignment with balanced measure using our ‘Good Mind Principles’.”

In his more-than-eight-hour of testimony, Smith insisted he had no political motivations in indicting Trump, and said he believed “we had proof beyond a reasonable doubt in both cases” that he brought.
Smith later told an unnamed committee staffer he would have indicted Biden or Barack Obama over similar evidence.
“President Trump and his associates tried to call members of Congress in furtherance of their criminal scheme, urging them to further delay certification of the 2020 election.
I did not choose those members, President Trump did,” Smith said.","Jack Smith, the former justice department special counsel who led the aborted federal prosecution of Donald Trump, told a congressional committee that he never spoke to Joe Biden about his cases, according to the transcript of a deposition released on Wednesday.

In his behind-closed-doors testimony to the House judiciary committee earlier this month, Smith defended the charges he brought against Trump for allegedly possessing classified documents and attempting to overturn the 2020 election, while warning of the consequences of allowing election meddling to go unpunished.

“Theoretically, what happens if there is election interference and the people who are responsible for that are not held accountable?” Democratic congresswoman Pramila Jayapal asked.

“It becomes the new norm, and that becomes how we … conduct elections,” Smith replied, according to the transcript.

“And so the toll on our democracy, if you had to describe that, what would that be?” the congresswoman asked.

“Catastrophic,” Smith said.

Trump and his Republican allies have alleged that the former special counsel was a key figure in a justice department that Biden had “weaponized” against his predecessor. The Republican-controlled House judiciary committee earlier this year heard testimony from one of Smith’s top deputies, and months later subpoenaed the former special counsel for private testimony. Smith had offered to voluntarily testify in public, as special counsels typically do.

In questioning from Democratic congressman Dan Goldman, Smith said he operated without interference from Merrick Garland, the attorney general who appointed him, or any other top justice department officials.

“Did President Biden ever give you any instructions about what you should or should not do related to these investigations?” Goldman asked.

“No,” Smith replied, later specifying he had not spoken to Biden about his cases in any way.

Smith was appointed in November 2022, and quickly brought the two federal cases against Trump, who also faced state-level charges of election interference in Georgia, and falsifying business records in New York.

While he would later be convicted of 34 felonies in the Manhattan case, neither of Trump’s federal indictments went to trial before he returned to office following the 2024 election, after which Smith, in line with justice department policy, dropped the charges.

The election-interference case was slowed by pretrial motions, including a supreme court ruling that gave presidents immunity for official acts and forced Smith to make changes to his case. The classified-documents case was hampered by rulings from Florida judge Aileen Cannon, who at one point dismissed Smith’s indictment.

Smith authored a report into his prosecutions, and the portion covering the election interference case was released prior to Biden leaving office. However, Cannon has barred the chapter discussing the classified-documents charges from being made public, though Democrats on the judiciary committee have asked her to reverse her decision.

At the outset of the hearing, an attorney for Smith, Peter Koski, told the committee the former special counsel had received an email from the justice department advising him to avoid talking about his evidence in the case because of Cannon’s ruling.

“This restriction significantly limits Mr Smith’s ability to discuss the classified-documents case. Nevertheless, Mr Smith is committed to doing his best to answering questions consistent with the department’s guidance,” Koski said.

In his more-than-eight-hour of testimony, Smith insisted he had no political motivations in indicting Trump, and said he believed “we had proof beyond a reasonable doubt in both cases” that he brought.

“If asked whether to prosecute a former president based on the same facts today, I would do so regardless of whether that president was a Republican or a Democrat,” he said in his opening statement. Smith later told an unnamed committee staffer he would have indicted Biden or Barack Obama over similar evidence.

Republicans have been in uproar after it emerged that federal investigators obtained data related to the phone usage of several members of Congress, which was used as part of Smith’s prosecutions. Smith hit back in his testimony, saying: “Recent narratives about my team’s work are false and misleading” and the “records were lawfully subpoenaed and were relevant to complete a comprehensive investigation”.

The only data collected, Smith said, was incoming and outgoing phone numbers and the calls’ durations, not their contents themselves. The data helped show that Trump continued to press his allies to stop Biden from formally becoming president, even as his followers were attacking the US Capitol on January 6, he added.

“President Trump and his associates tried to call members of Congress in furtherance of their criminal scheme, urging them to further delay certification of the 2020 election. I did not choose those members, President Trump did,” Smith said.

Trump has repeatedly railed against Smith, and in his testimony the former special counsel acknowledged the risk that the president could come after him.

“I have no doubt that the president wants to seek retribution against me,” Smith said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0c6b6153f6ef9976762872e59a0f5b562c179a7/180_0_1800_1440/master/1800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=57080d18d6d26ff6f65158e72c863b5c",N,,2025-12-31 20:57:24.767673

ICE agents did not appear to present a warrant to the man, and the agents refused to answer questions on the scene.","U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents reportedly swarmed the Central Coast over the weekend, with a local advocacy group saying agents plucked people from their neighborhoods, workplaces and shopping centers without warning.

Immigration agents took at least 92 people into custody from Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, according to data collected by 805 UndocuFund, a local nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting undocumented immigrants and their families. The elevated ICE activity appeared to continue later into the week as well.

“This one is a direct attack on our communities,” 805 UndocuFund communications and media organizer Claudia Gonzalez said, noting that ICE picked most people up in areas where immigrants live and work.

805 UndocuFund collected this data from rapid responders who witness the arrests and community members who call and report the arrests of their friends and family members, she said. The group then checks the numbers to ensure there aren’t duplicates of the same incident in the dataset.

On Saturday, ICE agents took 34 people into custody from Santa Maria and two people into custody from San Luis Obispo, according to the data provided to The Tribune.

Then, on Sunday, ICE took 13 people from Lompoc, two people from Santa Barbara and eight people from Santa Maria — including four people who were working at a gas station, according to the data.

On Monday, ICE agents took 24 people from Santa Maria, five people from San Luis Obispo, one person from Nipomo and three people from Paso Robles, according to the data.

Since President Donald Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20, Gonzalez said ICE agents have taken at least 94 community members into custody from San Luis Obispo County and 537 community members from Santa Barbara County — with a large number of those incidents happening during the past few days, Gonzalez said.

805 UndocuFund community organizer Cesar Vasquez said he’s never seen ICE take so many people during a two-day period.

“It’s been hell,” he said.

ICE did not respond to The Tribune’s request for comment about the apparent uptick in Central Coast activity as of Tuesday.

Elevated ICE activity continues into week

On Monday, 805 UndocuFund rapid responders were running around Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties monitoring ICE agents and offering help to families who had been separated, Vasquez said.

In addition to Santa Maria ICE agents, agents from Camarillo and Los Angeles appeared to join the swarm, too — which Vasquez hasn’t seen before, he said.

805 UndocuFund identifies ICE agents based on their vehicles and license plates.

The activity began early in Santa Maria on Monday, with ICE picking up a man on the way to his car at 4 a.m. on Bunny Avenue, Vasquez said. Then, at 4:45 a.m., ICE detained a man and a woman when he stopped on Bunny Avenue to drive her to work, he said.

At 5:24 a.m., ICE took a man from the parking lot of his apartment building on Western Avenue.

Then, ICE detained a man on Morrison Avenue as he dropped his children off with a babysitter at 5:26 a.m., Vasquez said.

ICE continued to circle the area, taking people into custody on Alvin and Bunny avenues and other nearby streets.

The agents then descended on San Luis Obispo County, taking a father from outside his apartment on Bullock Lane and Orcutt Road, Vasquez said. Then, 30 minutes later, ICE agents picked up two men from the same area, and another man on the way to his car 20 minutes after that, he said.

At 11:13 a.m., ICE agents took a man into custody from the lobby of the San Luis Obispo County Jail when he was released. The Tribune was at the scene at the time he was detained.

The agents immediately placed him in handcuffs and escorted him to a vehicle in the parking lot. ICE agents did not appear to present a warrant to the man, and the agents refused to answer questions on the scene.

Meanwhile, in Paso Robles, ICE took a man at 11:43 a.m. while he was getting groceries, Vasquez said. Agents continued to pick up other people in Santa Maria and across San Luis Obispo County on Monday afternoon, he said.

Tuesday morning was a similar story — with ICE agents driving around Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties to pick people up off the street, Vasquez and Gonzalez both told The Tribune.

The elevated activity has had a large impact on community members through the holiday weekend and into this week.

People avoided leaving their homes, even to go to work, to the doctor or to take their children to school, Gonzalez said.

“They’re definitely scared,” she said. “Even documented community members are scared to go outside, because what we’ve seen is obvious racial profiling. They’re hitting Santa Maria, and this is where our working community lives.”

These deportations have also impacted children from mixed-status families.

“When a family is separated, sometimes they lose their main breadwinner,” Gonzalez said. “Children are left without parents.”

Gonzalez said people can call 805 UndocuFund at 805-870-8855 if they see ICE or if they need assistance because a friend or family member was taken. People can donate to 805 UndocuFund’s mutual aid fund for impacted families at www.pledge.to/mutual-aid-fund.

“When I saw Uncle Sam pointing that finger, I just had it in my heart,” Mahin Ahmed, an ICE applicant, told the Times.","US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has reportedly planned a $100m, one-year media blitz for what it’s calling “wartime recruitment”, targeting conservative radio show listeners, gun rights aficionados, military affairs followers and men’s interests enthusiasts – among others in the Maga-verse – for jobs in the Trump administration’s next phase of its mass deportation campaign.

“Want to deport illegals with your absolute boys?” one of the agency’s ads says, directing interested readers to apply.

As ICE looks to hire for thousands of new positions, flush with cash after an unprecedented influx from Congress last summer, it’s relying on geofencing to ensure people near military bases, Nascar races, gun and trade shows, and college campuses receive its recruitment ads, according to an internal document reported by the Washington Post.

Officials also intend to spend $8m or more on deals with fitness, military and tactical/lifestyle online influencers, who would use their sway to push the administration’s immigration agenda through livestreams, events, and other content meant for their gen Z and millennial audiences.

“America has been invaded by criminals and predators. We need YOU to get them out,” ICE’s recruiting website says.

The administration’s hiring push comes after Donald Trump signed HR 1 into law in July, which allotted $45bn for immigration detention and $32bn for immigration enforcement-related activities and personnel.

Yet even as ICE now has the funds to hire about 14,000 new employees, its efforts to quickly do so have raised red flags among everyday citizens disgusted by the recruitment ads themselves and experts concerned that the speed and tone with which the federal government is pursuing new agents could attract more aggressive, combat-hungry applicants.

“They’re aiming for that sweet spot of people who’ve got something to prove, who want to have that power, under the guise of patriotism,” Americus Reed, a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, told the Post.

ICE’s controversial ads have leaned heavily on American symbolism – Uncle Sam, George Washington, Lady Liberty – while casting immigrants as bad actors to convince potential deportation officers to apply.

Meanwhile, ICE is offering an up to $50,000 signing bonus, higher than the real median personal income for a year’s work in the US, as well as up to $60,000 in student loan repayment for those who join.

The agency has already received more than 220,000 applications and made more than 18,000 tentative job offers, sometimes on the spot. At an ICE recruitment fair in Arlington, Texas, more than a hundred people were waiting outside before the event started.

“When I saw Uncle Sam pointing that finger, I just had it in my heart,” Mahin Ahmed, an ICE applicant, told the Times. “You’re thinking, ‘Look at this guy. He’s an immigrant. He wants to become a deportation officer.’ It doesn’t make any sense to you, makes 100 percent sense to me.”

With more ICE officers available, the White House border czar, Tom Homan, said that the number of immigrant arrests will “explode” in 2026, including through an increase in enforcement at workplaces, Reuters reported.

Homan’s comments came after the administration had signaled it would instead be toning down its public-facing immigration actions to focus on apprehending people with serious criminal convictions, in the face of widespread backlash to its violent and highly visible tactics in major cities around the country.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38bb565c4c908b17da4f77167e55959d3c281e9c/904_0_5001_4000/master/5001.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2d4402e573fdfe2f3354caf1d87583e3",N,,2025-12-31 17:57:23.358418

In the coming year, ICE plans to spend $100 million to recruit individuals who may be a good fit to assist in furthering President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda by targeting military enthusiasts, gun rights supporters, people interested in physical training and conservative politics, according to an internal document seen by the Washington Post.

The plan, reportedly dubbed the “wartime recruitment” strategy by ICE, outlines an aggressive acceleration in strategic marketing that ICE has already used to recruit more than 200,000 individuals to join the agency as it seeks to deport swaths of immigrants from the U.S.

New strategies include targeting recruitment ads to individuals on a military base, attending a NASCAR race or gun trade show, or at a college campus through “geofencing” – a technical strategy where advertisers can create a virtual boundary around a real area to trigger ads on web browsers or social media for people in the location.

The 30-page document also indicates ICE may partner with online influencers, some of whom could be former agents, veterans, or “pro-ICE,” who have Gen-Z and millennials audiences with interests that align with the military or fitness.

Those influencers would be expected to host live streams, attend events or post content online targeted toward “niche communities.”

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said they would not confirm or deny any leaked documents but praised the Washington Post for highlighting Trump and Secretary Kristi Noem’s “wildly successful ICE recruitment campaign, which is under budget and ahead of schedule.”

McLaughlin said ICE received more than 220,000 applications in five months and has issued more than 18,000 tentative job offers. She added that more than 85 percent of new hires have previous law enforcement experience.

McLaughlin stressed that new law enforcement hires meet “the same rigorous standards” that apply to all officers and those deployed in the field attend a virtual Deportation Officer Training Program as well as an in-person firearm and tactical training program at a local field office.

Over the last year, ICE has launched ad campaigns on television, radio, web browsers, streaming services and at in-person sporting events to attract potential recruits. Some of the ads target disgruntled police officers in major cities such as Chicago or Seattle. Others highlight signing bonuses of $50,000, generous benefits and even student loan forgiveness.

The agency has been specifically targeting Gen Z and early-career professionals as potential recruits, according to internal documents seen in August. Officials have been utilizing social media and streaming services to reach more than 42 million people in specific audience groups that may be a good fit for roles in ICE.

Earlier, Crenshaw found that there was “some evidence” that the prosecution of Ábrego García could be vindictive.
He specifically cited a statement by the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, on a Fox News program that seemed to suggest that the Department of Justice charged Ábrego García because he had won his wrongful deportation case.
The human-smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee during which Ábrego García was pulled over for speeding.
“The implication is that ‘clearance’ would come from the Office of the Deputy Attorney General,” Crenshaw writes.","A newly unsealed order in the criminal case against Kilmar Ábrego García reveals that high-level justice department officials pushed for his indictment, calling it a “top priority”, only after he was mistakenly deported and then ordered returned to the U.S.

Ábrego García, originally from El Salvador, has pleaded not guilty in federal court in Tennessee to charges of human smuggling. He is seeking to have the case dismissed on the grounds that the prosecution is vindictive – a way for the Trump administration to punish him for the embarrassment of his mistaken deportation.

To support that argument, he has asked the government to turn over documents that reveal how the decision was made to prosecute him in 2025 for an incident that occurred in 2022. On 3 December, US district judge Waverly Crenshaw filed an order under seal that compelled the government to provide some documents to Ábrego García and his attorneys. That order was unsealed on Tuesday and sheds new light on the case.

Earlier, Crenshaw found that there was “some evidence” that the prosecution of Ábrego García could be vindictive. He specifically cited a statement by the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, on a Fox News program that seemed to suggest that the Department of Justice charged Ábrego García because he had won his wrongful deportation case.

Rob McGuire, who was the acting US attorney for the middle district of Tennessee until late December, argued that those statements were irrelevant because he alone made the decision to prosecute, and he has no animus against Ábrego García.

In the newly unsealed order, Crenshaw writes: “Some of the documents suggest not only that McGuire was not a solitary decision-maker, but he in fact reported to others in [the justice department] and the decision to prosecute Abrego may have been a joint decision.”

The US attorney’s office for the middle district of Tennessee released a statement saying: “The emails cited in Judge Crenshaw’s order, specifically Mr McGuire’s email on May 15, 2025, confirm that the ultimate decision on whether to prosecute was made by career prosecutors based on the facts, evidence, and established [justice department] practice. Communications with the Deputy Attorney General’s Office about a high-profile case are both required and routine.”

The email referenced was from McGuire to his staff stating that Blanche “would like Garcia charged sooner rather than later”, according to Crenshaw’s order.

The human-smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee during which Ábrego García was pulled over for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and state troopers discussed the possibility of human smuggling among themselves. However, he was ultimately allowed to leave with only a warning. The case was turned over to Homeland Security Investigations, but there is no record of any effort to charge him until April 2025, according to court records.

The order does not give much detail on what is in the documents that were turned over to Ábrego García, but it shows that Aakash Singh, who works under Blanche in the office of the deputy attorney general, contacted McGuire about Ábrego García’s case on 27 April, the same day that McGuire received a file on the case from Homeland Security Investigations. That was several days after the US supreme court ruled in Ábrego García’s favor on 10 April.

On 30 April, Singh said in an email to McGuire that the prosecution was a “top priority” for the deputy attorney general’s office, according to the order.

According to the Post, the Hutchins warehouse would hold up to 9,500 detainees, nearly triple the amount that the largest current ICE detention facility, a makeshift tent encampment at Fort Bliss, can hold.
That number stands out even more when compared to the 700 or so that the current closest ICE detention center to Dallas, the Prairieland Detention Center near Alvarado, reportedly holds.
The Department of Homeland Security declined to answer questions about the proposed plan and did not confirm any of the paper’s findings.
Dan Patrick and Attorney General Ken Paxton, is the only state with more than one of the proposed new detention sites.","Nearly a year into President Donald Trump’s second administration, the signs that his controversial immigration policies will continue to show themselves in many ways are only growing more frequent. Along with near-daily headlines involving eye-popping statistics, arrests and deportations, a recent Washington Post report outlines a new plan that calls for Dallas County to soon be the home of the nation’s second-largest ICE detention facility.

“The Trump administration is seeking contractors to help it overhaul the United States’ immigrant detention system in a plan that includes renovating industrial warehouses to hold more than 80,000 immigrant detainees at a time, according to a draft solicitation,” the Post reported on Dec. 24.

According to the documents reviewed by the paper, the aim of the plan is to “speed up deportations by establishing a deliberate feeder system,” which is not logistically possible at present. Proposed new, large detention facilities would, according to the draft solicitation, be placed near “major logistical hubs.”

If the Dallas-Fort Worth area is anything, it’s a major logistical hub, so it’s of little surprise that Hutchins, in Dallas County, just a bit southeast of downtown Dallas, is one of the seven proposed spots for new detention facilities that would hold thousands of people at once. The proposed sites in the draft are located in cities, counties or states led by Republican officials who have demonstrated a pro-Trump stance and support for the president’s immigration policies.

According to the Post, the Hutchins warehouse would hold up to 9,500 detainees, nearly triple the amount that the largest current ICE detention facility, a makeshift tent encampment at Fort Bliss, can hold. That number stands out even more when compared to the 700 or so that the current closest ICE detention center to Dallas, the Prairieland Detention Center near Alvarado, reportedly holds.

The plans call for the renovated warehouses to have restroom and shower facilities, as well as medical units, recreational facilities, kitchens and housing for families that are detained together. But the fact that the government wants to place so many detainees together in an effort to deport as many as possible as quickly as possible leaves some advocates less than impressed with the proposed blueprints.

Tania Wolf, an advocate with the National Immigration Project who is based in New Orleans, near another proposed new detention center, told the Post. “It’s dehumanizing. You’re treating people, for lack of a better term, like cattle.”

The promise to begin mass deportations as soon as possible was arguably Trump’s most controversial pledge following his 2024 election victory. As of December 14, more than 68,400 people are in ICE custody, a record high.

Contrary to early statements from Trump and U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, who often declared that only the “worst of the worst” undocumented criminals would be detained and deported, many non-criminal immigrants have been held. According to recent reports, more than 75,000 of the people detained by ICE in the first nine months of 2025, at least a third of all ICE arrests during that time, did not have criminal records.

On Monday, the Observer reported from a press conference where the family of Maher Tarabishi, a Palestinian man living in North Texas detained by ICE in October, pleaded for his release. Tarbishi is being held at the Bluebonnett Detention Center north of Abilene, has no criminal record and is the primary caregiver for his son, Wael, who suffers from a rare neurological disorder that has caused him to be hospitalized twice since his father was arrested. Tarabishi is but the latest example of a North Texas resident being held by ICE who would likely not have been a candidate for deportation under previous administrations.

At this point, the plans for new dentinon facilities are in their early stages, and the Post article notes that the draft isn’t final and could change. The Department of Homeland Security declined to answer questions about the proposed plan and did not confirm any of the paper’s findings.

Texas, as Trump-friendly a state as there is, thanks to the enthusiastic support of Gov. Greg Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Attorney General Ken Paxton, is the only state with more than one of the proposed new detention sites. Baytown, outside of Houston, is listed in the draft solicitation as the second Texas warehouse site. San Antonio, along with El Paso and Los Fresnos, in the Rio Grande Valley, are noted as possible sites for new ICE processing centers, where detainees would go through before being “funnelled” to the larger detention facilities. These new processing facilities would act in a similar fashion to the Dallas ICE field office on Stemmons Freeway, the site of the September shooting that saw a gunman kill two detainees and injure another from the top of a nearby office building.",https://www.dallasobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/12/Immigrations_ICE_Detention_AdobeStock-e1767134725582.jpeg,N,,2025-12-31 16:58:07.639072

The second bill gave control of its tribal lands to the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians in Florida. They are suing the Trump administration over the construction of the immigration detention center, Alligator Alcatraz.

""Enough is enough. My Administration is committed to preventing American taxpayers from funding expensive and unreliable policies. Ending the massive cost of taxpayer handouts and restoring fiscal sanity is vital to economic growth and the fiscal health of the Nation. For these reasons, I cannot support the Finish the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act. Therefore, it is my duty to return H.R. 131 to the House of Representatives without my approval,"" Trump said in a message to Congress.

Both bills had bipartisan support.

“President Trump’s first veto of his second term blocks a bipartisan bill that both the House and Senate passed unanimously, costs taxpayers nothing, and delivers safe, reliable water to rural communities that overwhelmingly supported him,"" Colorado senators said ina joint statement.

Trump said the new law would not allow for any new construction spending on the pipeline project, but only fix the terms of repaying the cost, sparking a debate about the federal government's role in funding infrastructure projects.

While explaining the veto for the tribal lands bill, Trump wrote the tribe was ""actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively voted for when I was elected.""

Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo, backed the Arkansas Valley Conduit bill. Although Trump did not refer to her in the rejection, Boebert suggested the reason for the veto was ""political retaliation.""

I sincerely hope this veto has nothing to do with political retaliation for calling out corruption and demanding accountability. Americans deserve leadership that puts people over politics,” Boebert said in a statement on social media.

Mr. Trump vetoed the two bills on Monday, the White House announced on X, after they were sent to his desk earlier this month. The bills had backers in both parties, and they passed the House and Senate through voice votes. Both houses of Congress would need to pass the bills again by a two-thirds margin to override the president's veto.

It's fairly rare for the president to exercise his veto power, especially when the president's party controls Congress. Mr. Trump vetoed 10 bills in his first term, all during his last two years in office, and former President Joe Biden used the veto power 13 times while in office.

Trump vetoes Everglades bill over immigration dispute

One of the bills — the Miccosukee Reserved Area Amendments Act — would have added a small village called the Osceola Camp to a section of the Florida Everglades that the Miccosukee Native American Tribe has control over. It would also require the Department of the Interior to take action to protect structures in the village from flooding.

The bill was backed by Florida Republican Sens. Rick Scott and Ashley Moody, and by GOP Rep. Carlos Gimenez and Democratic Rep. Darren Soto. Shortly before it passed the House in July, Gimenez said the bill was ""about fairness and conservation.""

""It ensures the Miccosukee Tribe has the autonomy to protect their homes, land and their way of life,"" Gimenez said in a speech on the House floor.

But in a message to Congress on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said the project benefits ""special interests"" — and accused the tribe of not cooperating with his immigration policies.

He wrote that ""despite seeking funding and special treatment from the Federal Government, the Miccosukee Tribe has actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively voted for when I was elected.""

Earlier this year, the tribe joined a lawsuit challenging an immigration detention center in the Everglades that state and federal officials refer to as ""Alligator Alcatraz."" The tribe has argued the facility could hurt the surrounding environment, impacting the tribe's ability to hunt and hold ceremonies on the land.

The president also argued that the Osceola Camp was originally created without authorization, writing, ""it is not the Federal Government's responsibility to pay to fix problems in an area that the Tribe has never been authorized to occupy.""

The tribe said in a statement it was ""disappointed"" by the veto, arguing the bill ""was not about special treatment, but about public safety, environmental stewardship, and honoring long-recognized tribal interests.""

""We have never sought to obstruct the President's immigration agenda,"" Miccosukee Tribe Chairman Talbert Cypress said. ""Instead, we have taken action to ensure sufficient environmental due diligence is performed to protect federal restoration investments.""

Soto said: ""Trump's veto appears to be revenge for the Miccosukee Tribe's valid opposition to the atrocious 'Alligator Alcatraz.' It's sad, petty, and a violation of tribal sovereignty.""

Trump vetoes Colorado water bill — local lawmakers call it ""revenge""

The other piece of legislation that faced a presidential veto this week was the Finish the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act. That bill was aimed at completing a long-planned water pipeline that could serve some 50,000 people in southeastern Colorado.

The pipeline was first proposed during President John F. Kennedy's administration, part of a series of water projects in Colorado. But it was never built, in part because federal law required local communities to pay for it, according to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. A 2009 law changed the funding breakdown and allowed local governments to pick up only 35% of the tab. The bill that was passed this year would have reduced those local entities' interest payments and given them more time to repay the costs.

Mr. Trump said he vetoed the bill as part of a broader push to cut ""taxpayer handouts."" He pointed to the pipeline's expected price tag — the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation estimated in 2023 it would cost about $1.4 billion, double the projected price seven years earlier.

The president argued the legislation ""would continue the failed policies of the past by forcing Federal taxpayers to bear even more of the massive costs of a local water project.""

The bill was backed by the state's two Democratic senators and by Republican Reps. Lauren Boebert and Jeff Hurd, whose districts include areas that would be served by the pipeline.

Boebert told CBS News in a statement the veto was ""very disappointing,"" writing: ""This fight is not over.""

Boebert castigated the veto in a separate statement to local reporter Kyle Clark, calling the bill ""completely non-controversial"" and saying she hopes Mr. Trump's veto ""has nothing to do with political retaliation.""

""I must have missed the rally where he stood in Colorado and promised to personally derail critical water infrastructure projects,"" Boebert wrote. ""My bad, I thought the campaign was about lowering costs and cutting red tape.""

Democratic Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado also strongly criticized the president's decision, writing on X: ""Donald Trump is playing partisan games and punishing Colorado by making rural communities suffer without clean drinking water.""

Fellow Colorado Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet accused the president of seeking ""revenge.""

Boebert drew attention earlier this year by breaking with Mr. Trump and signing a petition to force a House vote on a bill to release files on Jeffrey Epstein.

Both bills had bipartisan support when passed by Congress earlier this year. To override Trump’s veto, a two-thirds majority would need to vote for each measure in both the Senate and House of Representatives.

Trump rejected 10 bills in his first term in the Oval Office –– with Congress overriding only his veto of a defense policy bill in January 2021. Former Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama vetoed 13 and 12 bills, respectively.

Bill to expand land reserved for the Miccosukee Tribe

In rejecting the Florida bill, Trump cited actions by the Miccosukee Tribe to try “to obstruct reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively voted for when I was elected.”

The tribe signed on as plaintiffs to one of three federal lawsuits against the Trump administration over the immigration detention facility constructed earlier this year in the Everglades, dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” The facility had been slated to close its doors earlier this year, but a federal appeals court put that order on hold in September, pending an appeal.

The bill vetoed by Trump would have incorporated the Osceola Camp — an inhabited tribal village in the Everglades — into the Miccosukee Reserved Area, controlled by the Native American tribe. The measure would have also required the Interior Department to consult with the Miccosukee Tribe on the best ways to protect structures from flooding.

One of the bill’s bipartisan sponsors — Republican Rep. Carlos A. Gimenez of Florida — said the measure was “about fairness and conservation” during a speech on the House floor in July.

“It ensures the Miccosukee Tribe has the autonomy to protect their homes, their land and their way of life,” he said at the time.

Requests for comment made Wednesday by Spectrum News to attorneys listed in federal court records as representing the Miccosukee Tribe — as well as to Gimenez’s office — were not immediately returned.

Trump contended in his veto that the Osceola Camp was built “without authorization, in a low area that was raised with fill material” and that the cost to repair and replace infrastructure could be as much as $14 million.

The president wrote that “it is not the Federal Government’s responsibility to pay to fix problems in an area that the Tribe has never been authorized to occupy.

Financing modifications proposed for a water pipeline in Colorado

The other bill vetoed by Trump would have helped rural residents pay for their share of a long-planned water pipeline project, called the Arkansas Valley Conduit.

The bill sought to lengthen the repayment timeline and to reduce interest payments the communities of the Arkansas River Valley must make to the Bureau of Reclamation for the pipeline’s construction.

First approved by former President John F. Kennedy in 1962, the project would provide an estimated 7,500 acre-feet of water per year to as many as 50,000 people in southeastern Colorado.

“Currently, many people in these areas rely on groundwater supplies that may contain naturally occurring radionuclides such as radium and uranium,” the Bureau of Reclamation says on a webpage about the plan.

Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., criticized Trump’s veto on social media, writing, “This isn’t governing. It’s a revenge tour.”

Bennet has previously accused the president of retaliating against the state over the incarceration of former election clerk Tina Peters, who is serving a nine-year sentence for her role in a data breach scheme driven by false claims about voting machine fraud in the 2020 presidential race.

Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., also chimed in Tuesday night on X, writing, “This isn’t over.”

The Colorado lawmaker shared another post, noting that she was among a handful of Republicans to sign a discharge petition forcing a vote in the House to require the Justice Department to release files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

After reversing course on his opposition, Trump ultimately signed the bill into law, and records have been made public in batches since Dec. 19 –– though several media outlets recently reported the Justice Department has more than 5.2 million more documents to review.

When asked for comment about Bennet's and Boebert’s remarks, the White House referred to Trump's message to Congress.

In those remarks, the president said that the water pipeline project had been delayed for decades because it is “economically unviable” and that he blocked the bill to save taxpayers money.

“Enough is enough,” Trump wrote about his decision. “My Administration is committed to preventing American taxpayers from funding expensive and unreliable policies.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/Trump_AP_25363767852117_NAT_1231,N,,2025-12-31 15:56:42.580492

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told the Washington Post that the agency was “thrilled"" about coverage of the ""wildly successful ICE recruitment campaign, which is under budget and ahead of schedule.” She did not dispute the information presented in the document.

Officials and citizens have raised alarm bells over ICE's traditional advertising methods, too, including public campaigns and propaganda efforts that many say are stoking unnecessary fear within communities.

Under the Trump administration, federal immigration officials have pivoted to extreme, high-risk tactics to meet deportation aims set by the president, including periodically violent operations in areas far from the border. U.S. Customs and Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino has said the unprecedented actions of ICE agents are a new ""turn and burn"" strategy that sees agents deploying tactics normally reserved for major offenders on families and individuals who haven't been suspected of violent offenses.

ICE is reportedly set to sign on tens of thousands of new agents in the coming months as a result of its ""surge hiring marketing strategy,"" incentivized by major signing bonuses and inflated salaries allocated from Trump's Big Beautiful Bill. The agency has also reduced requirements for new hires. DHS reported that it received over 200,000 job applications in the last five months alone, with McLaughlin stating the vast majority are former law enforcement.

As allegations of civil rights violations increased, so have the numbers of habeas corpus petitions filed in U.S. District Court Massachusetts.","Since President Donald Trump began his second term in office, New Bedford’s immigrant community has been transformed.

The first nine months of mass deportations were marked by sudden and violent raids that drew national and international attention. Over time, enforcement became more targeted, moving largely out of public view.

Federal authorities have arrested at least 60 immigrants living or working in the New Bedford area. The Light has confirmed the apprehension of 53 through local sources, court records, and area and federal law enforcement. Some were detained during large-scale actions. Others were arrested individually, or at check-ins for immigration appointments.

Of those individuals, nine have been confirmed released. Some are awaiting decisions in immigration court, while others were released under supervision. Twelve detainees have since been deported from the United States.

Violent raids

People felt the mass deportation campaign before it hit New Bedford. Shortly after the 2024 election, advocates, lawyers, and some public officials urged their community to brace for impact. Businesses on Acushnet Avenue began to feel the pinch before the first street arrest happened.

U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement’s hammer fell upon New Bedford on March 11, when agents descended on the Minit-Man Car Wash and detained three Guatemalan men.

On March 21, ICE agents detained two Guatemalan men when they used a battering ram to enter their home on Viall Street. Teenagers present at the home said agents did not present warrants for entry. The raid left a 19-year old as household head. The action spurred 200 residents to demonstrate outside City Hall.

On April 14, Marilú Domingo Ortiz used her cellphone to record a federal agent as he smashed the car window when agents arrested her husband, Juan Francisco Méndez. The tape led to an international outcry and prompted declamation from U.S. Rep. Bill Keating. After more than two months in detention, ICE released Méndez on bond.

Dramatic street raids continued. Operation Patriot in May and Operation Patriot 2.0 arrested thousands of immigrants statewide, largely with no criminal convictions. In New Bedford, the vast majority of immigrants detained had no violent criminal convictions.

The overwhelming majority of those detained locally have been Indigenous men from Guatemala. The gender disparities led some advocates to speculate that it may point to a strategy of removing breadwinners to pressure their families to leave.

On June 8, ICE detained Emerson Garcia DosSantos as he drove his car in Fall River, leaving his U.S. citizen wife, Erika Hartman DosSantos, to fight brain cancer alone. DHS later deported Garcia DosSantos to his native Brazil. The couple is arranging for Hartman DosSantos to relocate to Brazil.

In the coming months, tactics evolved. The last confirmed street operation took place in Fairhaven on Sept. 19, when agents took three Guatemalan men into custody. Among them was Luís David Ajtzac Osório, an 18-year old with special immigrant juvenile status and a legal work permit.

Tactics have moved beyond street arrests. In July, Market Basket told 47 workers to leave their New Bedford store unless they could show proof of legal work authorization.

That demonstrated New Bedford’s economic dependence on immigrants as fear pushed people to leave their jobs, and often enough, the area. After months of terror, some businesses along Acushnet Avenue reported drops in sales as high as 50%.

The number of immigrant students enrolled in New Bedford Public Schools also dropped by 6% from last year, and a further 13% since September.

Bishop Edgar Moreira da Cunha, the prelate of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Fall River, leads New Bedford’s large Catholic community. He spoke with The Light on the impact of ICE raids on church attendance.

“The United States is shooting themselves in the foot because they are doing harm to themselves by the things that they are doing,” da Cunha told The Light.

From the streets to the courts

ICE agents’ presence on the streets of New Bedford shrank significantly by the fall as federal operations shifted to other parts of the country. In Massachusetts, while street arrests have continued, ICE’s gaze fell upon district courts and immigration check-ins at the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program office in Framingham, or for check-ins at the ICE Field Office in Burlington.

Data collected by the Deportation Data Project and analyzed by The Light show that over 400 arrests in Massachusetts from January to mid-October 2025 occurred across 44 courts statewide.

In Bristol County, emails obtained by The Light show routine exchanges between the sheriff’s office and ICE, including booking logs, court dates, and release times. At the Dartmouth House of Correction, jail officials often coordinated directly with ICE, sharing information that has helped facilitate immigration arrests.

However, sheriffs are limited in how much they can assist ICE, even when detainers are issued. A 2017 ruling by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court bars sheriffs from holding someone solely on an ICE detainer once they are cleared for release, a ruling that has led to friction with federal agents.

That tension culminated in May, when the Department of Homeland Security published a list of “sanctuary jurisdictions,” accusing them of obstructing immigration enforcement. Nearly every county in Massachusetts appeared on the list, a move the president of the National Sheriffs’ Association, Kieran Donahue, criticized as arbitrary and damaging to cooperation between law enforcement and the White House.

In April, Mayor Jon Mitchell criticized ICE over a lack of transparency around Méndez’s arrest.

Communication has been inconsistent with the New Bedford Police Department as well, Police Chief Jason Thody told The Light in October. Most of the time, he said, officers learn of immigration arrests through news reports or social media.

In response to increased immigration enforcement activity and “some community pushback,” Thody issued interim guidance outlining how officers should interact with ICE when agents conduct operations in the city.

Legal developments

Enforcement continues to reflect massive changes in policy. And it has rippled into the court systems, where advocates and lawyers say many of those policies violate civil and due process rights.

Many complaints revolve around the speed at which those detained are processed and transferred outside Massachusetts. ICE detained Pascual Cuin González, a Guatemalan asylee in New Bedford, on Sept. 12, alongside his partner, Manuela Morales González.

Over the next week, authorities transferred him between Burlington and detention facilities in New York and Louisiana before agents released him to find his way back to New Bedford.

The use of Hanscom Air Force base to swiftly fly detainees out of Massachusetts prompted a letter from Gov. Maura Healey on Dec. 15 protesting the flights from the base.

“Flying these residents out of state and away from their support systems and legal counsel — often within hours of arrest — is intentionally cruel and purposely obstructs the due process and legal representation they are owed,” Healey said.

As fears of ICE permeate communities, nonprofits across the state have noticed a sizable increase in the number of residents applying for U.S. citizenship.

But many others seeking legal status, including Ajtzac Osório, the New Bedford teenager from the Fairhaven raid, have been de-documented despite following legal processes. The same day Ajtzac Osório was arrested, U.S. Citizenship and Immigrations Services removed his deferred action and later terminated his work permit.

As allegations of civil rights violations increased, so have the numbers of habeas corpus petitions filed in U.S. District Court Massachusetts. As of Dec. 29, there had been 629 habeas petitions filed in the court, 432 of which remained active. The number of habeas petitions filed continued to rise after multiple Board of Immigration Appeals decisions and an ICE policy change in July resulted in blanket bond hearing denials.

That happened to Yury Melissa Aguiriano Romero, a Honduran asylum seeker and the first confirmed female detainee from New Bedford. An immigration judge denied her a bond hearing at the behest of DHS. That judge later granted her release on bond only after a U.S. District Court judge ordered a bond hearing.

In December, U.S. District Court Judge Patti Saris declared that DHS had misclassified many detainees in order to deny their right to a bond hearing. She ordered DHS to allow for bond hearings to notify all current and future detainees within the jurisdiction of U.S. District Court Massachusetts and the Boston and Chelmsford immigration courts of that right in an appropriate language.

The rapidly shifting environment has taxed immigration lawyers, who find themselves overwhelmed with policy changes and people seeking legal representation.

The Massachusetts hub

The ICE Field Office in Burlington, where many are processed after arrest, has become a focal point of discussion over detention conditions. Stories of harsh treatment and possible civil and human rights violations have led to weekly protests outside the building and visits from federal lawmakers.

In August, The Light collected testimonies from immigrants in the Greater New Bedford area who had spent time in Burlington and, in some cases, other ICE facilities out of state. They described being kept in rooms with no windows for most of the day, receiving little food and water, and sometimes going days without bathing.

Others said their experiences in jails in New England, where immigrants were held with the general inmate population, felt more humane than ICE-run facilities.

Andrés De León Castro, arrested in Fairhaven in May and deported to Guatemala on July 12, said agents at Burlington told detainees they were not allowed to talk or move and left them in a freezing room without food or water.

“When we complained, they told us that’s what we deserved.”

Conditions inside the facility drew public attention after the release of Marcelo Gomes da Silva, a Milford High School student detained in May and held there for six days. His detention prompted a visit on June 5 by the U.S. Reps. Jake Auchincloss and Seth Moulton.

After his second visit in November, Moulton said at a news conference outside the facility that he saw fewer detainees than during his earlier visit, but that access to blankets remained a concern.

“It seems that they are moving people through here more quickly,” said Moulton. “The consequence of that is that they don’t have as much time to have lawyers intervene in their cases.”",https://newbedfordlight.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ice-arrest-screenshot.png,N,,2025-12-31 14:58:05.315601

California’s other legal fights with Trump This showdown is just one front in a broader war between California and the Trump administration:","The Trump administration has dropped its fight to keep California National Guard troops under federal control, a major shift in a months-long legal battle with Gov. Gavin Newsom.

In a filing Tuesday with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Justice Department lawyers withdrew their request to maintain authority over roughly 300 Guard members still deployed in Los Angeles. The move comes after the Supreme Court’s decision in Trump v. Illinois, which undercut the administration’s argument for using state troops in domestic law enforcement.

Federal lawyers said they “do not oppose lifting of the partial administrative stay,” clearing the way for California to regain command.

“This admission by Trump and his occult cabinet members means this illegal intimidation tactic will finally come to an end,” Newsom posted on X. He added that he expects the court to affirm California’s authority over its Guard.

The legal battle between Trump, California explained

The fight began in June when Trump federalized 4,000 California Guard troops and sent U.S. Marines to Los Angeles after immigration raids sparked protests. Newsom called the move “a serious breach of state sovereignty” and warned it would inflame tensions.

Those tensions boiled over downtown, where demonstrators clashed with police and federal agents after raids in Paramount and Compton. Union leader David Huerta was arrested during one protest, fueling outrage among immigration advocates.

California sued, arguing Trump’s order violated constitutional limits. Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer agreed, ruling the president’s theory of indefinite control “would upend the constitutional balance between state and federal power.” He ordered the troops returned to Newsom.

The administration appealed, but after the Supreme Court ruling, even conservative judges have questioned Trump’s stance.

Attorney General Rob Bonta called Tuesday’s filing “a good day for our democracy,” adding: “The President is not king.”

What’s next in the California National Guard case

The 9th Circuit is expected to lift the stay soon. Meanwhile, Congress is probing the broader use of military forces in civilian settings, raising civil liberties concerns.

For now, California appears poised to win back full control of its Guard — and score a symbolic victory in its long-running clash with Trump over immigration enforcement and state sovereignty.

Timeline: Key moments in the National Guard fight

June 6: Immigration raids in Los Angeles spark protests; union leader David Huerta arrested.

December 31, 2025

HRRC is deeply alarmed by the documented rise in the detention and physical assault of journalists in the United States, as outlined in the Freedom of the Press Foundation’s latest report. The routine detention of journalists signals a dangerous erosion of press freedom and a troubling shift in how authorities engage with independent media. HRRC calls on federal, state, and local authorities to immediately reaffirm and enforce protections for journalists, ensure accountability for abuses, and guarantee that members of the press can report freely and safely without fear of retaliation.

As press freedom is under increasing threat through legal and financial attacks in the United States, physical detention and assaults on journalists have also increased, according to a new report by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.

In 2025, at least 32 instances of journalists being detained by law enforcement while reporting were documented, in what the Freedom of the Press Foundation says represents a fundamental shift in authorities’ relationship with the press.

Nearly 90% of detentions took place during protests, the vast majority of which occurred during protests against efforts by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to arrest and deport “undocumented” immigrants. According to the report, documented instances involved journalists being detained for multiple hours at a time, sometimes while painfully handcuffed.

Though most instances involved journalists being released without charges, the detentions themselves deprived journalists of their crucial role to document and record potential abuses by law enforcement during protests.

“We know this chills their rights,” said Adam Rose, Chair of the Press Rights Committee for the LA Press Club and Deputy Director of Advocacy for Freedom of the Press Foundation, “but it also ends their shift.”

Assaults on journalists have also spiked in tandem with arrests, with nearly as many reported assaults on journalists recorded as in the previous three years combined. Half of those detained report being assaulted by officers in the lead-up to or process of being detained, including being violently forced to the ground and beaten by batons.

According to the Foundation, while covering immigration protests remains the riskiest beat for journalists’ safety and freedom, journalists have also been detained for routine news gathering, such as while covering city council meetings. The arrests represent a pattern of authorities “either poorly understanding the elements of routine newsgathering or purposefully using prosecutions to chill future reporting,” the report said.

This year, press freedom in the United States has fallen to a record low, according to Reporters Without Borders’ Press Freedom Tracker, classified as in a “difficult situation” for the first time in the tracker’s history. In addition to physical attacks on journalists, economic factors – which force news organizations to choose between editorial independence and financial sustainability – were considered the greatest challenge.

The disclosure comes as new figures showed a sharp fall in television ratings for this year’s Kennedy Center honors awards.
The Guardian has contacted the Kennedy Center for comment.","The Kennedy Center reportedly adopted bylaws earlier this year that would limit voting to Donald Trump-appointed trustees – a controversial move that appears to reveal the long-held plan to install Trump’s name to the center.

The bylaws, in a possible breach of the institution’s charter, were revised in May and specified that board members appointed by Congress, known as ex-officio members, could not vote or count towards a quorum, according to the Washington Post.

The new rule was in force when the board voted unanimously on 18 December to add Trump’s name to the center, rebranding the building as the Donald J Trump and the John F Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.

The name change has since triggered a wave of protests. Artists have cancelled bookings and members of Congress have vowed to overturn the name change. Joyce Beatty, a Democrat from Ohio, is even suing to reverse it on the grounds that changing the center’s name requires an act of Congress.

Trump took over as chair of the board in February, quickly purging sitting members, while installing his supporters – including his longtime foreign policy adviser Ric Grenell, whom he appointed as president of the center. Grenell had been a vocal tribune of Trump’s “America First” ideology, and was not afraid to ruffle feathers during past spells as ambassador to Germany and acting director of national intelligence (he was the first openly gay person to lead the intelligence community).

Just prior to his Kennedy Center appointment, Grenell served as the president’s envoy for special missions, and was involved in securing the release of Americans detained in Venezuela.

The center lists 34 presidentially appointed board members and 23 ex-officio members, who by law must include the mayor of Washington DC, head of the library of Congress, and the majority and minority leaders of the Senate. The federal law underpinning the center’s establishment identified ex-officio members as among the venue’s trustees, charged with maintaining it as a memorial to President John F Kennedy, the Post reported.

Roma Daravi, the center’s vice-president for public relations, told the Post that the rules had been changed in line with longstanding convention that ex-officio members did not vote: “The bylaws were revised to reflect this longstanding precedent and everyone received the technical changes both before the meeting and after revisions.”

Daravi continued: “Some members (including ex officio) attended in person, others by phone, and no concerns were voiced, no one objected, and the bylaws passed unanimously.”

Ellen Aprill, a legal scholar at UCLA, told the paper that such voting right limits breached the center’s charter.

“Clearly the intent of the charter provisions was to entrust Kennedy Center guidance to a broad group, not just those appointed by the president,” she said.

The disclosure comes as new figures showed a sharp fall in television ratings for this year’s Kennedy Center honors awards. A record low audience of 3.01m watched this year’s broadcast of the annual honors awards – hosted by Trump himself – when it was screened by CBS, marking a stark 25% downturn from last year. The event included appearances from some of Trump’s favorite artists, including Gloria Gaynor, Kiss and George Strait.

As artists cancel bookings, Trump on social media on Tuesday posted a string of statements from supporters criticizing the Kennedy family’s supposed lack of support for the center. His posts on his Truth Social network started mere hours after the Kennedy family announced the death of Tatiana Schlossberg, JFK’s granddaughter, who died aged 35, from leukemia.

In a statement, Walz’s office expressed openness to appearing before Comer’s committee while attacking the committee and President Donald Trump, who has led the attacks on the Minnesota governor and the state’s Somali population.

“We’re always happy to work with Congress, though this committee has a track record of holding circus hearings that have nothing to do with the issue at hand,” the office said. “While the Governor has been working to ensure fraudsters go to prison, the President has been selling pardons to let them out.”

The statement did not definitively indicate whether Walz would voluntarily appear before Congress.

The president and his allies have used the fraud investigations to attack Walz, the former Democratic vice presidential nominee whom he’s seeking to unseat in the midterms, and disparage Somali immigrants in the state.

Trump called Somali immigrants “garbage” at a White House event in early December. On Tuesday, the Department of Health and Human Services froze hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for Minnesota’s child care programs, the latest in a string of actions the administration has taken against Minnesota in response to the fraud scandals.

In a social media post Wednesday, Trump again railed on Somali immigrants and insisted the U.S. “send them back from where they came, Somalia, perhaps the worst, and most corrupt, country on earth.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Trump administration is seeking to revoke the citizenship status of U.S. citizens of Somali descent who were charged with benefits fraud, while acknowledging that action may be rebuffed by the courts.

“It’s something the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State is currently looking at right now,” Leavitt said in a Fox News interview Wednesday morning. “We know that there are liberal activist judges across this country who will try to block and tackle this administration from pursuing justice at every turn. But that’s not gonna stop the president and his entire cabinet by acting on behalf of law-abiding, tax-paying citizens in the state of Minnesota and in states across the country who have been ripped off by people who have abused our immigration system.”

Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in President Trump's first year back in office, an estimated 1.9 million people are self deporting versus more than 622,000 deportations. She is attributing it to the administration's crackdown on illegal immigrants.

In total, 2.5 million migrants have been deported.

For the holidays extending to Dec. 31, $3,000 was offered to immigrants who are in the country illegally through the CBP home app. Normally, $1,000 is offered. According to DHS's website, that money is an exit bonus, and the self-deportation also includes free travel to their home country or country where they have lawful status.

DHS will give migrants time to wrap up work, school and other personal matters before they self-deport.

It is unclear if the incentives are contributing to the self-deportation numbers or if it's mainly fear of migrants getting detained by ICE.

FOX 17 News is working to find out how many self-deportations have occurred in Tennessee. We are also looking to speak to migrants or activists who can speak on the self-deportations.

The angst from that community has been deportations include people whose only crime is crossing the border illegally, which they say is not basis for deportation. Deportations have also caused family separations.

But the president has grievances against the Miccosukee Tribe and the state of Colorado, leading lawmakers to accuse Mr. Trump of blocking the bills because of political disagreements. Throughout his second term, Mr. Trump has carried out a campaign of retribution against political opponents, law firms, universities and specific individuals.

In Florida, Mr. Trump suggested the veto of the bill to expand Miccosukee Tribe land was tied to its opposition to his immigration agenda. The Miccosukee Tribe joined a lawsuit earlier this year to block the administration from constructing an immigrant detention center in the Everglades nicknamed Alligator Alcatraz. And in Colorado, Mr. Trump has attacked the state’s leaders over the imprisonment of a former state election official, Tina Peters, for interfering with the 2020 presidential election.

“Despite seeking funding and special treatment from the federal government, the Miccosukee Tribe has actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively voted for when I was elected,” Mr. Trump wrote in a message to Congress. “My administration is committed to preventing American taxpayers from funding projects for special interests, especially those that are unaligned with my administration’s policy of removing violent criminal illegal aliens from the country.”

Both pieces of legislation passed by voice vote in Congress, indicating strong bipartisan support and suggesting lawmakers may try to override the president’s vetoes, which requires a two-thirds majority in both chambers. In Mr. Trump’s first term, he vetoed 10 pieces of legislation, one of which — the 2021 military policy bill — was overturned.

The Colorado legislation, which was sponsored by Representative Lauren Boebert, Republican of Colorado, would help local communities pay for the Arkansas Valley Conduit water pipeline.

“Enough is enough,” Mr. Trump wrote in a message to Congress. “My administration is committed to preventing American taxpayers from funding expensive and unreliable policies.”

Ms. Boebert slammed the president’s veto, arguing he was “denying clean drinking water for 50,000 people in Southeast Colorado.”

“I sincerely hope this veto has nothing to do with political retaliation for calling out corruption and demanding accountability,” she said in a statement.

Ms. Boebert was a vocal supporter of releasing the Epstein files, drawing backlash from the White House, and the president has attacked Colorado’s leaders in recent weeks over Ms. Peters. She was found guilty of interfering with voting machines in an effort to prove falsehoods that they had been used to rig the 2020 election against Mr. Trump. The president has pledged to pardon Ms. Peters, even though she was convicted in state court and Colorado officials argue he had no power to do so.

“This isn’t governing,” Senator Michael Bennet, a Democrat of Colorado, wrote on X about the president’s veto. “It’s a revenge tour.”

The Trump administration first imposed a travel ban on 12 countries in June. After an Afghan national was arrested in the shooting of two National Guard troops in Washington over the Thanksgiving weekend, Mr. Trump vowed to extend the restrictions to more countries. This month, he expanded the ban to 19 countries, including Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso, taking the total number of affected African states to 12.

Mali’s foreign ministry said it rejected the Trump administration’s argument that the action was taken because of security concerns and said the United State had made its decision without consulting Mali.

Several African countries that have adopted a more conciliatory approach and conceded to the demands to accept deportees from the United States have received exemptions from such travel bans. Weeks after Liberia agreed to receive Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant who was wrongly deported to El Salvador in March, the Trump administration extended visas for Liberians visiting the United States to 36 months from 12 months.

Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso are run my military juntas after coups in recent years. The military leaders of the countries had all largely severed ties with Washington and developed closer relations with Russia and China, as well as Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. They have also left the Economic Community of West African States, a regional alliance, and formed their own bloc.

“While this is likely to further constrain relations, it will also displace Washington’s influence,” said Beverly Ochieng, an analyst at Control Risk, a risk management group.

Since Mr. Trump was re-elected, he has sought to reshape American relations with Africa. While there have been pockets of continued engagement, such as efforts to end the war in Congo, analysts said the president has leaned heavily toward withdrawing from the continent.

Mr. Trump’s decision to slash foreign aid spending was deeply felt in Africa, which was the biggest recipient of U.S. assistance. A large number of the U.S. diplomats who were withdrawn from service this month were believed to have been posted in Africa.

Despite the American pullback, the strategic importance of countries in the Sahel region, a stretch of land that refers to countries south of the Sahara, could mean they are able to rebuild relations with Washington.

The Sahel, especially Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso, account for more than half the world’s terrorism related deaths, according to the United Nations. The United States has advised its citizens not to travel to three countries because of the threat of terrorism, crime and kidnapping.

“Some of the closest partners of the Sahel countries — despite unmatched military or financial resources as the U.S. — continue to position themselves in a way that will likely grant them favorable access in strategic areas, including defense, mining and energy,” Ms. Ochieng said.

Congress required the Justice Department to release its files related to the investigations of the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein by Dec. 19. The department released about 100,000 pages on that date, and said in the days that followed that at least a million more documents still needed to be reviewed.

Since late November, the department has assigned nearly 200 lawyers from the national security division to review the documents and remove any information about victims, or anything that would compromise continuing investigations or national security. Now, Justice Department officials have told employees that they need more help to accomplish the task.

The document review is expected to take until at least Jan. 20, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Trump administration had already drawn the ire of Democrats and a few Republicans in Congress for appearing to break the law setting the deadline to release the documents.

The Justice Department has defended its handling of the matter. “We have lawyers working around the clock to review and make the legally required redactions to protect victims, and we will release the documents as soon as possible,” the department said on social media.

But the disclosure that only a fraction of the documents have been released has only added to the troubles surrounding the rollout of the material. After the initial release on Dec. 19, some photographs were removed from the online collection because of what the department described as concerns about them possibly containing information about victims.

One image showed a credenza with an open drawer containing other photos, including at least one of Mr. Trump. Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, said the image was removed not to protect the president but because of concerns about whether that image contained any victims. The image was later restored to the collection.

More than a dozen schemes have come to light in Minnesota in recent years, many of them involving people of Somali origin. Prosecutors say the schemes have cost taxpayers billions of dollars. The scandal has rattled Minnesota politics and drawn the ire of the White House.

On Friday, a conservative active on social media, Nick Shirley, posted a video purporting to uncover rampant fraud in day care centers run by people of Somali origin. While day care centers in Minnesota have been prosecuted for overbilling in the past, none of the centers featured in the video have been accused of fraud by the authorities. Nevertheless, the video drew accolades from several senior White House officials.

Jim O’Neill, the deputy health secretary, said in a video statement on Tuesday that the department was pausing the funding in response to “credible allegations” of “extensive fraud” in Minnesota’s child care programs. Mr. O’Neill said he had sent a letter to the state’s governor, Tim Walz, a Democrat, demanding a thorough audit of the state’s day care centers.

In a statement, Mr. Walz’s office said the governor had been combating fraud “for years.”

“Fraud is a serious issue,” said the statement. “But this is a transparent attempt to politicize the issue to hurt Minnesotans and defund government programs that help people.”

Alex J. Adams, an assistant health secretary, joined Mr. O’Neill in the video statement and said that he had spoken on Monday with Cindi Yang, Minnesota’s child care services director, who had been unable to tell him whether fraud in the state’s social services system was isolated or widespread.

Carissa Larsen, a spokeswoman for the Minnesota Department of Children, Youth, and Families, which oversees government-subsidized day care centers, said on Tuesday evening that agency officials were aware of the announcement but were not in a position to comment.

Two weeks ago, Mr. Walz applauded new federal charges in a widening, yearslong federal investigation into his state’s social services programs and promised that state officials were working to overhaul the troubled system. But Mr. Walz has been facing criticism from President Trump and Minnesota Republicans, who charge that the state lacked adequate safeguards.

Mr. Walz, who is seeking re-election, wrote in an opinion piece in The Minnesota Star Tribune this month that his state had made “significant progress” in rooting out fraud in its social services system but had “much more to do.”

“And it’s my responsibility to fix it,” he wrote.

More than 90 people have been charged in federal fraud investigations in Minnesota, which began during the Biden administration, and at least 60 have been convicted. In announcing charges against six more people accused of defrauding safety net programs, Joseph H. Thompson, the prosecutor overseeing the investigation, said this month that the authorities had identified “staggering, industrial-scale fraud” in Minnesota’s safety-net programs.

The schemes, which took root in pockets of Minnesota’s Somali community, targeted government programs meant to feed children during the Covid-19 pandemic, to help children with autism and to assist people at risk of homelessness. The authorities say that fraudsters billed the state government for social services that were never provided.

Mr. Trump has seized on the scandal, using it to unleash xenophobic tirades against America’s Somali community.

Mr. O’Neill said in his video statement that the health department had also taken steps to secure the national Administration for Children and Families system, requiring that future payments around the country would need to be certified with a receipt or photo evidence. The department also created a new hotline for reports of fraud, he added.

“We’re committed to holding bad actors accountable,” Mr. O’Neill said in the video. “Regardless of rank or office, anyone who’s involved in perpetrating this fraud against the American people should expect to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

The emails, which were made public as part of a newly unsealed judicial order, largely reflected communications about the case that Robert E. McGuire, the acting U.S. attorney in Nashville, had with members of his staff and with Aakash Singh, a top official in Mr. Blanche’s office. They raised serious questions about whether the Justice Department had misled Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw Jr., who is overseeing the case, by telling him that local prosecutors had acted alone in charging Mr. Abrego Garcia.

“These documents show that McGuire did not act alone and to the extent McGuire had input on the decision to prosecute, he shared it with Singh and others,” Judge Crenshaw wrote in the unsealed order. “Specifically, the government’s documents may contradict its prior representations that the decision to prosecute was made locally and that there were no outside influences.”

One of the emails, dated April 30, was written by Mr. Singh to Mr. McGuire and another prosecutor, Jacob Warren, as the government was building its criminal case against Mr. Abrego Garcia, who at the time was still in custody in El Salvador.

In it, Mr. Singh made clear that charging Mr. Abrego Garcia was “a top priority” for Mr. Blanche’s office. In response, Mr. McGuire wrote, “We want the high command looped in.”

A little more than two weeks later, Mr. McGuire wrote to his staff that while the ultimate decision about whether to bring charges was his own, he had heard that Mr. Blanche and his chief deputy at the time, Emil Bove III, were pushing for charges to be filed. In the email, Mr. McGuire referred to Mr. Blanche as the “DAG” — or deputy attorney general — and to Mr. Bove as the “PDAG” — or principal deputy attorney general. He also mentioned the “ODAG” — or the office of the deputy attorney general.

“I have not received specific direction from ODAG other than I have heard anecdotally that the DAG and PDAG would like Garcia charged sooner rather than later,” Mr. McGuire wrote.

Judge Crenshaw’s order was only the latest in an ever-growing series of rebukes dealt to the Justice Department as it has pursued parallel efforts to both prosecute Mr. Abrego Garcia and expel him from the country again.

Three weeks ago, a federal judge in Maryland released him from immigration custody in a scathing order that accused the Justice Department of egregious conduct that included stonewalling her, disobeying her direct instructions and even “affirmatively” misleading her about its plans to re-deport Mr. Abrego Garcia.

The judge in that case, Paula Xinis, has temporarily barred the Justice Department from taking Mr. Abrego Garcia back into custody. But on Tuesday evening, department lawyers said they would rearrest him if they were able to overcome her provisional order stopping them from doing so.

Judge Crenshaw’s order containing the excerpted emails was originally issued under seal on Dec. 3, when he instructed prosecutors to hand over the full trove of materials to Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers. The lawyers sought the communications in an effort to bolster their claims that the indictment against Mr. Abrego Garcia had been brought because the Trump administration was trying to vindictively punish him for contesting his initial deportation.

In October, Judge Crenshaw issued a preliminary ruling finding that there was a “realistic likelihood” that the administration had in fact brought the case vindictively. That decision allowed Mr. Abrego Garcia’s legal team to seek internal documents from the government.

In his initial order, the judge singled out Mr. Blanche, saying that he had made “remarkable statements” about the criminal case. On the day in June that Mr. Abrego Garcia was brought back to face indictment, Mr. Blanche went on Fox News and declared that the government had started to investigate the case only after Judge Xinis, in Maryland, had questioned the administration’s decision to deport Mr. Abrego Garcia and found that it “had no right.”

The newly released emails only pointed further at Mr. Blanche’s involvement in deciding to charge Mr. Abrego Garcia.

In one of the emails, written on May 16 as the Justice Department was nearing its decision to bring charges, Mr. Warren wrote to Mr. Singh, suggesting that Mr. Blanche was playing some sort of role in whether to seek an indictment quickly.

“If the DAG does want to move forward with the indictment on Wednesday,” Mr. Warren wrote, “we think it would be prudent to loop in the press office ASAP.”

Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers have issued subpoenas to both Mr. Blanche and Mr. Singh in an effort to have them testify under oath about their roles in seeking criminal charges. The Justice Department has strenuously objected to the subpoenas in a series of court filings, some written by a top department official, Stanley E. Woodward Jr.

For the moment, Judge Crenshaw has put off deciding whether to force Mr. Blanche and Mr. Singh to take the witness stand — although he has put Mr. McGuire and his team in Nashville in a tough spot as they seek to rebut the judge’s preliminary finding that the case was brought vindictively.

All along, Mr. McGuire has told Judge Crenshaw that he can fight the claims of vindictiveness by placing himself and other lower-ranking witnesses from law enforcement on the stand to testify that senior Trump officials were not involved in the indictment of Mr. Abrego Garcia. But that argument lost much of its credibility after the emails were released on Tuesday.

And that has left Mr. McGuire facing a pair of bad outcomes.

If he were to go forward with his plan to overcome Judge Crenshaw’s preliminary finding of vindictiveness with testimony that the emails have already undercut, the judge could make a permanent finding of vindictiveness and immediately dismiss the indictment.

But the judge has also reserved the right to force Mr. Blanche and Mr. Singh to take the witness stand if he is unsatisfied by Mr. McGuire’s presentation. And that could lead to embarrassing questions being asked of some of the Justice Department’s most senior leaders.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/31/multimedia/31trump-news-promo-mqhv/31trump-news-promo-mqhv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 12:13:17.833372

No one from the federal government has contacted the county about plans, the head of the board of supervisors told News4. He flagged concerns about what a detention center in Stafford County might mean for the community.

News4 asked Board of Supervisors Chairman Deuntay Diggs if the county could support the level of infrastructure a major detention facility would need.

""No, not currently, and that's one of the bigger concerns with this potential detention facility. With 5,000 to 10,000 detainees, that's going to require upgrades in infrastructure, and that is going to come at the cost of the taxpayer,” he said.

Diggs said providing water, sewer and other resources to a federal facility would come at a cost.

News4 asked Diggs if he thinks such a facility is a move in the right direction for Stafford County.

""I don't believe so at this time. I think it changes the character and the nature of Stafford. We have a lot of history in Stafford. We're a very diverse community. Our constituents have been asking for things to do for the family, for kids, and this doesn't track with that direction,” he said.

News4 reached out to ICE and the Department of Homeland Security to ask about plans and did not hear back.

ICE is planning to hold 80,000 immigrants in warehouses around the country to speed up deportations, the Post reported.

While specifics on a potential facility in Stafford County are scarce, opinions are not.

“I mean, is that necessary? And is it morally right?” one resident asked. “That’s more so what I’m really concerned about.”

Included in the list of countries are Ecuador, Honduras, and Uganda, among others.

This is the latest effort by the current administration to reduce immigration to the United States. In October, the Justice Department’s Board of Immigration Appeals found that immigration judges should consider third-country removal prior to hearing an asylum case in the United States. In November, DHS asked immigration judges to dismiss nearly 5,000 cases. The basis of dismissal is not known.

The third country agreement gives the U.S. the ability to remove and relocate individuals to any of the countries in the program. In return, these countries typically receive some preferred treatment, like additional security support. In 2019, an interim final rule was issued, allowing the U.S. to reach agreement with El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras as third country partners. Per that agreement, if individuals were considered safe to apply for asylum in any one of those countries, they were barred from applying in the United States. Several lawsuits were filed, challenging the program. Additional lawsuits are expected in response to the current agreement.

In response, deniers of the program state it is eroding U.S. humanitarian programs. The program is considered another avenue for meeting Trump administration removal goals.

The Department of Justice argues the law violates the U.S. Constitution's supremacy clause and endangers federal officers.

Illinois officials state the law protects residents' constitutional rights from overreach by federal agents.

SPRINGFIELD — In an expected move, the Trump administration filed a lawsuit last week seeking to nullify a new state law that allows Illinois residents to sue federal immigration agents who arrest them in or near courthouses or if they believe their constitutional rights were violated.

The suit was filed by the Department of Justice in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. It alleges that the law, passed by the Democrat-led state legislature in October and signed by Pritzker earlier this month, violates the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution and increases the likelihood that officers face threats and harassment.

“Threatening officers with ruinous liability and even punitive damages for executing federal law and for simply protecting their identities and their families also chills the enforcement of federal law and compromises sensitive law enforcement operations,” the Department of Justice said in a statement.

The complaint names Gov. JB Pritzker and Attorney General Kwame Raoul as defendants.

A spokesperson for Pritzker said in a statement to Capitol News Illinois that “the Trump Administration’s masked agents are not targeting the ‘worst of the worst' — they are harassing and detaining law-abiding U.S. citizens and Black and Brown people at daycares, hospitals, and courthouses.”

“This new law reflects our belief that no one is above the law, regardless of their position or authority,” the spokesperson said. “Unlike the Trump Administration, Illinois is protecting constitutional rights in our state.""

Response to blitz

Pritzker signed the law in the aftermath of “Operation Midway Blitz,” a federal immigration enforcement campaign that targeted the Chicago region starting in September.

The Department of Homeland Security said that the operation resulted in the arrest of more than 4,500 immigrants who were living in Chicago and its suburbs without legal permission. But the raids often led to violent confrontations between masked federal agents and protestors during various operations in the city and suburbs, including near an Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility in suburban Broadview. Many of these skirmishes resulted in the deployment of tear gas and other chemical agents.

Leading Illinois Democrats viewed the new law as a comprehensive legislative response to the blitz that provides safeguards to people in their interactions with immigration agents. It also places new requirements on public colleges and universities, hospitals and child care facilities and mostly prohibits them from disclosing the immigration status of students, patients, parents and children.

But the reach of the law is limited. Not included in the package is an outright ban on law enforcement officers wearing face masks while on duty, for instance.

Senate President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, acknowledged before the bill passed that the state was “playing with a stacked deck” versus a federal government with the “upper hand” and that the law would likely be challenged.

Courthouse, private right of action provisions targeted

In its 22-page filing, the federal government specifically challenged the provisions relating to immigration agents’ actions in and around state courthouses as well as the private right of action that it created, arguing that “states have no power to ‘in any manner control the operations of’ the federal government.”

Under the law, all people attending court are considered “privileged from civil arrest” inside state courthouses and within a 1,000-foot buffer zone outside of the buildings.

Though there had long been a de facto understanding that such facilities were off-limits for immigration enforcement, they have increasingly been the site of apprehensions over the past year. Those who violate the act could be liable for statutory damages of $10,000.

The law also allows residents to sue immigration agents for violating their constitutional right to due process and protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.

They would be able to collect punitive damages that can increase if the agents are wearing masks, concealing their identities, failing to wear body cameras or using a vehicle with a non-Illinois or obscured license plate.

“That is a policy choice for Congress, not each individual state, to make,” Justice Department lawyers wrote in their filing, predicting that the law will “inevitably become a vehicle to threaten and harass federal officers.”

Latest state-federal immigration clash

It is not the first time the state and federal government have been entangled in litigation relating to immigration policy.

The Trump administration earlier this year filed a lawsuit seeking to invalidate, under the supremacy clause, a state law and Chicago and Cook County ordinances that limit state and local law enforcement’s cooperation with civil immigration enforcement. A federal judge dismissed the suit in July.

And Illinois and Chicago sued the Trump administration in October to block the planned deployment of National Guard Troops to the nation's third largest city. Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court denied an emergency appeal from the Trump administration seeking to lift a temporary restraining order put in place by a lower court that prevents the deployment of troops while the underlying case works through the courts.

The announcement drastically harms Gaza’s residents who rely heavily on the aid groups for medical care, food and shelter. For instance, MSF is responsible for 20% of the hospital beds and supports a third of all births in Gaza. In a statement issued last week in anticipation of Israel’s announcement, MSF said, “If Israeli authorities revoke MSF’s access to Gaza in 2026, a large portion of people in Gaza will lose access to critical medical care, water, and lifesaving support. MSF’s activities serve nearly half a million people in Gaza through our vital support to the destroyed health system.” We’ll have more on this story later in the broadcast.

Russia launched an overnight drone attack in the Ukrainian port city of Odesa, injuring four people, including three children. The strike comes as Russia claims to have moved a nuclear-capable missile system into Belarus, a day after Russia accused Ukraine of carrying out a drone attack on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s residence. Russian officials doubled down on the claim Tuesday but refused to provide any evidence. Meanwhile, national security advisers from several European countries are set to meet in Ukraine on Saturday, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Speaking to reporters, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine could be reached within weeks.

Prime Minister Donald Tusk: “The key outcome of recent days is the American declaration, and this is, of course, something new — some were even surprised — the American declaration of the United States’ readiness to participate in security guarantees for Ukraine after the conclusion of peace, including the presence of American troops, for example, on the border or on the line of contact between Ukraine and Russia.”

In Iran, mass protests over the country’s dire economic situation, including a collapsing currency and high inflation, have spread from businesses to universities. According to social media posts, students protested Tuesday at six university campuses in the capital Tehran, as well as in Isfahan and Yazd. The posts showed students chanting “Freedom” and “Don’t be afraid! We are all together.” Clashes broke out between students and security forces near the University of Tehran. This comes as Iran responded to President Trump’s threats that he would support new strikes against the country over its nuclear program. On social media, Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian warned that any actions against Iran would be “severe and regret-inducing.” This is the head of Iran’s parliament on Tuesday.

Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf: “I emphasize that Iran does not seek permission from anyone to defend itself. The Iranian people’s response to any widespread adventurism and evil is unapologetic and even unexpected.”

At least two oil tankers have reportedly arrived in Venezuela in recent days, with other vessels navigating toward the Venezuelan coast, despite the Trump administration’s blockade. The two other tankers approaching Venezuela are not under sanctions and are part of a fleet from China. It’s unclear whether China will press the Trump administration to secure the safe passage of the vessels as the United States ramps up its military forces against Venezuela.

This comes as a New York Times investigation has offered a glimpse into the physical evidence following mounting U.S. military strikes on boats off the Caribbean. The Times reports that days after a U.S. boat strike in November, a scorched 30-foot-long boat washed ashore a Colombian peninsula, followed by two bodies and dozens of packets, some of which had traces of a substance that smelled and looked like marijuana. The damning new details contradict President Trump’s claims of targeting cocaine and fentanyl traffickers. Marijuana is legal in at least 40 U.S. states.

In Bolivia, protests led by miners have entered a second week, with police forces on Tuesday firing tear gas at demonstrators in the capital La Paz. Protesters have condemned new austerity measures issued by the government of President Rodrigo Paz Pereira, who took office in early November. The decree has doubled gasoline prices and tripled diesel costs, with labor leaders and workers saying the new reforms will also skyrocket food and transportation costs for communities living in poverty. This is one of the protesters.

Franz Apulaca: “We’ve been repressed with rubber bullets, with weapons. We are fighting for a just cause. It is for Bolivia. We will fight to the end, until we get this cursed decree repealed.”

Honduran presidential runner-up Salvador Nasralla has formally filed an appeal to challenge the results of last month’s contested election. There are mounting accusations of fraud after conservative Nasry Asfura was declared the winner, nearly one month after voters took to the polls in an electoral process that was riddled with technical issues and a lack of transparency. Asfura was personally endorsed by President Trump, which was widely criticized as a way to intervene in Honduras’s election. Nasralla lost to Asfura by less than 1% of the vote and is seeking a review and recount of voter ballots.

The state of Florida executed 19 people on death row this year, a record high that nearly doubled the national average. That’s according to the Death Penalty Information Center, which said Florida’s executions accounted for about 40% of the country’s total this year. Advocates calling to abolish the death penalty have warned many of those put to death suffered from mental illnesses or were not given access to proper legal representation in their cases. Others were victims of abuse. Florida’s Republican Governor Ron DeSantis has been accused of expediting executions for political gain. Unlike other states, where the courts are more steadily involved in the process, Florida’s governor has the sole authority to issue execution warrants.

A newly unsealed order in the criminal case against Kilmar Ábrego García revealed that Justice Department officials pushed for his indictment, calling it a “top priority,” after he was wrongfully sent to El Salvador’s mega-prison CECOT and then returned to the U.S. under a court order. Meanwhile, ICE says it will not rearrest Kilmar Ábrego García again as long as a federal judge’s order blocking his detention remains in place.

Then in March of this year, Mr. Quero Silva was arrested by ICE agents.","The handsome actor, who appeared on a telenovela with salt and pepper locks under a baseball cap marked “POLICE,” seemed familiar to Venezuelan exiles who watched the show.

It wasn’t long before he was recognized as the lieutenant colonel who ran a notoriously repressive military unit in Barquisimeto, Venezuela.

Rafael Quero Silva, a former officer in Venezuela’s National Guard, was once accused by dozens of people and several human rights organizations of ordering violent military raids and the torture of detainees who were arrested after massive crackdowns on antigovernment protests in 2013 and 2014.

At some point after the protests ended, Mr. Quero Silva left the national guard.

Then, in 2018, Venezuelans living in the United States discovered that he had a new life in the Miami suburbs as a television extra on the Spanish-language soap opera “My Perfect Family.”

On Tuesday, five people who say they were tortured, shot or beaten by soldiers under Mr. Quero Silva’s command filed a claim in U.S. court under the Torture Victim Protection Act. The 1991 law allows the filing of civil suits in federal court against people who committed torture or extrajudicial killings while acting in an official capacity in another country. The lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages, although it is unclear whether Mr. Quero Silva has any assets.

The civil lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of Florida, would mark the first time a Venezuelan military officer would stand trial in the United States for abuses carried out under the government of President Nicolás Maduro in the more than 10 years since he took power, the lawyers said. The plaintiffs say they hope their case can serve as an important symbolic step for those who were abused or wrongfully detained under the Maduro regime.

“We would have the first case ever, despite all the attempts to bring a little accountability for what has been going on for over a decade,” said Almudena Bernabeu, a London-based lawyer with the law firm Guernica 37 Centre, which specializes in human rights cases. Her firm, along with the Miami-based firm McDermott Will & Schulte, represents the plaintiffs.

But before the lawsuit is ever heard, Mr. Quero Silva, 55, could be expelled from the United States.

He was arrested by ICE officials in March and now sits in immigration detention in South Florida awaiting deportation after being denied bail, according to U.S. government records. The Department of Homeland Security declined to say why he was detained.

When electoral results showed Mr. Maduro had won by a razor-thin margin, protesters who questioned the results hit the streets for months, including in Barquisimeto. The demonstrations turned violent and claimed at least 40 lives nationwide, including nine security forces, and marked a turning point in the government’s willingness to crack down on dissent.

Interviews with protesters and other witnesses found an apparent pattern of abuses on the part of security forces, who frequently beat, kicked and threatened protesters and, in some cases, shot demonstrators at point-blank range with plastic pellets.

Human Rights Watch called the violence “a systematic practice by the Venezuelan security forces.”

Other human rights groups documented instances of aggressive raids by soldiers in the city of Barquisimeto, involving the use of tear gas and lack of search warrants, at a minimum of 12 gated housing complexes.

Tuesday’s lawsuit accuses soldiers under Mr. Quero Silva’s command of firing tear gas and rubber bullets into and at people’s apartment complexes; setting on fire the roof of one of the buildings; breaking apartment windows and damaging buildings and cars. One plaintiff said her apartment was targeted because she often rendered aid to protesters.

Mr. Quero Silva was often there at the forefront, the lawsuit says, overseeing these military raids. The plaintiffs knew him, and they said they recognized him while they were in custody or participating in protests — an unusual factor uncommon in human rights cases where victims try to hold perpetrators accountable.

One of the plaintiffs, Wladimir Díaz, 32, a former student leader who now lives in Chicago, says he saw Mr. Quero Silva several times at protests when his unit used excessive force. At one demonstration, Mr. Díaz said guardsmen stormed a university building where students had sought refuge and fired live ammunition at protesters and he was struck.

“He destroyed families,” Mr. Díaz said to The Times. “I had to abandon my country. I have a gunshot wound. His people, his orders ruined my life.”

Carlos Doubront, 38, a Venezuelan lawyer who now lives in Miami, says he was attacked by soldiers from Mr. Quero Silva’s unit who made him kneel for hours, according to the lawsuit. He says knew Mr. Quero Silva from the neighborhood because they had friends in common and Mr. Doubront’s father was a general in the national guard.

“The boss doesn’t get his hands dirty, he has lackeys for that,” Mr. Doubront told The Times. “But when he starts to repress, he doesn’t forgive anything, he doesn’t respect anything.”

Another plaintiff, Ehisler Moises Vásquez Caridad, said in the lawsuit that she was shot in the face by Mr. Quero Silva’s soldiers.

Yet another, Maria Elena Uzcátegui Castro, said Mr. Quero Silva personally supervised the search of her house, where soldiers tied her up and robbed her. She was held in detention for four months, according to the lawsuit.

The plaintiffs said they all filed complaints with the authorities at the time but eventually fled Venezuela in the face of threats and other forms of repression.

Four years after the protests, word got out that Mr. Quero Silva had moved to the United States. In 2018, a South Florida journalist who had previously worked in Barquisimeto posted screenshots on social media of the former military officer in his roles on the television show, including one where he happily cheered at a horse racetrack.

Shortly after Mr. Quero Silva was spotted living in the United States, F.B.I. agents in both the United States and Spain interviewed victims who had accused Mr. Quero Silva of ordering torture and appeared to be preparing a case, the plaintiffs told The Times.

It is unclear what came of the investigation. The F.B.I. declined to comment.

Then in March of this year, Mr. Quero Silva was arrested by ICE agents.

The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on Mr. Quero Silva’s case, but said the agency was targeting “the worst” of “criminal illegal aliens.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/30/multimedia/30int-venezuela-torture01-photo-lvfm/30int-venezuela-torture01-photo-lvfm-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 09:58:09.817404

Independent journalist Nick Shirley released a video detailing his investigation into the issue on Friday, sparking a renewed interest into the allegations. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has charged 98 people in connection with its sweeping probe into the matter, Attorney General Pam Bondi said Monday on the social platform X.

Here is what to know, by agency, regarding federal investigations into allegations of fraud in Minnesota:

Department of Justice

Dating back to 2022, the DOJ has charged dozens of people as part of its inquiry into alleged fraud within programs under the Minnesota Department of Human Services (MDHS). Those charged are accused of defrauding MDHS programs that receive federal funding, including from Medicaid.

Joseph Thompson, the assistant U.S. attorney for Minnesota, said at a press conference earlier this month that it is possible that “half or more” of the $18 billion billed to 14 MDHS programs since 2018 is fraudulent.

“The fraud is not small, it isn’t isolated,” Thompson added. “The magnitude cannot be overstated. What we see in Minnesota is not a handful of bad actors committing crimes, it’s a staggering, industrial-scale fraud.”

Bondi also said Monday on X that the DOJ is “working hand-in-hand” with the departments of Treasury, Homeland Security), Housing and Urban Development and Labor to “continue unraveling this scheme.”

Department of Homeland Security

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) dispatched agents from its investigations unit to Minneapolis on Monday, with DHS Secretary Kristi Noem saying on X that her department is “conducting a massive investigation on [child care] and other rampant fraud.”

The department has shared multiple videos of investigators conducting inspections at businesses in Minneapolis over the last two days.

In one video, investigative officers approach a man in a store, whose face is blurred, and confirm that he received a notice of inspection for his business.

“We will root out this rampant fraud plaguing Minnesota,” DHS added.

Small Business Administration

Small Business Administration (SBA) head Kelly Loeffler said Monday that her department is halting annual grants to Minnesota, amid an inquiry into alleged fraud in COVID-era lending programs.

Loeffler said on X that the SBA is pausing the funding while it investigates $430 million in suspected Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) fraud in the state.

The PPP was established by the 2020 Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, passed by Congress and signed into law by President Trump during the COVID-19 pandemic. The program provided more than $750 billion in forgivable loans to businesses to assist with payroll, operating and other essential costs.

Last week, Loeffler sent a letter to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) outlining at least $2.5 million in PPP and Economic Injury Disaster Loan funds sent to people indicted in the fraud probe.

Department of Health and Human Services

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) paused payments from its Administration for Children and Families to Minnesota on Tuesday.

HHS Deputy Secretary Jim O’Neill said on X that he has also demanded an audit of day care centers highlighted in Shirley’s video from Walz, including attendance records, licenses, complaints, investigations and inspections.

In fiscal 2024, the Administration for Children and Families provided more than $172 million to Minnesota’s Child Care and Development Fund, more than $31 million of which was used to “improve the quality and availability of child care,” according to the state’s Department of Children, Youth and Families.

“We have turned off the money spigot and we are finding the fraud,” O’Neill added.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/AP25296714037305-e1764518306601.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-31 11:14:18.306115

“Under U.S. law, if an individuals (sic) procures citizenship on a fraudulent basis, that is grounds for denaturalization,” DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin toldNewsNation. “We are certainly auditing cases for the countries of concern which includes Somalia.”

DHS is auditing cases of individuals from not only Somalia but also 18 other countries.

Denaturalization refers to the process of stripping someone of their U.S. citizenship after it was granted. It is a time-consuming, lengthy, legal process that is infrequently used.

The government must prove that the citizenship was obtained illegally through the application process, such as through marriage fraud or lying during the application process.

It comes amid ongoing fraud investigations in Minnesota, where people in the Somali community are accused of defrauding taxpayers of social services funds.

Republican lawmakers in Maine blamed state Democrats, including the governor, for ignoring a Somali-led health services contractor that defrauded the state’s Medicaid program of millions of dollars.

In an exclusive interview with NewsNation earlier this month, whistleblower Christopher Bernardini alleged that Gateway Community Services filed false claims for visits to disabled and low-income clients, though the services were never performed.

A Gateway Community Services spokesperson told NewsNation Tuesday that Republican lawmakers have treated allegations of fraud as fact. The spokesperson said that the allegations are being “used as a wedge issue in a high-stakes election year.”

Monday’s lawsuit marked the latest in a campaign by President ‍Donald Trump’s administration to challenge state laws that extend tuition and financial aid benefits to non-citizens living in their states regardless of their immigration status.

The lawsuit targets a Virginia law that has since 2022 allowed immigrants who entered the country ​unlawfully to access reduced, in-state tuition rates at public universities and colleges ​if they can establish they reside in the state.

Supporters of the measure, which was signed into law in 2021 by then-Governor Ralph Northam, a Democrat, argued it would remove financial barriers that had limited the ‍ability of immigrant students in the state to pursue higher education like other Virginia residents.

The Justice ​Department argues the measure conflicts with federal immigration law ⁠in violation of the U.S. Constitution because it gives educational benefits to illegal immigrants that are denied to U.S. citizens from other states.

The lawsuit cites the federal Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, ⁠which restricts states’ ability to grant immigrants in the country illegally certain postsecondary education benefits.

“This is a simple matter of federal law: in Virginia and nationwide, schools cannot provide benefits to illegal aliens that they do not provide to U.S. citizens,” U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. “This Department of Justice will not tolerate American students being treated like second-class citizens in their own country.”

The Justice Department filed the ⁠lawsuit in Richmond federal court days before Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin leaves office and ‍hands control to Democrat Abigail Spanberger. His office did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.

At least 21 other states and the District of Columbia have similar “tuition ‍equity” laws and policies that allow certain students who graduated from high ​schools in their states to pay in-state tuition regardless ‍of their immigration status, according to the National Immigration Law Center.

According to the immigrant rights group, 14 states, including Virginia, also provide state financial aid to eligible students regardless of their immigration status.

Under Trump, the Justice Department has filed at least six lawsuits challenging similar policies in Texas, Kentucky, Illinois, Oklahoma, Minnesota and California.

What You Need To Know

Federal immigration agents seem to have changed their tactics inside of immigration court in the city at 26 Federal Plaza in Lower Manhattan

Immigrant advocates say ICE is now detaining more immigrants behind closed doors during regularly scheduled check-ins on a floor where attorneys aren’t allowed

In November, White House “border czar"" Tom Homan defended ICE operations across the country during a Fox News interview, saying, “Majority of people they’re arresting are public safety threats. They’re making your neighborhoods safer. They’re making your communities safer""

NY1 reached out to ICE several times to request an interview on the concerns raised by immigrant advocates, and ask for access to its enforcement operations in the building, but have not heard back

26 Federal Plaza houses two floors of the city’s immigration courts, and is much quieter these days.

Once a flashpoint of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in New York, video shot in late July shows dozens of armed masked officers arresting immigrants leaving their court hearings.

On a given day in December, fewer than a dozen federal agents from agencies including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) stand outside courtrooms.

Benjamin Remy — with New York Legal Assistance Group (NYLAG), a nonprofit legal services organization — has been on the ground here since detentions began in late May. He believes the Trump administration is shifting its resources and focus elsewhere.

“We’ve seen less enforcement here outside of courtrooms at 26 Federal Plaza, but we have seen more street raid enforcement, more raids on homes, businesses,” Remy, a senior staff attorney with NYLAG’s Immigrant Protection Unit, said.

In October and November, federal agents on Canal Street arrested 10 immigrants later charged with selling counterfeit goods.

In November, video appears to show ICE agents forcing their way into a Queens home without a warrant, looking for the mother’s cousin. Her children are American citizens.

In early December, residents in Jackson Heights shouted at ICE agents who appeared to leave.

In another November incident, ICE agents took a man from a car in Washington Heights to detain him.

Street arrests like those rarely end up in court. Rather, they can lead to detention and deportation.

“And then it’s ICE check-ins, so we’re seeing a lot of folks get detained, especially here on the fifth floor,” Remy said.

Remy and another NYLAG attorney, Allison Cutler, say they’re seeing less ICE activity on the floors with the more than two-dozen immigration judges.

However, they’re now getting many more calls about immigrants, including parents with children being detained during regularly scheduled check-ins with ICE, which are behind closed doors on a different floor.

“What’s very different about the fifth floor check-ins is that they don’t allow attorneys inside, and so unlike the 12th floor, where these detentions are very public, they’re getting caught on camera so that the world can know what is happening, these fifth floor detentions are very hidden,” Cutler, a supervising attorney with NYLAG’s Immigrant Protection Unit, said.

Earlier in December, Cutler and Remy learned about a fifth-floor detention from a faith-based organization.

“We just had ICE detain a community member on the fifth floor, so essentially this client who is going through her process, doing everything the right way, has a future date with her immigration judge for a future hearing, she was detained,” Cutler said.

NY1 reached out to ICE several times to request an interview on the concerns raised by immigrant advocates, and ask for access to its enforcement operations in the building, but have not heard back.

In November, White House “border czar” Tom Homan defended ICE operations across the country during a Fox News interview.

“Majority of people they’re arresting are public safety threats. They’re making your neighborhoods safer. They’re making your communities safer,” Homan said.

The Trump administration recently fired eight immigration judges at 26 Federal Plaza — a net drop of more than 10% there, bringing the total number of judges to 60 across three courthouses, according to NY1 reporting. Remy believes that complicates matters even more.

“Folks are showing up, they’re coming in, they’re expecting to have their hearing, they show up to the courtroom, and the judge is gone. If they’re lucky, maybe the clerk will be in there and can give them adjournment for another date. Sometimes they’re just turned away,” he said.

“But this is just adding another layer of confusion to an already just incredibly confusing and fearful situation. People are already scared and confused. This has only made that a lot worse,” he added.

Remy says fewer judges means more cases are being added to the more than 300,000 preexisting cases in the backlog in New York State, since cases don’t get resolved or are shifted over to judges who don’t have the same level of immigration expertise.

The Pentagon announced in September that it’s hiring 600 military lawyers as immigration judges across the country and eliminating job requirements, including having a decade of immigration law experience.

The move was confirmed by the Department of Homeland Security and follows reports first published by Fox News.

Denaturalization is legally possible if citizenship was obtained through fraud, but such cases are rare and often take years. Since returning to office in January, President Donald Trump has pushed a hardline immigration agenda that includes deportations, visa and green card revocations, and increased scrutiny of immigrants’ backgrounds.

Why It Matters

Civil rights and immigrant advocacy groups warn the audits could unfairly target Somali Americans and undermine due process. They argue the administration is using fraud investigations as a pretext to single out a specific community.

The issue has gained national attention as federal officials have labelled Minnesota’s Somali community a hotspot for fraud involving federal social service funds, a claim state officials dispute.

Key stakeholders include Somali American citizens, particularly in Minnesota, who fear increased scrutiny and potential loss of citizenship. The Trump administration and federal agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security, FBI and Department of Health and Human Services are driving the investigations as part of broader anti-fraud and immigration enforcement efforts.

Other stakeholders include Minnesota’s state government, which administers affected social programs, and immigrant-rights and human rights groups that argue the policy risks racial profiling and erosion of due process protections.

What’s Next

Federal agencies have increased investigative resources in Minnesota, while the Department of Health and Human Services has frozen child care payments to the state pending stricter documentation requirements.

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has pushed back, saying the state has already taken action against fraud and accusing the Trump administration of politicising the issue. Legal challenges and community backlash are likely as investigations continue.

And these operations have come with the unprecedented show of lawlessness from law enforcement that the ICE agents have been wearing face masks to conceal their identities.
Federal law generally overrides state law, and I just don’t see feds taking orders from state officials.
So Wiener’s ban on ICE agents wearing masks is unlikely to change anything once it takes effect January 1.
But it did start the momentum of legally deciding on what seems like a dubious law enforcement practice to many of us who do not work in law enforcement.","State Senator Scott Wiener got a law passed prohibiting ICE agents from wearing face coverings in California. We’ll find out when it goes into effect Thursday whether ICE agents will follow that law.

Right from the start of the Trump 2.0 administration, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents started snatching anyone remotely Hispanic-looking off the street and throwing them in detention facilities god-knowns-where. And these operations have come with the unprecedented show of lawlessness from law enforcement that the ICE agents have been wearing face masks to conceal their identities.

So back in June, state Senator Scott Wiener and his fellow state Senator Jesse Arreguín proposed a law to ban federal agents from wearing face coverings while on duty in the state of California. That measure sailed easily through the state legislature and Gavin Newsom signed it into law.

Now that law officially takes effect on Thursday, January 1, 2026. Come Thursday, it will no longer be legal for ICE agents to wear masks on the job when in California.

“Starting on Thursday, ICE agents who terrorize California communities while covering their faces will be in violation of California law and subject to civil and criminal liability,” Wiener said in a Tuesday press release. “There is no legitimate reason for ICE or any law enforcement officer to cover their faces while conducting normal operations, and doing so undermines public safety and erodes trust in law enforcement. If ICE continues to operate as a secret police force in California, we will hold them accountable.”

Okay well that’s all well and good Mister State Senator, but is there any way we can enforce this? Federal law generally overrides state law, and I just don’t see feds taking orders from state officials. Plus it's the Trump administration, which has been completely unapologetic about pulling reasons out of their ass to justify all manner of legal violations.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is not budging on the mask thing. “I would say that they wear masks at times to protect their identities from dangerous situations,” she said at an Illinois press conference shortly before Newsom signed the law. “With the leadership teams, we leave that up to them to discern what’s necessary in certain situations.”

The feds have already said they’d sue to overturn the law. But three other states have already started the process of passing similar bans (New York, Illinois, and Massachusetts).

So Wiener’s ban on ICE agents wearing masks is unlikely to change anything once it takes effect January 1. But it did start the momentum of legally deciding on what seems like a dubious law enforcement practice to many of us who do not work in law enforcement.

HHS PROBES MINNESOTA'S USE OF BILLIONS IN FEDERAL SOCIAL SERVICE FUNDS AMID FRAUD CONCERNS: REPORT

DHS emphasized that denaturalization, or stripping of citizenship, is governed by strict legal standards and applies only under limited circumstances.

The review includes cases tied to 19 countries that DHS considers countries of concern, including Somalia. DHS did not specify how many cases are currently under review or whether any individuals have been referred for denaturalization proceedings.

Denaturalization is a rare and intense legal process. Historically, the federal government has pursued only between a dozen and a few dozen cases per year, dating back to the 1990s.

COMER SUMMONS MINNESOTA OFFICIALS AS HOUSE PROBES MASSIVE SOCIAL SERVICES FRAUD

Prosecutors must prove that citizenship was obtained illegally, and denaturalization convictions require a high burden of proof that can often take years to litigate.

The scrutiny also comes as the Department of Health and Human Services moved Tuesday to freeze child care payments to Minnesota, citing alleged fraud involving daycare providers across the state.

I am one of those immigrants. Like many others, I moved to the United States from Mexico pursuing opportunity. I came first as a young professional, then as an international student. In the end, I stayed because of the life I’m building here. I’ve lived in Chicago for years, growing from an aspiring journalist to an award-winning reporter while covering the West and Southwest sides. I’ve made some of the best friends one can ask for, bought a house with my partner and made Chicago my home.

Journalists are trained to set aside our feelings and opinions, to recognize our biases and to pursue the truth above all else. But I cannot set aside my status as an immigrant, nor would I want to.

Operation Midway Blitz reminded me how much documenting the truth matters, even as it became increasingly risky for me to do so. Although I am a legal immigrant, I worried I could be detained as I was out in the neighborhood reporting, wondering whether not being a citizen could be used against me — even if my job, as a member of the press, is protected by the Constitution. Even if I’ve always followed the law.

But being an immigrant reporter has helped me better connect with sources, asking them deeper questions and establishing trust. I understand the complexities of the immigration system — one that can turn people’s lives upside down, bring great opportunities or force people to make incredibly difficult decisions.

For many, Operation Midway Blitz brought long-held fears to the forefront, the kind that come up during sleepless nights: Would they have to leave their home? Their loved ones? As the federal government increasingly targeted journalists, detaining one locally, I found myself asking similar questions.

What if they detain me? What about my family? What about our dreams?

I talked to people who, for years, lived in the shadows because they were undocumented. In Little Village, U.S.-born teenagers told me how much their mothers and fathers had sacrificed, working hard despite their anxiety because they wanted to provide for their children.

On the Southwest Side — and across the city — I covered the efforts of Chicagoans who organized to protect their neighbors. I talked to people who had the incredibly difficult task of telling a neighbor their loved one had been taken away, ripped from their lives. I interviewed teenagers left with guilt and pain after one of their parents was detained.

I never expected to see masked, armed federal agents moving through an American city, deploying tear gas on streets lined with people’s homes, shooting a woman, killing a man, all while detaining the landscapers, construction workers and others who work hard for the American Dream. But I am proud to have covered these stories.

These are voices I cannot forget. Everywhere, I am reminded of corners of the city where people — including legal immigrants, U.S. citizens, even children — were taken, brutalized or tear-gassed.

But I’m also reminded of the people who blew whistles, who helped those burned by tear gas get out of harm’s way, the people who spent their nights and weekends organizing and volunteering to protect their neighbors.

For many immigrants, the past few months marked the end of their American Dream. While covering this story deeply challenged me, it also showed me I am exactly where I’m supposed to be — telling the truth, and telling stories that matter to my community and my city: Chicago.",https://bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/12/DSC_3074.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 09:58:22.851021

Here's a breakdown of some of this year's defining moments, presented in no particular order.

Outrage, grief after Minnesota lawmaker shootings

Minnesota Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark were killed, and state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette were injured in what federal and state officials characterized as politically-motivated shootings in June.

Melissa and Mark Hortman were fatally shot in their Brooklyn Park home, while John and Yvette Hoffman were shot around 5 miles away in their Champlin home.

The attacks spurred a manhunt involving federal, state and local law enforcement for the suspected shooter, Vance Boelter. He was taken into custody less than two days after the shootings near his home in Green Isle, Minnesota.

Boelter has since been federally charged on six counts, which include murder, stalking and firearms violations. He pleaded not guilty to the charges in August. He's also been charged by the state with two counts of first-degree murder and four counts of attempted first-degree murder.

Court documents show Boelter's then-wife told an investigator they were ""preppers,"" meaning they ""prepare for major or catastrophic incidents."" She says her husband gave her a ""bailout plan"" before the attacks. She subsequently filed for, and was granted, a divorce.

State records show that Boelter served two consecutive three-year terms on the Minnesota Governor's Workforce Development Board. He was first appointed by then-Gov. Mark Dayton in 2016 and was reappointed by Gov. Tim Walz three years later.

""The Governor does not interview applicants for these roles and he does not know Boelter,"" Walz's office said in a statement to WCCO. ""They are not appointments to a position in the Governor's cabinet. These boards and commissions have no authority to make decisions, change laws, or implement policies.""

Minnesotans and state and federal lawmakers mourned the loss of Melissa and Mark Hortman in the weeks following the attacks. Melissa Hortman represented Minnesota House District 34B as a member of the Democratic Party. She was elected to the Minnesota Legislature in 2004 and was in her 11th term.

Federal immigration enforcement operations reach Minnesota

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations targeting Somali immigrants began in the Twin Cities earlier this month. The actions started a day after President Trump said, ""I don't want [Somalis] in our country.""

On Thanksgiving, Mr. Trump, in a social media post, used a slur usually directed at people with intellectual disabilities to describe Walz, used racially and religiously prejudiced language against Rep. Ilhan Omar and said that Somali refugees are ""completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota.""

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said its agents have arrested more than 400 people since ""Operation Metro Surge"" began. It's unclear how many of those 400 are still detained or have been sent elsewhere.

ICE agents have conducted operations in several cities around the metro. In Brooklyn Park, a coffee shop owner said agents lied to one of his employees before detaining him. WCCO reached out to ICE to ask what charges the employee faces and why he was detained, but has not heard back.

Minneapolis city leaders said on Dec. 10 that a U.S. citizen was wrongfully arrested by ICE agents because he looks Somali. WCCO reached out to ICE for a response to the accusation, but has not heard back.

Federal agents also gathered outside a home construction site in Chanhassen, where two men were atop an aerial work platform. One of the men came down after nearly two hours, and the other didn't come down until after the agents left. DHS officials say the men first climbed atop the roof after they ""fled from a vehicle and entered a construction site,"" and claim the first man to come down from the roof had entered the country illegally from El Salvador in 2019. He is now in ICE custody pending removal proceedings.

Omar, a Democrat, told WCCO in an interview on Dec. 14 that her son was pulled over by federal agents and asked him to prove his citizenship. ICE's Acting Director Todd Lyons said the agency has ""absolutely zero record of its officers or agents pulling over Congresswoman Omar's son"" and accused her of trying to ""unfairly demonize our law enforcement officers."" Omar then responded, ""ICE has long operated as a rogue agency beyond reform. It's no surprise that an agency known for disappearing people also can't keep its records straight. ICE now claims it has records of all the stops, and our office would welcome the opportunity to review them.""

Residents have clashed with ICE agents on several occasions since the operations began, including in south Minneapolis and the city's Cedar-Riverside neighborhood. Thousands of others have marched in protest of the federal actions.

Court documents said a federal agent was briefly kidnapped in Plymouth while conducting surveillance at an apartment complex, looking for a man who allegedly overstayed his student visa. Two people have been federally charged with assaulting, resisting, or impeding certain officers or employees in the incident.

Trump voices support for Lindell's bid for governor

Mr. Trump voiced support for Minnesota gubernatorial candidate Mike Lindell, founder and CEO of MyPillow, at a rally on Dec. 20 in North Carolina.

Lindell, 64, has joined a crowded Republican field seeking to unseat Walz in 2026. Mr. Trump said Lindell ""deserves to be governor of Minnesota"" after the myriad legal and financial woes the businessman dealt with in his quest to push conspiracy theories about the 2020 election.

""That man suffered. What he did, what he went through, because he knew the election was rigged. And he did it. I mean, he just did it as a citizen,"" Mr. Trump said.

Noem delivers bonus checks to MSP Airport TSA employees; union calls move illegal

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem was at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport in November to deliver $10,000 bonus checks to Transportation Security Administration officers, some of whom worked during the 43-day federal government shutdown.

Local 899 Airport Screeners Union said the bonuses were illegal and only rewarded 7% of the MSP workforce. WCCO asked Noem why some staff were excluded from the bonus, and she said they went to staff nominated for the reward.

Rep. Emmer calls for ethics investigation into Rep. Craig's town hall stops

Republican House Majority Whip Tom Emmer in April called for federal lawmakers to launch an ethics investigation into Democratic U.S. Rep. Angie Craig of Minnesota.

Craig and several other Democratic lawmakers across the country were making town hall stops in GOP-led districts in April to highlight the absence of Republican leaders at local events during the first months of President Trump's second term.

Emmer and fellow House Republican delegation members Brad Finstad, Michelle Fischbach and Pete Stauber, sent letters to the House Committee on Ethics and the Committee on House Administration urging a review of possible ethics violations by Craig.

""While her Republican colleagues have refused to show up and answer to their constituents in person, Representative Craig is actively showing up in their districts,"" Craig's office said.

Investigations into fraud in Minnesota reach new scrutiny

The Feeding Our Future scandal, the nation's largest COVID fraud scheme, garnered renewed focus from the Trump administration this year.

Somali Minnesotans are among the nearly 80 charged in connection with the scheme, in which prosecutors say defendants stole hundreds of millions of dollars that were supposed to be used to feed hungry children during the pandemic.

Mr. Trump has criticized Minnesota over the controversy, calling the state a ""hub of fraudulent money laundering activity"" and claiming ""Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great state and billions of dollars are missing.""

Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph H. Thompson suggested earlier this month that the total amount of fraud in Minnesota could be $9 billion or more. Walz and other state officials disputed that the amount of taxpayer money stolen is that high.

In late December, Homeland Security agents in Minneapolis were ""conducting a massive investigation on childcare and other rampant fraud,"" according to Noem. Many of their targets came not from tips from the FBI, but from a viral video posted on social media. The video alleged nearly 12 day care centers in the state that are receiving public funds are not actually providing any service. CBS News conducted its own analysis here.

Amid the investigation and Thompson's accusation that fraud in the state could be $9 billion or more, Minnesota House and Senate Republicans called on Walz to resign. In response, the governor's office said Walz has been working for years to crack down on fraud and has asked the state Legislature for more authority to take aggressive action.

On Dec. 13, Walz unveiled a new statewide fraud prevention program, naming former FBI agent Tim O'Malley as the new director of program integrity. Republican State Sen. Jordan Rasmusson said, in response to the announced program, a ""statewide director of program integrity isn't something you need when your commissioners are doing their jobs well in the first place.""

Special elections held after Eichorn and Mitchell resign

Minnesota officials held two special elections, in April and on Election Day in November, to fill the seats of former state senators Justin Eichorn and Nicole Mitchell.

Eichorn, a Republican from Grand Rapids, resigned in March in the wake of a federal criminal charge accusing him of soliciting sex from someone he thought was 17, but turned out to be an undercover cop. He is charged federally with attempted coercion or enticement of a minor, and pleaded not guilty to the charge in April.

Mitchell resigned in July after she was convicted of first-degree burglary and possession of burglary or theft tools for breaking into her stepmother's Detroit Lakes home in April 2024. The former Democratic state senator represented parts of Woodbury and Maplewood.

Republican Keri Heintzeman beat Democrat Denise Slipy to replace Eichorn in Senate District 6 in a special election held on April 29. Six months later, on Election Day, then-state Rep. Amanda Hemmingsen-Jager defeated Republican Dwight Dorau for Mitchell's former seat in Senate District 47.

Under the first Trump administration, there were roughly 400,000 TPS recipients.
Florida has more than 400,000 TPS recipients, and Texas has nearly 150,000.
Venezuelans, who make up 605,000 of those 935,000 TPS recipients, were first granted protections during Trump’s first term.
Barrett added that even when TPS recipients try to apply for longer-term legal status they face multiple hurdles.","“I don’t think we’ve ever, as a country, seen such a huge number of people losing their immigration status all at once,” said Julia Gelatt, the associate director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute.

The move to strip so many immigrants of their work authorization is likely to not only affect communities, but also batter the economy, both immigration and economic experts told States Newsroom.

“Seeing well over 1 million people lose their work authorization in a single year is a really huge event that has ripple effects for employers and communities and families and our economy as well,” Gelatt said.

Dozens of lawsuits have been filed by immigrant rights groups and TPS recipients themselves challenging the terminations as unlawful.

“This is the continuation of the Trump administration attack against the immigrant community, and specifically about the TPS program, a program that, for many of us has been a good program, a life-saving program,” said Jose Palma, a TPS recipient from El Salvador and coordinator of the National TPS Alliance, which is part of several TPS lawsuits.

Who is granted Temporary

Protected Status?

A TPS designation is given because a national’s home country is deemed too dangerous to return to due to violence, war, natural disasters or some other unstable condition.

When Congress created the program in 1990, it was initially meant to be temporary, which is why authorizations can be as short as six months and as long as 18 months.

Immigrants who are granted TPS must go through background checks and be vetted each time their status is renewed, but the program does not provide a path to citizenship.

Under the Biden administration, the number of TPS recipients grew, as did the category of humanitarian parole.

That policy decision was heavily criticized by Republicans, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem vowed to reevaluate TPS country designations for terminations during her Senate confirmation hearing this year.

“This program has been abused and manipulated by the Biden administration, and that will no longer be allowed,” Noem said during her hearing.

Before the Trump administration came into office in late January, there were more than 1.3 million immigrants in the TPS program, hailing from 17 countries. Under the first Trump administration, there were roughly 400,000 TPS recipients.

“Almost a million new people got onto TPS protections under President Biden, so we saw a really rapid expansion, and now we’re seeing a very rapid contraction, which is all to say that in the first Trump administration, there weren’t so many people who had TPS,” Gelatt said.

Noem has terminated TPS for immigrants from 11 countries, and the more than 1 million immigrants affected will lose their protections by February.

Noem extended six months’ protection for South Sudan earlier this year, but decided in November to terminate protections by January. She most recently terminated a TPS designation for Ethiopia on Dec. 12.

The other countries with TPS termination are Afghanistan, Burma, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria and Venezuela.

“We’ve never seen this many people lose their legal status in the history of the United States,” David Bier, the director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said. “This is totally unprecedented.”

People losing their status are also concentrated in certain areas. Florida has more than 400,000 TPS recipients, and Texas has nearly 150,000. Bier said he expects certain industries with high TPS workers to feel the impact, such as construction and health care.

Haiti, Venezuela

Immigrants from two countries — Haiti and Venezuela – make up a majority of recipients set to lose their TPS protections, at nearly 935,000 people.

Venezuelans, who make up 605,000 of those 935,000 TPS recipients, were first granted protections during Trump’s first term.

On his final day in office in 2021, his administration issued 18-month deportation protections for Venezuelans — known as Deferred Enforcement Departure, or DED — citing the country’s unstable government under President Nicolás Maduro.

“Through force and fraud, the Maduro regime is responsible for the worst humanitarian crisis in the Western Hemisphere in recent memory,” according to the Jan. 19, 2021 memo. “A catastrophic economic crisis and shortages of basic goods and medicine have forced about five million Venezuelans to flee the country, often under dangerous conditions.”

After the Trump administration’s 18-month DED designation, the Biden administration issued the TPS designation for Venezuelans who came to the U.S. in 2021 and again in 2023. The move created two separate TPS groups for Venezuelans.

“The bottom line is that removing the 935,000 Venezuelans and Haitians would cause the entire economy to contract by more than $14 billion,” said Michael Clemens, a professor in the Department of Economics at George Mason University.

He added that not all the TPS recipients are in the labor market. Some are children or elderly dependents who cannot work. Clemens said the TPS workforce population of Haitians and Venezuelans is about 400,000.

Humanitarian

parole program

Separately, under the Biden administration, nearly 750,000 immigrants had some form of humanitarian parole, granting them work and temporary legal status due to either Russia’s war in Ukraine or efforts by the administration to manage mass migration from Central American countries.

DHS has moved to end humanitarian parole for 532,000 immigrants hailing from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, opening them up for deportation proceedings.

“The onslaught of attacks that we’ve been seeing on temporary forms of immigration status, specifically with a humanitarian focus, is truly saddening and concerning,” said Alice Barrett, a supervising immigration attorney at the immigrant rights group CASA.

Not every recipient has been affected. The agency has kept humanitarian parole for 140,000 Ukrainians who came to the United States after Russia’s invasion in 2022, and 76,000 Afghans who were brought in after the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from their country.

But since the National Guard shooting last month in Washington, D.C., allegedly by an Afghan national granted asylum, the program is under increased scrutiny and all immigration-related paperwork from Afghans has been halted.

Court decisions influential

This is not the first time the Trump administration has tried to end TPS.

During the president’s first term, he tried to end TPS for Haiti, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Sudan, but the courts blocked those attempts in 2018.

This time is different, said Palma of the National TPS alliance.

“The only thing different right now is that the Supreme Court is allowing the Trump administration to continue with termination of TPS, even though lower courts are saying, ‘No, we should stop the cancellation of TPS for now, until it’s clear whether the decision was illegal or not,’” he said.

So far, in emergency appeals, the high court has allowed the Trump administration to move forward in stripping legal status for the two groups of Venezuelan TPS recipients and individuals in the humanitarian parole program.

Barrett at CASA, which is leading the legal challenge of TPS termination for Cameroon and Afghanistan, said when it comes to TPS termination, “what we are seeing in the second Trump administration is a supercharged version of what we saw in the first Trump administration.”

“We are essentially seeing during this administration more actual terminations happening early on even while litigation is pending, which has certainly been disappointing for members of the community, because they’re still left in this limbo,” she said.

Barrett added that even when TPS recipients try to apply for longer-term legal status they face multiple hurdles.

“For example, we are seeing them questioned or denied relief at asylum interviews because they did not apply for asylum within one year of entering the United States, even though the Code of Federal Regulations clearly creates an exception to this one-year filing deadline for people who have been in other valid status before applying for asylum,” Barrett said.

“These members of our community who have been in lawful status therefore now risk being placed in removal proceedings and even (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) detention, where conditions are increasingly inhumane and dangerous,” she continued.

TPS recipients are still continuing to fight in the courts and share their stories, Barrett said.

“These cases are still in progress, and we remain hopeful that despite preliminary rulings leaving so many hardworking individuals and their families in a state of uncertainty, upon thorough review and litigation of these cases the courts will recognize the improper nature of recent TPS terminations and restore status for those seeking safety here in the United States,” she said.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/themercury.com/content/tncms/custom/image/47283276-d683-11e6-9ad2-7311962f5570.jpg?resize=600%2C315,N,,2025-12-30 21:11:48.361845

Stephenson donated to the 2022 campaign of the barrister Allison Bailey, who was found to have been unlawfully discriminated against by her chambers for her gender-critical views.
An open letter signed by Stonewall, Galop and TransActual, among others, said: “We recognise that Dr Stephenson has an impressive track record in the sector.
Stephenson said she did not accept the characterisation that this was “a licence to discriminate based on looks”.","The new chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission has asked campaigners who raised doubts about her appointment to “judge me on what I do”.

In one of her first media interviews since her appointment at the start of December, Dr Mary-Ann Stephenson pledged to “uphold the rights of everybody across all protected characteristics”, after the UK government overruled the objections of parliament’s women and equalities committee about her suitability for the job.

Stephenson argued that open letters she had signed opposing censorship on campus and violence against campaigners had been “really widely mischaracterised as kind of anti-trans letters”.

Instead, she said, they were in line with her “lifelong commitment to protecting and upholding human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and freedom of association and basic democratic rights”.

Stephenson donated to the 2022 campaign of the barrister Allison Bailey, who was found to have been unlawfully discriminated against by her chambers for her gender-critical views.

Asked what she would say to those who may feel she had taken a side in the debate, Stephenson said: “I was concerned about women who had been harassed or sometimes lost their jobs for the expression of legally protected views at a point when there was a public debate about changing legislation.”

She went on: “I would say, you know, judge me on what I do. I am really keen, I think it’s really important for the chair of the EHRC to uphold the rights of everybody across all protected characteristics.”

Acknowledging that “clearly I need to build a relationship” with the LGBTQ+ sector in her new role, she said: “I think it’s really important when we’re looking at this issue around single-sex spaces, to make sure that you also protect the rights of trans people.”

A number of LGBTQ+ organisations raised objections to Stephenson’s prior public statements after she was announced as the government’s preferred candidate. An open letter signed by Stonewall, Galop and TransActual, among others, said: “We recognise that Dr Stephenson has an impressive track record in the sector. However, she has also previously supported views seen at odds with inclusivity for all.”

Stephenson’s most pressing challenge in the new role is the formal guidance on how public bodies, businesses and other service providers should respond to April’s landmark supreme court ruling on biological sex that the equalities watchdog submitted to the government for approval in September.

Her predecessor, Kishwer Falkner, has criticised the amount of time ministers have taken to approve the new rules, while a leaked draft last month suggesting transgender people could be banned from single-sex spaces based on how they look caused consternation among LGBTQ+ advocates.

Stephenson said she did not accept the characterisation that this was “a licence to discriminate based on looks”. She said: “I think my starting point in all of this is that you have to ensure that everyone, as far as possible, has access to the services they need.”

She said it was “important to make sure that there are services provided for people who can’t or don’t want to use the services for their biological sex. It is about recognising that everybody has rights in this situation, but where you are providing single-sex services, the supreme court has said those have to be on the basis of biological sex.”

The UK government has previously insisted it will take as much time as necessary to “get right” new rules on access to single-sex spaces.

Asked if she would be prepared to accept changes to the draft guidance from ministers, Stephenson said she believed it was “legally sound” and that the EHRC was “really happy to provide [the government] with any evidence that they need”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18dbfe6db088cf20d7d1ca6681f960ce28d2a670/456_0_4998_4000/master/4998.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=74672cc9eda9253a9eb875a3f16ff05e",N,,2025-12-30 20:57:14.610457

And Illinois and Chicago sued the Trump administration in October to block the planned deployment of National Guard Troops to the nation’s third largest city.","Springfield, IL (CAPITOL NEWS ILLINOIS) – In an expected move, the Trump administration filed a lawsuit last week seeking to nullify a new state law that allows Illinois residents to sue federal immigration agents who arrest them in or near courthouses or if they believe their constitutional rights were violated.

The suit was filed by the Department of Justice in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. It alleges that the law, passed by the Democrat-led state legislature in October and signed by Pritzker earlier this month, violates the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution and increases the likelihood that officers face threats and harassment.

“Threatening officers with ruinous liability and even punitive damages for executing federal law and for simply protecting their identities and their families also chills the enforcement of federal law and compromises sensitive law enforcement operations,” the Department of Justice said in a statement.

The complaint names Gov. JB Pritzker and Attorney General Kwame Raoul as defendants.

A spokesperson for Pritzker said in a statement to Capitol News Illinois that “the Trump Administration’s masked agents are not targeting the ‘worst of the worst’ — they are harassing and detaining law-abiding U.S. citizens and Black and Brown people at daycares, hospitals, and courthouses.”

“This new law reflects our belief that no one is above the law, regardless of their position or authority,” the spokesperson said. “Unlike the Trump Administration, Illinois is protecting constitutional rights in our state.”

Response to blitz

Pritzker signed the law in the aftermath of “Operation Midway Blitz,” a federal immigration enforcement campaign that targeted the Chicago region starting in September.

The Department of Homeland Security said that the operation resulted in the arrest of more than 4,500 immigrants who were living in Chicago and its suburbs without legal permission. But the raids often led to violent confrontations between masked federal agents and protestors during various operations in the city and suburbs, including near an Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility in suburban Broadview. Many of these skirmishes resulted in the deployment of tear gas and other chemical agents.

Leading Illinois Democrats viewed the new law as a comprehensive legislative response to the blitz that provides safeguards to people in their interactions with immigration agents. It also places new requirements on public colleges and universities, hospitals and child care facilities and mostly prohibits them from disclosing the immigration status of students, patients, parents and children.

But the reach of the law is limited. Not included in the package is an outright ban on law enforcement officers wearing face masks while on duty, for instance.

Senate President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, acknowledged before the bill passed that the state was “playing with a stacked deck” versus a federal government with the “upper hand” and that the law would likely be challenged.

Courthouse, private right of action provisions targeted

In its 22-page filing, the federal government specifically challenged the provisions relating to immigration agents’ actions in and around state courthouses as well as the private right of action that it created, arguing that “states have no power to ‘in any manner control the operations of’ the federal government.”

Under the law, all people attending court are considered “privileged from civil arrest” inside state courthouses and within a 1,000-foot buffer zone outside of the buildings.

Though there had long been a de facto understanding that such facilities were off-limits for immigration enforcement, they have increasingly been the site of apprehensions over the past year. Those who violate the act could be liable for statutory damages of $10,000.

The law also allows residents to sue immigration agents for violating their constitutional right to due process and protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.

They would be able to collect punitive damages that can increase if the agents are wearing masks, concealing their identities, failing to wear body cameras or using a vehicle with a non-Illinois or obscured license plate.

“That is a policy choice for Congress, not each individual state, to make,” Justice Department lawyers wrote in their filing, predicting that the law will “inevitably become a vehicle to threaten and harass federal officers.”

Latest state-federal immigration clash

It is not the first time the state and federal government have been entangled in litigation relating to immigration policy.

The Trump administration earlier this year filed a lawsuit seeking to invalidate, under the supremacy clause, a state law and Chicago and Cook County ordinances that limit state and local law enforcement’s cooperation with civil immigration enforcement. A federal judge dismissed the suit in July.

And Illinois and Chicago sued the Trump administration in October to block the planned deployment of National Guard Troops to the nation’s third largest city. Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court denied an emergency appeal from the Trump administration seeking to lift a temporary restraining order put in place by a lower court that prevents the deployment of troops while the underlying case works through the courts.

To hear the DOJ tell it, providing in-state tuition to immigrant residents unlawfully discriminates against out-of-state U.S. citizens.
The DOJ also said UVA tuition guidelines are ""in direct conflict with federal law.""
""As a result, Virginia law affirmatively removes immigration status as a barrier to establishing domicile and obtaining in-state tuition benefits.""
The federal government says the salve for Virginia's alleged encroachment of federal immigration law is federal preemption of the domicile rules used to determine in-state tuition.","The Trump administration filed a federal preemption lawsuit on Monday against the Commonwealth of Virginia over a policy that provides in-state tuition for immigrants who live in the Old Dominion.

In February, President Donald Trump signed an executive order entitled ""Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders."" The order aimed to keep ""taxpayer-funded benefits"" away from immigrants and directed officials to target ""[s]tate laws that provide in-State higher education tuition to aliens but not to out-of-State American citizens.""

Now, in a 13-page lawsuit, the U.S. Department of Justice is taking a constitutional swipe at the University of Virginia's tuition policies.

""Federal law prohibits States from providing aliens who are not lawfully present in the United States with any postsecondary education benefit that is denied to U.S. citizens,"" the lawsuit begins. ""There are no exceptions. Virginia violates it nonetheless. This court should put an end to this and permanently enjoin the enforcement of provisions of the Virginia Education Code that directly conflict with federal immigration law.""

The litigation focuses on two sections of Virginia law that recognize immigrants as ""Virginia residents based on certain conditions.""

The laws themselves do not mention immigrants or distinguish between classes of people, except for provisions outlining rules for military dependents. Rather, the laws cited by the DOJ focus on how domicile is determined and the time periods that allow a person domiciled in Virginia to become eligible for in-state tuition.

The lawsuit offers the following upshot of those guidelines: ""Virginia law permits an alien who is not lawfully present in the United States to qualify for reduced in-state rates and state-administered financial assistance based on residence within the state but does not make United States citizens eligible for such benefits without regard to whether the United States citizens are Virginia residents.""

To hear the DOJ tell it, providing in-state tuition to immigrant residents unlawfully discriminates against out-of-state U.S. citizens.

""That classification makes illegal aliens eligible for reduced in-state tuition and state-administered financial assistance for public state colleges and universities while U.S. citizens from other states are ineligible for the reduced tuition and must pay higher out-of-state tuition rates,"" the lawsuit goes on. ""This is not only wrong but illegal. The challenged act's discriminatory treatment in favor of illegal aliens over U.S. citizens is squarely prohibited and preempted by federal law.""

The Trump administration argued the UVA domicile policy runs afoul of a section of federal law which, on its own terms, purports to limit ""eligibility for preferential treatment of aliens not lawfully present on basis of residence for higher education benefits.""

The lawsuit cites the relevant language (emphasis in original):

An alien who is not lawfully present in the United States shall not be eligible on the basis of residence within a State . . . for any postsecondary education benefit unless a citizen or national of the United States is eligible for such a benefit . . . without regard to whether the citizen or national is such a resident.

It is not enough for the federal government to say the UVA tuition guidelines violate federal law, though they do argue that UVA is violating at least two immigration-related statutes. The DOJ also said UVA tuition guidelines are ""in direct conflict with federal law."" And, closely related to this argument, the DOJ says Virginia encroaches on federal immigration law by trying to take immigration status out of the equation in a third section of the domicile rules.

""Virginia law expressly provides that a student may not be deemed ineligible to establish domicile for in-state tuition purposes solely on the basis of the immigration status of the student's parent,"" the lawsuit goes on. ""As a result, Virginia law affirmatively removes immigration status as a barrier to establishing domicile and obtaining in-state tuition benefits.""

The litigation comes in the form of an as-applied challenge. This means the DOJ does not think Virginia law is broadly unconstitutional. Instead, the federal government is arguing that the in-state tuition guidelines used by UVA are unconstitutional in one specific circumstance: when such pricing is afforded to immigrants.

The federal government says the salve for Virginia's alleged encroachment of federal immigration law is federal preemption of the domicile rules used to determine in-state tuition.

To that end, the lawsuit puts forward a lone avenue of redress: a violation of the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution.

The government's lawsuit also marshals some support from a 2023 case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit in which a group of conservative students unsuccessfully attempted to bar the University of North Texas from charging out-of-state tuition.

In that case, the appellate panel declined to grant relief for the out-of-state students but opined separately to say the federal law cited by the students – the same one cited by the Trump administration here – has a ""sole focus…on improper benefits for illegal aliens.""

So, while the lawsuit rhetorically seeks to strike blows for U.S. citizens, the law itself cannot do that under the DOJ's preferred precedent. The Trump administration, instead, is simply trying to get Virginia to stop allowing immigrants to make use of the domicile laws.

""[T]hey confer in-state tuition benefits on unlawfully present aliens that are not available to all United States citizens on the same terms, regardless of residency,"" the lawsuit argues. ""As a result, these provisions, as applied to illegal aliens, are preempted under the Supremacy Clause and are therefore unconstitutional.""",https://lawandcrime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Donald-Trump-Memorial-Day-2025.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 18:56:50.300692

Here is our primer on the biggest stories to emerge from federal courts in Northern California and the Sacramento region this year.

Gov. Gavin Newsom’s former chief of staff arrested in FBI public corruption probe

Dana Williamson, former chief of staff to Newsom and a powerhouse among political aides and lobbyists, was arrested on Nov. 12 and charged with 23 federal counts of bank and wire fraud, filing false tax returns and obstruction of justice. Several of the charges were made in connection with a scheme to funnel money from a campaign account connected to longtime California politician Xavier Becerra to benefit his former chief of staff, Sean McCluskie. Both McCluskie and lobbyist Greg Campbell have pleaded guilty to participating in the scheme.

Federal defendants in Sacramento walked free. The reason: No paid lawyers

In at least eight cases in federal court in Sacramento, judges ruled that defendants’ constitutional rights were violated after the U.S. government stopped paying court-appointed lawyers to represent them. Julian Ortiz, who had faced life in prison for allegedly selling methamphetamine, was released on Dec. 12 after U.S. District Judge John Mendez ruled that without payment, his lawyer could not pay for experts, investigators, translators or others needed to properly research and defend his case. Nationally, about 12,000 private attorneys who rely on the courts to appoint them to represent indigent defendants went without pay for about six months, thanks to the snowballing effect of budget issues, the government shutdown and a computer glitch.

Trump v Newsom: California defiant as policy differences play out in court

From the price of eggs to the deployment of the National Guard, tensions between the Democratic Governor of California and the Republican President played out in federal court in 2025, offering some wins and some losses to each side.

Early in the year, California’s leaders responded defiantly to a threat by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in public safety grants to states and cities that protected migrants under so-called sanctuary policies. San Francisco and Santa Clara sued to stop the action in a case that was quickly joined by numerous cities throughout the country.

Immigration sweeps lead to hard-fought cases on immigration, National Guard

In June, when violent protests erupted over immigration sweeps in Los Angeles, Trump federalized the California National Guard over Newsom’s objections, prompting the first of several lawsuits over an issue that soon went nationwide.

The very next month, immigration sweeps at a South Sacramento Home Depot led to arrests and protests here. Detention of migrants, sometimes violently, at immigration court in Sacramento was detailed in a case filed in federal court in San Jose. But in another case, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a Southern California federal judge’s ruling that immigration stops could not be conducted solely based on someone’s apparent ethnicity or job site.

The state also refused to roll back protections for transgender athletes in schools, prompting yet another lawsuit from the Trump administration.

Retired Supreme Court Justice Kennedy reflects on cases, politics, Sacramento boyhood

Among the personalities who shaped the modern political and court system is Sacramento’s own retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. In a rare interview, the 89-year-old sat down with The Bee to talk about the city he loves, his childhood friendships with future luminaries such as the writer Joan Didion, and court decisions that for decades defined him as an influential swing vote on the court.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem wrote in a Dec. 19 memo to the General Services Administration (GSA), obtained by the Post, that the buildings in question at St. Elizabeths’ 176-acre West Campus ""present a risk to life and property"" and that ""demolition is the only permanent measure that resolves the emergency conditions.""

DHS included a security risk assessment report with the memo that Noem said supports immediate corrective action.

The assessment states the vacant buildings could be accessed by unauthorized individuals and could provide a tactical advantage for small-arms or active-shooter scenarios. The report also warned of threats from ""malicious insiders,"" including employees or contractors with legitimate access who could exploit the vacant buildings to target executives, disrupt operations or compromise sensitive information.

TRUMP’S TROUBLING WEEK: DEMANDING GOVERNMENT MONEY, DEMOLISHING THE EAST WING

In total, DHS is seeking to demolish 17 buildings. Four have already received approval from federal planning bodies, while the remaining 13 have not been reviewed or approved and are now being pushed through under the emergency demolition designation, according to preservation officials.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News Digital that buildings at the site need to be demolished for safety reasons.

""DHS security and safety assessments have determined these dilapidated, vacant buildings pose unacceptable safety, security and emergency-response risks,"" McLaughlin said. ""Demolition is the only permanent corrective action.""

A GSA spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the agency was notified by DHS of a serious and immediate security risk at the St. Elizabeths campus.

""Where buildings pose a threat, demolition may be necessary, and we are currently following all applicable laws and regulations,"" GSA spokesperson Marianne Copenhaver said.

Founded in 1855, St. Elizabeths was the nation’s first federally operated psychiatric hospital.

The West Campus was declared ""excess property"" in 2001 and then transferred to the GSA. It was later selected to become DHS’s headquarters and has been redeveloped over the past 15 years into a high-security, fortified complex for DHS, according to the GSA website.

TRUMP ADMIN DEFENDS WHITE HOUSE BALLROOM AS NATIONAL SECURITY MATTER

The site is a National Historic Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, with dozens of 19th- and early-20th-century buildings.

The demolition plan has drawn opposition from the National Trust for Historic Preservation and the D.C. Preservation League, which argue that DHS has not shown evidence of an actual emergency.

The groups told the Post that the emergency declaration relies solely on Noem’s own determination and bypasses required historic-preservation review procedures for a National Historic Landmark.

""A unilateral declaration like this is problematic because it bypasses the procedural safeguards designed to ensure stability, legitimacy and fairness,"" reads a letter signed by Elizabeth Merritt, the National Trust’s general counsel, and Rebecca Miller, the Preservation League’s executive director, according to the Post.

The preservation groups also argue that DHS used an emergency declaration and holiday timing to compress the review window, leaving little opportunity to challenge the demolition of historic buildings.

Homeland Security calls it a “force multiplier“ in ramping up deportations, but for Sherman Luna, it is a negative.
There are not enough dangerous criminals in this country to meet the goal of 1 million deportations a year,” expressed Sherman Luna.","NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) — President Donald Trump said he would deport a million people in his first year in office. According to the Vera Institute of Justice, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has detained nearly 6,000 people in Tennessee alone.

In 2025, ICE kicked off its raids in large cities across the country. By May, Nashville was in the bulls-eye. With traffic support from the Tennessee Highway Patrol, ICE began detaining people in South Nashville; the operation ended with 196 arrests.

According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 95 arrestees had prior criminal convictions and 31 were already removed from the U.S. and “reentered the U.S. illegally,” but the arrests did not end there.

“Right now, the community is at incredible risk. And there is palpable fear throughout the community,” said Lisa Sherman Luna, executive director at the Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition.

Sherman Luna added that the high number of deportations would not be possible without what is known as a 287(g) agreement, which allows local Tennessee law enforcement to work with ICE. Homeland Security calls it a “force multiplier“ in ramping up deportations, but for Sherman Luna, it is a negative. She says Tennessee went from only two 287(g) agreements up to several dozen.

“It is a program that is rife with civil rights violations, that is incredibly costly to local governments, and erodes trust with local law enforcement within the community,” she said. “Now, if you’re an immigrant, you’re not going to call law enforcement when you’ve been a victim of a crime.”

According to arrest data obtained by the Deportation Data Project, ICE made 800 arrests in Tennessee in October; many of those were in jails. In the Robertson County Jail, ICE detainments went from 18 to 128 in one year. Meanwhile, in Wilson County, they increased from 22 to 110.

Congressman Andy Ogles supports ICE’s operation.

“These countries are literally emptying out their prison, they’re busing them to the Southern border, and then they’re pushing to toward the United States. We literally have been the recipient of the worst of the worst of Africa, South America and Central America because those countries no longer wanted those individuals in their countries so they sent them here. So enough is enough. We’ve got to get very serious about deportations,” said Ogles.

“The reality is that for Trump to carry out his mass deportation agenda, he has to have a broader scope. There are not enough dangerous criminals in this country to meet the goal of 1 million deportations a year,” expressed Sherman Luna.

Arrests in Tennessee have nearly doubled since last year. A DHS website lists what it calls the “worst of the worst.” Looking at Nashville arrests, the list includes Mario Romero-Beltran from El Salvador who was convicted of rape and aggravated assault; Nimia Gamez-Saucedo was convicted of drug trafficking and illegal re-entry; and Jose Herrera-Rivas was convicted of a weapons offense possessing a synthetic narcotic.

“If I have to choose between a migrant from Somalia and our wives, our daughters, our sisters, I’m going to choose to protect you rather than someone like this,” said Ogles.

“Unfortunately, I do think cruelty is at the heart of all this,” said Santiago Mueckey, associate director for advocacy at Vera Institute of Justice.

Mueckey is especially concerned about what happens to the detainees once they are in the system and removed from the public eye.

“The bigger issue is that more than 96% of the people detained in Tennessee are then moved out of state, mostly to Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi. So not only is this completely destabilizing to communities, to families, but it presents challenges for the individuals who are detained,” added Mueckey.

Mueckey says by moving them out of state, detainees have a hard time connecting with their families and securing a lawyer.

“Out of the close to 6,000 people who have been detained in Tennessee, more than two-thirds of them don’t have legal representation,” he said. “And I keep coming back to legal representation because it really is the last line of defense.”

Under Chhabria's order, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services can share with ICE the basic biographical, contact and location information outlined in his order starting on Jan. 5","A federal judge in California this week allowed officials to share some Medicaid information — including addresses and phone numbers — with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to help that agency in its efforts to identify, arrest and deport immigrants suspected of living in the U.S. illegally.

The ruling amounts to a partial legal victory for the Trump administration and its efforts to carry out a deportation operation of unprecedented proportions.

U.S. District Court Judge Vince Chhabria said in an order Monday the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, can receive biographical, contact and location information from the Medicaid program, for immigration enforcement purposes. That can include the immigration status of individuals, their address, phone number and date of birth.

""Congress could not have made a clearer statement about DHS's entitlement to certain data from other agencies, and that entitlement would be meaningless if it did not also obligate agencies to comply with DHS's legitimate data requests,"" Chhabria wrote in his order.

Chhabria said ICE's data requests must be limited to people in the U.S. unlawfully. He blocked the agency from having access to a broader set of Medicaid information, including sensitive medical records and data on American citizens and lawful permanent residents.

Generally speaking, immigrants in the U.S. illegally are not eligible for Medicaid or most federal benefits, but states are required to provide emergency care to anyone, regardless of their immigration status. And some Democratic-led states also offer certain health benefits to immigrants who lack legal status.

A group of roughly 20 Democratic-led states, led by California, had challenged the Trump administration's immigration information-sharing effort, saying it will deter immigrants from seeking critical medical care.

The Trump administration, on the other hand, has said the policy will allow officials to better enforce federal immigration law. In a statement to CBS News, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the ruling was a ""victory for the rule of law and American taxpayers.""

""President Trump consistently promised to protect Medicaid for eligible beneficiaries,"" McLaughlin added. ""To keep that promise after Joe Biden flooded our country with tens of millions of illegal aliens, CMS and DHS will ensure that illegal aliens do not receive Medicaid benefits that are meant for law-abiding Americans.""

The court rejected the federal government’s conditions, stating that they were not “consistent with Congressional intent or FEMA’s mission.”

“The court saw through FEMA’s attempt to break the law and deny money that North Carolina relies on to respond to hurricanes, natural disasters, and other emergencies,” Jackson said in the release. “Our state is going to get back the $17 million that Congress promised so that our emergency responders and law enforcement officers are ready to respond to the next crisis.”

In Nov., Jackson sued FEMA and DHS for setting “unlawful” terms on grants without congressional approval. Congress passed a law setting how much funding each state should receive, but then the federal agencies “unlawfully” held one grant and shortened the time on another, according to the press release.

In the ongoing legal battles about whether or not people can legally film ICE activity in public, at least seven federal courts have ruled that it is a First Amendment right to record law enforcement agents in public.
The publication asked the department if it considers recording or following a law enforcement officer in a public place to be obstruction of justice.
In July, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem declared “violence” as being “anything that threatens [DHS agents] and their safety.
Cato, alongside groups like the ACLU, says that these arrests are unconstitutional, and that ICE has a “systematic” approach to detaining people who film agents’ arrests.","Masked and armed Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are arresting people for filming their activities in public spaces. Though multiple courts said these arrests violate the First Amendment, the Department of Homeland Security begs to differ.

While an official count of these arrests is not available, ProPublica tracked at least 130 Americans — including at least 12 elected officials — who’ve been arrested for allegedly interfering with and filming agents.

In the ongoing legal battles about whether or not people can legally film ICE activity in public, at least seven federal courts have ruled that it is a First Amendment right to record law enforcement agents in public.

“If you obstruct or assault our law enforcement, we will hunt you down and you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” an unnamed DHS spokesperson told Reason. The publication asked the department if it considers recording or following a law enforcement officer in a public place to be obstruction of justice.

“That sure sounds like obstruction of justice,” the DHS spokesperson said. “Our brave ICE law enforcement face a more than 1,150% increase in assaults against them.”

Straight Arrow News contacted DHS to try to clarify the agency’s legal argument, but did not receive a response.

In July, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem declared “violence” as being “anything that threatens [DHS agents] and their safety. It is doxing them. It is videotaping them where they’re at,” she said.

First Amendment right, courts say

Federal courts, including the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 10th and 11th circuits, have ruled that the First Amendment protects the rights of people to record law enforcement agents performing their duties in the public sphere.

Adam Rose, the deputy director of advocacy for Freedom of the Press Foundation, said he’s sat in on courtrooms where the DHS’ attorneys try to argue their point.

“This DHS comment is pro-secret police and anti-American,” Rose told Straight Arrow News. “Using an unnamed spokesperson puts it on the same level as an online troll, so let’s not pretend this has any merit. Filming in public is a fundamental American right, as confirmed by federal appeals courts for decades.”

The department’s email responses to Reason seem to defy federal courts saying that the First Amendment protects the right to record police activity in public spaces.

“It’s one of the most direct public statements yet from DHS articulating a policy that treats following, recording, and revealing the identities of federal immigration officers as illegal activity,” C.J. Ciaramella wrote for Reason.“There have been months of news reports and viral showing federal immigration officers threatening, brandishing weapons, and violently detaining people for following and recording them in public.”

But most of ICE’s citizen arrests for allegedly interfering with or assaulting agents have been dropped, ProPublica reported.

“There’s a reason DHS and its counterparts keep getting humiliated in court when they pretend to be victims,” Rose told SAN. “They’re losing in front of juries, judges are calling them not credible. It’s important not to normalize this absurd language from DHS — their ‘sounds like’ doesn’t mask their intent.”

Powerful player

ICE is positioned to receive more money than any other federal law enforcement agency.

This year, Congress earmarked $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border security initiatives, including a $45 billion allocation for immigration detention. Officials plan to increase its detention capacity from a daily average of 41,500 people to at least 100,000, according to Reuters.

Tricia McLaughlin, DHS’ assistant secretary for public affairs, said, “videotaping ICE law enforcement and posting photos and videos of them online is doxing our agents… We will prosecute those who illegally harass ICE agents to the fullest extent of the law.”

But many courts, organizations and people say that videotaping the agents in public is a First Amendment right.

“There is no doubt that DHS is deliberately threatening people who observe and record their activities,” David J. Bier, the director of immigration studies at Cato Institute, told SAN. “This is an attack on their First Amendment rights as well as accountability when agents violate people’s rights in other ways.”

Cato Institute, a libertarian organization, is among the vocal critics of ICE’s arrests of people for filming law enforcement agents. Cato, alongside groups like the ACLU, says that these arrests are unconstitutional, and that ICE has a “systematic” approach to detaining people who film agents’ arrests.

“[I]t is crucial to understand that ICE and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) consider people who follow DHS and ICE agents to observe, record, or protest their operations as engaging in ‘impeding,’” Bier wrote in an article for Cato. “DHS has a systematic policy of threatening people who follow ICE or DHS agents to record their activities with detentions, arrests, and violence, and agents have already chased, detained, arrested, charged, struck, and shot at people who follow them.”

The ACLU is another group that is an active opponent of these ICE arrests. Scarlet Kim, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, told SAN that it is a core First Amendment right to record publicly visible law enforcement activity.

“It creates an independent record of what officers are doing, and it is no accident that some of the most high-profile cases of misconduct have involved video recordings,” Kim said. “The burning question is why ICE officers feel the need to hide who they are and what they do from the public — masking their faces, lacking visible ID, driving unmarked vehicles, and now attacking those who document their activities.”",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2226092192_Dominic_GwinnGetty_Images_clean.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 19:56:20.258130

States, not presidents, run elections November’s off-year elections may not be the best indicator of what could lie ahead.
Congress can help set rules for federal elections, but states administer their own election operations and oversee the counting of ballots.
Likewise, Hasen said, Trump could spread misinformation to undermine confidence in vote tallies, as he has done routinely ahead of elections.","If history is a guide, Republicans stand a good chance of losing control of the House of Representatives in 2026. They have just a slim majority in the chamber, and the incumbent party usually gives up seats in midterm elections.

President Trump, whose loss of the House halfway through his first term led to two impeachments, is trying to keep history from repeating — and doing so in ways his opponents say are intended to manipulate next year’s election landscape.

He has rallied his party to remake congressional maps across the country to create more conservative-leaning House seats, an effort that could end up backfiring on him. He’s directed his administration to target Democratic politicians, activists and donors. And, Democrats worry, he’s flexing his muscles to intervene in the midterms like no administration ever has.

Democrats and other critics point to how Trump has sent the military into Democratic cities over the objections of Democratic mayors and governors. They note that he’s pushed the Department of Homeland Security to be so aggressive that at one point its agents handcuffed a Democratic U.S. senator. And some warn that a Republican-controlled Congress could fail to seat winning candidates if Democrats reclaim the House majority, recalling Trump’s efforts to stay in power even after voters rejected him in 2020, leading to the violent attack by his supporters on the U.S. Capitol.

Regarding potential military deployments, Ken Martin, chair of the Democratic National Committee, told the Associated Press: “What he is going to do is send those troops there, and keep them there all the way through the next election, because guess what? If people are afraid of leaving their house, they’re probably not going to leave their house to go vote on Election Day. That’s how he stays in power.”

Military to the polls, or fearmongering?

Democrats sounded similar alarms just before November’s elections, and yet there were no significant incidents. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a frequent Trump antagonist who also warns about a federal crackdown on voting in 2026, predicted that masked immigration agents would show up at the polls in his state, where voters were considering a ballot measure to counter Trump’s redistricting push.

There were no such incidents in November, and the measure to redraw California’s congressional lines in response to Trump’s efforts elsewhere won in a landslide.

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said the concerns about the midterms come from Democratic politicians who are “fearmongering to score political points with the radical left flank of the Democrat party that they are courting ahead of their doomed-to-fail presidential campaigns.”

She described their concerns as “baseless conspiracy theories.”

Susie Wiles, Trump’s chief of staff, denied that Trump was planning to use the military to try to suppress votes.

“I say it is categorically false, will not happen. It’s just wrongheaded,” she told Vanity Fair for an interview that was published earlier in December.

DNC litigation director Dan Freeman said he hasn’t seen an indication that Trump will send immigration enforcement agents to polling places during the midterms, but is wary.

He said the DNC filed public records requests in an attempt to learn more about any such plans and is drafting legal pleadings it could file if Trump sends armed federal agents to the polls or otherwise intervenes in the elections.

“We’re not taking their word for it,” Freeman said in an interview.

States, not presidents, run elections

November’s off-year elections may not be the best indicator of what could lie ahead. They were scattered in a handful of states, and Trump showed only modest interest until late in the fall when his Department of Justice announced it was sending federal monitors to California and New Jersey to observe voting in a handful of counties. It was a bureaucratic step that had no impact on voting, even as it triggered alarm from Democrats.

Alexandra Chandler, the legal director of Defend Democracy, a group that has clashed with Trump over his role in elections, said she was heartened by the lack of drama during the 2025 voting.

“We have so many positive signs we can look to,” Chandler said, citing not only a quiet election but GOP senators’ resistance to Trump’s demands to eliminate the filibuster and the widespread resistance to Trump’s demand that television host Jimmy Kimmel lose his job due to his criticism of the president. “There are limits” on Trump’s power, she noted.

“We will have elections in 2026,” Chandler said. “People don’t have to worry about that.”

Under the Constitution, a president has limited tools to intervene in elections, which are run by the states. Congress can help set rules for federal elections, but states administer their own election operations and oversee the counting of ballots.

When Trump tried to single-handedly revise election rules with a sweeping executive order shortly after returning to office, the courts stepped in and stopped him, citing the lack of a constitutional role for the president. Trump later promised another order, possibly targeting mail ballots and voting machines, but it has yet to materialize.

DOJ voter data request ‘should frighten everybody’

Still, there’s plenty of ways a president can cause problems, said Rick Hasen, a UCLA law professor.

Trump unsuccessfully pushed Georgia’s top election official to “find” him enough votes to be declared the winner there in 2020 and could try similar tactics in Republican-dominated states in November. Likewise, Hasen said, Trump could spread misinformation to undermine confidence in vote tallies, as he has done routinely ahead of elections.

It’s harder to do that in more lopsided contests, as many in 2025 turned into, Hasen noted.

“Concerns about Trump interfering in 2026 are real; they’re not frivolous,” Hasen said. “They’re also not likely, but these are things people need to be on guard for.”

One administration move that has alarmed election officials is a federal demand from his Department of Justice for detailed voter data from the states. The administration has sued the District of Columbia and at least 21 states, most of them controlled by Democrats, after they refused to turn over all the information the DOJ sought.

“What the DOJ is trying to do is something that should frighten everybody across the political spectrum,” said David Becker, a former Justice Department voting rights attorney and executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research. “They’re trying to use the power of the executive to bully states into turning over highly sensitive data — date of birth, Social Security numbers, driver’s license, the Holy Trinity of identity theft — hand it over to the DOJ for who knows what use.”

‘Voter protection’ versus ‘election integrity’

Voting rights lawyers and election officials have been preparing for months for the midterms, trying to ensure there are ways to counter misinformation and ensure state election systems are easy to explain. Both major parties are expected to stand up significant campaigns around the mechanics of voting: Democrats mounting what they call a “voter protection” effort to monitor for problems while Republicans focus on what they call “election integrity.”

Freeman, the DNC litigation director who previously worked in the DOJ’s voting section, said his hiring this year was part of a larger effort by the DNC to beef up its in-house legal efforts ahead of the midterms. He said the committee has been filling gaps in voting rights law enforcement that the DOJ has typically covered, including informing states that they can’t illegally purge citizens from their voter rolls.

Tina Barton, co-chair of the Committee for Safe & Secure Elections, a coalition of law enforcement and election officials who advise jurisdictions on deescalation and how to respond to emergencies at polling places, says interest in the group’s trainings has “exploded” in recent weeks.

“There’s a lot at stake, and that’s going to cause a lot of emotions,” Barton said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/166dfe2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7402x3886+0+524/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F01%2F9a%2F3dc380d046cba1b90269841ab2e8%2Ff33eee354ef14343be819efae9d9d415.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 16:12:26.361645

The complaint cites federal law that states, “an alien who is not lawfully present in the United States shall not be eligible on the basis of residence within a State … for any postsecondary education benefit unless a citizen or national of the United States is eligible for such a benefit … without regard to whether the citizen or national is such a resident.”

In a lawsuit filed late Monday, the Trump administration said the Virginia Education Code “directly” conflicts with federal immigration law.

“Federal law prohibits States from providing aliens who are not lawfully present in the United States with any postsecondary education benefit that is denied to U.S. citizens,” Elianis Perez, assistant director at the Office of Immigration Litigation at DOJ, wrote. “There are no exceptions.”

According to the complaint, since 2022 Virginia law has allowed students without legal immigration status who have lived in the state for at least two years to benefit from reduced, in-state tuition rates while denying that same benefit to citizens who are not residents of Virginia.

The office of Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Similar lawsuits have been filed against other states that have comparable tuition programs.

The Trump administration sued Oklahoma in August, Illinois in September and California in November. In June, a federal judge blocked a Texas policy that granted financial aid to unauthorized immigrants.

I’m only suggesting the issues surrounding the detention and release of illegal entrants are not as clear-cut as all those jurists believe.","Judge Robert Pitman of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas (W.D. Tex.) issued an order last week in Siac Guzman v. Bondi, directing DHS to release from immigration custody an alien who entered illegally 19 years ago and who was arrested at his home on Halloween. Such orders have been commonplace since DHS changed its detention policies earlier this year, but are they correct? The answer likely isn’t as clear cut as a lot of jurists seem to believe.

Section 235(b) versus Section 236(a)

Section 236(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) permits immigration officers to arrest aliens on administrative warrants “pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States”.

Once they are arrested, section 236(a) gives immigration officers three options: (1) to “continue to detain the arrested alien”; (2) to release the alien on a bond of not less than $1,500; or (3) to release the alien under a little-used authority known as “conditional parole”, which is different from the more commonly utilized “parole” under section 212(d)(5)(A) of the INA.

Certain aliens arrested on warrant under section 236(a) of the INA are not eligible for release, however.

Specifically, section 236(c) of the INA bars the release of any alien inadmissible on the criminal grounds of removal in section 212(a)(2) of the INA and the “security and related” grounds in section 212(a)(3) of the INA, as well as certain aliens who are deportable under the criminal grounds in section 237(a)(2) and security grounds in section 237(a)(4) of the INA.

Finally, an amendment to section 236(c) in Pub. L. 119-1, the “Laken Riley Act”, bars the release of aliens inadmissible because they are “present without admission or parole” under section 212(a)(6)(A) of the INA, because they sought admission through fraud under section 212(a)(6)(C) of the INA, or because they lack proper entry documents under section 212(a)(7) of the INA who have been “charged with”, “arrested for”, or “convicted of”, or who “admits having committed, or admits committing acts which constitute the essential elements of” certain crimes.

So far, so good.

The problem is a different section of the INA: Section 235 (which I refer to as the “inspection protocol”) mandates the detention of all “applicants for admission” to the United States and thus is seemingly at odds with the release provisions in section 236(a) of the INA.

“Admission” is defined in section 101(a)(13)(A) of the INA as “the lawful entry of [an] alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer”, while section 235(a)(1) of the INA” defines “applicant seeking admission” as:

An alien present in the United States who has not been admitted or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival and including an alien who is brought to the United States after having been interdicted in international or United States waters) . . ..

More specifically (and importantly), section 235(a)(1) of the INA defines that term “for purposes of” title II, chapter 4 of the INA – which includes section 236(a).

In any event, the inspection protocol gives immigration officers two options for dealing with applicants for admission who are removable under 212(a)(6)(C) for seeking admission through fraud or who lack proper entry documents and therefore are removable under section 212(a)(7) of the INA.

Under section 235(b)(1), immigration officers can subject such aliens to “expedited removal”, which permits the immigration officers to issue a removal order to such alien provided the alien hasn’t been found to have a “credible fear” of persecution or torture.

If DHS goes that route, section 235(b)(1) of the INA mandates that the alien be detained “pending a final determination of credible fear of persecution and, if found not to have such a fear, until removed”, and also requires DHS to detain aliens who were subject to expedited removal but found to have a credible fear pending “further consideration of the application for asylum” by an immigration judge.

Alternatively, section 235(b)(2)(A) of the INA permits immigration officers to process those aliens subject to removal under sections 212(a)(6)(C) and 212(a)(7) of the INA the same way it deals with every other inadmissible “applicant for admission” by placing them into removal proceedings (under section 240 of the INA) before an immigration judge.

Again, however, section 235(b)(2)(A) of the INA mandates those aliens also be detained, as is clear from the language therein, which states in pertinent part:

in the case of an alien who is an applicant for admission, if the examining immigration officer determines that an alien seeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted, the alien shall be detained for a proceeding under section [240 of the INA]. [Emphasis added.]

I’ll explain the highlights below, but for now just keep them in mind.

There is one more wrinkle to add to this analysis.

“Expedited removal” under section 235(b)(1) of the INA only applies to aliens encountered by CBP at the borders and the ports, and – at the executive branch’s option pursuant to section 235(b)(1)(B)(iii) of the INA – to any other alien who is removable under sections 212(a)(6)(C) or 212(a)(7) who:

has not affirmatively shown, to the satisfaction of an immigration officer, that the alien has been physically present in the United States continuously for the 2-year period immediately prior to the date of the determination of inadmissibility under this subparagraph. [Emphasis added.]

That highlight will also be explained below.

DHS Changes Its Detention Interpretation, and EOIR Follows Suit

The inspection protocol in section 235 was added to the INA by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), and for 29 years thereafter various administrations offered differing opinions on how the detention mandates therein were to be applied.

In its 2005 opinion in Matter of X-K-, for example, the BIA held that aliens subject to expedited removal who were placed into section 240 removal proceedings before an immigration judge following a credible fear finding were eligible for release on bond.

That was plainly at odds with the language of section 235(b)(1), but it wasn’t until more than a year after the Supreme Court concluded in its 2018 opinion in Jennings v. Rodriguez that aliens detained under sections 235(b)(1)(B)(ii) and 235(b)(2)(A) of the INA aren’t entitled to EOIR bond redeterminations that then-AG William Barr issued his own opinion (Matter of M-S-) overruling Matter of X-K-.

One constant interpretation throughout that period, however, was that aliens who entered illegally, evaded apprehension, and were arrested in the interior were eligible for bond under section 236(a) of the INA.

That changed, however, in July when acting ICE Director Todd Lyons issued a memo (as yet unpublished) “declar[ing] that immigrants who arrived in the United States illegally are no longer eligible for a bond hearing as they fight deportation proceedings in court”.

Thereafter, in September, the BIA issued an opinion in Matter of Yajure-Hurtado concluding that illegal entrants remain “applicants for admission” up to the point they’re either admitted or removed and therefore remain subject to mandatory detention under section 235(b) of the INA – essentially blessing Lyons’s interpretation.

Siac Guzman v. Bondi

That brings me to Judge Pitman’s recent order in Siac Guzman, which largely focuses on the tension between discretionary release in section 236(a) of the INA and mandatory detention under 235(b)(2)(A) of the INA.

The court concedes that the term “applicant for admission” in section 235(a)(1) of the INA “would be a broad enough category to include an individual like” Siac Guzman, “who was not admitted to the United States, regardless of how long” he has “resided in the United States”.

In other words, the judge found that Siac Guzman is subject to the inspection protocol.

But Judge Pitman concluded the alien is not subject to mandatory detention under section 235(b)(2)(A) of the INA even though he’s an applicant for admission.

That’s because, the court found, Siac Guzman is not also “seeking admission”, a ""requirement” Judge Pitman reads “to mean a noncitizen [sic] present in the United States without admission who has recently arrived and is actively seeking admission, not a noncitizen [sic] who has been residing in the country for years”. (Emphasis in the original.)

Judge Pitman is not alone in reaching that conclusion, and in fact cites to a series of recent district court decisions issued post-Matter of Yajure-Hurtado that make the same finding, all premised on the conclusion that the phrase “seeking admission” in section 235(b)(2)(A) must mean something.

IIRIRA and the “Entry Doctrine”

Respectfully, however, that interpretation of section 235(b)(2)(A) ignores the history of that provision, and in particular what Congress was attempting to accomplish when it created the inspection protocol.

I’ve explained that history in-depth elsewhere, but briefly, IIRIRA was intended to eliminate a convoluted sorting process then in existence known as the “entry doctrine”.

Pursuant to that doctrine, if an alien like Siac Guzman had entered illegally “free from official restraint”, he’d be placed into deportation proceedings and would receive a broad range of procedural rights.

If an alien crossed illegally while actively pursued by an immigration officer and was apprehended, however, the alien would be placed into exclusion proceedings, with few constitutional protections.

The entry doctrine invited a lot of unnecessary litigation (check out the BIA’s opinion in Matter of G-, and you’ll understand), and so Congress in IIRIRA replaced “deportation” and “exclusion” proceedings with one unified process – “removal proceedings” under section 240 of the INA – and treated every alien who hasn’t been “admitted” as an “applicant for admission”.

“Seeking Admission”

In so doing, Congress created a legal fiction under which even illegal entrants were “applicants for admission” even though – by evading inspection at the ports – applying for “admission” as defined in section 101(a)(13)(A) of the INA was the last thing they intended.

Given that, no illegal entrant could be found to be “actively seeking admission”, and Judge Pitman’s logic would, expedited removal aside, scuttle the inspection protocol entirely, and frustrate Congress’s intentions in amending section 235 in IIRIRA.

Moreover, there is no limiting principle to the W.D. Tex.’s logic. At what point does “recently arrived” end, and where? Does it expire in a day, a week, a month? If an alien crosses illegally at Juarez and immediately hops a flight to Maine at El Paso, could the alien be stopped four hours later at the arrival airport and detained?

Such fine parsing is why IIRIRA ended the entry doctrine, but if Congress had the intention Judge Pitman ascribes to it, it would have defined the term “alien seeking admission” as it did with “admission” and “applicant seeking admission”.

Congress didn’t, and therefore the only way that term can logically be read in section 235(b)(2)(A) is in the context of the phrase as a whole, “an alien seeking admission” who “is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted”, and in the context of section 240(c)(2)(A) of the INA, which places the burden on an “applicant for admission” to prove “the alien is clearly and beyond doubt entitled to be admitted and is not inadmissible under section” 212 of the INA.

Simply put, if “aliens seeking admission” have shown they are not inadmissible during the inspection process, Congress in section 235(b)(2)(A) is saying that they are to be admitted, not detained. It’s only when they fail to do so that the detention mandate kicks in.

That’s the most logical interpretation, and the only one that doesn’t actively subvert Congress’s intentions in the rest of section 235.

The Section 236 Conundrum

That still leaves the issue of sections 236(a) and (c), the former permitting the discretionary release of certain aliens and the latter barring the release of certain (criminal and security-risk) aliens who are removable under section 212 of the INA.

One could argue that only aliens who haven’t been admitted, and who are therefore “applicants for admission” under section 235(a)(1) can be subject to inadmissibility under section 212, and that Congress thus didn’t intend the detention mandate in section 235(b)(2)(A) to apply to every applicant for admission.

There are two flaws in that logic, however.

First, aliens who have been paroled under section 212(d)(5)(A) of the INA are not subject to detention under section 235(b)(2)(A) of the INA but could still be – or become – removable under the section 212 grounds of inadmissibility listed in section 236(c) (with one exception I’ll discuss below).

Given that, by my estimate, nearly 2.9 million “applicants for admission” were paroled under the Biden administration, a provision mandating their detention in specific instances would be logical.

The sole reference in section 236(c) that would undermine that conclusion is to aliens inadmissible under section 212(a)(6)(A) – because they have neither been “admitted” nor “paroled” – who committed certain criminal offenses.

As noted above, that reference was added (on January 29) by the Laken Riley Act – an important point for two reasons: (1) that act was intended to force DHS to detain aliens, not release them; and (2) at that point, neither DHS nor EOIR read section 235(b)(2)(A) as mandating the detention of every illegal entrant encountered in the interior.

Congress is presumed to know how a law has been interpreted when it is amended, and therefore it’s logical to conclude the drafters of the Laken Riley Act specifically mandated the detention of alien criminals who hadn’t been admitted or paroled to ensure they would be detained.

The second flaw is that redundant detention provisions aren’t uncommon in the INA. Notably, section 241(a)(2)(A) of the INA mandates the detention of all aliens under final orders of removal and then states that “[u]nder no circumstance” shall an alien ordered removed on criminal grounds be released.

Doubling down on the detention of an alien who is an “applicant for admission” (section 235(b)(2)(A) of the INA) who has committed certain criminal acts (section 236(c)(1)(E) of the INA) would be consistent with Congress’s double-detention mandate for criminals in section 241(a)(2)(A).

“Inconsistency with Prior Pronouncements”

Finally, Judge Pitman argues that the BIA’s “inconsistency” in Matter of Yajure-Hurtado “with prior pronouncements reduces even its ‘power to persuade’”.

With due respect to both the W.D. Tex. and EOIR, the BIA has a spotty record in interpreting the detention mandates in section 235 of the INA.

As noted above, the BIA misapplied the detention mandates in section 235(b)(1) of the INA in Matter of X-K- for 14 years before AG Barr issued Matter of M-S-, even though Matter of X-K- was wildly at odds with the language of the statute – a fact even I realized when I was an immigration judge, but was powerless to correct.

In fact, it wasn’t until the Supreme Court read the language of the statute plainly in Jennings that AG Barr corrected the Board’s erroneous interpretation.

“An Error Does Not Become Truth by Reason of Multiplied Propagation”

To quote Judge Dolly Gee’s 2015 order in Flores v. Lynch (quoting Gandhi): “An error does not become truth by reason of multiplied propagation, nor does truth become error because nobody sees it.”

If that’s true with respect to the release of tens of thousands of alien families (at issue in Flores), it must also be true when applied to the detention of illegal entrant “applicants for admission” as well.

None of this is to call out Judge Pitman; his is one of at least a hundred district court orders rejecting Trump II’s interpretation of the detention mandate for illegal entrant “applicants for admission” in section 235(b)(2)(A) of the INA.

The watchdog, which supporters say protects US consumers from financial harm by powerful banks, lenders and corporations, is at risk of collapsing after Donald Trump vowed to shutter it since he returned to office this year.

The agency’s acting director, Russell Vought, said that since the Federal Reserve has been operating at a loss, it is unable to fund the CFPB.

In a 32-page decision, DC district judge Amy Berman Jackson said that this novel workaround by the Trump administration to “starve” the agency of funding was “manufactured by the defendants” and based solely on an office of legal counsel memo, which said that there were no “combined earnings” available from the Fed for the CFPB – since the agency doesn’t receive its appropriations from Congress.

Earlier this year, the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents the workers at the CFPB, sued Vought, and ultimately secured an order from Jackson that stopped the administration from dismantling the consumer watchdog, and blocked mass firings. Today, she added that Vought’s argument is “not a valid justification for the agency’s unilateral decision to abandon its obligations under the injunction”.

She added that funding for the agency has continued “seamlessly” since the bureau was established in 2011, “even in the years since 2022 when the Federal Reserve’s interest expenses have exceeded its earnings”.

The US court of appeals for the DC circuit upheld Jackson’s earlier injunction and is set to hear the case on the administration’s wider attempt to dismantle the entire CFPB in February 2026. “The only new circumstance is the administration’s determination to eliminate an agency created by Congress with the stroke of pen, even while the matter is before the Court of Appeals,” Jackson wrote in today’s order, describing it as “yet another attempt to achieve the very end the Court’s injunction was put in place to prevent”.

Jackson’s ruling comes just days before the agency was set to run out of the funding necessary to pay employees. In response, Elizabeth Warren – the top Democrat on the Senate banking committee – praised Tuesday’s decision. “If courts continue to uphold the law, they’ll keep blocking Russ Vought’s illegal attempts to ‘close down’ the agency that has returned $21bn directly to Americans who were cheated by big banks and giant corporations,” she said.

Topline:

President Donald Trump focused on California first as his administration rolled out its crackdown on unauthorized immigration, sending the National Guard to Los Angeles and carrying out high profile raids throughout the state.

Why it matters: Raids on California streets and lawsuits that followed helped rewrite the ground rules for how agents can operate. What began as before-dawn operations in Golden State farm towns quickly expanded into a broader nationwide strategy: surprise workplace and neighborhood sweeps and roving patrols miles from the border.

What's next: California expects further interior enforcement, additional legal battles over sanctuary laws, funding, and renewed attempts to expand detention capacity.

Read on... for more on what happened in 2025 and what to expect in the coming year.

In 2025, California became the frontline of a federal playbook for more militarized immigration enforcement.

Raids on California streets and lawsuits that followed helped rewrite the ground rules for how agents can operate. What began as before-dawn operations in Golden State farm towns quickly expanded into a broader nationwide strategy: surprise workplace and neighborhood sweeps and roving patrols miles from the border.

CalMatters reporters across California documented how tactics first seen in Kern County, such as warrantless traffic stops and a heavy reliance on appearance-based profiling, spread statewide and then across the country. The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld these methods.

Early in the second Trump administration, the federal government sent Marines to the border, citing a crisis. Those troops have since quietly gone home.

Hundreds of National Guard troops were deployed to Los Angeles following civil unrest about immigration arrests. President Donald Trump threatened to send forces to the Bay Area, then backed off. State officials objected, while federal leaders characterized the moves as necessary. The standoff deepened long-running tensions between California and the White House over the state’s sanctuary policy and federal authority.

All this fell most heavily on families with deep roots in California. CalMatters found deportations increasingly reached people who have decades-long residence, U.S.-citizen children, stable employment, and even those following legal pathways. ICE detained people at green-card interviews and routine check-ins. The changes destabilized school systems, the agricultural economy, and health care.

A federal lawsuit over a deaf asylum seeker’s prolonged detention exposed gaps in medical care and disability accommodations in immigration facilities. Under Trump, asylum seekers with pending claims lost protection from arrest. A new system is emerging where people trying to follow the rules are easier targets than those evading them. Detention centers drew scrutiny as local authorities shied away from conducting health and safety inspections, while advocates reported worsening conditions inside.

A quieter but equally consequential trend has emerged: The immigrant population shrank. Love them or hate them, Trump’s immigration policies were achieving the administration’s goals. Pew Research found the national immigration population shrank by about 1.4 million people in the first half of 2025, the first decline in half a century. Economists warned about slower growth. State leaders weighed long-term impacts on the workforce, schools, and social service systems.

Enforcement grew more data-driven. Drone surveillance expanded in urban areas, and advocates warned about new uses of artificial intelligence to identify deportation targets and analyze asylum and visa applicants’ digital histories.

2026 outlook

California expects further interior enforcement, additional legal battles over sanctuary laws, funding, and renewed attempts to expand detention capacity. School districts and employers are preparing for more mass removals, while lawmakers are considering new privacy protections.

For more than a century, the Rose Parade has delighted audiences across Southern California with its colorful, elaborate floats and fanfare.

The parade will celebrate its 137th year when floats begin traveling through Pasadena at 8 a.m. Jan. 1, 2026. This year's theme is ""Magic in Teamwork,"" and Magic Johnson is the Grand Marshal.

This year, for the first time in two decades, rain appears to be highly likely on parade day. Rain conditions are rare for the legendary parade.

Showing off SoCal weather, in fact, was one of the main drivers of the parade's creation.

As the Pasadena Tournament of Roses website recounts, Charles F. Holder led Valley Hunt Club members in creating the parade in 1890, saying: “In New York, people are buried in snow. Here our flowers are blooming and our oranges are about to bear. Let’s hold a festival to tell the world about our paradise.”

Topline:

Nearly one year after fires destroyed thousands of homes in L.A. County, many families have concluded that rebuilding isn’t in their budget. In nearly half of recent deals for empty lots, homeowners are selling to investors. That’s the conclusion researchers with the online real estate listings platform Redfin reached in a new report published this morning.

The numbers: Analyzing transactions in L.A. County burn zones during July, August and September, they found that about 40% of Pacific Palisades vacant lots went to corporate buyers. In both Altadena and Malibu, about 44% of such vacant lot sales went to investors.

The context: Investor activity is common following disasters. While some say they can be helpful in bringing homes back to ravaged communities, others are skeptical about their plans. Some lawmakers and organizations have been working to counteract speculative development in Altadena.

Read on… to learn why one Altadena fire survivor sees this trend as “disaster capitalism” coming for the diverse foothill community.

Shortly after the Eaton Fire destroyed thousands of homes in and around Altadena, signs sprung up across the community announcing “Altadena is not for sale.”

Now, nearly one year later, hundreds of Altadena families have concluded that rebuilding isn’t in their budget. In nearly half of recent deals for empty lots, homeowners are selling to investors.

That’s the conclusion researchers with the online real estate listings platform Redfin reached in a new report published Tuesday.

Analyzing transactions in L.A. County burn zones during July, August and September, they found that about 40% of Pacific Palisades vacant lots went to corporate buyers. In both Altadena and Malibu, about 44% of such vacant lot sales went to investors.

“It's not uncommon to see that when disasters hit a place, investors come in,” said Sheharyar Bokhari, Redfin’s principal economist. “It's hard to value a vacant lot, so you could perhaps buy lower than what it should sell for and then flip it.”

More vacant lots are getting scooped up

To conduct the analysis, Redfin researchers looked at sales in the zip codes 90272 for the Pacific Palisades, 91001 for Altadena and 90265 for Malibu. They categorized buyers as investors if their names contained words or abbreviations such as LLC, Inc, Corp or Homes.

There was a marked increase of vacant lots sales in all communities, according to the report. In the Pacific Palisades, 119 lots sold in July, August and September. Altadena saw 61 lot sales. In 2024, before the fires, neither Pacific Palisades nor Altadena had any lots selling in those months.

Malibu saw some vacant lots sell in that time frame in 2024. But before the fires, only about 21% of those sales were to investors.

The findings are similar to those in a separate report published in October by the nonprofit Strategic Actions for a Just Economy. That report found that 49% of sales in the Eaton Fire burn zone went to corporate entities.

Zaire Calvin lost his family’s home in Altadena and had a sister who died in the fire. He said the trend shows “disaster capitalism” poised to change the diverse foothill community.

“If rebuilding becomes a race for capital instead of a return home for families, then disaster has been basically repackaged as opportunity for those with the most resources,” Calvin said. “It's like they're preying on us while we're still praying for hope and help.”

Some lawmakers and organizations have been working to counteract speculative development..

Assembly Bill 851, signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom in October, outlawed unsolicited offers on properties in burn zones until 2027.

The nonprofit Greenline Housing Foundation has been buying lots from distressed sellers in Altadena, giving them an alternative to more bottom-line driven investors. The organization has said it intends to rebuild homes and sell them at below market prices to first-time buyers.

Corporate buyers: disaster capitalists or helpful rebuilders?

Bokhari, the Redfin economist, said investor activity is not entirely detrimental to communities recovering from disaster.

“Investors who have a lot more capital can come in and build that community,” he said. They can afford to clean up lingering environmental damage and build homes that comply with the latest fire safety codes, he said.

“Investors play that role in bringing back those homes,” Bokhari said.

Still, uncertainty around investors’ plans have left many Altadenans anxious. Will homes be for sale or for rent? How will those homes look? Will investor-built properties give Black families a way to continue building generational wealth in a historically Black corner of L.A. County?

Lori Gay, president and CEO of Neighborhood Housing Services of L.A. County, said in the grand scheme of L.A. real estate, not many lots in Altadena are trading hands so far. Only 61 lots in the community sold in July, August and September according to the Redfin report.

“More will go up for sale over time,” Gay said. But in her organization’s work advising families on how to rebuild, she said, “Most families we’ve seen want to go back home. They’re not trying to leave. They’re trying to figure out how to stay.”

Good Tuesday morning. I’m Kimberly Leonard, guest-writing Playbook from sunny Miami, where I live and write Florida Playbook. Get in touch.

DRIVING THE DAY

AN (ALMOST) CONGRESSIONAL ARRAIGNMENT: The now-postponed arraignment for Democratic Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick of Florida could have been just a short, humdrum court proceeding. But the scene that unfolded outside the C. Clyde Atkins U.S. Courthouse in Miami yesterday became so much more as multiple political storylines converged.

A dozen journalists surrounded Cherfilus-McCormick as she entered the federal courthouse with her husband and lawyers just across the street from where President Donald Trump had faced his own arraignment over classified documents in 2023.

Cherfilus-McCormick, 46, has been charged with allegedly stealing $5 million in overpaid federal disaster funds — then using the money toward her congressional campaign and a 3.14-carat yellow diamond ring. (There was no stone in sight yesterday.)

As they walked up the courthouse steps, the member of Congress and her lawyers ignored questions from Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio. Holding a mic and accompanied by a cameraperson, he demanded to know why her indictment should be treated differently from that of former GOP Rep. George Santos of New York, whose colleagues expelled him from Congress following numerous criminal charges including misuse of campaign funds. (He was eventually sentenced for wire fraud and identity theft.)

Tarrio told Playbook the scene reminded him of his own initial court appearance in Miami that resulted in a 22-year sentence in DC for seditious conspiracy for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol insurrection.

In a January 2022 interview with PBS News, Cherfilus-McCormick accused the Proud Boys of trying to intimidate Black voters at her special election.

“On a personal level it’s sweet justice,” Tarrio said, referring to how Democrats publicized his sentencing. Trump pardoned Tarrio in January.

The drama inside the courtroom was more subdued, playing out in less than five minutes. Magistrate Judge Lisette Reid gave the member of Congress the three more weeks her lawyer, David Markus, said she needed to officially retain his legal team, and the arraignment got bumped to Jan. 20, 2026. While that punted Cherfilus-McCormick’s official plea, she has repeatedly said she’s innocent, including yesterday.

Markus is the same lawyer representing Ghislaine Maxwell in ongoing legal matters stemming from her conviction for involvement in her late boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking network. But it was what Markus said upon exiting the courthouse that drove the day’s news: He accused “folks within the Florida Democratic Party” of targeting his client and said his team would be “exposing” those involved. He didn’t elaborate.

Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried notably hasn’t weighed in on the indictment. Yet the comments about possible intraparty strife come just as the beleaguered state party had otherwise ended the year with glimmers of hope after a Democrat was elected Miami mayor.

Cherfilus-McCormick’s seat is safely blue. Trump lost it by nearly 40 points in 2024, according to the Downballot. But her charges and claims of her own party’s involvement threaten to distract Florida Democrats as they go up against a much better-funded and organized Florida GOP, especially as national Democrats warn that failing to compete in the South could make a future presidential victory nearly impossible.

Former Broward County Mayor Dale Holness, who lost the Democratic nomination to Cherfilus-McCormick in 2021 by five votes, said candidates should be focused on affordability and stressed he viewed the state party as “working hard to rebuild itself.”

“Everyone deserves their day in court,” said Holness, who’s among those running for the seat again. “I don’t know the spin the attorney is putting on it now.”

If convicted, Cherfilus-McCormick is facing more than five decades in prison. She’s the only member of Congress of Haitian descent and has been a vocal opponent of the Trump administration’s travel ban and immigration restrictions. Florida has half a million residents with ties to Haiti, which is facing gang violence and political instability.

While Cherfilus-McCormick stepped down from her subcommittee leadership role, some Florida Republicans have called for her to be expelled, pointing to Santos’ 2023 ouster.

Santos — who’s moving to Florida fresh off the heels of a Trump clemency — agrees. “I was denied due process and that is the standard that was set by the House,” he said. “I don’t like it — but fair is fair. She needs to go.”

9 THINGS FOR YOUR RADAR

1. DEEP DIVE: POLITICO’s Daniel Lippman, Sophia Cai and Daniel Barnes have an in-depth story this morning about how Paul Ingrassia has survived in the Trump administration. The 30-year-old lawyer pulled his nomination to lead the Office of Special Counsel after POLITICO reported that he said he has a “Nazi streak,” according to texts. He is now the acting general counsel at the General Services Administration, after two previous jobs as White House liaison to DOJ and DHS.

“His almost Trumpian survival demonstrates how ideological affinity and personal loyalty can outweigh all other considerations in this administration,” the authors write. “And while top officials in the Republican Party and White House have split between denouncing bigoted language exhibited by officials like Ingrassia and forming a defensive line around supporters, the messages don’t appear to have hurt his official standing.” A lawyer for Ingrassia did not confirm the texts were authentic and said at the time they “could be manipulated or are being provided with material context omitted.” The lawyer and Ingrassia did not comment for this story.

2. FIRST IN PLAYBOOK — Bowl blitz: Abdul El-Sayed’s campaign for the U.S. Senate in Michigan is airing the last of its football-themed, nearly six-figure statewide ads during the Citrus Bowl on New Year’s Eve, which will see Texas take on the University of Michigan, El-Sayed’s alma mater. In promoting the ad, which features him throwing the pigskin, El-Sayed’s campaign said that “College football remains one of the last places where Michiganders can come together across political divides, age, and background.”

But El-Sayed, who captained his high school football team, has expressed a more complicated relationship with the game in the past, Playbook’s Adam Wren reports. In his now private Substack called “The Incision,” EL-Sayed wrote of the “toxic masculinity at the heart of America’s most popular sport.” He also wrote that “on the sidelines and in the locker room, I was fed a hefty dose of the worst kinds of racist taunting. On an episode of the podcast “America Dissected,” El-Sayed said football “takes some of the most egregious narratives that we tell ourselves about who we are as a country. And it puts it on the field every Sunday.”

Asked for comment, an El-Sayed spokesperson said: “Abdul’s love of football isn’t theoretical. It’s up close and personal, earned snap after snap and tackle after tackle. Football taught him so much about leadership and community — but also about the risks and who bears them. Abdul knows that loving something means pushing it to be better. That’s the same approach he’ll bring to the U.S. Senate: identify the problem honestly and directly so we can find real solutions, and then fight to make things better for everyone, not just the people at the top.”

3. VENEZUELA VEX: The CIA carried out a drone strike earlier this month on a port facility on the coast of Venezuela — marking the first known attack inside the country and a major escalation of the administration’s pressure campaign, CNN’s Natasha Bertrand and colleagues scoop. The strike targeted the dock believed to be storing drugs, and there were no casualties. The report came after Trump told reporters yesterday about hitting a facility, calling it a “major explosion” but remaining mum on details, per WSJ’s Dustin Volz. And on the oil front, the squeeze on Venezuela via the blockade is causing the country to shutter some of its oil wells, as they run out of storage space, per Bloomberg.

4. WAR AND PEACE: Despite simmering tensions on the way forward on Gaza and Iran, Trump and Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu projected a united front while doling out the usual praise for each other, NYT’s Tyler Pager and David Halbfinger report. Little was said publicly about their talks over the multi-course lunch at Mar-a-Lago, including on how the Gaza peace plan will advance into the second phase. Trump did heap some pressure on Hamas, saying they have a “very short period of time” to disarm, adding there will be “hell to pay” if they don’t, per Bloomberg.

Trump’s strongest commitment was on Iran, stating he will back more strikes on the country should they rebuild their nuclear capabilities, POLITICO’s Alex Gangitano writes from Palm Beach. “And if they are, we’re going to have to knock them down,” Trump said. He added that he heard Iran may want to make a deal, but otherwise he would support an Israeli strike. Trump also paid reporters a surprise visit on the Mar-a-Lago patio, Alex writes in to Playbook. He pointed to an area where there was the family of Ran Gvili, a deceased hostage in Gaza. “They’re waiting for their son to come home. From Israel. Their son is a very brave soldier and that’s the only body.” His mother said they are going to bring her son home.

Trump’s other headache: After a hopeful meeting this weekend between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy where Trump declared a peace deal could be “very close,” Russia is once again throwing cold water on the prospect, POLITICO’s Eli Stokols and Diana Nerozzi write. The Kremlin vowed to turn up hostilities after an attack on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s property. The latest disagreement signals the sides remain far apart on peace, Eli and Diana write.

5. HEALTH OF A NATION: “Trump admin doles out billions for rural health,” by POLITICO’s Alice Miranda Ollstein and Ruth Reader: “The Trump administration on Monday doled out billions to states from a fund Congress created to ‘transform; rural health care. The funds, however, will be lavished more generously on small states and states that adopt administration friendly policies. … [CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz] said disbursements for states are between $145 million and $281 million for 2026, amounts largely driven by how large a state’s rural population is. … even fans of the program stress that it won’t come close to making up for the deep cuts to Medicaid that states are bracing for in 2026.”

The bigger picture: “Inside RFK Jr.’s reshaping of public health in Trump’s first year,” by WaPo’s Rachel Roubein and colleagues: “Interviews with almost 100 people reveal how Kennedy, as health secretary, has reshaped the vaccine and broader public health infrastructure in less than a year.”

6. 2026 WATCH: With current members of Congress weighing reelection, “the direction of travel is toward the door,” but there’s another growing trend: former members looking to come back, WaPo’s Anna Liss-Roy writes. At least 18 former members are jockeying to win back a seat. And the reaction from current lawmakers is telling: “I’ve had so many members ask me if I need a wellness check,” Ben McAdams said. “They’re like, ‘Cori, we love that you’re running again, but why would you want to come back? You’re free,’” Cori Bush told WaPo. For a running tally of all the retirees in Congress next year, AP has you covered.

Redistricting rodeo: The new maps approved in California made some districts more competitive for Democrats, and now they’re intensifying the Democratic Party’s civil war about which faction should carry its mantle — moderates or progressives, POLITICO’s Blake Jones reports. And in Rep. David Valadao’s (R-Calif.) district, NYC Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s team is crafting Democrat Randy Villegas’ media strategy and “going for the jugular.” … Next up, Utah’s state Republican lawmakers will appeal to the state’s Supreme Court which could determine the future of its maps, per Deseret News’ Brigham Tomco.

Happening tonight: Iowa’s special state Senate election. Should Republicans take the Democratic-leaning district, they’ll regain a supermajority and secure their control on state government, per AP.

7. LIVE FROM NEW YORK: “The Making of Mayor Mamdani,” by NY Mag’s David Freedlander: “Mamdani’s revolution, in this moment before he takes office, has two defining qualities. The first is the well-known movement-building skill of the man. …The second is a certain sense of unreality — a tension between what he promises he will do and what the normal laws of political physics would seem to allow. … The two qualities — the scintillating political skill and the strangeness of a 34-year-old democratic socialist just a few years removed from a music career taking control and pledging enormous changes without meaningful compromise — exist side by side, and how they resolve will define Mamdani’s mayoralty.”

8. IMMIGRATION FILES: A federal judge ruled yesterday that the Trump administration can move forward with sharing location data on undocumented immigrants receiving public health benefits with ICE officials, starting Jan. 6, POLITICO’s Tyler Katzenberger reports. The ruling is a victory for Trump’s push for mass deportations, and a significant setback for Califonia AG Rob Bonta and the Democratic attorneys general who sued back in July.

Deportation drive: “The Trump administration’s plan to close a ‘huge loophole’ in legal immigration,” by POLITICO’s Myah Ward and Eric Bazail-Eimil: “The Trump administration’s strategy was bolstered in October when the Justice Department’s Board of Immigration Appeals, an administrative body that oversees immigration courts, said judges should weigh third-country removal before an asylum case is considered in the U.S. … in November, DHS attorneys asked judges to dismiss nearly 5,000 cases, more than twice the amount in October and four times the amount in September … Immigration attorneys and advocates, alarmed by the latest trend, argue that it’s a further erosion of the U.S. asylum system in the United States.”

9. FED UP: “Trump Says He Still Might Fire Powell as Fed Chair Pick Looms,” by Bloomberg’s Josh Wingrove and Kate Sullivan: “[Trump] teased that he has a preferred candidate to be the next chair of the Federal Reserve, but is in no hurry to make an announcement — while also musing that he might fire the central bank’s current leader, Jerome Powell. … ‘Maybe I still might,’ Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. … Trump did not specify who is his leading chair candidate and said an announcement would be made in ‘January sometime.’”

TALK OF THE TOWN

IN MEMORIAM — “Joseph Hartzler Dies at 75; Led Prosecution of Oklahoma City Bomber,” by NYT’s Richard Sandomir: “Joseph Hartzler, who led the successful prosecution of Timothy McVeigh for the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, which killed 168 people and injured hundreds in the deadliest domestic terror attack in American history, died on Dec. 18 at his home in Chicago. He was 75.”

KENNEDY CENTER WOES — Yet another round of cancellations are hitting the Kennedy Center, as a jazz ensemble and a New York dance company set to perform on New Year’s Eve have pulled out of their performances, per NYT. Both were set to be featured at the New Year’s Eve concert at the center, but both acts said their decision was connected to the center’s recent name change to feature Donald Trump.

FIVE YEARS OF JAN. 6 — Democrats are preparing to sound the alarm again on the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 with a special hearing next week on its five-year anniversary, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries announced in a “dear colleague” letter, per POLITICO’s Nick Wu.

ICE told Fox News they're on the ground in Minneapolis investigating allegations of fraud involving child care centers, as authorities follow a sprawling money trail that federal prosecutors say could ultimately total more than $9 billion.

""We're learning a lot,"" ICE Director Todd Lyons told ""Fox & Friends"" on Tuesday.

Lyons shared that the agency is looking into possible criminal and terrorist ties overseas, adding that the probe speaks to the breadth of ICE's work.

""[We're] going with criminal warrants to conduct these investigations,"" he said.

""All too often you hear that ICE is just out there terrorizing the community or conducting administrative work. We've been on the ground in Minnesota conducting criminal investigations and Homeland Security investigations [and have] gone door to door to a lot of these suspected fraud sites all over St. Paul and Minnesota.""

The investigation follows widespread fraud allegations, including ones stemming from a viral video posted by independent journalist Nick Shirley showing visits to several Minnesota daycare facilities, including Quality Learning Center in Minneapolis, which appeared inactive during the visit despite receiving state childcare assistance funds.

Minnesota Department of Children, Youth and Families Commissioner Tikki Brown said during a Monday news conference that prior inspections of the sites – which occurred at random and within the last six months – did not uncover fraud and children were active at the sites.

Brown additionally acknowledged questions about the timing of the video visits, noting that regulators are seeking clarity on whether footage was recorded during operating hours or on days when centers were scheduled to be open.

""While we have questions about some of the methods that were used in the video, we do take the concerns that the video raises about fraud very seriously,"" she said.

A spokesperson for Gov. Tim Walz also addressed the swath of fraud allegations plaguing the state, saying, ""The governor has worked for years to crack down on fraud and asked the state legislator for more authority to take aggressive action. He has strengthened oversight.""

Lyons criticized Minnesota's policies, alleging that ""sanctuary"" jurisdictions allow bad actors to ""hide in plain sight"" and commit crimes.

""You see a lot of these fraudsters use a lot of the sanctuary rules and sanctuary protections to enact criminal fraud just like this,"" he said.

▪ Trump admin targets Minnesota

▪ Trump consumed with foreign policy

▪ U.S. strikes facility in Venezuela

▪ Iowa state Senate election

A fraud scandal plaguing Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) has drawn the ire of many Republicans and those in the Trump administration, The Hill’s Sarah Fortinsky reports. The state and its governor are facing national backlash following a viral video that made headlines showing a day care facility that appeared inactive despite receiving significant funding.

This comes amid an already launched investigation into the state’s safety net programs.

And on Monday, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem said she sent agents door to door at suspected fraud sites as part of the broader investigation launched earlier this month.

“DHS is on the ground in Minneapolis, going DOOR TO DOOR at suspected fraud sites. The American people deserve answers on how their taxpayer money is being used and ARRESTS when abuse is found,” readsa post from DHS’s account on social platform X.

The viral video, released Friday by independent journalist Nick Shirley, renewed scrutiny of the governor’s handling of widespread fraud occurring in some state-run programs, Fortinsky reports.

Many have sought to blame the Democratic governor for failing to sufficiently crack down on the issue, while Walz’s office has sought to defend the governor’s handling of the situation.

A spokesperson for the governor said they have “hired an outside firm to audit payments to high-risk programs, shut down the Housing Stabilization Services program entirely, announced a new statewide program integrity director, and supported criminal prosecutions.”

Walz has criticized the administration’s actions but has said consistently that anyone committing fraud should go to prison.

Additionally, Small Business Administration (SBA) Administrator Kelly Loeffler said Monday on X that she is pausing annual funding to Minnesota while the SBA investigates fraud.

Leading the Day

TRUMP’S YEAR-END POLICY FOCUS: Trumphas spent the last week of the year focused on foreign policy while residing at Mar-a-Lago, where he hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss ending the war with Russia and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss ongoing peace efforts in Gaza, disarming Hamas, strikes in Iran and an “understanding” regarding Syria.

He announced military strikes against ISIS in Nigeria on Christmas Day and revealed he targeted a Venezuelan facility on Dec. 26. This string of events at the end of the year underscores the president’s focus on foreign policy during his second term, The Hill’s Brett Samuels reports.

The president, now in his last term, is seeking to establish his legacy around the world as a dealmaker, and as a peacemaker.

▪ The Hill: Trump shows foreign policy focus to end 2025

NETANYAHU MEETING: Trump and Netanyahu on Monday were in lockstep during their after-meeting news conference, The Hill’s Filip Timotija and Colin Meyn report.

Trump said Israel had lived up to its ceasefire commitments “100 percent,” despite the U.S. reportedly scolding Netanyahu for killing a top Hamas military leader earlier this month.

A main focus was pressure on Hamas to disarm, with Trump saying the militant group would be “wiped out” if it refused to abide by its commitments in the second phase of the U.S.-brokered peace plan.

Trump also expressed support for U.S. strikes against Iran for Tehran’s purported extension of its ballistic missile program as well as for Israel’s potential military action against the country. Despite the language, he reiterated the U.S. is open to holding discussions with Tehran regarding its nuclear program.

The president also said he and Netanyahu have an “understanding regarding Syria,” adding that he was “sure” Israel and Syria’s new president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, would get along, Timotija and Meyn report.

Trump also discussed a potential pardon for Netanyahu’s fraud and bribery charges, saying that Israeli President Isaac Herzog was on board. Herzog denied that claim.

▪ The Hill: Trump backs Israeli strikes on Iran if ballistic missile tests continue.

With this year’s focus on foreign policy and solving international disputes, many of the president’s allies have said he is deserving of the Nobel Peace Prize, with Trump himself even quipping that he deserves it during an earlier meeting with Netanyahu.

But not everyone in the president’s party agrees with Trump’s foreign policy work, including Greene, who has said the president should be more focused on domestic issues. The Georgia Republican is an outlier, however, as she’s broken with the president publicly many times recently.

Polling has shown voters, too, have not necessarily rewarded Trump for his focus on foreign affairs.

A Quinnipiac University poll published earlier this month found Trump’s overall approval was at just 40 percent, while 54 percent of survey respondents disapprove. The poll found that 41 percent approved of his handling of foreign policy, compared with 54 percent who disapproved.

US ATTACKS FACILITY IN VENEZUELA: Few details are known about an attack that Trump has said “knocked out” a “big” facility in Venezuela as the administration continues to put pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

Trump said this during a Friday appearance on the “Cats & Cosby” show on New York’s WABC radio and lauded the attacks on purported drug-smuggling boats in the region, The Hill’s Filip Timotija reports.

“We just knocked out — I don’t know if you read or you saw — they have a big plant or big facility where they send the, you know, where the ships come from,” the president told hosts John Catsimatidis and Rita Cosby. “Two nights ago, we knocked that out. So we hit them very hard.”

On Monday, Trump shed some more light on the attack, saying the U.S. personnel hit an “implementation” area.

“We hit all the boats and now we hit the area, it’s the implementation area. That’s where they implement. And that is no longer around,” the president said at Mar-a-Lago while taking questions alongside Netanyahu.

Trump said there was a “major explosion in the dock area where they load the boats up with drugs,” adding it took place “along the shore.”

If confirmed, it would be the first land strike in Venezuela since the Trump administration began a pressure campaign against Maduro and since U.S. forces started striking alleged drug-trafficking boats in September.

ISSUES REMAIN IN UKRAINE PEACE TALKS: The president on Monday said thathe had spoken with Putin but that there were still “very thorny issues” to get through before solidifying a peace plan with Ukraine, Samuels reports.

Trump was expected to call the Russian leader following his Sunday meeting with Zelensky. And, though the exact details of which issues were the most difficult to negotiate with Putin are unclear, it is known that land ownership is a particular sticking point.

Additionally, Trump expressed frustration at Ukraine for claims from Russian officials saying that a Ukrainian drone attacked one of Putin’s residences, something Kyiv has denied, The Hill’s Ellen Mitchell reports.

“It’s one thing to be offensive. It’s another thing to attack his house. It’s not the right time to do any of that. … I was very angry about it,” Trump said, adding that he learned of the alleged attack during his call with Putin.

Also, following Sunday’s meeting to discuss the Ukrainian president’s 20-point peace plan, Zelensky said Monday that he asked Trump for the U.S. to commit to security guarantees for decades, and that Trump said he would consider it.

BIGGEST EDUCATION STORIES OF 2025: Education news in 2025 was dominated by Trump’s crusade against higher education and the U.S. Department of Education, The Hill’s Lexi Lonas Cochran reports. From the president consolidating his power over education institutions to immigration affecting K-12 students, here are just a few of the main education stories of the past year:

Trump dismantles Education Department

Since taking office Trump has singled out the Department of Education as something to get rid of. And Education Secretary Linda McMahon began the process in March when she laid off half the employees at the federal agency.

The president then signed an executive order ordering the department to be dismantled as much as legally possible.

“The department’s useful functions … will be preserved, fully preserved,” he said at the time, referring to Pell Grants, Title I funding and programs for students with disabilities. “They’re going to be preserved in full and redistributed to various other agencies and departments.”

Programs hit hardest include the Institute of Education Sciences, Federal Student Aid and the Office of Civil Rights, which recently brought back some employees because of case backlogs, Lonas Cochran reports.

Immigration crackdown

Trump has always had a firm line on immigration policy, but many students were still surprised to see so many international students with ties to pro-Palestinian campus movements arrested.

The administration has said these students are a threat to the foreign policy of the United States and that Secretary of State Marco Rubio could order their deportation.

The administration has added new rules for foreign students, most notably adding a check on students’ social media accounts when they apply for a visa.

As a result, the crackdown has led to a drop in international students’ interest in attending school in the U.S., and K-12 districts with high immigrant populations have seen a decline in attendance.

Student loan changes

Trump is handling student loan repayment much differently from former President Biden, who advanced new measures to reduce student loan debt.

Notably, the Trump administration recently announced the end of the Saving on Valuable Education (SAVE) income-driven repayment option, which is almost guaranteed to raise the rates for 7 million borrowers who will need a new plan.

Republicans’ massive spending package, which passed earlier this year, also included changes to the student loan system that will drop the number of repayment options to two by 2028. One option is a standard repayment plan expecting payment within 10 to 25 years, and the other is a plan that requires 30 years of loan payments before they are forgiven.

The administration has also said it wants to remove some employers from the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, as well.

Poor reading scores

Reading scores have been down since the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2025 was no different. Twelfth-grade reading scores from 2024 were at the lowest level since before 1992.

And at the beginning of the year, the Nation’s Report Card showed reading scores for fourth and eighth graders continued to plummet.

“These results are both heartbreaking and tragic,” Alicia Levi, president and CEO of Reading is Fundamental, said at the time. “We need to take action. … We are calling on, leaders from all sectors, public and private, to join us in this fight.”

But, as Lonas Cochran reports, the reading crisis is affecting older adults as well. A 2020 Gallup study found the reading crisis was costing the U.S. $2.2 trillion annually, with the problem likely getting worse over five years.

IOWA STATE SENATE ELECTION: Voters in Iowa will vote Tuesday in a special state Senate election that could allow Republicans to regain a supermajority in the upper chamber. The GOP already has one in the state House, but if they can win the West Des Moines-area seat formerly held by a Democrat, they can regain their tight grip on state government, The Hill’s Julia Mueller reports.

Republicans held a supermajority in the state Senate until Democrats broke it during an August special election, which added to national Democrats’ optimism during the 2025 off-year elections. Democrats in Iowa and at the national level are looking to hold on to current trends and keep their momentum going ahead of the 2026 midterms.

The race is between Renee Hardman (D) and Lucas Loftin (R), who are running against each other for the District 16 seat following the death of state Sen. Claire Celsi (D). Republicans currently enjoy a 33-16 seat advantage over Democrats in the state Senate, just one voting member shy of being able to override the governor’s veto outright.

Democrats won an August election to break the state Senate supermajority and have made Tuesday’s election a priority. And the odds are in their favor.

Celsi won the district by 16 percentage points against a Republican after redistricting in 2022 and went on to win reelection by 40 percentage points over a Libertarian Party competitor. Though Trump won Iowa last fall, then-Vice President Kamala Harris won the District 16 area by 17 percentage points.

Hardman, the first Black woman elected to the West Des Moines City Council, is currently the West Des Moines mayor pro tempore. Loftin, a political newcomer, is a longtime employee of an environmental services company and is active on boards related to homeschooling.

The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee has called the race a “must-win” to protect the party’s “hard-won progress” after Iowa marked the sixth time Democrats broke a state legislature GOP supermajority in the last two years.

Democrats have enjoyed a year of expected and unexpected wins and seek to continue the trend going into 2026.

The Closer

And finally … It’s time to add Gonzaga men’s basketball coach Mark Few to the list of people disappointed with the sport’s current situation.

Coaches across college sports have lodged complaints as student-athletes are now able to receive name, image and likeness (NIL) compensation and transfer multiple times without penalty, The Hill’s Max Rego reports.

Concerns came to a head last week when 21-year-old James Nnaji, a former NBA draft pick, committed to Baylor University and was given four years of eligibility by the NCAA.

“Our lack of leadership has really shown,” Few told reporters Sunday after his team beat Pepperdine University 96-56, according to The Spokesman-Review. “Now it’s probably time to get some help from Congress, but they’re more screwed up than the NCAA.”

Few added that leaders “need to start listening to coaches” on relevant topics.

Nnaji, who was the 31st pick in the 2023 NBA draft by the Detroit Pistons, has not played on an NBA or G League team. Instead, he has spent the past two-plus years playing professionally in Spain and coming to the U.S. to compete in the NBA Summer League, retaining his collegiate eligibility.

But Nnaji’s decision, and Baylor’s decision to put him on the team, has been met with condemnation by some coaches.

Michigan State University head coach Tom Izzo joined Few and slammed collegiate athletics leaders for allowing this to happen.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/Leading-Walz_120425_AP_Steve-Karnowski.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-30 18:12:24.363533

State Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit) says she is in contact with the mayor of the Detroit-adjacent community after reporting last week identified plans by the Trump administration to build large holding centers to speed up deportations.

Chang, who represents neighborhoods including those in Highland Park, said the community was on the list of potential cities where one of these warehouses would be built.

What they're saying:

""We know that a few days ago, there was an article in the Washington Post that listed out a number of cities across our whole country — places that are going to host huge detention centers, places that are going to hold smaller detention centers and Highland Park was on that list,"" said Chang.

The state senator told FOX 2's Roop Raj she had been in touch with the local state representative and mayor of the city in hopes of getting more answers about the plans.

""We were trying to figure out if this was accurate. I still don't have the answer to that question, but it has definitely raised the alarm,"" she said. ""None of us want an ICE detention center in Highland Park.""

She said residents have reached out to her office, saying they have no interest in a facility like the one allegedly proposed by ICE being brought to Highland Park.

The backstory:

Reporting in the Washington Post on Dec. 24 found efforts by the Trump administration to overhaul the country's immigrant detention center in favor of a plan that uses industrial warehouses that hold tens of thousands of immigrant detainees at a time.

The Post cited a ""draft solicitation"" that included plans for large warehouses in Virginia, Texas, Louisiana, Arizona, Georgia, and Missouri.

There are sixteen smaller proposed warehouses, including one in Highland Park, according to the Post's reporting. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security could not confirm the reporting.

FOX 2 has also reached out to the White House for comment, but has not heard back.

Dig deeper:

The Trump administration's push to ramp up deportations is part of the president's agenda that he outlined throughout his campaign.

Since taking office, the U.S. has seen its Immigration and Customs and Enforcement agency ramp up efforts at detaining immigrants in a bid to remove them from the country.

The Post cited reporting out of Arizona in which the agency's acting director advocated for treating deportations more like a business.

Under Trump, the Justice Department has filed at least six lawsuits challenging similar policies in Texas, Kentucky, Illinois, Oklahoma, Minnesota and California.","Dec 30 (Reuters) – The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit challenging a Virginia law that makes immigrants in the country illegally eligible for reduced in-state tuition and financial aid at the state’s public colleges and universities.

Monday’s lawsuit marked the latest in a campaign by U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration to challenge state laws that extend tuition and financial aid benefits to non-citizens living in their states regardless of their immigration status.

The lawsuit targets a Virginia law that has since 2022 allowed immigrants who entered the country unlawfully to access reduced, in-state tuition rates at public universities and colleges if they can establish they reside in the state.

Supporters of the measure, which was signed into law in 2021 by then-Governor Ralph Northam, a Democrat, argued it would remove financial barriers that had limited the ability of immigrant students in the state to pursue higher education like other Virginia residents.

The Justice Department argues the measure conflicts with federal immigration law in violation of the U.S. Constitution because it gives educational benefits to illegal immigrants that are denied to U.S. citizens from other states.

The lawsuit cites the federal Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, which restricts states’ ability to grant immigrants in the country illegally certain postsecondary education benefits.

“This is a simple matter of federal law: in Virginia and nationwide, schools cannot provide benefits to illegal aliens that they do not provide to U.S. citizens,” U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. “This Department of Justice will not tolerate American students being treated like second-class citizens in their own country.”

The Justice Department filed the lawsuit in Richmond federal court days before Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin leaves office and hands control to Democrat Abigail Spanberger. His office did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.

At least 21 other states and the District of Columbia have similar “tuition equity” laws and policies that allow certain students who graduated from high schools in their states to pay in-state tuition regardless of their immigration status, according to the National Immigration Law Center.

According to the immigrant rights group, 14 states, including Virginia, also provide state financial aid to eligible students regardless of their immigration status.

Under Trump, the Justice Department has filed at least six lawsuits challenging similar policies in Texas, Kentucky, Illinois, Oklahoma, Minnesota and California.

Texas and Oklahoma, both led by Republican governors, quickly settled by agreeing to consent decrees blocking enforcement of their state laws.

U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in California said in his ruling that the federal government can legally share ""basic biographical, location, and contact information"" with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The ruling will take effect on Jan. 6, according to court documents.

The development comes months after 20 states, including California, sued in July to prevent the federal government from sharing with ICE data obtained by the Department of Health and Human Services about immigrants receiving Medicaid benefits.

""We are disappointed in the court’s decision allowing for the sharing of some Medicaid data with ICE,"" said a statement from the office of California Attorney General Rob Bonta, one of the nearly two dozen Democratic officials who sued to block the information-sharing effort.

Chhabria noted in his ruling that while basic Medicaid information can be shared with ICE, the injunction still applies to other information, including data about immigrants legally in the country.

""Beyond the basic information discussed above, the policies are totally unclear and do not appear to be the product of a coherent decision making process,"" Chhabria wrote.

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the ruling was ""a victory for the rule of law and American taxpayers.""

Undocumented immigrants are largely ineligible for federal health benefits, and they do not qualify for comprehensive Medicaid coverage.

But some undocumented immigrants can receive treatment for life-saving procedures in emergency rooms through Emergency Medicaid, and some states – including California – allow people to receive other state-funded benefits regardless of their immigration status.

The Trump administration has pushed for agencies across the federal government to share more information with immigration authorities to power the president's deportation agenda. Judges have blocked several of those efforts.

In September, a federal judge in California temporarily blocked the U.S. Department of Agriculture from collecting data about recipients of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP.

It adds to legal challenges the Trump administration has filed against other states over similar policies that provide migrants access to in-state tuition and education benefits.

The architect of some of DHS’ most consequential immigration enforcement operations fired back at Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., after Swalwell posted a Christmas image depicting a helicopter and ICE agents converging on the Bethlehem crèche.

""May this be the last Christmas we live this nightmare,"" Swalwell captioned the image, which drew widespread backlash during the Twelve Days of Christmas.

""Yes, the last Christmas where un-American pedantic dolts choose illegal aliens over US Citizens,"" U.S. Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino responded, before following up by exchanging with others on social media.

Bovino then replied to a Florida woman who told Swalwell: ""Yes, the nightmare was [the] last four years prior letting in everyone and their grandma. Insane [a] congressman would post this.""

EXCLUSIVE: CATHOLIC BISHOPS CHIDED FOR SOWING ‘CONFUSION’ ON DEPORTATIONS STANCE

""Well said… Merry Christmas,"" Bovino said, adding he would follow her X account.

When another critic brought up Swalwell’s alleged relationship with a Chinese spy named Fang Fang — which the congressman denies – Bovino quipped, ""Oh yes, how could I forget to mention that.""

Other commentators slammed Swalwell for appearing to misstate the underlying facts of why Joseph and Mary had gone to Bethlehem and why they fled to Egypt soon after Jesus Christ’s birth — a storyline immigration activists sometimes use to counter pro-border security arguments.

DHS FIRES BACK AFTER DEM LAWMAKER CLAIMS SHE WAS 'PUSHED ASIDE AND PEPPER SPRAYED' DURING ICE RAID

One cited a passage from the Gospel of Luke, which recounts that Caesar Augustus ordered a census across the Roman Empire, requiring each man to return to his ancestral town. Joseph, a descendant of King David, therefore traveled from Nazareth to Bethlehem, David’s birthplace.

Per the Gospel of Matthew, an angel appeared to Joseph in a dream and told him to take his family and flee to Egypt, as King Herod was seeking to kill young Jesus.

Observers often debate the connection, if any, that biblical passages have to contemporary immigration policy arguments.

Immigration hawks often cite Egypt as being a province of the Roman Empire, meaning the Holy Family did not immigrate to another country as refugees in a legal sense, but to escape Herod’s rule as a provincial king installed by Rome; similar to a governor; until his death made it safe to return to Judea.

Others dispute that characterization.

ICE DELIVERS 'GREATEST GIFT OF ALL' WITH CHRISTMAS ARRESTS OF CONVICTED CRIMINALS ACROSS MULTIPLE STATES

""Eric – Mary and Joseph were legal immigrants complying with the rules of the Roman Empire,"" conservative activist Robby Starbuck responded to the congressman.

""Rome ordered a census and Joseph had to be counted because Bethlehem was his city; basically the opposite of illegal immigration. Lying about this is Christophobic,"" he said.

Starbuck added that in the Book of Acts, God ""marked out … boundaries of their lands,"" which the commentator said was proof that secure borders have scriptural grounding.

U.S. District Judge Angel Kelley’s order does not reflect the underlying legal merits. It is intended to ensure the migrants can remain in the country until the judge considers the case more fully.

“Because of the serious consequences at stake, both for the Plaintiffs and the Defendants, the Court finds an administrative stay appropriate, as it would ‘minimize harm,’ while allowing the assigned District Court Judge the time this case deserves,” Kelley wrote in her four-page ruling.

The judge will issue a new decision after receiving written briefing through Jan. 13.

Temporary Protected Status (TPS) allows migrants to stay in the U.S. and receive work authorization when they are from a country experiencing armed conflict, environmental disaster or other extraordinary conditions.

South Sudan was first designated for the program in 2011 as it gained its independence and became Africa’s youngest country. It has been plagued with war, and a State Department advisory urges Americans to avoid travel to the country.

Roughly 232 South Sudanese are currently TPS recipients, court filings indicate.

President Trump’s second administration has looked to shrink the program by revoking various countries’ TPS designations. Lawsuits remain ongoing over changes to the program regarding Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Myanmar, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria and Venezuela.

Last month, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced she had conducted a review of conditions in South Sudan and the administration was terminating the country’s TPS status after Jan. 5.

It sparked a lawsuit from individual South Sudanese TPS holders and African Communities Together, an immigrant rights organization. They claim Noem acted unlawfully by acting with racial animus against nonwhite immigrants, failing to consult with appropriate agencies and not having good reason for the decision.

Kelley, an appointee of former President Biden who serves in Boston, will consider those arguments next month. But her ruling keeps TPS in place in the meantime, ensuring recipients do not become eligible for deportation as early as next Tuesday.

The plaintiffs pleaded with the judge for the immediate intervention, warning they will otherwise face “irreparable harm, including deadly harm.”

The Trump administration urged the judge to deny the request, criticizing the plaintiffs for waiting more than six weeks after Noem’s announcement to sue and insisting an administrative stay should only serve to briefly freeze legal proceedings.

“It should not serve to directly enjoin Executive agency action, which is what Plaintiffs’ requested administrative stay would accomplish,” the Justice Department wrote in court filings Monday.

The judge rejected those arguments. She wrote that the government’s proposed approach could imminently result in some individuals’ deportations.

“Further, if their TPS expires and is eventually restored following a full consideration of the merits, any gap in immigration status for South Sudanese nationals could result in ineligibility for future relief,” Kelley wrote.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/AP25310446835020-e1767108543803.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-30 11:58:52.879418

By Darmin Bachu

TiE New York has formally responded in court to the lawsuit brought by charter member Kesav Dama, arguing that the case reflects an internal dispute rather than actionable misconduct and urging the court to allow the organization’s governance activities to proceed uninterrupted.

The response, filed as an opposition to an Order to Show Cause, marks the first detailed public articulation of TiE New York’s position since the litigation became public — after multiple board members, including former president Jignesh Patel and secretary Vaibhav Parikh, declined to comment for prior reporting.

At the center of the latest development is the court’s interim ruling lifting a previously issued temporary restraining order that had briefly restricted certain TiE New York governance actions.

Justice Karina E. Alomar of Queens County Supreme Court declined to extend the TRO after reviewing the parties’ submissions, allowing TiE New York to resume routine operations while the broader lawsuit continues. The ruling does not dismiss the case or resolve the merits of the allegations, but it signals that the court was not prepared—at this preliminary stage—to impose emergency restraints on the organization’s leadership.

Legal analysts note that lifting a TRO is procedurally significant but not dispositive. “It reflects the judge’s assessment that immediate irreparable harm was not sufficiently established for interim relief,” said one nonprofit litigation attorney familiar with similar cases. “It does not mean the underlying claims lack substance.”

TiE NY’s argument

In its opposition papers, TiE New York and the individual defendants characterize the lawsuit as an attempt to judicialize an internal governance disagreement. The filing argues that:

The board followed established procedures in addressing complaints;

An internal subcommittee was formed to review the allegations;

No emergency circumstances justified court-imposed restraints on elections, finances, or leadership decisions; and

The plaintiff failed to demonstrate irreparable harm warranting extraordinary relief.

DefendantsOppositionToShowCause

The defendants further contend that granting the requested relief would improperly interfere with the autonomy of a New York not-for-profit corporation and set a precedent for courts to manage internal disputes better handled through organizational processes.

As part of TiE New York’s response, former president Jignesh Patel submitted a sworn affidavit denying allegations of threats, intimidation, or abuse of authority. Patel asserts that communications cited in the complaint were taken out of context and that his actions were consistent with his duties as an officer of the organization.

The affidavit also challenges the plaintiff’s credibility and motivations, framing the dispute as a reaction to disagreements over governance and decision-making rather than misconduct.

TiE New York’s filings rely heavily on a report prepared by a board-appointed subcommittee, which concluded that the complaints did not warrant disciplinary action against Patel. The report describes interviews, document review, and deliberations undertaken by select board members tasked with evaluating the allegations.

Critics, however, have questioned the independence of the subcommittee, noting that its members were drawn from the same board accused in the lawsuit of failing to act. Those concerns are likely to feature prominently as the litigation proceeds.

Despite filing extensive court papers, TiE New York leadership has not offered on-the-record comment to the press. Patel, Parikh, and other board members again declined to respond to questions for this follow-up article, referring inquiries to court filings or offering no response at all.

The absence of public explanation has drawn criticism from some members, who argue that transparency is particularly important for a nonprofit organization that positions itself as a steward of ethical leadership and entrepreneurship.

What the ruling does — and does not — resolve

The lifting of the TRO allows TiE New York to continue operations, including governance and administrative functions, while the case advances through motion practice and potential discovery. It does not resolve:

Whether fiduciary duties were breached;

Whether the board acted in good faith in responding to complaints;

Whether internal processes were adequate or conflicted; or

Whether damages or injunctive relief may ultimately be warranted.

Those questions remain before the court.

With emergency relief denied but the lawsuit intact, the case now enters a more conventional litigation phase. Observers expect motions to dismiss, possible document discovery, and further judicial scrutiny of board conduct.

For TiE New York, the immediate operational threat may have eased, but the reputational and legal challenges persist. As one nonprofit governance expert noted, “A lifted TRO buys time—but it doesn’t end the conversation. In many ways, it just begins the real examination.”

The People's Power Assembly (PPA) organized the protest in direct response to the ICE officer shooting that happened in Glen Burnie on Christmas Eve. In that incident, ICE maintains its officers only acted in self-defense.

While one of the protesters' goal was to raise awareness of ICE's activity locally, PPA organizers told WJZ they want to pressure state leaders to act.

Calling for an end to ICE enforcement

Protesters gathered on the corner of Hopkins Place and Baltimore Street, which is near where the ICE Baltimore Field Office, holding signs and calling for ICE to be abolished.

They chanted, ""ICE out of Baltimore! ICE out of Maryland!""

""All they had on the [people involved in Glen Burnie] was they were suspected of being [undocumented] immigrants. We reject that,"" said PPA organizer Andrew Mayton.

In a statement, ICE said officers shot Tiago Alexandre Sousa-Martins -- who the agency says is an undocumented Portuguese immigrant -- when Sousa-Martins tried to ram other vehicles and the officers.

ICE said the officers first tried to get him to turn off the engine, which he refused to do. Solomon Antonio Serrano-Esquival, who ICE has identified as a Salvadoran undocumented immigrant, was in the passenger seat with Sousa-Martins.

PPA organizers hopes Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and other state lawmakers move to ban cooperation agreements some counties have with ICE, as well as 287(g) agreements.

287(g) agreements are where ICE gives local law enforcement the authority to perform some immigration officer enforcement duties.

A bill to ban 287(g) agreements failed to reach Gov. Moore's desk in the 2025 legislative session, but several lawmakers have expressed interest in introducing another similar bill in the upcoming session.

""ICE is its own department, there is no other kinds of collaborative efforts similar to this. All it does is put communities in danger,"" Mayton said.

WJZ reached out to ICE for any updates to the investigation into the Christmas Eve shooting, but didn't hear back. ICE issued a statement on the day of the shooting that called on ""extremist rhetoric"" against the agency to stop.

""The incident, which is still under investigation, comes as the extremist anti-ICE rhetoric and outright lies of politicians, the news media, activists, and violent agitators continue to fuel a more than 1,150% increase in assaults against ICE officers,"" the agency said.

Sousa-Martins and Serrano-Esquival were taken to area hospitals and, at last check, are stable.

Local ICE activity

The Christmas Eve shooting is one of the latest local showings of President Trump's ramped up immigration enforcement.

Another recent case making headlines is the detainment of 22-year-old Dulce Consuelo Morales Diaz. She was taken into ICE custody when she was on her way home from a Taco Bell in Baltimore, despite saying she's a U.S. citizen.

Her lawyer, Victoria Slatton, has gone viral for her TikToks about Morales Diaz. She posted a TikTok Sunday reporting Morales Diaz has been transported to a third detention facility. She'd previously been detained in Louisiana and Texas.

Slatton has said she has Morales Diaz's birth certificate, immunization records, and other documentation proving her client's U.S. citizenship. The government has maintained Morales Diaz is an undocumented immigrant, and that she claimed to be a Mexican citizen to border patrol when she was at the Arizona-Mexico border in 2023.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/12/29/99d2e872-3ba8-4afa-a7fc-2d5889e10d95/thumbnail/1200x630/3ed72be8a269e18668e2183df3ca9567/iceprotest.png,N,,2025-12-30 11:59:07.701148

Driving the news: U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria, a California-based Obama appointee, said in his Monday order that sharing basic biographical, location and contact information is ""clearly authorized by law.""

However, he strictly limited what kinds of data could be shared.

The Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services can provide citizenship and immigration status, address, phone number, date of birth and Medicaid ID for those illegally living in the United States.

Chhabria did block broader data sharing, writing that ""the new policies are totally unclear about what that information would be, why it would be needed for immigration enforcement purposes, and what the risks of sharing it with DHS would be.""

State of play: Chhabria pointed to government filings outlining the policy and legal background on such information sharing, including one that said CMS would provide ICE the ""minimum required information.""

But that policy said CMS may share other information beyond immigration status, location and phone numbers ""on a case-by-case basis as permitted by law.""

Chhabria wrote that many questions remain and that the memos fail to address ""why a more narrowly tailored policy, focused on the basic biographical information discussed above, would not suffice for immigration enforcement purposes.""

Catch up quick: The judge blocked the Trump administration in August from using the information for immigration enforcement purposes, finding a ""reasoned decisionmaking process"" did not precede the policy change.

That prior preliminary injunction will remain in place until next Monday.

Julian “Vicente” Ortiz Velazquez was taken into custody on Nov. 4 after leaving the Lowe’s parking lot in Puyallup with a truck full of lumber. His wife, Shauna, said unmarked vehicles surrounded him as he pulled onto South Fruitland.

“They started asking him about his legal status,” Shauna said. “And he said, ‘I have the right to remain silent, can you please tell me why you’re detaining, what did I do wrong?’”

Two days before Christmas, video captured the moment his family embraced him for the first time in more than two months. A federal judge had ruled he should be released from custody while his case continues.

“Every day you just sit in there and think about how your family is surviving on the outside,” Shauna said, translating what her husband said. “When you’re the main source of income…it feels like every day is an eternity.”

In a statement to KING 5, ICE said:

“ICE arrested Julian Ortiz Velazquez Nov. 4 because he is in the United States illegally in violation of federal law as written by Congress. He has been returned to Mexico on three separate occasions in 2021 and will be detained at an ICE detention facility pending immigration proceedings and will be afforded due process before a federal immigration judge.”

Shauna said Vicente does not have a criminal history and was working to obtain legal status — both through an asylum claim and through his marriage to her. The couple has been married for three years, and she is a U.S. citizen.

Despite his release, Vicente now wears an ankle monitor and is restricted from leaving the state.

“It’s not necessarily house arrest — he can go anywhere he wants, just can’t leave the state,” Shauna said.

His arrest comes amid reports that top Trump officials have encouraged ICE to increase arrest numbers by targeting places like Home Depot, Lowe’s and 7-Eleven — locations where day laborers often gather.

The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump adviser Stephen Miller directed agents to “just go out there and arrest illegal aliens” and specifically suggested big-box retail locations.

KING 5 also witnessed ICE agents arrest another father outside a Home Depot in Redmond in October.

Shauna describes her husband as hardworking and devoted.

“He would literally give someone his shirt off his back to make sure they weren’t cold,” she said back in November.

Their daughter said losing him so suddenly has been painful.

“I never thought the whole father-daughter relationship…was something I was going to get, and he made it possible for me,” Alexandrea Ortiz said.

Deploying National Guard

One of the most prominent cases involved the topic of deploying the National Guard to Portland.

In September, President Donald Trump described Portland as ""war ravaged"" in a social media post, following protests outside the Portland Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility.

Less than 24 hours after President Donald Trump announced he was sending troops to Portland, protesters and ICE agents came face to face with minor clashes. KATU witnessed one get detained by officers.

The state of Oregon filed a lawsuit, arguing that the president lacked the authority to invoke Title 10 and deploy the National Guard without proving a rebellion, invasion, or inability to enforce federal law.

Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and the president had a tense text message exchange over his invoking of Title 10 and authorizing the troops to go to Portland.

Judges ultimately sided with Oregon, ruling that the protests did not meet these criteria. The Trump administration appealed the decision, until a judge permanently blocked the deployment in early November.

Gender-affirming care penalties

Another high-profile case saw Oregon Attorney General Rayfield suing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services over Secretary RFK Jr.'s declaration that providers could be barred from Medicaid if they allowed gender-affirming care for children.

Rayfield contends that RFK Jr. lacks the authority to define professional standards of care. The case is ongoing.

Imposing tariffs

Other states also joined Oregon in challenging President Trump's tariffs, including a 145% tariff on most Chinese products.

Experts estimated these tariffs could increase the cost of living for Oregonians by about $4,000 annually.

Rayfield argued that only Congress has the authority to impose taxes and tariffs, as outlined in Article 1 of the Constitution. The federal court sided with Rayfield, but the Trump administration has since appealed.

Federal funds

Earlier this year, Oregon sued the Trump administration over the freezing of federal funds.

The administration had announced a freeze to audit overspending, affecting nonprofits working on social issues like domestic violence.

The court ruled in favor of Oregon, stating that the president could not impose new conditions on already awarded funding.

SNAP data

In the summer of this year, Rayfield and Wash. Attorney General Nick Brown were among AGs from 20 other states suing the Trump administration over its efforts to obtain data from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP.

According to the lawsuit, the U.S. Department of Agriculture was improperly attempting to gather sensitive personal information from low-income families who use food stamps. The requested information included Social Security numbers and home addresses.

In December, a federal judge in Oregon temporarily blocked the Trump administration from fining states millions of dollars over their implementation of SNAP under new federal government guidelines.

Around that time, the Trump administration reversed its guidance, saying that noncitizens living in the country legally remained eligible for the food assistance program.

The guidance included refugees, asylum seekers and permanent residents, also known as 'green card"" holders.

That order, however, is temporary and prohibits the administration from penalizing the states as the states’ lawsuit is considered by the courts.

Alliance San Diego has been seeking justice for Hernández and his family ever since he was killed.
“Anastasio was a long-time resident of San Diego.
“Anastasio was tragically tortured, beaten, kicked, stomped, and killed by border agents,” Guerrero said.

The film is called “Critical Incident: Death at the Border,” which details accounts of the Border Patrol’s involvement in Hernández’s death and the ensuing investigation, which has been described as a “cover up” by Andrea Guerrero, executive director of Alliance San Diego, a human rights advocacy group.

Alliance San Diego has been seeking justice for Hernández and his family ever since he was killed.

“Anastasio was a long-time resident of San Diego. He had a wife, five U.S. citizen children born here and was a member of the community,” Guerrero said.

Hernández encountered the Border Patrol agents after trying to enter the country illegally; he had been deported days prior to the incident.

“Anastasio was tragically tortured, beaten, kicked, stomped, and killed by border agents,” Guerrero said. “Unfortunately, that was only the first part of the story — the second part was the cover-up.”

According to Guerrero, the Critical Incident Team that was sent to investigate Hernández’s death tried to exonerate U.S. Customs and Border Protection along with the agents involved of any civil and criminal liability.

“After he died, after he stopped breathing, they went up onto the pedestrian bridge and took the video cameras off and they erased those videos,” Guerrero said. “They also cleared the crime scene of any evidence … then they went to the hospital and removed all the Taser wires. … They were shadow units, they were cover-up units clear and simple.”

Guerrero stated they came across the investigation results while researching legal measures against the agents and discovered these criminal incident teams had been involved in other border-related incidents over many years.

In 2022, CBP disbanded the Critical Incident Teams, and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights held a hearing on the Hernandez-Rojas case, ultimately calling for the reopening of the matter while recognizing that Hernández’s human rights had been violated.

“The HBO documentary is so timely because it exposes what unchecked power looks like at the largest law enforcement agency in the country and it reminds us what the consequences are,” said Guerrero.

HBO reached out to Alliance San Diego a few years ago about conducting its own investigation, according to Guerrero.

“That’s not just a documentary, but it’s also investigative journalism,” Guerrero said.

Neither CBP nor Border Patrol provided comment about the HBO film, which began airing on Monday.

In May 2024, the U.S. Office of Government Accountability Office issued a report stating that the units “were widespread — used in seven of nine U.S. Border Patrol sectors, including San Diego, on the southwest border — and operated for years with little to no oversight.” The GAO’s report suggested that CBP take additional steps to strengthen its response to incidents involving its personnel.

In response to the 2024 GAO report, CBP issued a statement saying in part: “CBP continually evaluates and improves upon its policies, practices, and procedures to ensure they are consistent with the law, and adhere to the highest standards. CBP has made tremendous strides improving oversight and training, and in reducing incidents involving the use of force.”",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/12/cit-hbo.png?w=1280,N,,2025-12-30 11:59:03.790817

“Beyond the basic information discussed above, the policies are totally unclear and do not appear to be the product of a coherent decisionmaking process,” he wrote.

The previous ruling that barred sharing information will be in effect until next Monday, which was its previous expiration date, ""solely for administrative purposes,"" Monday's ruling says.","A federal judge in California ruled Monday that the federal government is allowed to share basic information about Medicaid participants with Immigration and Customs Enforcement amid a government push to locate people it believes are in the country unlawfully.

The plan to share information from the federally backed program had been blocked by a preliminary injunction that applied to 20 states that sued, including California.

U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria partly denied the states' request for a preliminary injunction Monday, writing that “basic biographical, location, and contact information” is legal under the law.

But he also granted the injunction as it pertains to any information beyond that.

“We are disappointed in the court’s decision allowing for the sharing of some Medicaid data with ICE,” the office of California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement Monday.

“Though we are gratified that the court enjoined DHS’s broader efforts to obtain more sensitive health data; data of citizens, lawful permanent residents, and other people with lawful status; and data from other CMS administered health programs,” Bonta’s office said, referring to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

Monday's order notes that the Medicaid services agency, CMS, has said in a notice that it ""will share the minimum required information,” such as “citizenship and immigration status, location, and phone numbers.”

Immigrants unlawfully in the United States are largely not eligible for Medicaid.

All states are required to offer emergency Medicaid — temporary coverage that pays only for lifesaving services in emergency rooms — to anyone, regardless of immigration status.

Emergency Medicaid spending accounts for less than 1% of the program’s expenses, according to a study published in October in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

Chhabria's order notes that basic information is something that the Department of Homeland Security, the agency that governs ICE, has always had the authority to request.

Chhabria also said in his partial order that there are many unanswered questions.

“Beyond the basic information discussed above, the policies are totally unclear and do not appear to be the product of a coherent decisionmaking process,” he wrote.

His order grants a preliminary injunction against sharing information of broader categories.

Chhabria cited questions about whether DHS may request information about lawful citizens or lawful permanent residents, including in mixed households in which some are lawfully in the country and others are not.

“The new policies are totally unclear about what that information would be, why it would be needed for immigration enforcement purposes, and what the risks of sharing it with DHS would be,” he wrote.

Medicaid is a federal and state joint program that has about 79 million enrollees across the country. In California, it is called Medi-Cal.

The California attorney general’s office said Monday that participants expected privacy.

“When individuals signed up for Medi-Cal, they did so with the understanding that their data would not be used for purposes unrelated to administering the program,” it said.

CMS has long had a policy of not sharing data about Medicaid patients with ICE, and since at least 2013, ICE has had a policy of not using that data for immigration enforcement, Chhabria wrote in a ruling in August.

But in June, CMS began sharing data about Medicaid patients with ICE, and in July, CMS and ICE ""entered into a formal data-sharing agreement,"" Chhabria wrote in background about the case.

The lawsuit was against the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Homeland Security and others.

Those agencies did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday evening.

The previous ruling that barred sharing information will be in effect until next Monday, which was its previous expiration date, ""solely for administrative purposes,"" Monday's ruling says.

The court has set a hearing for Friday, if necessary, according to court documents.

Contributing Writers

Federal agents fanned out in Minneapolis on Monday for a “massive investigation on child care and other rampant fraud,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said.

Noem posted the update about U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions on X and said “more coming.”

The post shows agents wearing jackets with large white letters, “HSI,” for Homeland Security Investigations, which is part of ICE — interviewing people at storefronts.

Homeland Security posted a separate notice saying that agents were “going DOOR TO DOOR at suspected fraud sites.”

“The American people deserve answers on how their taxpayer money is being used and ARRESTS when abuse is found. Under the leadership of @Sec_Noem, DHS is working to deliver results,” a Monday X post said.

About $9 billion has been lost to fraudulent claims in Minnesota’s federal-assistance programs, federal authorities have estimated. Dozens of people have been arrested, charged and convicted since 2022 in at least three major scandals, with more arrests expected as additional scandals are probed, federal prosecutors have said.

In other recent action, the Small Business Administration announced it was cutting off $5.5 million in federal funds because Minnesota state officials haven’t effectively safeguarded federal tax dollars, said Kelly Loeffler, the head of the agency.

Although the scandals are now drawing national attention, concerns over programs being defrauded on a large scale date back to at least 2018. Some whistleblowers raised alarms as early as 2009.

Minnesotans said that contributing factors include the state’s generous, progressive social-welfare policies, lax enforcement, and the “Minnesota Nice” attitude: A willingness to help others with few questions asked.

In addition, whistleblowers said they were reluctant to come forward because they suffered retaliation and claims of “racism” or “Islamophobia” for reporting allegations against Somali immigrants, who are Black and Muslim.

Patel: FBI Surged Resources to Minnesota Early in Investigation

FBI Director Kash Patel on Sunday confirmed that his office had surged resources to Minnesota to investigate claims of fraud exploiting federal services and programs.

Federal officials have so far indicted 78 people and convicted 57 individuals in a $250 million fraud scheme in Minnesota, Patel said in a post on X. Charges included wire fraud, money laundering, conspiracy and more.

“The FBI is aware of recent social media reports in Minnesota,” Patel wrote. “However, even before the public conversation escalated online, the FBI had surged personnel and investigative resources to Minnesota to dismantle large-scale fraud schemes exploiting federal programs. Fraud that steals from taxpayers and robs vulnerable children will remain a top FBI priority in Minnesota and nationwide.”

The FBI director also said that the recent arrests are “just the tip of a very large iceberg.”

“We will continue to follow the money and protect children, and this investigation very much remains ongoing. Furthermore, many are also being referred to [immigration] officials for possible further denaturalization and deportation proceedings where eligible.”

The fraud scheme, Patel wrote, resulted in the stealing of “federal food aid meant for vulnerable children during COVID” including “sham vendors, shell companies, and large-scale money laundering tied to the Feeding Our Future network.”

“These criminals didn’t just [engage] in historic fraud, but tried to subvert justice as well,” he said.

Patel noted a case in which a defendant and others have been “charged for attempting to bribe a juror with $120,000 in cash.”

“Those responsible pleaded guilty and were sentenced, including a 10-year prison term and nearly $48 million in restitution in related cases,” he said.

The FBI chief’s announcement was made after a viral video posted online showed a day care in Minneapolis that allegedly obtained millions of state-backed funding, even though it was largely inactive. Some Republican lawmakers, including Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., called for Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s office to investigate.

Vice President JD Vance called the fraud allegations in the state “a microcosm of the immigration fraud in our system.”

“Politicians like it because they get power. Welfare cheats like it because they get rich,” Vance wrote on X on Saturday. “But it’s a zero sum game, and they’re stealing both money and political power from Minnesotans.”

Joe Thompson, first assistant U.S. attorney, told reporters earlier this month that the scale of fraud in Minnesota-run programs is astronomically high. Fraud was found in programs involving services such as child nutrition, housing services, and autism, he said.

“I’m sure everyone is wondering how much of this $18 billion was fraud,” Thompson told reporters. “That’s the $18 billion question.”

In response to the investigations, Walz in October ordered a third-party audit and paused payments to the 14 programs for 90 days. One program has since been shut down entirely. Walz says the state aggressively increased resources for fraud detection and prevention and recently appointed a statewide director of program integrity to oversee those efforts.

Aside from Patel’s statement, the White House has sounded the alarm for fraud among Minnesota’s Somali community. On Thanksgiving, President Donald Trump described the state as “a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity” and noted that he was terminating Temporary Protected Status for Somalis in Minnesota.

Walz has been critical of Trump and the White House’s statements about Somalis in his state, saying in an NBC interview in late November that administration officials are “demonizing an entire community.”

The county’s seen numerous deportation operations kick off throughout the region since June, raising a host of concerns from some residents, local officials, state legislators and congressional representatives.

A series of protests kicked off shortly after the raids began in June, with protestors railing against ICE sweeps in downtown Santa Ana, near the federal buildings.

Not long after that, the National Guard came to town and were posted by federal buildings in Santa Ana, including the Ronald Reagan federal courthouse.

The raids have also spurred the cities of Anaheim, Costa Mesa and Santa Ana to roll out immigrant aid funds for people impacted by ICE raids – helping with things like legal representation and rent payments.

Some local elected officials throughout OC warned that creating such immigrant aid programs could jeopardize critical federal funding for things like housing assistance.

Other city council members called on their local police departments to work with ICE, with the Huntington Beach City Council voting to disregard state law and direct officers to assist in deportation efforts.

While the roving deportation tactics were temporarily put on hold by a federal judge, a majority of U.S. Supreme Court Justices ultimately blocked that restraining order as the lawsuit plays out in lower court.

Who Got Caught Up in ICE Sweeps?

Beginning in early June, federal agents began detaining people throughout the county – from courthouses to Home Depots.

[Read: Orange County Braces For ICE]

“We all I guess were under the impression that the presence of ICE was going to be to target dangerous, violent criminals. But what we’re seeing, and what I woke up to yesterday, were day laborers looking for work that were being detained, tackled with excessive force by Homeland Security officers and ICE,” Orange County Supervisor Vicente Sarmiento said at a June 10 county supervisors’ meeting.

The deportation efforts also reached neighborhoods, like in Santa Ana and Irvine.

Shortly after the raids kicked off, Congressman Lou Correa (D-Santa Ana) criticized federal agents for not going after criminals.

“From what I saw, I don’t believe those are serious violent criminals,” Correa said at a June news conference . “I saw a couple individuals that looked like they got pulled off a job painting somewhere.”

“Why did you pick up working individuals? They’re not violent serious criminals to my knowledge,” he said.

In the coming months, immigrant advocates and volunteers have told Voice of OC that federal officials restructured immigration policies, turning once documented immigrants into undocumented immigrants.

“It’s not criminals, it’s the most vulnerable of the immigrant population that are being made undocumented. Immigration has their information because they’re applying, they’re trying to do it the right way and they’re being targeted,” said volunteer and a federally accredited immigration legal representative, Bethany Anderson, in a late October interview.

Officials with the Department of Homeland Security repeatedly told Voice of OC throughout the year that agents have done their due diligence and have conducted “highly targeted” deportation enforcement.

According to data from the Department of Homeland Security, a large majority of the over 5,700 people in ICE detention facilities throughout California are considered “no ICE threat.”

As of Nov. 28 – the latest available data – 67% of the people in ICE facilities are “no ICE threat” while 33% are considered ICE threats.

One Orange County case made national news after federal agents violently arrested Narciso Barranco, a 48-year-old Tustin landscaper who’s a father of three U.S. Marines.

It kicked off a series of protests, vigils and calls for immigrant aid programs.

[Read: Tustin Landscaper Violently Arrested in Deportation Sweeps Says Hope Lives]

Barranco, who was arrested in Santa Ana in June, has since been released and is working his way through the immigration system.

His son, Marine veteran Alejandro Barranco, testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Border Security and Immigration in July.

“My father is a human being but was not treated with the dignity he deserves. He has always made sure to do his best in giving back and supporting this country like we all do. That is who he is – that is who this country punched, threw in detention and is trying to deport,” Alejandro Barranco told the committee.

“I am here today because I want other people who have had family members like my dad taken away to know they’re not alone. Thousands of families like ours are being ripped apart and their stories matter. I want this committee to understand the human impact of the immigration policies

A Wave of Protests

A wave of protests began June 9 – the same day deportation sweeps kicked off – in Downtown Santa Ana, the heart of Orange County.

In the coming days, thousands of demonstrators railed against ICE raids and called on elected officials to take stands against the operations.

But concerns immediately began surfacing on how local police departments responded to the protests, namely in Santa Ana.

It spurred Santa Ana City Councilman Johnathan Hernandez to ask for a public accounting of how police officers responded, including information like what types of non-lethal rounds were used and how many times such tactics were deployed.

The protestors also focused on Mayor Valerie Amezcua, who was largely silent on the ICE raids in June.

[Read: Santa Ana’s Response to ICE Protests Prompt Questions for Police & Mayor]

At a June city council meeting, numerous residents sounded off at the public podium – criticizing the city’s response to the raids.

[Read: Santa Ana Residents Demand Mayor Resign, Citing Weak Response to ICE Raids, Protests]

During a November police oversight commission meeting, Santa Ana Police Department officials said the response was textbook and that officers targeted bad actors among the protestors.

Yet many who were at those protests, like Hernandez, dispute that characterization of events.

There were also large-scale demonstrations in Anaheim and Santa Ana – as part of the nationwide “No Kings” protests – where a diverse group of residents voiced numerous concerns against federal policies, especially the ICE raids.

In June, thousands of people gathered at Anaheim’s La Palma Park for the “No Kings” protest.

And in October, thousands gathered in Santa Ana’s Centennial Park to rail against deportation sweeps and other federal policies, like cuts to food stamps.

ICE Sweeps Spur Immigrant Aid

The raids spurred a roundtable of state legislators and community organization leaders over the summer, when Assemblymembers Sharon Quirk-Silva (D-Fullerton) and Avelino Valencia (D-Anaheim) detailed how much the raids were impacting Orange County’s local economy.

[Read: Orange County Feels Economic Fallout of ICE Raids]

The community organizations also told the state legislators they needed resources from the state so they could continue helping people impacted by the deportation sweeps.

Recently, Valencia announced state legislators carved out a $1.5 million state grant to Catholic Charities OC in an effort to get more legal resources for the immigrant community and help people become legal residents and citizens.

[Read: More OC Immigrants Could Get Citizenship, Visas Under $1.5 Million State Grant]

In the meantime, the cities of Anaheim, Costa Mesa and Santa Ana created immigrant aid funds for their residents – helping people with things like groceries, rent and legal assistance at a time when many are too frightened to go to work or the grocery store.

[Read: Immigration Legal Aid Funds Grow in Orange County]

OC Supervisor Sarmiento and various community organizations also helped establish a $1.5 million fund aimed at helping people through the immigration legal system.

Like Correa, Sarmiento said that President Donald Trump’s administration hasn’t been targeting criminals like what federal officials promised early in the year.

“You have now Homeland Security, Border Patrol and ICE officers staged at some of the immigration courts throughout Southern California and here in Santa Ana, which I’ve personally seen, that are ready to detain immediately after a summary dismissal,” Sarmiento said in a September phone interview.

A Flashpoint in Garden Grove

Orange County saw one of the most thorough debates on the deportation sweeps at a Garden Grove City Council meeting in October as officials there considered a resource webpage for residents – a portion of the city website that directs people to things like legal aid and other resources.

During the Oct. 28 council meeting, Councilwoman Arianna Arestegui successfully got a majority of her colleagues to support creating the resource page.

“We need to have this conversation together,” Arestegui said during the meeting. “A lot of these provisions are things that are being enacted by other cities in our region that are major stakeholders in this issue as well and Garden Grove is the third largest Hispanic community in Orange County.”

But Councilman George Brietigam said the issue should be tackled at the state level and blamed California’s sanctuary law for the deportation raids – a law that largely curbs local law enforcement from aiding deportation efforts.

“The state is responsible. Not the federal government, the state – they created sanctuary state laws,” Brietigam said. “The sanctuary state laws made it so ICE has to go out in the community and chase people down. And it looks terrible, it scares people. It scares kids. This is what the state created.”

[Read: Garden Grove Becomes Flashpoint of Immigration Debate in Orange County]

Brietigam, who said immigrants should go through the citizenship process instead, voted against the resource page.

Mayor Stephanie Klopfenstein, who abstained on the vote, warned the resource page could land Garden Grove on the federal government’s radar – potentially jeopardizing federal funding.

“I don’t want to have to look somebody in the face and say your rental assistance has been taken from you.”

The government had argued that the plaintiffs should pursue other legal avenues, including habeas corpus petitions, to challenge their treatment.
“The ‘inherently transitory’ exception thus no longer applies to Mr. Hernandez Torres, rendering his claims moot,” the judge wrote.
Representatives for the plaintiffs, ICE and the Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","(CN) — Carmen Sequen faced a dilemma familiar to thousands of immigrants across the country: appear for her hearing and risk arrest by ICE agents or stay away and lose her chance to make a legal case to remain in the United States.

On Monday, U.S. District Court Judge P. Casey Pitts of the Northern District of California ruled that such concerns warrant judicial examination. He rejected the government’s motion to dismiss a lawsuit challenging policy change implemented by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Justice Department’s immigration court system.

The decision allows Sequen and two other plaintiffs to continue their challenge against policies they say have fundamentally altered immigration enforcement. This includes Yulisa Alvarado Ambrocio and Ligia Garcia.

“In general, there is a strong presumption that Congress intends judicial review of administrative action,” Pitts, a Joe Biden nominee wrote in his order.

In May, ICE issued final guidance allowing its agents to make civil immigration arrests in or near courthouses on a case-by-case basis whenever they believe a noncitizen will be present, easing earlier restrictions that generally limited such arrests to national security threats, imminent danger or other exceptional circumstances.

The plaintiffs say the policy shift has led to more absences at immigration hearings as they weigh the risk of arrest against appearing for their cases. Pitts found that the plaintiffs had reasonably argued that the government didn’t provide sufficient justification for the changes.

“Plaintiffs plausibly allege that each of the challenged policies is arbitrary and capricious,” she wrote.

The plaintiffs also challenge ICE’s elimination of a longstanding 12-hour limit on detention in short-term holding facilities. The agency now permits detention in these facilities for up to 72 hours or longer under what it terms exceptional circumstances.

In their lawsuit, the plaintiffs describe conditions at ICE’s San Francisco field office that include overcrowded rooms with open toilets, limited access to hygiene products and showers, and inadequate sleeping arrangements.

Pitts expressed concern about the policy’s internal contradictions.

“Providing for overnight or multi-night detention in hold rooms while preserving a prohibition on ‘sleeping apparatus’ is not just likely but certain to lead to violations of noncitizens’ due process rights to be free from punitive conditions of confinement,” he wrote.

The government had argued that the plaintiffs should pursue other legal avenues, including habeas corpus petitions, to challenge their treatment. Pitts rejected that argument, explaining that such petitions have limited scope.

“Habeas petitioners may challenge only the fact or duration of particular detainees’ confinement,” she wrote. “Plaintiffs could not use habeas to challenge ICE’s failure to provide a reasoned basis for its overall policy of permitting detention longer than 12 hours in short-term hold rooms.”

Pitts granted the government’s motion to dismiss claims brought by Martin Hernandez Torres, who was removed to Mexico and no longer faces the prospect of detention by ICE.

“The ‘inherently transitory’ exception thus no longer applies to Mr. Hernandez Torres, rendering his claims moot,” the judge wrote.

The decision allows claims by Sequen, Ambrocio and Garcia to move forward. The court has already issued preliminary orders staying the courthouse arrest policies within ICE’s San Francisco area of responsibility, which covers Northern California, Hawaii, Guam and Saipan, in the Northern Mariana Islands, and requiring ICE to address conditions at its holding facility on Sansome Street.

Representatives for the plaintiffs, ICE and the Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2025/08/new-york-immigration-court-arrest.jpg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2025-12-30 01:57:21.401895

In June, a federal judge blocked a Texas law that provided unauthorized immigrants in-state tuition.
Texas became the first state to offer in-state tuition to unauthorized students in 2001, according to the National Immigration Forum, an advocacy group.
In its complaint, the Justice Department argued that the provision illegally favors unauthorized immigrants living in Virginia over U.S. citizens who reside outside the state and would not be eligible for the reduced in-state tuition.
In 2020, Ralph Northam, a Democrat and then the Virginia governor, signed legislation allowing unauthorized immigrants in Virginia to receive in-state tuition.","The Justice Department sued Virginia on Monday over its policy of granting unauthorized immigrants in-state financial aid at public colleges and universities, saying that the assistance violates federal law because it discriminates against U.S. citizens living in other states.

The complaint came as Virginia’s term-limited Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, prepares to leave office next month. He will be succeeded by the state’s Democratic governor-elect, Abigail Spanberger. It is the latest in a series of lawsuits from the Trump administration aimed at blocking states from extending tuition benefits to unauthorized immigrants.

In November, the administration sued California over a similar tuition policy, and in September it brought a case against Illinois over its financial aid program for unauthorized immigrants.

In June, a federal judge blocked a Texas law that provided unauthorized immigrants in-state tuition.

Texas became the first state to offer in-state tuition to unauthorized students in 2001, according to the National Immigration Forum, an advocacy group.

The case in Virginia centers on a section of the state’s legal code that allows students who have lived in Virginia for at least two years to qualify for in-state tuition at public universities.

In its complaint, the Justice Department argued that the provision illegally favors unauthorized immigrants living in Virginia over U.S. citizens who reside outside the state and would not be eligible for the reduced in-state tuition.

“This is not only wrong but illegal,” the lawsuit said. “The challenged act’s discriminatory treatment in favor of illegal aliens over U.S. citizens is squarely prohibited and pre-empted by federal law.”

Governor Youngkin’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the office of the state’s attorney general, Jason Miyares, another Republican who is due to leave office next month. The Virginia Education Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

As of September, at least 14 states offered financial aid to students without regard to immigration status, according to the National Immigration Law Center, another advocacy group. But many states’ policies are shifting.

In 2020, Ralph Northam, a Democrat and then the Virginia governor, signed legislation allowing unauthorized immigrants in Virginia to receive in-state tuition. At the time, Mr. Northam said the law underscored that the students were “Virginians, in every sense of the word, except for the immigration status,” according to WTOP-FM.

State Senator Jennifer B. Boysko, a Democrat who cosponsored the legislation, said in an interview Monday night that she was unsurprised by the lawsuit, saying that she expected the Trump administration to move to penalize the state as Democratic leadership takes over.

But she said the complaint left her “sad for the individuals who were doing everything that they were supposed to and are going to be penalized if this holds.”

Mark Keam, a Democratic former member of the Virginia House of Delegates who was another cosponsor, said he was concerned that the Trump administration was moving toward challenging Plyler v. Doe, the 1982 Supreme Court decision that found children who are unauthorized immigrants have a constitutional right to free public education through high school. “By going after the in-state tuition for college students, they’re heading down that road,” Mr. Keam said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/23/multimedia/29trump-news-virginia-tuition-suit1/hfonat-uva-qwpb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 01:11:50.739480

Seeing it first hand, Muhammad Haseeb Ahmad is anxiously awaiting word on whether he can obtain permanent residency.

“It's like just waiting and waiting — frustration at its pinnacle,"" he said.

The 25-year-old from Pakistan completed his master's in applied computing in artificial intelligence (AI) from the University of Windsor in October 2024. He applied to an immigration stream that catered to master's and PhD graduates, and has been waiting ever since.

Ontario changing its system as Ottawa cuts caps

The prog ram he a pplied to falls under Ontario's Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP). A partnership with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), the program provides a fast-track to permanent residency for workers and international students with skills in specific areas seen as a benefit to the overall Canadian economy.

The Ontario government is looking at changes to the program. Already, a skilled trades stream has been cancelled, and the government is considering going from nine entry categories (based on skills and profession) to a proposed four.

An Ontario government webpage seeking feedback on the proposed changes says the plan would simplify the process for applicants and their employers, f acilitate access for ""priority health-care applicants"" and add a path for entrepreneurs.

There will also be fewer spaces. Ottawa has reduced the number of provincial nominee applications accepted by about half, as the federal finance minister says Canada wants to bring immigration to ""more sustainable"" levels.

Ahmad said he and his friends worry that their stream will get suspended as proposed, though they may still be eligible under a different proposed stream for “exceptional talent.”

Amid that uncertainty, he said, his plan to pursue a PhD in medical AI from University of Toronto or University of Waterloo — paperwork for which is already prepared — is now on hold.

Ahmad said he still hopes things will work out.

“After every darkness, there's a hope. After every night, there's a light. I'm hopeful I will get nominated and get my permanent residence.”

International student permit cuts are pushing away prospective students, experts say

Ahmad has time on his work permit until fall 2027 and if nothing works out, he said he would pursue his PhD in New Zealand instead.

“We are not sure what those new requirements going to be. So far, it's totally unclear,” he said.

Skilled trades stream axed

For a London, Ont., man, six years of efforts to attain permanent residency in Canada have gone down the drain and he said he's returning home follow ing the suspension of the skilled-trades stream under OINP.

“I am done with Canada. I've done everything I could do fo r this economy. And then, if this is how I'm going to be treated, then I'm sorry, no thank you. I'm a human too,” Ankit Kumar Patel said.

CBC spoke with the 29-year-old soon after the announcement of the suspension and, a month later, he says going back home is his only option. Patel came to Canada in 2019 as an international student from India after completing his mechanical engineering degree.

After studying at Fanshawe College, he secured a three-year work permit and worked as a computer numerical control operator for manufacturing companies.

In October 2024, with three months left on his work permit, Patel applied to the OINP for permanent resident status under the skilled-trades category.

Move to suspend parts of Ontario immigration program leaves London man in limbo

Immigrant workers say future in limbo as government ranking system scores soar

More than a year later, on Nov. 14, the provincial government, in an update posted an on the ONIP web page, announced the indefinite suspension of the program's skilled trades stream due to fraudulent applications in the system.

“I feel betrayed. If I knew that it's going to end up this way, then I would’ve pursued something else and not waste my time working three years in a trade.”

Patel said it’s unfair the province is treating all applicants with the same broad stroke.

“It's like a broken promise… If they didn't need us in the first place, they should not have invited us,” he said.

Patel and hundreds impacted by th e suspension of the trades stream staged protests last month outside the OINP's office. CBC spoke with some of them, who say the province’s decision has thwarted their years of hard work and hopes of becoming Canadians.

In an emailed statement, the Ministry of Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills Development said the move is in line to better meet current and future labour market needs in Ontario.

“This decision was made following a comprehensive review that found evidence of systemic misrepresentation or fraud in applications to the skilled trades stream,” the statement said.

“Examples of these systemic compliance and enforcement concerns include falsified information relating to work experience claims, including manufactured payroll records, inaccurate or falsified income documentation, and forged employer reference letters.”

The ministry said prior to the suspension, it had approved 59 applicants from the stream for a nomination but all other applications in the stream remain closed.

NDP calls for reopening of applications

Alexa Gilmour, Ontario NDP critic for the OINP file, said the wider OINP overhaul and restructure from nine to four immigration streams could be “a jobs disaster.""

She said there were 2,600 applicants under the now-suspended trades stream. She called on the government to reopen the applications and give them ""due process.""

“[The workers] did everything right … then the rug was pulled out from under them on November 14th. These workers were not only betrayed, but painted unfairly,” she said.

The employers and the communities that depend on those workers need them, she said. In northern Ontario, Gilmour said, whole communities are counting on these trades workers.

Expect more immigration scrutiny, lawyer says

Lou Janssen Dangzalan, an immigration lawyer in Toronto, said misrepresentation and fraud has plagued OINP with “unsavory agents or ghost consultants and sometimes even licensed representatives” padding applications with problematic documentation.

But Dangzalan said it is still a “disruptive and drastic” move to the applicants and the businesses to cancel the trades stream entirely.

“This is purely a political policy choice,” he said.

“I do applaud the Ontario government for acknowledging that there's a problem, but I'm not sure if basically using a hammer to kill a fly would be a good idea in a house of glass.”

Dangzalan said realistically, applicants should start planning for a possible future where they may need to leave Canada.

“But that doesn't mean that their PR journey is necessarily over right there. Leaving Canada doesn't mean that you're already automatically excluded from the Canadian experience class.”

He said if people have to leave and wait in their home countries for PR, they can work toward gaining skilled work experience there, which can bump their scores, and boost language scores, including by learning French.

“So, 2026 is going to be tough for a lot of people… 2026 is going to be a year of enforcement… IRCC’s going to scrutinize every single application with more diligence than they ever did before.”

Twenty-one states asked the court to block enforcement of an October ICE policy memo that rescinded a 2019 rule barring the use of health care information for immigration enforcement.

“The Trump administration’s effort to use Medicaid data for immigration enforcement is a violation of their trust and will lead to fewer people seeking vital health care, harming the overall health of our communities and increasing public health costs to the state.”","SAN FRANCISCO (CN) — A federal judge on Monday allowed the Trump administration to move forward with a new Immigration and Customs Enforcement policy permitting the agency to obtain basic information of certain Medicaid patients for immigration enforcement purposes.

U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria ruled that the sharing of Medicaid data that is “the primary focus of the new policies” — including basic biographical, location and contact information — is “clearly authorized by law and the agencies have adequately explained their decisions.”

However, the Barack Obama appointee blocked the agencies from sharing any information beyond the specified categories.

“The new policies are totally unclear about what that information would be, why it would be needed for immigration enforcement purposes, and what the risks of sharing it with DHS would be,” he said in the seven-page order released Monday.

Twenty-one states asked the court to block enforcement of an October ICE policy memo that rescinded a 2019 rule barring the use of health care information for immigration enforcement.

The new policy allows ICE to request and use data from the Department of Health and Human Services for “any and all law enforcement activities that ICE is authorized to pursue as a matter of federal law.”

Chhabria rejected many of the states’ arguments against the data-sharing policies, ruling that the Department of Homeland Security has broad statutory authority to obtain data from other agencies to “pursue legitimate law enforcement objectives, like immigration enforcement,” and that Congress requires agencies to comply with legitimate data requests from DHS.

The judge also rejected the states’ claims that the data-sharing policies violate the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Privacy Act, the Affordable Care Act and the Social Security Act, finding the policies “do not restrict ICE from obtaining Medicaid data pertaining to the basic biographical, contact and location data of unlawfully present aliens.”

However, Chhabria sided with the states regarding data beyond basic information, echoing concerns raised at the Dec. 9 preliminary injunction hearing about what additional information DHS could request on a “case-by-case basis,” whether data about citizens or lawful permanent residents could be sought, and whether the policies would allow HHS to share sensitive medical information about Medicaid patients with DHS.

“Beyond the basic information discussed above, the policies are totally unclear and do not appear to be the product of a coherent decision-making process,” Chhabria said, adding that the “government failed to provide satisfactory answers to these and other questions based on the contemporaneous record” at the Dec. 9 hearing.

The new preliminary injunction temporarily bars HHS and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services from sharing information received from the plaintiff states with DHS or ICE, unless it is limited to the citizenship and immigration status, address, phone number, date of birth and Medicaid ID of individuals who are not in the country legally.

Chhabria added that if such basic information is “not severable” from data the agencies are prohibited from obtaining, including information about U.S. citizens or sensitive medical records, it may not be disclosed.

Representatives for either party did not respond to a request for comment.

The states sued the Trump administration in July, claiming that the health information of millions of individuals — including their immigration status — was shared with DHS, which oversees ICE, without their consent and in violation of federal law.

On Aug. 12, Chhabria granted the plaintiff states’ initial request for a preliminary injunction, temporarily blocking DHS from using Medicaid data obtained from the plaintiff states for immigration enforcement purposes, including data they already acquired.

The previous preliminary injunction will remain in effect until Jan. 5, 2026.

The California Attorney General’s Office told Courthouse News it is disappointed in the judge’s decision to allow the sharing of some Medicaid data with ICE.

“When individuals signed up for Medi-Cal, they did so with the understanding that their data would not be used for purposes unrelated to administering the program,” a spokesperson said. “The Trump administration’s effort to use Medicaid data for immigration enforcement is a violation of their trust and will lead to fewer people seeking vital health care, harming the overall health of our communities and increasing public health costs to the state.”","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2025/06/doctors-in-operating-room.jpg/w=800,h=600,fit=crop",N,,2025-12-29 22:56:58.766032

During a live interview with KFOX14/CBS4, Escobar highlighted issues with subcontractors failing to deliver services at Camp East Montana, a tent detention facility for migrants, which reportedly cost taxpayers $1.24 billion.

""Subcontractors who are supposed to deliver laundry services... are not doing it,"" Escobar said, noting that detainees are reporting that they themselves are washing their clothes in their sinks while the subcontractor continues to receive payment for these services.

Escobar also pointed out that janitorial services, meant to be daily, are reportedly only performed once every 10 days.

Escobar emphasized the need for oversight, despite Democrats being in the minority.

""I have visited Camp East Montana four times now. And, and just for context, I think it's really important for El Pasoans to know that this is part of the job that members of Congress are supposed to do,"" Escobar said, adding that it is important to make sure that taxes are being spent appropriately.

However, Escobar noted that she believes it has been difficult to get her colleagues from across the aisle to get on board with scrutinizing the camp, as she said, ""Unfortunately, not everyone believes that we should provide humanitarian care to human beings in our custody.""

Escobar said she has tried to appeal to Republican colleagues on fiscal grounds, arguing that while people lose healthcare and joblessness rises, the government pays billions for inadequate services at Camp East Montana.

""Republicans do not seem at all bothered by the fact that American taxpayers keep dishing out billions of dollars for services that are not being delivered,"" Escobar said.

As it has been reported, Escobar and over 100 Democratic leaders, along with human rights advocates, have demanded action to address issues at Camp East Montana.

From introducing the ""Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act,"" which calls for the establishment of oversight over these types of centers, to sending letters and testimonies from detainees to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

However, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has categorically denied allegations that conditions in Camp East Montana are inhumane.

A DHS official dismissed the claims as ""fearmongering clickbait,"" asserting that detainees receive proper meals, medical treatment, and opportunities to communicate with lawyers and family members.

Below is DHS's full statement:

This is fearmongering clickbait. As our brave ICE law enforcement is facing a more than 1,150% increase in assaults against them, KFOX14 is choosing to smear them with anonymous allegations. Here are the facts: any claim that there are 'inhumane' conditions at ICE detention centers are categorically false. No detainees are being beaten or abused. All detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment, access to showers, and have opportunities to communicate with lawyers and their family members. It is a longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters ICE custody. This is the best healthcare that many aliens have received in their entire lives. Meals are certified by dieticians. No lawbreakers in the history of human civilization have been treated better than illegal aliens in the United States. Get a grip.

These third-country agreements, which ensure due process under the U.S. Constitution, are essential to the safety of our homeland and the American people. If you break our laws and come to our country illegally, you could end up in any number of third countries. President Trump and Secretary Noem are using every tool available to get criminal illegal aliens out of American communities and out of our country. Our message is clear: Criminals are not welcome in the United States. These third-country agreements, which ensure due process under the U.S. Constitution, are essential to the safety of our homeland and the American people.

In response to Escobar, Michael Aboud, chairman of the El Paso Republican Party, dismissed the complaints, stating,

Aboud suggested that those speaking out have their own motivations, saying, ""They’re always going to complain because they hate Republicans. Lawyers are paid to find reasons to complain.""

Alliance San Diego has been seeking justice for Hernández and his family ever since he was killed.
“Anastasio was a long-time resident of San Diego.
“Anastasio was tragically tortured, beaten, kicked, stomped, and killed by border agents,” Guerrero said.

The film is called “Critical Incident: Death at the Border,” which details accounts of the Border Patrol’s involvement in Hernández’s death and the ensuing investigation, which has been described as a “cover up” by Andrea Guerrero, executive director of Alliance San Diego, a human rights advocacy group.

Alliance San Diego has been seeking justice for Hernández and his family ever since he was killed.

“Anastasio was a long-time resident of San Diego. He had a wife, five U.S. citizen children born here and was a member of the community,” Guerrero said.

Hernández encountered the Border Patrol agents after trying to enter the country illegally; he had been deported days prior to the incident.

“Anastasio was tragically tortured, beaten, kicked, stomped, and killed by border agents,” Guerrero said. “Unfortunately, that was only the first part of the story — the second part was the cover-up.”

According to Guerrero, the Critical Incident Team that was sent to investigate Hernández’s death tried to exonerate U.S. Customs and Border Protection along with the agents involved of any civil and criminal liability.

“After he died, after he stopped breathing, they went up onto the pedestrian bridge and took the video cameras off and they erased those videos,” Guerrero said. “They also cleared the crime scene of any evidence … then they went to the hospital and removed all the Taser wires. … They were shadow units, they were cover-up units clear and simple.”

Guerrero stated they came across the investigation results while researching legal measures against the agents and discovered these criminal incident teams had been involved in other border-related incidents over many years.

In 2022, CBP disbanded the Critical Incident Teams, and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights held a hearing on the Hernandez-Rojas case, ultimately calling for the reopening of the matter while recognizing that Hernández’s human rights had been violated.

“The HBO documentary is so timely because it exposes what unchecked power looks like at the largest law enforcement agency in the country and it reminds us what the consequences are,” said Guerrero.

HBO reached out to Alliance San Diego a few years ago about conducting its own investigation, according to Guerrero.

“That’s not just a documentary, but it’s also investigative journalism,” Guerrero said.

Neither CBP nor Border Patrol provided comment about the HBO film, which began airing on Monday.

In May 2024, the U.S. Office of Government Accountability Office issued a report stating that the units “were widespread — used in seven of nine U.S. Border Patrol sectors, including San Diego, on the southwest border — and operated for years with little to no oversight.” The GAO’s report suggested that CBP take additional steps to strengthen its response to incidents involving its personnel.

In response to the 2024 GAO report, CBP issued a statement saying in part: “CBP continually evaluates and improves upon its policies, practices, and procedures to ensure they are consistent with the law, and adhere to the highest standards. CBP has made tremendous strides improving oversight and training, and in reducing incidents involving the use of force.”",https://www.borderreport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/12/cit-hbo.png?w=1280,N,,2025-12-30 10:59:05.017346

And Illinois and Chicago sued the Trump administration in October to block the planned deployment of National Guard Troops to the nation’s third largest city.","SPRINGFIELD — In an expected move, the Trump administration filed a lawsuit last week seeking to nullify a new state law that allows Illinois residents to sue federal immigration agents who arrest them in or near courthouses or if they believe their constitutional rights were violated.

The suit was filed by the Department of Justice in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. It alleges that the law, passed by the Democrat-led state legislature in October and signed by Pritzker earlier this month, violates the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution and increases the likelihood that officers face threats and harassment.

“Threatening officers with ruinous liability and even punitive damages for executing federal law and for simply protecting their identities and their families also chills the enforcement of federal law and compromises sensitive law enforcement operations,” the Department of Justice said in a statement.

The complaint names Gov. JB Pritzker and Attorney General Kwame Raoul as defendants.

A spokesperson for Pritzker said in a statement to Capitol News Illinois that “the Trump Administration’s masked agents are not targeting the ‘worst of the worst’ — they are harassing and detaining law-abiding U.S. citizens and Black and Brown people at daycares, hospitals, and courthouses.”

“This new law reflects our belief that no one is above the law, regardless of their position or authority,” the spokesperson said. “Unlike the Trump Administration, Illinois is protecting constitutional rights in our state.”

Response to blitz

Pritzker signed the law in the aftermath of “Operation Midway Blitz,” a federal immigration enforcement campaign that targeted the Chicago region starting in September.

The Department of Homeland Security said that the operation resulted in the arrest of more than 4,500 immigrants who were living in Chicago and its suburbs without legal permission. But the raids often led to violent confrontations between masked federal agents and protestors during various operations in the city and suburbs, including near an Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility in suburban Broadview. Many of these skirmishes resulted in the deployment of tear gas and other chemical agents.

Leading Illinois Democrats viewed the new law as a comprehensive legislative response to the blitz that provides safeguards to people in their interactions with immigration agents. It also places new requirements on public colleges and universities, hospitals and child care facilities and mostly prohibits them from disclosing the immigration status of students, patients, parents and children.

But the reach of the law is limited. Not included in the package is an outright ban on law enforcement officers wearing face masks while on duty, for instance.

Senate President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, acknowledged before the bill passed that the state was “playing with a stacked deck” versus a federal government with the “upper hand” and that the law would likely be challenged.

Courthouse, private right of action provisions targeted

In its 22-page filing, the federal government specifically challenged the provisions relating to immigration agents’ actions in and around state courthouses as well as the private right of action that it created, arguing that “states have no power to ‘in any manner control the operations of’ the federal government.”

Under the law, all people attending court are considered “privileged from civil arrest” inside state courthouses and within a 1,000-foot buffer zone outside of the buildings.

Though there had long been a de facto understanding that such facilities were off-limits for immigration enforcement, they have increasingly been the site of apprehensions over the past year. Those who violate the act could be liable for statutory damages of $10,000.

The law also allows residents to sue immigration agents for violating their constitutional right to due process and protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.

They would be able to collect punitive damages that can increase if the agents are wearing masks, concealing their identities, failing to wear body cameras or using a vehicle with a non-Illinois or obscured license plate.

“That is a policy choice for Congress, not each individual state, to make,” Justice Department lawyers wrote in their filing, predicting that the law will “inevitably become a vehicle to threaten and harass federal officers.”

Latest state-federal immigration clash

It is not the first time the state and federal government have been entangled in litigation relating to immigration policy.

The Trump administration earlier this year filed a lawsuit seeking to invalidate, under the supremacy clause, a state law and Chicago and Cook County ordinances that limit state and local law enforcement’s cooperation with civil immigration enforcement. A federal judge dismissed the suit in July.

And Illinois and Chicago sued the Trump administration in October to block the planned deployment of National Guard Troops to the nation’s third largest city. Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court denied an emergency appeal from the Trump administration seeking to lift a temporary restraining order put in place by a lower court that prevents the deployment of troops while the underlying case works through the courts.

“The ruling confirms what we’ve long believed, that members of Congress are entitled to visit federal facilities without notice.
Congress must be able to exercise its oversight authority at ICE facilities, just like any other federal agency.","SAN DIEGO (KGTV) — A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's policy requiring congressional members to give seven days advance notice before visiting Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities, ruling the restrictions interfere with Congress's oversight responsibilities.

The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed earlier this year by a Colorado congressmember. It comes after San Diego's Democratic congressional delegation was twice denied access to an ICE holding facility inside the federal building downtown over the past two months.

In late November, the delegation finally gained access to the facility after being turned away on previous attempts. The congress members were told they needed to provide seven days advance notice under a Department of Homeland Security policy announced in June.

""We will never know whether they cleaned it up for us because we had to give them all sorts of notice,"" Rep. Scott Peters said during their eventual visit.

Rep. Juan Vargas expressed frustration with the changing requirements during their second denied attempt.

""They told us the 48-hour rule. We followed that. The seven-day rule, we followed that. And yet, once again, they say no,"" Vargas said.

The federal judge in Washington D.C. ruled the advance notice requirements were ""contrary to law"" and described the restrictions as causing ""tangible harm"" that interferes with Congress's oversight role. The ruling temporarily blocks the policy while the case proceeds.

San Diego's four Democratic congress members were unavailable for interviews Monday, but Peters issued a statement reacting to the ruling.

“The ruling confirms what we’ve long believed, that members of Congress are entitled to visit federal facilities without notice. It’s part of our oversight responsibilities. Nevertheless, we tried our best this fall to cooperate with the administration but even after we gave them plenty of notice we were twice denied entry. Fortunately, that won’t happen again,"" said Peters.

Congressman Levin also issued a statement Monday saying: “Earlier this year, following reports that ICE was violating its own detainment standards, my colleagues and I attempted to conduct oversight at the ICE facility inside the Edward J. Schwartz United States Courthouse in San Diego, only to be blocked by ICE.

Congress must be able to exercise its oversight authority at ICE facilities, just like any other federal agency. The American people deserve to know how detainees are being treated and how their tax dollars are being spent.

Blocking these visits has nothing to do with security and everything to do with hiding the truth and avoiding accountability.

This court ruling is a step in the right direction. Oversight isn’t optional, and NO agency gets to operate in the shadows.”

ICE did not respond to requests for comment but has previously defended the policy as necessary to maintain operational security and safety at facilities. In a past statement, ICE called the oversight visits a ""publicity stunt.""

Because Democrats are in the minority, they cannot call an official congressional hearing. But throughout Mr. Trump’s second term, Democratic lawmakers have held informal events meant to draw public attention to their criticisms of the administration.

In a letter sent Monday to the Democratic caucus, Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the minority leader, said the hearing, set for Tuesday of next week, would highlight Mr. Trump’s broad clemency to rioters seeking to reverse his loss in the 2020 election, some of whom have been rearrested on other charges. He also said that lawmakers would explore “ongoing threats to free and fair elections posed by an out-of-control Trump administration.”

But with Democrats preparing for midterm elections in which they seek to win control of the House, Mr. Jeffries made clear that the hearing was meant to counter Republicans’ efforts to sanitize the storming of the Capitol.

“In the years since that disgraceful day, far-right Republicans in Congress have repeatedly attempted to rewrite history and whitewash the events of Jan. 6,” Mr. Jeffries wrote.

The mob of Trump loyalists that attacked the Capitol that day caused millions of dollars in damage, injured more than 140 police officers and, for the first time in U.S. history, interrupted the certification of a presidential election.

Next Tuesday’s hearing will be led by Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi, who led the bipartisan House select committee that investigated the attack, held widely viewed hearings in 2022 and issued a report on Mr. Trump’s efforts to overturn his election loss.

But the coming hearing, held by a party with little power to conduct oversight or compel action, will likely demonstrate just how much the dynamics around Jan. 6 have shifted in the year since Mr. Trump returned to power.

Though he once disavowed the rioters, Mr. Trump during his 2024 presidential campaign increasingly called them patriots and suggested they had been unfairly treated by the Justice Department.

The president opened his second term by granting clemency to all of the nearly 1,600 people charged in connection with the attack, including those who had assaulted police officers as they tried to disrupt the peaceful transfer of presidential power.

Earlier this year, Speaker Mike Johnson announced a new Republican-led subcommittee that would again investigate the attack and counter “false narratives” about it, part of a larger Republican project to recast the riot.

That panel, led by Representative Barry Loudermilk of Georgia, has yet to hold a hearing. But Mr. Loudermilk has said one of its targets would be the once-stalled investigation into the planting of pipe bombs outside the Republican and Democratic Party headquarters in Washington the night before the attack.

Earlier this month, officials arrested a Virginia man in connection with the pipe bombs, which had been at the center of right-wing conspiracies.

According to court documents released on Sunday, the man, Brian J. Cole Jr., told federal agents that he felt the need to “speak up” after he began to believe that the 2020 election had been tampered with.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/29/multimedia/29trump-news-j6-hearing-mptk/29trump-news-j6-hearing-mptk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 21:11:59.776917

California officials said last month that the state notified about 17,000 truckers that their commercial driver’s licenses would be revoked because the expiration dates went past when the drivers were legally allowed to be in the U.S. That number has since grown to 21,000.

U.S. Fish and Wildlife Director Brian Nesvik, who was confirmed in August, has advocated delisting the Greater Yellowstone grizzly bear and said both the bear and gray wolf populations have recovered.

Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., was the sponsor of the latest congressional effort to reduce protections. On the last day before leaving for the holiday break, the House passed her bill that would require the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to reissue a rule that rescinded Endangered Species Act protections for the gray wolf.

The Trump administration finalized the gray wolf’s delisting in November 2020, but the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California vacated it in February 2022 after finding that the Fish and Wildlife Service didn’t demonstrate that the population could be sustained outside of certain areas of the western Great Lakes and northern Rocky Mountains.

The ruling effectively reinstated protections for the wolf population in the lower 48 states. The decision made an exception for the northern Rocky Mountains, where the wolf was delisted by a 2011 act of Congress. Montana, Idaho and Wyoming state officials manage the population in those states.

By requiring the Fish and Wildlife Service to reissue the rule from the first Trump administration, Boebert said her bill would allow all states to set their own management policies.

Supporters of the delisting say the wolf population has sufficiently recovered and that management should be returned to the states. They say wolves, grizzly bears and other predators make it difficult to prevent human-wildlife conflict.

“We can no longer put farmers, ranchers, and even our pets in harm’s way by using taxpayer dollars to protect a species that has been fully recovered,” Boebert said on the House floor. “It’s time for the federal government to get out of the way and allow the state and tribal wildlife agencies to manage the species.”

Congressional Republicans have taken action before to remove endangered species protections for some species.

The House passed a bill in the last Congress identical to Boebert’s, and Rep. Harriet M. Hageman, R-Wyo., sponsored a bill that would delist the Greater Yellowstone population of grizzly bears that the House Natural Resources Committee approved in a 20-19 party-line vote in July.

Other bills and riders in appropriation measures have sought to either delist or prevent the listing of both predators and other species, such as the lesser prairie-chicken, whose listing impacts industry activity.

Supporter of delisting

But the second Trump administration has given congressional Republicans an agency ally in the push to delist predators.

Nesvik was previously director of the Wyoming Game and Fish Department, where he advocated delisting the Greater Yellowstone grizzly bear and said both the bear and gray wolf populations have recovered.

Nesvik also told the House Natural Resources Committee in 2023 that human-wildlife interactions were on the rise because the increasing number of bears has caused them to move into “non-suitable habitats,” including farms and backyards.

He intervened in October in a program to import wolves from British Columbia to reintroduce the species to Colorado, an initiative that was approved in a 2020 statewide referendum. Nesvik told Colorado Parks and Wildlife the importation violated an agreement between the state agency and the Fish and Wildlife Service.

Mike Leahy, senior policy director for wildlife, hunting and fishing at the National Wildlife Federation, said he has been pleased that the Trump administration “hasn’t come down too hard on predators yet.”

But the Trump administration will have to decide whether to once again attempt to delist grizzly bears and gray wolves.

“How they handle the pending decision regarding grizzly bears will be interesting and telling,” said Leahy. “I think if they were to propose delisting grizzly bears nationwide, that would be a big mistake and probably lose pretty easily in court.”

Leahy said that instead of legislation to force the delisting of predators, Congress could instead focus on increasing appropriations for programs intended to compensate ranchers, such as the Wolf Livestock Loss Demonstration Project Grant Program.

The Senate’s fiscal 2026 Interior-Environment Appropriations bill would keep the same funding level of $1 million for the program, while the House (HR 4754) would increase it to $2.5 million.

In addition to delisting specific species, Republicans are eyeing further changes to the underlying law. A bill from House Natural Resources Chairman Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., includes changes to the law that would limit courts’ abilities to review delisting decisions.

Westerman’s committee approved the bill, 25-16, on Dec. 17.

He said he hoped to bring the bill to the floor in 2026 or reach a bipartisan agreement with the Senate on changes to the law.

On Dec. 5, WWL-TV reported that Kirkpatrick had submitted a revised version of the immigration policy to Murrill for review.
In the letters, the civil rights groups requested meetings with Kirkpatrick and Moreno to address how NOPD officers will engage with immigrants and with federal immigration enforcement agencies moving forward.
Neither the NOPD nor Murrill’s office have provided details on how the immigration policy might be altered.
The NOPD’s longstanding immigration policy was recently taken down from the department’s online policy manual.","New Orleans community groups and civil rights organizations are urging the city’s leadership to include them in drafting changes to the New Orleans Police Department’s immigration policy, which has been in place for nearly a decade but is currently under review following pressure from top officials in state government.

In letters addressed to NOPD Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick and New Orleans Mayor-elect Helena Moreno, organizations, including Familias Unidas en Acción, ACLU of Louisiana and the Vera Institute of Justice, expressed concern at recent reports that top NOPD officials have been working with Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill on a revised version of the department’s immigration policy. That policy, adopted in 2016, generally prohibits officers from inquiring about immigration status or directly participating in federal immigration enforcement efforts.

The department adopted the policy — and a number of others — under court order, as part of a long-running federal consent decree and has long been criticized by Murrill and Gov. Jeff Landry, both of whom are Trump allies and immigration hardliners.

Murrill has argued that local policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration agencies, such as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, run afoul of recently enacted state laws meant to bolster federal-local partnerships.

A federal judge lifted the consent decree last month. On Dec. 5, WWL-TV reported that Kirkpatrick had submitted a revised version of the immigration policy to Murrill for review. Then, on Dec. 18, Murrill announced on social media that she had met with Kirkpatrick and other NOPD officials “about keeping New Orleans residents and everyone who visits safe.”

“We certainly understand that recent changes in state law have created pressure on the New Orleans Police Department to change its policies,” reads the Dec. 17 letter to Kirkpatrick signed by more than 30 groups. “However, we are concerned that those changes appear to be taking place without community consultation.”

A second letter addressed to Moreno, sent Monday, echoed those concerns.

“We are concerned that Superintendent Kirkpatrick has chosen to engage in this process behind closed doors with an Attorney General whose values do not align with those of our city nor consider the families [that] will be separated by the policy,” reads a letter to Moreno, dated Monday, Dec. 29.

In the letters, the civil rights groups requested meetings with Kirkpatrick and Moreno to address how NOPD officers will engage with immigrants and with federal immigration enforcement agencies moving forward.

Neither the NOPD nor Murrill’s office have provided details on how the immigration policy might be altered. The NOPD did not respond to a request for comment by publication time. Murrill’s office pointed to previous statements she has made, which do not detail specific changes being contemplated.

The letters come amid a stepped up immigration enforcement effort —called operation Catahoula Crunch — that has sent hundreds of U.S. Border Patrol agents to southeast Louisiana. Just after that effort launched, Murrill told Kirkpatrick that the NOPD could be in violation of a 2024 state law prohibiting so-called “sanctuary policies” that limit local cooperation with ICE and Border Patrol.

The NOPD’s longstanding immigration policy was recently taken down from the department’s online policy manual. Asked for comment on Monday, an NOPD spokesperson said that Kirkpatrick was on leave, adding that the department might not be able to provide details on the policy discussions until she was back on duty.

When asked for a comment from Murrill, spokesperson Lester Duhé, directed Verite News to the letter that she had addressed to Kirkpatrick regarding cooperation with federal immigration agencies and to the post on X. Moreno’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Despite the groups’ allegations that community groups have been left out of the revision process, last week, community organizers and immigrant rights attorneys met with Kirkpatrick to provide input on a new immigration policy, according to people who attended. However, according to one attendee, Kirkpatrick was less than forthcoming about the new language under consideration.

In a phone interview with Verite News, Leticia Casildo, executive director of Familias Unidas en Accion, a local nonprofit that supports immigrant communities in the greater New Orleans area, said Kirkpatrick “took a really defensive posture,” during the meeting, telling the group they were addressing their concerns to the wrong person and that she did not believe community members should be involved in drafting the new policy.

“When we asked her to present the policies that were being re-written, she flat out denied us,” Casildo said. “That for us is so worrisome because we know that [Gov. Jeff Landry] has this agenda to hurt the immigrant community.”

Earlier this year, Murrill sued the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office over its immigration policy — also the result of a federal consent judgement — that blocks the agency from honoring voluntary requests from federal immigration agents to hold immigrants already booked into the parish jail past their release dates. These requests are called immigration detainers. That case is ongoing.

Casildo was part of a large effort to pass the OPSO policy, — which stemmed from a 2011 federal court case that alleged that two foreign-born construction workers were held for months beyond their release dates at the request of ICE. The policy was put into effect in 2013 as a settlement in the case.

“Those were not policies that some lawyer made in an office,” Casildo said. “They were fought hard for with blood and sweat and tears.”

Jeremy Jong, an attorney at national immigrant support nonprofit Al Otro Lado, who was at the meeting with Kirkpatrick last week, said he worries about the NOPD jumping too hastily into partnerships with federal immigration agencies without strict legal guidance to guard against abuses.

“You don’t know how to keep whatever cooperation that you’re going to do with ICE in legal bounds,” Jong said, pointing to a recent $112 million verdict against the Suffolk County Sheriff’s Office in New York over allegedly improper ICE holds.

“If in the end there has to be a change – obviously we want a policy that cooperates with ICE to the least extent possible,” Jong said. “The details of that, I think personally, should be between the people most impacted and the police department.”

Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the date of a letter to NOPD Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick and the date of a social media post by Attorney General Liz Murrill.

Undocumented immigrants are not eligible to enroll in federal Medicaid programs, but California and other blue states — Illinois, Colorado, New York, Washington, Oregon, Minnesota, as well as Washington, D.C. — allow some people to receive state-funded benefits through their Medicaid implementation programs regardless of immigration status.

Chhabria’s order is narrowly tailored to six categories of “basic” personal information: citizenship, immigration status, address, phone number, date of birth and Medicaid ID.

The Trump administration is only allowed to share Medicaid data about people unlawfully living in the United States, meaning ICE can’t access personal information collected from other immigrants receiving Medicaid.

ICE and HHS remain barred from sharing personal health records and other potentially sensitive medical information for immigration enforcement under a preliminary injunction. Chhabria said the agencies did not provide a compelling reason for exchanging such information, which California and other states argued would violate health privacy laws.

“Beyond the basic information discussed above, the policies are totally unclear and do not appear to be the product of a coherent decisionmaking process,” Chhabria wrote.

California sued the Trump administration following reports that HHS was sharing personal data collected from undocumented immigrant Medicaid enrollees with immigration officials at the Department of Homeland Security.

Chhabria in August temporarily barred the Trump administration from sharing such information for immigration enforcement purposes, but left the door open for data transfers to resume. His decision to revise the injunction comes after ICE and HHS published formal notices in November detailing how they planned to use Medicaid data in immigration cases.

The Trump administration has been less successful in seizing personal information from other government databases. Judges in recent decisions have blocked the White House’s attempts to share taxpayer data and food aid recipients’ information with immigration officials.

For example, in late January, immigration officials showed up at the door of a Croatian woman in San Diego.
In San Diego in particular, immigration officials have methodically expanded their reach in official spaces — from court hallways to green card appointments.","State violence is nothing new in the border region.

Many of those leading transborder lives in San Diego and Tijuana have witnessed or even experienced the increased power and, sometimes, impunity, that Customs and Border Protection officials wield within range of the border. This year, that authority — and violence — expanded to the interior of the United States.

In 2010, border officials killed an undocumented immigrant in the process of deporting him at the San Ysidro Port of Entry. Since then, the widow of Anastasio Hernández Rojas has fought to preserve his memory and to get some kind of justice for his death. His case, she told me earlier this year, is not just about him, but about all of the families who have lost loved ones to U.S. border officials’ violence.

In May of this year, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, a tribunal within the Organization of American States, found that what those officials did to Hernández Rojas amounted to torture, and that the U.S. government worked to cover up what happened. His widow Maria Puga said she will keep pushing until the people involved are in jail.

“This fight that had so much help from organizations, the community, people who saw me in the street and said, ‘That’s good, ma’am. You will succeed,’ it keeps going,” Puga said in Spanish.

The person who was in charge of the San Diego Sector of Border Patrol at the time of Hernández Rojas’ death is now running Custom and Border Protection for the Trump administration.

Even before President Donald Trump took office, in January, we saw El Centro Border Patrol agents make mass arrests in Bakersfield, far from their normal area of operation in El Centro, Calexico and Imperial. Since then, Border Patrol agents, under the leadership of Commander Gregory Bovino — a promotion from his previous position running the El Centro Sector — have gone from city to city, conducting raids and often violent arrests.

Violent arrests have also happened in the border region itself.

For example, in late January, immigration officials showed up at the door of a Croatian woman in San Diego. Their interaction left her visibly bruised. Months later, officials detained her until an attorney was able to get her out using a writ of habeas corpus petition, a federal court filing that argues the government has someone in custody unlawfully.

Though the Supreme Court has long given border officials the ability to conduct warrant-less searches at the border in certain contexts, it expanded their power this year in a decision after attorneys and advocates challenged Border Patrol agents’ use of racial profiling as they roamed Los Angeles and other parts of California. When that decision came down, Pedro Rios, director of the American Friends Service Committee’s U.S./Mexico Border Program, predicted in an opinion piece for CalMatters that the state violence that had long been in the border region would only keep growing on the interior of the country.

We’ve seen U.S. citizens who document immigration raids as they are happening arrested by federal officials, as in the case in Linda Vista in July when several were charged with assaulting a federal agent and held overnight at the San Ysidro Port of Entry. Charges against the immigrant who was initially arrested and against one of the U.S. citizens have been dropped. The other two cases are still pending.

In San Diego in particular, immigration officials have methodically expanded their reach in official spaces — from court hallways to green card appointments.

Since a reporting trip to Nicaragua in 2019, I’ve thought a lot about my peers there who have had to navigate covering an increasingly hostile authoritarian regime. Most, if not all, Nicaraguan journalists have had to flee, but they continue to cover what’s happening in their country as they live in exile.

This year, human rights groups and journalists have turned to their Latin American peers to have conversations about how to navigate their work as state violence increases. The Washington Office on Latin America hosted a panel in April about enforced disappearances after the Trump administration sent more than 200 Venezuelan men to El Salvador, where they were imprisoned.

“If there’s one thing we have learned in Latin America, the consequences, the impact of enforced disappearances are profoundly human,” said Carolina Jiménez Sandoval, president of WOLA, during the panel. “Sadly when a person or a group of people disappear, their relatives, their families, the community, the society to which the disappeared person belongs to suffers greatly. In Latin America, we know this feeling of agony. Unfortunately we know it too well.”

In November, the Knight Center for Journalism at University of Texas at Austin hosted a conversation with journalists living in exile.

“When all freedoms have been eliminated, when there is no freedom of reunion, freedom of mobilization, electoral freedom, religious freedom, the last reserve of freedom is journalism in exile,” said Carlos Fernando Chamorro, founder of Nicaraguan outlet Confidencial, during the panel.

As we look ahead to 2026, I know I will be keeping these conversations in mind as I continue to document how state violence plays out in the border region and beyond.",https://voiceofsandiego.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Trisha_20-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 17:57:09.307715

Deploying National Guard

One of the most prominent cases involved the topic of deploying the National Guard to Portland.

In September, President Donald Trump described Portland as ""war ravaged"" in a social media post, following protests outside the Portland Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility.

Less than 24 hours after President Donald Trump announced he was sending troops to Portland, protesters and ICE agents came face to face with minor clashes. KATU witnessed one get detained by officers.

The state of Oregon filed a lawsuit, arguing that the president lacked the authority to invoke Title 10 and deploy the National Guard without proving a rebellion, invasion, or inability to enforce federal law.

Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and the president had a tense text message exchange over his invoking of Title 10 and authorizing the troops to go to Portland.

Judges ultimately sided with Oregon, ruling that the protests did not meet these criteria. The Trump administration appealed the decision, until a judge permanently blocked the deployment in early November.

Gender-affirming care penalties

Another high-profile case saw Oregon Attorney General Rayfield suing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services over Secretary RFK Jr.'s declaration that providers could be barred from Medicaid if they allowed gender-affirming care for children.

Rayfield contends that RFK Jr. lacks the authority to define professional standards of care. The case is ongoing.

Imposing tariffs

Other states also joined Oregon in challenging President Trump's tariffs, including a 145% tariff on most Chinese products.

Experts estimated these tariffs could increase the cost of living for Oregonians by about $4,000 annually.

Rayfield argued that only Congress has the authority to impose taxes and tariffs, as outlined in Article 1 of the Constitution. The federal court sided with Rayfield, but the Trump administration has since appealed.

Federal funds

Earlier this year, Oregon sued the Trump administration over the freezing of federal funds.

The administration had announced a freeze to audit overspending, affecting nonprofits working on social issues like domestic violence.

The court ruled in favor of Oregon, stating that the president could not impose new conditions on already awarded funding.

In the summer of this year, Rayfield and Wash. Attorney General Nick Brown were among AGs from 20 other states suing the Trump administration over its efforts to obtain data from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP.

According to the lawsuit, the U.S. Department of Agriculture was improperly attempting to gather sensitive personal information from low-income families who use food stamps. The requested information included Social Security numbers and home addresses.

In December, a federal judge in Oregon temporarily blocked the Trump administration from fining states millions of dollars over their implementation of SNAP under new federal government guidelines.

Around that time, the Trump administration reversed its guidance, saying that noncitizens living in the country legally remained eligible for the food assistance program.

The guidance included refugees, asylum seekers and permanent residents, also known as 'green card"" holders.

That order, however, is temporary and prohibits the administration from penalizing the states as the states’ lawsuit is considered by the courts.

TALLAHASSEE — Alligator Alcatraz. Guns. Social media.

Legal battles about those and myriad other Florida issues remain unresolved heading into 2026. Here are 10 big legal issues to watch in the coming year:

ALLIGATOR ALCATRAZ: The immigrant-detention center in the Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” has spawned a series of court battles since Florida opened the facility this summer. For example, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is scheduled to hear arguments in April in a case that alleges violations of a federal environmental law. Other cases involve issues such as detainees’ access to attorneys and whether the state has withheld public records.

BOOK FIGHTS: Publishing companies, authors and parents are challenging state and local education officials in federal lawsuits after books were removed from school libraries because of alleged improper content. For instance, a case at the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals challenges a 2023 state law that led to books being removed. Two other pending lawsuits target Escambia County School Board decisions to remove or restrict access to books.

GUNS: Nearly eight years after the measure passed following the mass shooting at Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the U.S. Supreme Court is deciding whether to take up the National Rifle Association’s challenge to a law that prevents people under age 21 from buying rifles and other long guns. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier has taken the unusual step of refusing to defend the law.

IMMIGRATION: A panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments in October about a law that created state crimes for undocumented immigrants who enter or re-enter Florida. The state appealed after a U.S. district judge issued a preliminary injunction, ruling the 2025 law was likely preempted by federal immigration authority. It remains unclear when the appellate panel will issue a decision.

MARIJUANA: After falling short in 2024 of passing a constitutional amendment to allow recreational marijuana, the political committee Smart & Safe Florida wants to take the issue back to voters in 2026. But first, it needs to submit enough signatures and get Florida Supreme Court approval of the proposed ballot wording. The court review could turn into a fight, as Gov. Ron DeSantis and Attorney General James Uthmeier oppose allowing recreational marijuana.

SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS: A U.S. district judge in 2026 is expected to rule on the constitutionality of a 2021 Florida law that placed restrictions on social-media platforms, such as preventing the sites from banning political candidates. Tech industry groups challenged the law, which passed after Facebook and Twitter, now known as X, blocked President Donald Trump from their platforms after Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

SOCIAL MEDIA RESTRICTIONS: Saying social media was harming children’s mental health, Florida lawmakers in 2024 passed a measure to prevent children under age 14 from opening accounts on certain platforms. Parents would have to give consent for 14- and 15-year-olds to have accounts on the platforms. Industry groups filed a First Amendment challenge and were backed by a district judge. The issue is pending at the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

TRANSGENDER ISSUES: Gov. Ron DeSantis’ administration and lawmakers in recent years have approved a series of measures aimed at transgender people, sparking legal battles. For example, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is weighing the constitutionality of a state law and regulations that restrict treatments for people with gender dysphoria. It also is considering a challenge to a ban on Medicaid coverage for hormone therapy and puberty blockers

UTILITY RATES: The state’s Office of Public Counsel and two consumer groups have gone to the Florida Supreme Court to challenge a decision by utility regulators to approve Tampa Electric Co. base-rate increases that began to take effect in 2025. Meanwhile, the Office of Public Counsel and consumer groups have indicated they likely will also challenge a November decision by regulators to approve a Florida Power & Light base-rate settlement.

WETLANDS: In a case closely watched by conservation and business groups, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia is considering whether the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2020 improperly shifted permitting authority to Florida for projects that affect wetlands. A U.S. district judge sided with conservation groups that challenged the shift. Florida and business groups have defended giving authority to the state.

It’s the most rapid loss in legal status for immigrants in recent United States history, experts in immigration policy told States Newsroom. The Trump administration curtailed legal immigration by terminating Temporary Protected Status for more than 1 million immigrants and ending Humanitarian Parole protections for half a million more individuals.

“I don’t think we’ve ever, as a country, seen such a huge number of people losing their immigration status all at once,” said Julia Gelatt, the associate director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute.

The move to strip so many immigrants of their work authorization is likely to not only affect communities, but also batter the economy, both immigration and economic experts told States Newsroom.

“Seeing well over 1 million people lose their work authorization in a single year is a really huge event that has ripple effects for employers and communities and families and our economy as well,” Gelatt said.

Dozens of lawsuits have been filed by immigrant rights groups and TPS recipients themselves challenging the terminations as unlawful.

“This is the continuation of the Trump administration attack against the immigrant community, and specifically about the TPS program, a program that, for many of us has been a good program, a life-saving program,” said Jose Palma, a TPS recipient from El Salvador and coordinator of the National TPS Alliance, which is part of several TPS lawsuits.

Who is granted Temporary Protected Status?A TPS designation is given because a national’s home country is deemed too dangerous to return to due to violence, war, natural disasters or some other unstable condition.

When Congress created the program in 1990, it was initially meant to be temporary, which is why authorizations can be as short as six months and as long as 18 months.

Immigrants who are granted TPS must go through background checks and be vetted each time their status is renewed, but the program does not provide a path to citizenship.

Under the Biden administration, the number of TPS recipients grew, as did the category of humanitarian parole.

That policy decision was heavily criticized by Republicans, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem vowed to reevaluate TPS country designations for terminations during her Senate confirmation hearing this year.

“This program has been abused and manipulated by the Biden administration, and that will no longer be allowed,” Noem said during her hearing.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) Before the Trump administration came into office in late January, there were more than 1.3 million immigrants in the TPS program, hailing from 17 countries. Under the first Trump administration, there were roughly 400,000 TPS recipients.

“Almost a million new people got onto TPS protections under President Biden, so we saw a really rapid expansion, and now we’re seeing a very rapid contraction, which is all to say that in the first Trump administration, there weren’t so many people who had TPS,” Gelatt said.

Noem has terminated TPS for immigrants from 11 countries, and the more than 1 million immigrants affected will lose their protections by February.

Noem extended six months’ protection for South Sudan earlier this year, but decided in November to terminate protections by January. She most recently terminated a TPS designation for Ethiopia on Dec. 12.

The other countries with TPS termination are Afghanistan, Burma, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria and Venezuela.

“We’ve never seen this many people lose their legal status in the history of the United States,” David Bier, the director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said. “This is totally unprecedented.”

People losing their status are also concentrated in certain areas. Florida has more than 400,000 TPS recipients, and Texas has nearly 150,000. Bier said he expects certain industries with high TPS workers to feel the impact, such as construction and health care.

Haiti, VenezuelaImmigrants from two countries — Haiti and Venezuela – make up a majority of recipients set to lose their TPS protections, at nearly 935,000 people.

Venezuelans, who make up 605,000 of those 935,000 TPS recipients, were first granted protections during Trump’s first term.

On his final day in office in 2021, his administration issued 18-month deportation protections for Venezuelans — known as Deferred Enforcement Departure, or DED — citing the country’s unstable government under President Nicolás Maduro.

“Through force and fraud, the Maduro regime is responsible for the worst humanitarian crisis in the Western Hemisphere in recent memory,” according to the Jan. 19, 2021 memo. “A catastrophic economic crisis and shortages of basic goods and medicine have forced about five million Venezuelans to flee the country, often under dangerous conditions.”

After the Trump administration’s 18-month DED designation, the Biden administration issued the TPS designation for Venezuelans who came to the U.S. in 2021 and again in 2023. The move created two separate TPS groups for Venezuelans.

“The bottom line is that removing the 935,000 Venezuelans and Haitians would cause the entire economy to contract by more than $14 billion,” said Michael Clemens, a professor in the Department of Economics at George Mason University.

He added that not all the TPS recipients are in the labor market. Some are children or elderly dependents who cannot work. Clemens said the TPS workforce population of Haitians and Venezuelans is about 400,000.

Humanitarian Parole programSeparately, under the Biden administration, nearly 750,000 immigrants had some form of humanitarian parole, granting them work and temporary legal status due to either Russia’s war in Ukraine or efforts by the administration to manage mass migration from Central American countries.

DHS has moved to end humanitarian parole for 532,000 immigrants hailing from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, opening them up for deportation proceedings.

“The onslaught of attacks that we’ve been seeing on temporary forms of immigration status, specifically with a humanitarian focus, is truly saddening and concerning,” said Alice Barrett, a supervising immigration attorney at the immigrant rights group CASA.

Not every recipient has been affected. The agency has kept humanitarian parole for 140,000 Ukrainians who came to the United States after Russia’s invasion in 2022, and 76,000 Afghans who were brought in after the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from their country.

But since the National Guard shooting last month in Washington, D.C., allegedly by an Afghan national granted asylum, the program is under increased scrutiny and all immigration-related paperwork from Afghans has been halted.

Court decisions influentialThis is not the first time the Trump administration has tried to end TPS.

During the president’s first term, he tried to end TPS for Haiti, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Sudan, but the courts blocked those attempts in 2018.

This time is different, said Palma of the National TPS alliance.

“The only thing different right now is that the Supreme Court is allowing the Trump administration to continue with termination of TPS, even though lower courts are saying, ‘No, we should stop the cancellation of TPS for now, until it’s clear whether the decision was illegal or not,’” he said.

So far, in emergency appeals, the high court has allowed the Trump administration to move forward in stripping legal status for the two groups of Venezuelan TPS recipients and individuals in the humanitarian parole program.

Barrett at CASA, which is leading the legal challenge of TPS termination for Cameroon and Afghanistan, said when it comes to TPS termination, “what we are seeing in the second Trump administration is a supercharged version of what we saw in the first Trump administration.”

“We are essentially seeing during this administration more actual terminations happening early on even while litigation is pending, which has certainly been disappointing for members of the community, because they’re still left in this limbo,” she said.

Barrett added that even when TPS recipients try to apply for longer-term legal status they face multiple hurdles.

“For example, we are seeing them questioned or denied relief at asylum interviews because they did not apply for asylum within one year of entering the United States, even though the Code of Federal Regulations clearly creates an exception to this one-year filing deadline for people who have been in other valid status before applying for asylum,” Barrett said.

“These members of our community who have been in lawful status therefore now risk being placed in removal proceedings and even (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) detention, where conditions are increasingly inhumane and dangerous,” she continued.

TPS recipients are still continuing to fight in the courts and share their stories, Barrett said.

“These cases are still in progress, and we remain hopeful that despite preliminary rulings leaving so many hardworking individuals and their families in a state of uncertainty, upon thorough review and litigation of these cases the courts will recognize the improper nature of recent TPS terminations and restore status for those seeking safety here in the United States,” she said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0332836/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2018x1059+0+99/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd0%2F21%2F70c112ca4639a4bbaa2b6c1897c6%2Fvenezuelans-tps-051925.png,N,,2025-12-29 18:57:20.989144

Therefore, AB 288 was rendered temporarily moot, at least until the Board is again unable to act.
The next NLRB Board Member to have his/her term expired is David Prouty in August of 2026.
Therefore, unless President Trump fires another NLRB Board Member in the next eight months, the NLRB will have a 3 person quorum through late August.
Two of the five NLRB Board positions remain open.","AB 288, enacted by the California Legislature in September (which CDF reported on in September and October of this year), mirrors a similar New York law and authorizes California’s Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) to enforce provisions of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) in the private sector when the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) declines or is unable to act.

More specifically, AB 288 encourages and empowers private-sector unions and employees to take their disputes to PERB if the NLRB fails to act within statutory timeframes. Under AB 288, when the NLRB does not have a quorum or is otherwise not functioning, workers could petition PERB to:

Decide unfair labor practice cases that the NLRB has not resolved within six months;

Certify a union as the exclusive bargaining representative;

Order employers to bargain, reinstate terminated workers, or participate in binding mediation; and

Impose civil penalties, with funds earmarked for PERB’s enforcement efforts.

In short, the bill attempts to create a parallel state enforcement process for rights already guaranteed under the federal NLRA.

Shortly after enactment of AB 288, the NLRB filed a lawsuit in the Federal Court for the Eastern District of California seeking to enjoin enforcement of the statute on the grounds that it is preempted by the NLRA pursuant to the Garmon preemption doctrine. On Friday, Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District, Judge Troy L. Nunley , ruled on the preliminary injunction and issued his decision granting the injunction and finding that AB 288 is preempted under Garmon.

Judge Nunley held that the court is “unable to consign the notion that Congress’ interest in the NLRB’s independence when it enacted the NLRA was so strong that that in its absence, Congress intended the NLRB to be stripped of its authority.” Judge Nunley went on to find that Congress’ foremost interest in enacting the NLRA and establishing the NLRB was “uniformity and avoidance of inconsistency.” Based on these findings, the Court issued its Order enjoining enforcement of AB 288 finding it to be preempted by the NLRA.

What Does This Mean For California Employers?

AB 288 only takes effect when the NLRB is unable to act (e.g., when the Board lacks a three member quorum or if there is a federal government shutdown). Although the NLRB was without a quorum and unable to process cases for almost eleven months, that all changed in mid-December. As we recently reported, with the appointment and the confirmation of Scott Mayer and James Murphy, the NLRB now has a quorum. Therefore, AB 288 was rendered temporarily moot, at least until the Board is again unable to act.

The next NLRB Board Member to have his/her term expired is David Prouty in August of 2026. Therefore, unless President Trump fires another NLRB Board Member in the next eight months, the NLRB will have a 3 person quorum through late August. Two of the five NLRB Board positions remain open. If a new Board member is not nominated and confirmed before August 27, 2026, the NLRB will again be without a quorum. Judge Nunley’s decision (unless overturned on appeal) confirms that should that occur, or should there be another extended federal government shutdown, unions and employees will be unable to obtain relief from the California PERB for private sector employer disputes and matters.",https://www.cdflaborlaw.com/_images/content/CDF-OG-logo.png,N,,2025-12-29 15:57:14.028757

“They do not want to have people have the ability to apply for asylum in the United States.” But the administration official countered that anyone who genuinely fears persecution should only be concerned about their safety.
In a federal lawsuit filed that year — revived this September — asylum seekers and immigration groups argued the agreements were unlawful.
“No one who has passed through other countries where they’re not being persecuted should get asylum [in the United States].
Since Trump returned to office, the White House has aggressively targeted the asylum system and tried to accelerate deportations.","“Asylum was not designed to provide people a backdoor way to get to a country of their choosing,” said a senior administration official, granted anonymity to discuss internal thinking about the strategy. “If the United States is confident that they can be successfully removed to another country where they will not be threatened, then there’s no reason or expectation that they should be allowed to remain here.”

The Trump administration’s strategy was bolstered in October when the Justice Department’s Board of Immigration Appeals, an administrative body that oversees immigration courts, said judges should weigh third-country removal before an asylum case is considered in the U.S. The endorsement turbocharged the effort, and in November, DHS attorneys asked judges to dismiss nearly 5,000 cases, more than twice the amount in October and four times the amount in September, according to a recent analysis of immigration court data. It is not clear that all 5,000 were because DHS wanted to send someone to a third country.

In exchange for accepting migrants, these other countries have usually received less U.S. condemnation for alleged human rights abuses and greater security assistance.

Immigration attorneys and advocates, alarmed by the latest trend, argue that it’s a further erosion of the U.S. asylum system in the United States.

“The administration wants to demolish our humanitarian protection system,” said Rebekah Wolf, a staff attorney with the immigration justice campaign and policy department of the American Immigration Council. “They do not want to have people have the ability to apply for asylum in the United States.”

But the administration official countered that anyone who genuinely fears persecution should only be concerned about their safety.

“They shouldn’t care about what specific location,” the official said. “Many [immigration groups] somehow think that it’s bad to be doing this — that everyone should get a hearing, no matter anything else. But the reality from our perspective is, it is the law. And you may disagree with the law, but the way to address that is through Congress.”

DHS’s strategy provides another example of how President Donald Trump’s team learned from and built upon efforts of his first term. In 2019, DHS and the Justice Department issued an interim final rule allowing the U.S. to enter into third-country agreements with Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala — barring migrants from applying for asylum in the U.S. if the administration determined they could do so safely in one of the other nations. In a federal lawsuit filed that year — revived this September — asylum seekers and immigration groups argued the agreements were unlawful. Administration officials expect other lawsuits to be filed against their latest strategy.

This term, the White House has not only expanded efforts to strike these agreements with less stable nations, but has also cut other deals with countries willing to accept migrant deportees. For months, the administration has deported migrants to African nations, including South Sudan and Eswatini. The administration also sent more than 200 Venezuelans to El Salvador, where they were detained in the country’s mega-prison for months.

And this month, Palau, an archipelago of roughly 350 small islands in the Pacific Ocean, inked a deal with the Trump administration to take up to 75 migrants in exchange for aid, another example of how the White House is looking to third-countries to accelerate deportations of people who cannot be returned to their home countries.

As for asylum protections, supporters of the administration argue that the system has long been abused, and they are simply course correcting to bring the program in line with its original intent.

“No one who has passed through other countries where they’re not being persecuted should get asylum [in the United States]. If you’ve passed through other countries, you’ve effectively ignored other opportunities to claim asylum,” said Mark Krikorian, head of the Center for Immigration Studies think tank, which favors restrictions on immigration. “It’s a way to deter bogus asylum claims.”

A DHS spokesperson said the agency is working to remove all unauthorized immigrants from the United States, while “ensuring they receive all available legal process, including a hearing before an immigration judge.”

“Asylum Cooperative Agreements,” as DHS calls them, “are lawful bilateral arrangements that allow illegal aliens seeking asylum in the United States to pursue protection in a partner country that has agreed to fairly adjudicate their claims” the spokesperson said. “DHS is using every lawful tool available to address the backlog and abuse of the asylum system.”

DHS said last month that the Trump administration is on pace to shatter deportation records, projecting nearly 600,000 removals by the end of the president’s first year, surpassing the 400,000 deportations that marked the peak for the Obama administration.

Since Trump returned to office, the White House has aggressively targeted the asylum system and tried to accelerate deportations. That has included an aggressive effort to shrink the case backlog in the immigration courts, which EOIR says has now dropped to less than 3.75 million cases from 4.18 million in January.

“The Trump administration knows that the backlog at the immigration courts is a huge obstacle to their mass deportation campaign,” said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an immigration lawyer who works as an analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. “They’re trying to speed up and close out as many of those cases as they can.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fd4%2F5b%2F21fbe7184081acd0c3be5da95154%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2232569993,N,,2025-12-29 14:57:09.942963

For Ms. Oliveira, the prospect may have been exceptionally daunting because she was then the subject of immigration proceedings.
“Under the VTVPA, cooperating victims like Ms. Oliveira are entitled to apply for what is known as a U visa.
“On January 30, 2025, DHS abruptly eliminated that benefit when Immigration & Customs Enforcement (‘ICE’) announced that it would no longer ask its DHS-sister agency, U.S.
Each of these would constitute an independent basis to conclude that the issuance of the 2025 Policy was arbitrary and capricious.","Where a complaint has been filed challenging the Department of Homeland Security’s change in policy regarding the removal of “U Visa” applicants, a request by the plaintiffs for a preliminary injunction should be granted because their Administrative Procedure Act claim is particularly strong.

“Congress implemented the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act (‘VTVPA’) to ‘strengthen the ability of law enforcement agencies to detect, investigate, and prosecute cases of domestic violence [and] sexual assault.’ …

“Plaintiff Lucia Goncalves Moreira Oliveira presents a tragic success story for the VTVPA. On August 20, 2023, Ms. Oliveira was robbed and sexually assaulted on the streets of Boston, Massachusetts. For any survivor of such an ordeal, the decision of whether to call the police is often fraught with difficulty, both because of the intense emotional charge of the situation and because of the considerable challenges in prosecuting crimes of that nature. Indeed, from 2020-2023, only 13% of sexual assaults in urban areas were ever reported. For Ms. Oliveira, the prospect may have been exceptionally daunting because she was then the subject of immigration proceedings. Many in her position might have felt understandably apprehensive about inviting law enforcement into the most sensitive parts of their life. But rather than let her attacker disappear into the night, Ms. Oliveira did the right thing: she contacted the authorities and has since fully cooperated with law enforcement. By doing so, she contributed to our collective safety. Indeed, a Boston Police detective has signed an affidavit attesting to Ms. Oliveira’s ongoing, active participation in their investigation.

“Under the VTVPA, cooperating victims like Ms. Oliveira are entitled to apply for what is known as a U visa. As set forth above, U visas serve a dual purpose: providing humanitarian relief to victims of abuse and facilitating those victims’ participation in criminal investigations, much to the benefit of our communities. And while an annual cap on U visas has unfortunately meant a years-long backlog of applications, the Department of Homeland Security (‘DHS’) has, until recently, ensured that qualifying individuals would not be removed while waiting for final relief.

“On January 30, 2025, DHS abruptly eliminated that benefit when Immigration & Customs Enforcement (‘ICE’) announced that it would no longer ask its DHS-sister agency, U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services (‘USCIS’), to decide whether a U visa application is ‘bona fide’ — meaning whether it satisfies the prima facie requirements for relief, plus national security and public safety background checks for the applicant — before executing the applicant’s order of removal. As a result, individuals with bona fide, yet unadjudicated, U visa applications — ‘victims of crimes committed against them in the United States, including rape, torture, kidnaping, trafficking, incest, domestic violence, sexual assault, female genital mutilation, forced prostitution, involuntary servitude, being held hostage,’ and more—suddenly find themselves unprotected from removal. Indeed, this is the exact position in which Ms. Oliveira finds herself. Ms. Oliveira’s U visa application was submitted to USCIS ten months ago, almost quintuple what Congress imagined as an appropriate length for deciding interim relief. Nevertheless, it has not been enough, and Ms. Oliveira’s application continues to be outstanding.

“Through their complaint, Ms. Oliveira and her husband ask the Court to find that the rescission of ICE’s prior policy and the institution of its new policy (hereinafter, the ‘2025 Policy’) violated the Administrative Procedure Act (‘APA’) and the Due Process Clause. In the interim, Plaintiffs ask the Court preliminarily to enjoin ICE from applying the 2025 Policy in their case. …

“On the merits, Plaintiffs’ APA claim is particularly strong. ICE’s announcement of the 2025 Policy summarily states that ‘it is the policy of the United States to achieve the ‘total and efficient enforcement of [immigration] laws.” But the VTVPA (including the availability of interim relief) is part of our immigration laws. It is thus unclear how its implementation could ever be at odds with DHS’s purported goal. Moreover, neither the announcement, nor the Executive Order it cites, gives any indication that DHS has considered how its new policy will impact the VTVPA’s law-enforcement and humanitarian aims, let alone the ‘serious reliance interests’ with which all agencies are required to reckon. …

“The other preliminary injunction factors weigh likewise in favor of relief. …

“For these reasons, and those stated herein, the Court will grant Plaintiffs’ motion and enjoin DHS from relying on the 2025 Policy in the administration of their removal. …

“The Court finds that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed, at a minimum, on their APA claim. The Court’s federal-question jurisdiction is not withdrawn under section 1252(g), and Plaintiffs are likely to show that the issuance of the 2025 Policy, including the rescission of the 2021 Policy, was arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the APA. …

“Plaintiffs assert that DHS’s issuance of the 2025 Policy was arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the APA. … Defendants make no meaningful counter. Nonetheless, the Court tests Plaintiffs’ APA claim and finds it substantial. …

“For purposes of this preliminary injunction, the Court is satisfied that Plaintiffs will be able to show that the 2025 Policy constitutes final agency action. …

“Finally, the Court turns to whether DHS’s decision to issue the 2025 Policy, rescinding the 2021 Policy, was arbitrary and capricious. As noted above, the announcement succinctly stated that ‘it is the policy of the United States to achieve the “total and efficient enforcement of [immigration] laws.”’ In turn, it cited an Executive Order more generally addressing ‘threats to national security and public safety’ and the ‘economic well-being of Americans.’ …

“Here, the record currently before the Court indicates that DHS ‘entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,’ … indeed one that was specifically and explicitly addressed by Congress through the VTVPA and subsequent legislation — that ‘women and children who are victims of [violent and sexual] crimes committed against them in the United States must be able to report these crimes to law enforcement and fully participate in the investigation of the crimes committed against them and the prosecution of the perpetrators of such crimes.’ Nowhere does DHS seem to recognize, let alone address, that withdrawing protections might chill non-citizen cooperation and ‘[weaken] the ability of law enforcement.’ …

“DHS highlights its interest in the ‘total and efficient enforcement of [immigration] laws,’ yet seems to forget that the VTVPA is one of those laws. …

“Based on the preliminary record, the Court finds that the 2025 Policy does not follow from DHS’s stated rationale. Moreover, it ignores congressional findings and closes its eyes to the effects on people like Plaintiffs. Each of these would constitute an independent basis to conclude that the issuance of the 2025 Policy was arbitrary and capricious. …

“The Court finds that, in the absence of an injunction, Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm, including the lost opportunity to receive U visa interim relief. Defendants fault Plaintiffs for their delay in filing this suit. …

“The Court likewise finds that the balance of equities and public interest weigh in favor of relief. …

“For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction is granted. Pursuant to Rule 65(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court hereby preliminarily enjoins Defendants, their agents, and anyone acting in concert or participation with Defendants from implementing, instituting, maintaining, or giving effect to the 2025 Policy, including its rescission of the 2021 Policy, in any form with respect to Plaintiffs until further order issued by this Court.”

Alligator Alcatraz. Guns. Social media.

Legal battles about those and myriad other Florida issues remain unresolved heading into 2026. Here are 10 big legal issues to watch in the coming year:

ALLIGATOR ALCATRAZ: The immigrant-detention center in the Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” has spawned a series of court battles since Florida opened the facility this summer. For example, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is scheduled to hear arguments in April in a case that alleges violations of a federal environmental law. Other cases involve issues such as detainees’ access to attorneys and whether the state has withheld public records.

BOOK FIGHTS: Publishing companies, authors and parents are challenging state and local education officials in federal lawsuits after books were removed from school libraries because of alleged improper content. For instance, a case at the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals challenges a 2023 state law that led to books being removed. Two other pending lawsuits target Escambia County School Board decisions to remove or restrict access to books.

GUNS: Nearly eight years after the measure passed following the mass shooting at Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the U.S. Supreme Court is deciding whether to take up the National Rifle Association’s challenge to a law that prevents people under age 21 from buying rifles and other long guns. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier has taken the unusual step of refusing to defend the law.

IMMIGRATION: A panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments in October about a law that created state crimes for undocumented immigrants who enter or reenter Florida. The state appealed after a U.S. district judge issued a preliminary injunction, ruling the 2025 law was likely preempted by federal immigration authority. It remains unclear when the appellate panel will issue a decision.

MARIJUANA: After falling short in 2024 of passing a constitutional amendment to allow recreational marijuana, the political committee Smart & Safe Florida wants to take the issue back to voters in 2026. But first, it needs to submit enough signatures and get Florida Supreme Court approval of the proposed ballot wording. The court review could turn into a fight, as Gov. Ron DeSantis and Attorney General James Uthmeier oppose allowing recreational marijuana.

SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS: A U.S. district judge in 2026 is expected to rule on the constitutionality of a 2021 Florida law that placed restrictions on social media platforms, such as preventing the sites from banning political candidates. Tech industry groups challenged the law, which passed after Facebook and Twitter, now known as X, blocked President Donald Trump from their platforms after Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

SOCIAL MEDIA RESTRICTIONS: Saying social media was harming children’s mental health, Florida lawmakers in 2024 passed a measure to prevent children under age 14 from opening accounts on certain platforms. Parents would have to give consent for 14- and 15-year-olds to have accounts on the platforms. Industry groups filed a First Amendment challenge and were backed by a district judge. The issue is pending at the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

TRANSGENDER ISSUES: DeSantis’ administration and lawmakers in recent years have approved a series of measures aimed at transgender people, sparking legal battles. For example, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is weighing the constitutionality of a state law and regulations that restrict treatments for people with gender dysphoria. It also is considering a challenge to a ban on Medicaid coverage for hormone therapy and puberty blockers.

UTILITY RATES: The state’s Office of Public Counsel and two consumer groups have gone to the Florida Supreme Court to challenge a decision by utility regulators to approve Tampa Electric Co. base-rate increases that began to take effect in 2025. Meanwhile, the Office of Public Counsel and consumer groups have indicated they likely will also challenge a November decision by regulators to approve a Florida Power & Light base-rate settlement.

WETLANDS: In a case closely watched by conservation and business groups, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia is considering whether the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2020 improperly shifted permitting authority to Florida for projects that affect wetlands. A U.S. district judge sided with conservation groups that challenged the shift. Florida and business groups have defended giving authority to the state.

David Courvelle, 56, entered a plea deal with prosecutors and pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Robert Summerhays.

Courvelle was a contract detention officer at the facility in Evangeline Parish managed by the GEO Group between Jan. 1 and July 30, according to court records.

Around Jan. 1, Courvelle allegedly began a personal, romantic and consensual relationship with a Nicaraguan ward at the detention center.

Between May and July 30, the document states, Courvelle had sexual contact multiple times with the detainee. He purchased gifts and food for the detainee, and gave her photographs of her daughter.

Courvelle allegedly arranged for other detainees to serve as lookouts while he and the detainee with the initials C.H. met in a janitorial closet, Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Johnson said in court.

On July 16, Johnston said, staff at the detention center saw Courvelle and C.H. exiting the janitorial closet. Courvelle was transferred to another detention block and resigned after learning there were recordings of calls between him and C.H.

In a September interview with ICE representatives, Johnson said, Courvelle denied the activity, but about 30 minutes later admitted he had a relationship with C.H.

Courvelle is set to appear April 10, 2026, before Summerhays for sentencing.

He was released Monday on a $10,000 unsecured appearance bond.

Summerhays said Courvelle could face up to 15 years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000, supervised release of up to 3 years and ordered to pay a $100 special assessment.

The petitioners cannot establish that their past persecution or fear of future persecution is on account of a protected ground, so their asylum claims must fail.
The petitioners’ proposed group — ‘Guatemalan small business owners’ — is not meaningfully different from prior groups we have rejected that are defined by economic status or perceived wealth.
Instead, Lopez argues that her identity as a small business owner is an immutable characteristic core to her identity because it allowed her to escape the discrimination she suffered due to her dismembered finger and because the hardware business was a family business.
Because we affirm the BIA’s holding as to the asylum claims, we also reject the petitioners’ withholding of removal claims.","Where the Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed an immigration judge’s order denying applications for asylum, the BIA’s decision should be upheld because the petitioners cannot establish that their past persecution or fear of future persecution is based on a protected ground.

“Edwin David Ramos-Hernandez, his wife Sheyly Cristabel Lopez, and their minor daughter D.Z.R.L. petition for review of a December 11, 2024, decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (‘BIA’), which affirmed an Immigration Judge’s (‘IJ’) order denying their applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (‘CAT’). … We deny the petition and explain why the agency’s ruling was supported by substantial evidence and committed no error of law. …

“Ramos-Hernandez, Lopez, and D.Z.R.L. are citizens of Guatemala who entered the United States on September 8, 2021. …

“We turn first to the petitioners’ asylum applications. …

“Substantial evidence supports the IJ’s determinations against the petitioners. The petitioners cannot establish that their past persecution or fear of future persecution is on account of a protected ground, so their asylum claims must fail. …

“The BIA did not err in affirming the IJ’s determinations that ‘Guatemalan small business owners’ is not a cognizable [particular social group (PSG)] and that the petitioners had failed to show a nexus between the harm they experienced and their second proposed PSG, ‘the Lopez-Ramos-Hernandez nuclear family.’ …

“This court has held that proposed PSGs similar to ‘Guatemalan small business owners’ are not cognizable because they are overly broad and do not implicate an immutable characteristic. …

“We reject the petitioners’ arguments that they fall into exceptions to these rulings. The petitioners’ proposed group — ‘Guatemalan small business owners’ — is not meaningfully different from prior groups we have rejected that are defined by economic status or perceived wealth. The petitioners do not address this caselaw. Instead, Lopez argues that her identity as a small business owner is an immutable characteristic core to her identity because it allowed her to escape the discrimination she suffered due to her dismembered finger and because the hardware business was a family business. However, the record does not compel the conclusion that being a small business owner was fundamental to Lopez’s identity because she studied to be and initially sought employment as a teacher in Guatemala, and she has since worked at a daycare and as a house cleaner in the United States. The petitioners further argue that if their identities as small business owners were not immutable, they ‘would not have operated the business, even as the extortion demands and threats began.’ This argument is circular and, in any event, they testified that they did close down the business shortly after the extortion began.

“Substantial evidence also supports the IJ’s determination that the petitioners failed to establish a nexus between their experienced harm and their membership in the ‘Lopez-Ramos-Hernandez nuclear family.’ The record reflects that the family was extorted because they operated a successful hardware business, not because of kinship itself. Lopez’s own testimony confirms this point, as she was concerned about returning to Guatemala because there ‘have been a lot of attacks happening’ and ‘there is a lot of violence’ — not because of her status as a Lopez-Ramos-Hernandez family member. As our caselaw has repeatedly established, the mere fact that members of the same family were harmed does not establish that the family connection was a central motivation for the suffered harm. …

“Additionally, the agency did not err in finding that the petitioners had not been targeted on account of their anti-gang political views. …

“The BIA also did not err in affirming the IJ’s determination that petitioners failed to establish past persecution. …

“Here, the evidence consists of two to three relatively vague threats and one physical attack that may or may not have been connected to those threats. The IJ had reason to believe that the attack against Ramos-Hernandez was not necessarily related to the prior extortion, particularly given the inconsistency in the record over when the incident occurred and the lack of evidence regarding motive. This court has found that even more severe situations did not constitute persecution. …

“Similarly, substantial evidence supports that the petitioners failed to establish a well founded fear of future persecution. … Given that the petitioners closed their store and remained in Guatemala for approximately two years after receiving the threats with no further incidents, they have not presented credible, direct, and specific evidence supporting a fear of individualized future persecution. Because they have not established membership in a PSG, the petitioners also have not shown a pattern or practice of persecution of a similarly situated group on account of a protected ground. …

“… The petitioners here have not presented additional specific evidence explaining why they cannot relocate, beyond general conditions of corruption and violence in Guatemala. …

“The burden of proof required for withholding of removal is higher than that for asylum. Therefore, ‘a noncitizen who cannot meet the lower asylum standard will necessarily fail to make out a counterpart claim under the higher standard for withholding of removal.’ López-Pérez v. Garland, 26 F.4th 104, 111 (1st Cir. 2022). Because we affirm the BIA’s holding as to the asylum claims, we also reject the petitioners’ withholding of removal claims. …

“As to their CAT claims, the agency correctly determined that the petitioners did not meet their burden of presenting a preponderance of the evidence showing that if they returned to Guatemala, they ‘would be subject to torture by or with the acquiescence of a government official.’ … Substantial evidence supported the IJ’s conclusion that there was no objectively reasonable basis to believe that the petitioners would be harmed at all upon their return to Guatemala, given that they lived peacefully without incident for more than a year after closing their business. In light of that finding, the record does not compel the conclusion that the petitioners would face torture by anyone upon their return. Similarly, the IJ’s factual finding in the context of the petitioners’ asylum claims that they had failed to establish that relocation in Guatemala would be unreasonable also supports denial of their CAT claims. …

“For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review of the decision of the BIA is denied.”

While community defense efforts in large urban metropolises such as Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago, and Portland have attracted the most media coverage, anti-ICE activity is also thriving in Republican-controlled states like Texas and North Carolina.

Many grassroots groups in conservative-leaning states are documenting their own work on Instagram, using social media accounts as hubs to update local communities on ICE activity, recruit volunteers, and announce trainings. They may face a more challenging terrain than those organizing in Democratic-controlled states, given the active collaboration of law enforcement agencies with ICE.

While red state anti-ICE organizing may be less likely to feature whistles, bullhorns, and other confrontational tactics seen in cities like Chicago and Los Angeles, common themes are emerging, consistent with organizing in liberal cities. The anti-ICE playbook in red states involves creating a hotline for residents to report ICE activity, “Know Your Rights” sessions that give people legal advice on what information they should withhold when confronted by ICE, and ICE-watch trainings for observers documenting arrests. Many groups are also ensuring that the families of those arrested and detained have legal and financial support.

This non-comprehensive roundup of anti-ICE activities is an indication of how widespread resistance to fascism became in 2025.

North Carolina

In North Carolina cities such as Raleigh and Charlotte, a grassroots organization called Siembra NC is leading efforts to protect community members from ICE. Siembra NC was founded in 2017 in direct response to the first Trump administration and offers a hotline for residents reporting ICE arrests, as well as abusive employers and landlords. If ICE agents attempt to enter people’s home or car, Siembra NC advises locking the door and starting a livestream on social media to document the interaction.

In an Instagram post in mid-November, Siembra NC also documented its members showing up outside grocery stores in Charlotte when ICE agents arrested shoppers. Volunteers who were trained as part of Siembra NC’s “Safe to Work, Safe to School” patrols ensured that those being arrested were informed of their right to remain silent and knew not to sign any documents.

In a piece for Teen Vogue, Siembra NC’s co-executive director Nikki Marín Baena explained how her organization began training people in the parking lots of immigrant neighborhoods on how to identify ICE agents. “After a volunteer confirmed an officer’s identity, they would alert neighbors to the agent’s presence, and our dispatch team would send a text message to our contacts in the area,” she wrote. Siembra NC’s efforts are effective. According to Baena, “in every case we worked on, when the agents realized they were being watched, they abandoned their stakeout.”

Having learned how to respond to anti-immigrant attacks in Trump’s first term, Siembra NC has published a downloadable playbook as part of its “Defend and Recruit” campaign, and on July 23, held a virtual event specifically designed for organizers in red states engaged in ICE-watch activities.

Pennsylvania

The People’s Defense Front (PDF) in Northern Appalachia, which is located in central Pennsylvania, offers community defense trainings against “police violence, landlord cruelty, white supremacists and abusive bigots.” Its Instagram account documents the August 19 arrests of 26 workers by ICE agents and state troopers. Labeling the effort as “Know Your Enemy,” PDF published photos of those armed agents and asked community members for help in identifying them.

PDF offers a Centre County Rapid Response Network hotline for community members to report ICE activity, and recruits volunteers to sign up for and get trained in conducting anti-ICE patrols. “We patrol every morning and night,” said the group in an online post, and “maintain close contact with workers and the community.”

PDF is also collaborating with the Student Committee for Defense and Solidarity (SCDS) in State College where Penn State’s campus is located, and where ICE activity was documented in July 2025. SCDS explained in a post that, “In confronting ICE through our patrols, we raise the cost of ICE’s violence with the aim to undercut their power and deter their presence in the area.”

Texas

In Dallas and Fort Worth, Vecinos Unidos DFW is holding “Know Your Rights” and ICE-watch trainings, and organizing people by neighborhoods. “People who know both how to defend their rights and how immigration agents are operating nearby are less likely to be separated from their families,” said the group on Instagram. Like many other organizations, they have a community defense hotline that people can call to report ICE activity.

Vecinos Unidos DFW also began a court watch program after immigrants were arrested when they showed up to their court dates. The grassroots organization is calling on local residents to be present at immigration hearings. “With ICE activity picking up in our area,” said Vecinos Unidos DFW on Instagram, “it’s crucial to stay vigilant and learn our rights to protect ourselves and our neighbors.” The group is also organizing people to prevent Dallas police from cooperating with ICE agents, and raising funds as mutual aid for immigrant families who have been separated by detention and deportation.

Alabama

The Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice, along with other organizations local to Birmingham, has set up an ICE-watch program called Bham Migra Watch, alerting local communities of the locations, times, and dates of ICE arrests.

In September 2025, after dozens of people were arrested in Russellville, Franklin County, on their way to work, the group urged people to call their hotline with any information or requests for legal and other help.

Bham Migra Watch also informs residents of their rights if they are approached by ICE agents, and recruits volunteers to sign up for trainings for “all Birmingham friends interested in fighting against ICE aggression,” and for those located in Montgomery and Montevallo to “fight for the community around you.”

Florida

Defensa Gulf Coast is a Florida-centered effort in and around Pensacola, describing itself as a group “formed to defend our immigrant neighbors against the racist deportation machine.” Operating out of the “Pensacola Liberation Center,” Defensa Gulf Coast has participated in efforts to shut down the notorious immigrant jail known as “Alligator Alcatraz,” and, like other groups, established a hotline to report ICE sightings.

Tennessee

An effort centered in Nashville called Music City Migra Watch is encouraging local residents to carefully document ICE activity and send it to them. The group conducts ICE-watch and court-watch trainings “meant to empower our community, build safety, and support those who need it most.” It also supports trainings in surrounding localities including Springfield, Murfreesboro, and Mount Juliet. Beyond local community defense, Music City Migra Watch is leading a boycott of Avelo Airlines, a company known for collaborating with ICE to transport arrested immigrants.

Looking Toward Resistance in 2026

Given the increasing number of U.S. citizens caught in ICE’s dragnet, organizers are warning that attacks on immigrants are just the beginning. Siembra NC’s Baena issued a challenge to those who want ICE out of their communities, saying, “How many of us would it take to put the focus on the attacks that will touch nearly every American, not simply those terrorizing immigrants?”

After a year of ICE violence, groups like hers are bracing themselves for increased staffing at the federal agency and a greater armed presence on city streets. The 2025 “Know Your Rights” sessions and trainings on anti-ICE defense offer a strong foundation for local communities to ramp up activism in many forms. “We are more ready than ever if ICE accomplishes its goal of hiring 600 percent more officers,” said Baena.

And readiness means expanding activities from the streets to the halls of power. “In 2026 we are going to switch from ‘defense’ to ‘offense,’ ensuring we don’t simply watch out for ICE agents but create the conditions necessary to hold elected officials accountable for guaranteeing dignity for everyone in our state,” Baena promised.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2246351093.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 13:57:12.372348

Shortly after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, Mr. Doan, a staunch Democrat, lost his job as a software engineer with a company that produces video game competitions.","How has President Trump done over the course of 2025?

For some voters, 2025 was a great year for the country. For others, it was a depressing, unaffordable slog. And one person definitely regretted his vote.

The Times asked voters whom we have followed over the last 18 months just what they thought of the last year.

Almost everyone agreed that the year was big and chaotic. After that, they splinter in some interesting and surprising ways.

The mayor of the small border town of Roma, Jaime Escobar Jr. said he believes Mr. Trump has made strides in his first year in office to control border crossings.

Mr. Escobar, a longtime Democrat, voted for Mr. Trump after years of what he described as chaos at the border.

“I think Trump is doing a good job,” he said. “He just needs more time.”

When it comes to the economy, he said he is confident that Mr. Trump can improve affordability if Republicans can keep control of Congress after the midterms. Gas prices, he said, have already come down.

“I see steady progress,” Mr. Escobar said.

Mr. Escobar is not without criticism.

“I’ve always been very pro-law enforcement,” he said. But he added that he is troubled by some of the videos and photographs of ICE agents aggressively detaining migrants. He hopes to see more humane treatment of migrants with long ties to the United States who do not have criminal records.

“The only thing that matters to him is himself.”

Erwin McKone, 55, Flint, Mich.

Erwin McKone, who works in agribusiness sales, voted for Mr. Trump last November, a bit reluctantly. He describes himself as a moderate who felt Democrats had failed to control the southern border.

But he is alarmed over Mr. Trump’s actions in 2025.

Mr. McKone said he thinks the administration’s approach to border security has been needlessly draconian.

His top concerns, however, are the president’s rhetoric, narcissism and the transactional nature of his politics, he said. “The only thing that matters to him is himself,” he said. “And then maybe the people who pay the bills.”

He worries about what the years ahead may bring. “There are times that I struggle to remain positive when I look at this administration and how the United States and our Constitution and Congress and the Senate are changing,” he said.

— Ernesto Londoño

Matthew Dugie, a union construction worker, agonized over his vote before casting his ballot for Kamala Harris. He regretted it almost immediately.

“I wasted a vote,” he said.

He is a rare voter — a 2020 Trump supporter who voted for Ms. Harris in 2024.

But he is largely happy with Mr. Trump’s approach to his second term. He gives Mr. Trump credit for imposing tariffs to try to bring back domestic manufacturing, and said he feels that a bold chief executive is now running the country.

“He’s got answers, and he’s got direction, and he’s more of a leader,” Mr. Dugie said.

He disagrees with Mr. Trump’s strikes on boats in the Caribbean and does not want to see the United States start a war in Venezuela.

But he has plenty of construction work from hospitals and data centers, and says his retirement account is up about 11 percent since last year.

And this year, he said, he even indulged in a four-day trip to Las Vegas.

“I think it’s going to be a long three years.”

Sharon Reed, 78, with her husband, Bob Reed, 79, Central Pennsylvania

For Bob and Sharon Reed, both retired schoolteachers, the issue with Mr. Trump all along has been less about what he plans to do and more about how he does it.

They are Republicans, and mostly agree with the president’s goals, like shrinking the government and strengthening the border. That is why they voted for him, with reservations.

But it’s Mr. Trump’s bulldozing style that is their problem: the scale and speed of his actions, the rhetoric that accompanies them and the turmoil that inevitably follows.

The Reeds, for instance, support weeding out government fraud, but Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency “didn’t go after the fraud,” Ms. Reed said. “They just fired people.”

They support strengthened immigration enforcement, but not ICE’s aggressive tactics that meant “some innocent people get swept up with it,” Mr. Reed said.

Their list goes on.

Still Mr. Reed is, on balance, pleased enough. “I think he’s trying to work for the betterment of the country,” Mr. Reed said.

Ms. Reed is not so pleased.

She does not regret her vote, given her options, but she just keenly hopes for better choices the next time around.

“I think it’s going to be a long three years,” she said.

Though she voted for Kamala Harris, Veronica McCloud believed Mr. Trump deserved support from all Americans and she was willing to give him a chance.

Ms. McCloud, a retired English teacher, said she even found herself agreeing with some of the president’s decisions. But his manner was the issue. Ms. McCloud, for instance, supported trimming government waste, but thought the widespread firing of federal employees was callous and reckless. She believes in securing the country’s borders and deporting criminals, but the images of ICE agents aggressively rounding up immigrants, including children, left her heartbroken.

“So much fighting and pointing fingers,” she said. “And the president is always blaming Biden, always looking backward.”

“I am disappointed, particularly with the way he speaks to women and women of color,” she added. “The name calling has to stop.”

She said she has been most affected by the rising cost of food. She rarely buys beef now.

“Going to the grocery store is miserable,” she said. “I find myself going aisle by aisle and saying ‘I will wait on this for the next paycheck.’”

“I wish we could have a president that is doing what Trump is doing, but one that is not so divisive.”

Perry Hunter, 56, Sellersburg, Ind.

Perry Hunter, a high school teacher who voted for Mr. Trump, has been pleased with nearly all of the president’s decisions, including the aggressive way he has handled deportations, his demolition of the East Wing of the White House and his attacks on Venezuelan boats allegedly carrying drugs.

And he said that Democrats just don’t want to agree with Mr. Trump on anything.

“If he said drinking Drano was bad for you, there would be people going on to drink Drano, just to prove him wrong,” he said.

But he doesn’t like that Mr. Trump has been rude — especially when commenting about the killing of the filmmaker Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner.

“I wish we could have a president that is doing what Trump is doing,” he said, “but one that is not so divisive.”

— Juliet Macur

Annabelle Collins, an independent who supported Ms. Harris, has mixed feelings about the past year. “Not every aspect was horrible,” she said.

As a Venezuelan immigrant who moved to the United States as a child, she is against the Trump administration’s tactics for detaining undocumented immigrants who have lived in the country for decades.

“There has to be a better way to do those things,” Ms. Collins, 37, said.

At the same time, she said, President Trump’s aggressive immigration policy has helped her husband, who is a border patrol agent.

“I know he’s in a safer place,” she said.

“It’s been slow change.”

Charles Vaughters, 25, Laramie, Wyo.

Charles Vaughters, a Marine veteran and college student who considers himself conservative, says that the country has improved — but just “marginally.”

“It’s been slow change,” he said. “It takes a long time to steer the ship.”

He said Mr. Trump could do a better job at deporting migrants who arrived in the country illegally and that ICE “needs to ramp up its numbers.”

He also does not support Mr. Trump’s decision in September to continue H-1B visas, meant for foreign workers who fill specialized roles, even with a new $100,000 fee per worker.

He thinks the program should be ended. His friends who are computer science majors, he said, are worried about finding jobs.

“I don’t think Trump’s ever going to do that,” he said, “because he has a lot of friends in big tech who benefit immensely from that program.”

— Juliet Macur

When asked what words sum up the first year of the second Trump term, Sam Consiglio did not hesitate.

“Uncertainty, confusion and disorderly,” said Ms. Consiglio, 22, a moderate Democrat who voted for Kamala Harris in 2024. “In the past year, we don’t really know what to expect as citizens.”

On top of that, she added, “a lot of the problems that we had a year ago are still problems today,” citing the price of groceries.

But the tone from the White House troubles her most. To Ms. Consiglio, a president should be a steadying force: “One who calms those nerves,” she said.

Mr. Trump’s behavior, however, is “very different from what you would expect from a president.”

— Kurt Streeter

For Thien Doan, there is no doubt that life feels much worse than it was a year ago. Shortly after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, Mr. Doan, a staunch Democrat, lost his job as a software engineer with a company that produces video game competitions. To save money, he rented out his condo and moved in with family. It took him about six months to land a new position, but he still has not moved back into his own home.

“The job market out there is just really, really bad.”

The lawmakers warned that the proposed rule would create widespread fear and confusion within immigrant communities, leading families to avoid medical care, nutrition assistance and housing support even when they qualify under federal law.
The lawmakers cited recent legislation, including the 2025 reconciliation law, which deliberately preserved access to key public programs for specific immigrant populations.
For these reasons, the legislators urged the Trump administration to abandon the proposed rule and retain the 2022 regulations that align with congressional intent, protect public health and ensure that families are not punished for accessing lawful, life sustaining assistance.
Several New York City agencies have also publicly condemned the proposed rule, citing concerns about its potential impact on public health, housing stability and immigrant well being.","Senior immigration leaders in the United States Senate and House of Representatives have strongly criticized a proposed rule by President Donald Trump that would penalize Caribbean and other immigrant families for lawfully accessing health care, food assistance and housing support.

In a formal regulatory comment submitted to the United States Department of Homeland Security, the lawmakers opposed the proposed Public Charge Ground of Inadmissibility rule, warning that it unlawfully rewrites longstanding immigration law and would discourage immigrant families from using essential public benefits to which they are legally entitled.

The comment was submitted by Congressman Jamie Raskin, Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security and Enforcement, Congressman Robert Scott, Ranking Member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, Senator Dick Durbin, Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Alex Padilla, Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Border Security and Immigration, and Senators Bernie Sanders and Ron Wyden.

The lawmakers argued that the proposal seeks to bypass congressional authority by altering the definition of public charge, a term that for more than one hundred and thirty five years has applied only to individuals who are primarily dependent on government assistance for subsistence. They warned that a public charge determination can directly affect an immigrant’s eligibility to enter or remain in the United States.

According to the legislators, the Trump administration’s proposal would penalize immigrants for using supplemental benefits such as health care, nutrition assistance and housing programs that Congress intentionally made available to support working families. They stated that the Department of Homeland Security is attempting to administratively redefine public charge in violation of congressional intent, despite repeated legislative decisions rejecting such changes.

The members noted that Congress has revised immigration law multiple times without ever expanding the definition of public charge to include the lawful use of non cash benefits. They emphasized that federal agencies have long recognized programs such as Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and housing assistance as tools that promote public health, food security and housing stability, enabling families to remain economically self sufficient.

The lawmakers warned that the proposed rule would create widespread fear and confusion within immigrant communities, leading families to avoid medical care, nutrition assistance and housing support even when they qualify under federal law. They noted that the Department of Homeland Security itself acknowledged in the proposed rule that the policy could result in poorer health outcomes, increased poverty, housing instability and greater reliance on emergency rooms for basic care. These impacts, they said, would extend beyond immigrant households to affect communities across the United States.

They further stated that Congress has consistently determined immigrant access to public benefits through eligibility rules rather than by penalizing individuals for adjusting their immigration status based on lawful benefit use. The lawmakers cited recent legislation, including the 2025 reconciliation law, which deliberately preserved access to key public programs for specific immigrant populations.

For these reasons, the legislators urged the Trump administration to abandon the proposed rule and retain the 2022 regulations that align with congressional intent, protect public health and ensure that families are not punished for accessing lawful, life sustaining assistance.

Zachary Segal, a BU undergraduate student, became the target of harassment after posting on X that he contacted U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to report what he believed to be violations of federal immigration law.

There is nothing unlawful about reporting suspected violations of federal law. Yet, thousands of individuals, including fellow BU students, sent Mr. Segal threatening messages and covered campus with posters labeling Segal a “racist and fascist.” One poster displayed across the campus states that people like Segal have “no place” on BU’s campus.

Mr. Segal received multiple death threats, including messages stating, “If I ever see you i’m [expletive] killing you and leaving ur dead body on the sidewalk”; “I’ll be waiting outside your little event tonight”; and “We’re coming for you.” One message referenced the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, threatening, “Here’s to hoping you’re the next to get Kirked.”

Rather than defend Segal, Boston University instructed Segal not to attend classes and placed the burden on him to arrange academic accommodations himself, effectively admitting it could not ensure his safety on campus. At the same time, BU officials issued critical public statements and refused to condemn the threats or announce concrete safety measures.

Boston University’s response violates its duty of care under Massachusetts law and contradicts its own published commitments to protect free expression and protect students from harassment. Because the University has acknowledged it cannot safely accommodate Mr. Segal in Boston, AFL has demanded a reasonable accommodation — allowing him to transfer to Boston University’s Washington, D.C. program for the remainder of his education.

The Illinois case is the first one of several state legal challenges over National Guard deployments to be ruled on by the high court.
A state court in Tennessee ruled in favor of Democratic officials who sued to stop the ongoing Guard deployment in Memphis.
The Trump administration has appealed the California and Oregon rulings to the 9th U.S.","The Supreme Court last week decided not to overrule a lower court decision that blocked the deployment of National Guard troops in the Chicago area.

Justices on Dec. 23 declined the Trump administration’s emergency request to overturn the earlier ruling by U.S. District Judge April Perry. In her ruling, Perry said the Trump administration had no power to use troops to support its immigration crackdown.

Last Tuesday’s ruling was the second defeat for the president’s effort to send troops to assist in its anti-immigration campaign. An appeals court earlier also refused to overturn Perry’s ruling.

Justices heard arguments in the case more than two months ago. The high court order is not a final ruling but it could affect other lawsuits challenging President Donald Trump’s efforts to deploy the military in other Democratic-led cities.

“At this preliminary stage, the government has failed to identify a source of authority that would allow the military to execute the laws in Illinois,” the high court majority wrote.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, said he narrowly agreed with the decision to keep the Chicago deployment blocked.

Three conservative justices — Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch — publicly dissented.

The outcome was a rare Supreme Court setback for Trump, who had won repeated victories in emergency appeals since he resumed residence in the White House in January.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker applauded Tuesday’s decision as a win for the state and country.

“American cities, suburbs, and communities should not have to face masked federal agents asking for their papers, judging them for how they look or sound, and living in fear that the President can deploy the military to their streets,” he said.

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson defended Trump’s decision to activate the National Guard to protect federal personnel and property from “violent rioters.”

Alito and Thomas said in their dissent that the court had no basis to reject Trump’s contention that the administration needed the troops to enforce immigration laws. Gorsuch said he would have narrowly sided with the government based on the declarations of federal law enforcement officials.

The administration originally sought the order to allow the deployment of 300 troops from Illinois and 200 from Texas.

The Trump administration argued that the troops were needed “to protect federal personnel and property from violent resistance against the enforcement of federal immigration laws.”

In her ruling, Perry wrote that she found no substantial evidence that a “danger of rebellion” is brewing in Illinois and no reason to believe the protests there had gotten in the way of Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Perry initially blocked deployment for two weeks. But in October, she extended the order indefinitely while the Supreme Court reviewed the case.

The Illinois case is the first one of several state legal challenges over National Guard deployments to be ruled on by the high court.

District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb is suing to halt the deployments of more than 2,000 guardsmen in the nation’s capital.

A federal judge in Oregon has permanently blocked the deployment of National Guard troops there, and all 200 troops from California were being sent home from Oregon, an official said.

A state court in Tennessee ruled in favor of Democratic officials who sued to stop the ongoing Guard deployment in Memphis.

In California, a lower court judge in September said deployment in the Los Angeles area was illegal.

Our Investment Funds Team breaks down the potential impact of the Court’s decision on funds and market participants.

The ruling could increase litigation risk for funds and fund sponsors

Investors could challenge a wide range of fund contracts, including governance and advisory arrangements

The lack of clear time limits could expose older agreements to renewed challenges

On December 10, 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in FS Credit Opportunities Corp. v. Saba Capital Master Fund Ltd. to resolve a circuit split over whether investors have a private right of action under Section 47(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The case centers on closed-end fund bylaws adopting Maryland “control-share” voting limitations and has broad implications for funds that fall, directly and indirectly, under the 1940 Act.

The Supreme Court granted certiorari to decide whether Section 47(b) of the 1940 Act includes an implied private right of action allowing private litigants to seek rescission of contracts that allegedly violate the 1940 Act. The question comes to the Court following decisions in the Second Circuit that recognize a private right of action, in contrast to decisions from the Third and Ninth Circuits, which have found no private right of action under Section 47(b).

By resolving this circuit split, the Court’s decision could materially affect investors’ ability to sue funds directly over allegedly unlawful contracts.

Litigation Background

The dispute stems from challenges brought by Saba Capital to several closed-end funds organized under Maryland law. Those funds adopted bylaws opting into certain voting rights provisions under the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act (MCSAA). Under the MCSAA, once a shareholder acquires at least 10% of a fund’s shares, the shareholder is prohibited from voting shares above that threshold unless two-thirds of the remaining shareholders affirmatively approve the additional voting rights.

Saba Capital filed a declaratory judgment action in the Southern District of New York, asserting that the voting rights provisions violated Section 18(i) of the 1940 Act, which requires that every share of stock issued by a fund subject to the Act be a voting stock with equal voting rights.

Before Saba’s suit, the Second Circuit held as an issue of first impression in Oxford University Bank v. Lansuppe Feeder LLC that the 1940 Act contains an implied private right of action for rescission under Section 47(b). Relying on that precedent, the district court granted summary judgment in Saba’s favor, rescinded the challenged contracts, and found that the voting rights provisions violated the 1940 Act. On appeal, the Second Circuit affirmed, creating a split with the Third and Ninth Circuits.

Key Legal Issues Before the Court

The Supreme Court granted review to decide whether Section 47(b) of the 1940 Act contains an implied private right of action for rescission.

Recent Supreme Court precedent has closely scrutinized statutory language and required unambiguous congressional intent to create a private right of action. The Court may also address the applicability of its decision in Transamerica Mortgage Advisors v. Lewis, which found an implied right of action for rescission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, a statute enacted with the 1940 Act.

The parties and amici have advanced competing views on whether Section 47(b) supports a private right of action.

Potential Implications for Market Participants

A decision recognizing a private right of action under Section 47(b) could materially expand funds’ litigation exposure. As amici, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have argued to the Supreme Court, with an implied private right of action, private litigants would likely have the opportunity to challenge a vast array of an investment company’s contracts, including governance documents and bylaws, advisory and sub-advisory agreements, securities issuances, and contracts with service providers and other third parties.

The decision could also affect shareholder engagement dynamics for closed-end funds and business development companies (BDCs) and could indirectly affect private fund structures if 1940 Act provisions are implicated. Because Section 47(b) does not contain a statute of limitations, there is a significant risk that companies could face retrospective rescission and related collateral consequences. For long-standing companies, assessing this risk may require examination of its internal structures, investment history, and contractual arrangements.

Bottom Line

The Supreme Court’s decision in FS Credit Opportunities could significantly reshape the enforcement landscape under the 1940 Act by either opening or closing the door to private rescission claims under Section 47(b). Registered funds, BDCs, private fund complexes, and their counterparties should consider proactively assessing contractual portfolios, governance frameworks, and disclosure practices to prepare for either outcome and be ready to implement responsive measures once the decision is issued.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15546_5043.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 10:58:26.329973

By the 1970s, Filipino healthcare workers were being trained and exported to the US as skilled labor, said Valerie Francisco-Menchavez, a sociology professor at San Francisco State University and author of Caring for Caregivers: Filipina Migrant Workers and Community Building During Crisis.
‘We care about people’ Healthcare workers know better than anyone what it means to live on borrowed time.","In the Philippines, she spent three years providing end-of-life care for a family’s grandmother. When the grandmother died, family members told the healthcare worker to arrange her own way to the United States, where they operated home healthcare facilities.

In California, they promised, she would have a place to stay and a stable job. They would look after her just as she had cared for their grandmother.

In 2018, the caregiver – who asked to be identified as Bella – arrived in Los Angeles on a tourist visa. She imagined herself working in healthcare facilities tucked in verdant hills or in beach communities.

Instead, Bella, 57, said she landed in a shadow network of home healthcare jobs. She was shuttled among multiple facilities to avoid compliance checks and paid a fraction of a living wage. One job lasted eight months, she said, and paid $30 a day for 24-hour patient care.

“I’m thinking: ‘How could I live with that situation?’” said Bella. In Filipino culture, the concept of utang na loob, or a deep-seated sense of obligation to repay kindness, kept Bella tied to the family that she said ultimately exploited her labor and left her undocumented in the US.

To break free, Bella lived in a church for months. Many in the same situation fall deeper into the cracks of a system ripe for abuse, but Bella eventually joined a workers’ rights group that provided immigration and social services. She now earns just enough as a part-time independent home caregiver to pay taxes and rent a small room with a one-window view.

That fragile sense of stability has been shaken by news of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arresting people who look like her at workplaces and at immigration check-in appointments.

“It’s too much,” Bella said about the anxiety of the ICE arrests. She limits trips outside of home for essentials – which include work – because patients rely on her care.

In the US healthcare system, Filipinos make up a large percentage of the workforce – 4% of registered nurses are of Filipino descent, which is more than double the Filipino American population, according to National Nurses United.

The large number of Filipinos in healthcare work includes undocumented people, who fill workforce gaps and care for ailing people. Approximately 2% of undocumented immigrants in the US are from the Philippines, according to data from the Migration Policy Institute.

Amid heightened levels of immigration arrests, many Filipino healthcare workers say they are providing essential care while in the grips of anxiety over their own safety.

ICE agents have walked past Veronica Velasquez, a physical therapist, in the hallways of the Los Angeles hospital where she works. Her heart raced each time. The Philippines native was brought to the US when she was 11 years old and granted temporary protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program. She understands intimately the fear and vulnerabilities of the undocumented community.

“This is a hospital that’s supposed to be for the community, and it does not feel safe,” said Velasquez, 33. “This is supposed to be a healing space. This is supposed to feel like a space where I should feel safe. This is my place of work, and it 100% does not feel that way.”

A history written in care

The presence of Filipinos in the US healthcare industry is part of a centuries-long history tracing back to the US occupation of the Philippines.

In the mid-20th century, nursing education exchange programs were set up between the US and the Philippines. By the 1970s, Filipino healthcare workers were being trained and exported to the US as skilled labor, said Valerie Francisco-Menchavez, a sociology professor at San Francisco State University and author of Caring for Caregivers: Filipina Migrant Workers and Community Building During Crisis.

Many schools and universities in the Philippines today offer nursing programs that help graduates find healthcare jobs in other countries. In the US, Filipino caregivers are part of the backbone of a healthcare system facing critical labor gaps, said Aquilina Soriano Versoza, founder and executive director of the Pilipino Workers Center of Southern California.

“[Caregivers] wouldn’t be coming here if there weren’t the need for the labor,” said Versoza.

Some immigrate on skilled worker visas or, like Bella, overstay tourist visas. Both paths leave caregivers vulnerable, especially since many support families back home.

Christina Fadriga knows the trade-offs. To provide for her four children, she made the solo journey to the US in 2006 to work as a caregiver.

“I’m proud to be a caregiver in America,” said Fadriga, 60. But lately, the ICE raids have put her caregiving community on edge. As a green card holder, Fadriga is required to split her time between the US and the Philippines to maintain her permanent resident status. Her children are grown now, but she always feels torn about her nomadic existence – especially now.

There’s a lot of fear in the community, said Fadriga. Fed by news and social media posts about ICE arrests and detentions – which have included permanent residents and US citizens – friends advised her not to return to the US.

Others urged her not to be afraid.

“But how can you not be afraid?” said Fadriga.

‘We care about people’

Healthcare workers know better than anyone what it means to live on borrowed time.

“Today you’re sick. Tomorrow, it could be someone else. The next day, it could be my mom or me,” said Angelica Mateo, a licensed vocational nurse and a contract specialist with SEIU-UHW at Kaiser Permanente’s Los Angeles area clinics.

Mateo, who immigrated as a child and became a US citizen in 2021, said her immigrant background made her especially attuned to patients’ anxieties.

“We got into this career because we care about people,” said Mateo, 39. “We never did it with the mentality of, like: ‘I’m going to be the best nurse for citizens only.’”

Almost 60,000 people are in ICE detention, according to federal data. In one case, a longtime green card holder was detained at a Seattle airport after visiting the Philippines.

Such stories ripple quickly through the Filipino American community, where being undocumented has its own unofficial name in Tagalog: “TNT” – tago ng tago, or “always hiding”.

Velasquez, the LA physical therapist, tries to be a reassuring presence for this community in hiding. She posts videos explaining patients’ rights and how to seek support if treating patients under ICE detention.

“We are human beings, just like any other citizen or non-citizen,” said Velasquez. “We are just here trying to survive, just like everyone else.”

Living and working in the grips of heightened immigration enforcement has taken a toll on Bella’s mental health, especially in hiding. Sometimes she imagines speaking directly with leaders in charge of immigration policies.

In those times, she imagines asking a simple question: do you have elderly parents or children who need care?

If so, chances are, in those homes, domestic workers just like her are performing most of the household care duties.

So, where is the utang na loob or sense of obligation to repay kindness for this kind of essential work?

“Most of the caregivers who are here, we are not here to harm America,” said Bella. “We are a help in this country.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80f0cecb67b81c6ae7571782c25a19e4a1884cf8/0_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=71bf6fe789bd4050bf4797aa7227cee8",N,,2025-12-29 11:12:10.457576

The data present a more nuanced picture than recent commentary might suggest, and especially those who contend that the Roberts court is overly deferential to executive power.","Empirical SCOTUS is a recurring series by Adam Feldman that looks at Supreme Court data, primarily in the form of opinions and oral arguments, to provide insights into the justices’ decision making and what we can expect from the court in the future.

Much recent commentary has suggested that the Roberts court is overly deferential to executive power – especially under President Donald Trump. The Niskanen Center, for example, contends that the court “is enabling Trump’s executive authority,” while the Brennan Center argues that the court has given “the president the power of a king.” But is this narrative supported by the empirical record? At the very least, is the Roberts court more deferential to presidential power than past courts? Our preliminary answer, like much else having to do with this court, is that it’s complicated.

What we looked at

The Supreme Court’s treatment of cases involving the presidency has long interested scholars of separation of powers. Indeed, research shows that justices who were appointed by the current president tend to favor that executive at higher rates than other justices. Other work examines how the court responds to perceived presidential overreach, finding that institutional constraints on executive power vary with the court’s composition.

This is in line with what is known as the attitudinal model, which suggests that judicial behavior reflects ideological preferences rather than neutral legal reasoning; in other words, that justices vote in favor of presidents with whose political ideology they agree. Along those lines, recent empirical work has demonstrated that partisan polarization affects judicial decision-making, with the justices increasingly dividing along party lines in politically salient cases.

This analysis builds on these foundations by examining support for the United States as a party on the merits docket. Support rates are calculated as the percentage of votes cast in favor of the United States’ position based on underlying data from the Supreme Court Database. Specifically, the analysis examines these rates across chief justice eras, by the political party of the appointing president, and by individual justices through the end of the 2024-2025 term.

Historical patterns: the long view

Figure 1, below, shows the number of cases involving the United States per term from 1803 through 2024. The pattern reveals dramatic growth through the early 20th century, peaking at 79 cases in the 1891 term during the court of Chief Justice Melville Fuller (1888-1910). This expansion reflected the growing reach of federal power and the court’s expanding docket. The mid-20th century saw continued high volumes, with the court of Chief Justice Earl Warren (1953-1969) often having over 40 such cases per term. Since the early 1980s, however, the overall number of cases has declined substantially as the court has reduced its total docket, although cases involving the United States remain a significant portion of the court’s work.

Figure 2, below, displays the total number of cases involving the United States by chief justice. Fuller’s dominance reflects both his relatively long tenure (of over two decades) and, again, the explosion of federal litigation in the late 19th century. The Warren court comes second with 619 cases, followed by the court of Chief Justice Edward Douglass White (1910-1921) with 526. Among recent chief justices, William Rehnquist (1986-2005) presided over 330 cases while John Roberts has seen 250 such cases through the 2024 term. As noted above, however, the Roberts court’s lower count likely reflects the court’s generally smaller docket rather than any reduced federal government presence.

Support for the United States by chief justice era

The next figure presents support rates for the United States across chief justice eras. The modern pattern shows considerable variation. The courts of White and Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase (1864-1873) led with 70.4% and 70% support for the United States, respectively, followed by the court of Chief Justice William Howard Taft (1921-1930), himself a former president, at 66.33%. Fuller, despite deciding the most cases, supported the government at 64.74%. Among more recent courts, that of Warren E. Burger (1969-1986) supported the United States 64.09% of the time, while Rehnquist’s was at 63.01%.

The famously liberal Warren court is notable for its 52.74% support rate – among the lowest of any chief justice era. This makes some sense: this relatively low rate came during a period of significant expansion in individual rights and skepticism toward government power. The Roberts court falls even nearer the bottom, however, at 49.39%.

Finally is the court under Chief Justice John Marshall (1801-1835). Given Marshall was generally considered a proponent of federal power, it is of some surprise that his court shows a historically low 40.74% support rate for the United States. That said, this may reflect the limited scope of federal authority in the early republic and the nascent state of executive power during that era more than anything else.

The partisan dimension

The next chart breaks down support for the United States by chief justice and the party of the appointing president. The analysis is limited to chief justices since 1900 in order to focus on the modern era of more developed executive power.

As the data reveals, when one party held a durable edge in appointments, the court’s support for the United States tended to be higher. For example, in the early 1900s (the Fuller, White, and Taft courts), the bulk of the justices were Republican appointees, reflecting that party’s dominance of the presidency for long stretches around the turn of the century. It’s thus unsurprising that the court frequently voted in favor of the administration during this period. What’s more striking is how high the U.S. win rate was under Democratic administrations even with a Republican-appointed bench, such as in the White court era – an indicator that, during this period, the court’s general receptiveness to federal power often outweighed any simple party alignment.

These percentages decreased during the court of Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes (1930-1941). This era began with a bench still heavily shaped by earlier Republican administrations, but which rapidly became a Roosevelt-appointed court after the late 1930s (and FDR’s successive terms). By the time of the courts of Chief Justices Harlan Fiske Stone (1941-1946) and Fred M. Vinson (1946-1953), the story is more straightforward: the overwhelming majority of the justices were Democratic appointees (almost all entirely appointed by FDR, in Stone’s case), during Democratic terms.

That brings us to the Warren era. Although the Warren court is remembered as liberal, its roster was mixed – containing many Roosevelt/Truman appointees, but then supplemented by Republican Eisenhower appointees (including Warren himself) alongside later Kennedy/Johnson picks.

For the Burger and Rehnquist courts, the figure shows a clearer correlation between the party of the appointing president and the court’s support for the presidency than is present in the early-mid century: Both eras feature higher pro–U.S. rates under Republican administrations than Democratic ones. That pattern is broadly consistent with the reality that, over the long run of each court, Republican appointees held a durable edge in the voting coalitions that most often formed majorities. But the gap is also modest, especially under Rehnquist, where even a court with a Republican-appointed tilt still delivered substantial executive wins under Democratic presidents.

By the time Roberts became chief, the partisan structure is clearest. The bulk of the court is Republican-appointed and has been so since Roberts’ appointment as chief justice. There, a noticeably higher win rate for the United States under Republican administrations is consistent with the conventional wisdom about a Republican-appointed majority court.

Stepping back, the trend looks like a shift from weak partisan sorting to stronger partisan sorting over time. In the early 1900s and much of the mid-century, appointing-party composition helps explain some variation, but high United States win rates under both parties point to a court whose baseline posture toward federal power often dominated partisan alignment. Over time – especially by the late 20th century and then more sharply in the Roberts era – the relationship between the party of the appointing president and differential success for Republican versus Democratic administrations becomes more pronounced. The most plausible interpretation is that the docket and the parties’ legal agendas became more ideologically sorted: Modern Democratic and Republican administrations more often defend positions that map onto the court’s ideological cleavage, so the appointing-party composition has come to increasingly predict which administration will fare better in contested, high-salience government cases.

Individual justices and the current Roberts court

The voting patterns of current Roberts court justices deserve closer examination given contemporary debates about executive power. The following figure shows the overall top and bottom 15 justices by their support rate for the United States among those with at least 25 votes in such cases.

Among the current justices, none appear in the top 15. At the bottom there is a mix of the court’s conservative and liberal wings. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, often viewed as part of the court’s liberal wing, voted for the government 43.16% of the time. This places her just a touch above fellow liberal Justice Elena Kagan, who voted in favor of the government 42.29% of the time and significantly ahead of Justice Neil Gorsuch, one of the more conservative justices, who supported the government’s position less than 37% of the time, perhaps in line with his libertarian instincts. (The average support for the government across all justices with 25 or more votes was 55.82%.)

Further focusing on the current justices we see the following:

With the exception of Gorsuch, the conservative justices, led by Justice Samuel Alito, provide the highest support for the government. Roberts is right in the middle at 51.43%.

Moving to support for Republican versus Democratic administrations, across the Roberts court every justice shown is more likely to vote for the United States when a Republican administration is in office, though the size of that gap varies, as demonstrated by the chart above. The largest partisan swings appear for Kagan (a Democratic appointee with a relatively low pro-United States rate under Democratic administrations but, interestingly, a much higher rate under Republican ones) and Gorsuch (a Republican appointee whose pro-United States rate jumps sharply under Republican administrations). Roberts and Sotomayor also show sizable gaps favoring Republican administrations.

At the same time, the chart underscores that party alignment isn’t a complete explanation. Alito, who is a Republican appointee and considered strongly conservative, is highly pro-United States under both parties, just markedly more so under Republican administrations – consistent with a justice who is broadly receptive to government authority or law enforcement positions but especially aligned with conservative stances. The votes of Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh, and Clarence Thomas, also all Republican appointees, reflect a baseline willingness to side with the government but less so than Alito. (Jackson, a Democratic appointee, appears only under Democratic administrations here.) While the pattern may fit conventional expectations for a court with a durable Republican-appointed majority in which Republican administrations benefit more often, the magnitude depends on each justice’s jurisprudential commitments and the ideological content of the government’s positions in the cases that actually reach the merits docket.

So what does this tell us?

The data present a more nuanced picture than recent commentary might suggest, and especially those who contend that the Roberts court is overly deferential to executive power. Indeed, this court’s 49.39% support rate for the United States is below the historical average and substantially lower than the courts led by Fuller, Taft, Warren, Burger, and Rehnquist – that is, all the courts since 1900.

The partisan analysis also reveals some interesting patterns. Republican-appointed courts since 1900 have generally supported the government at higher rates during Republican presidencies, though the Roberts court shows lower overall support rates than its predecessors regardless of which party controls the White House. This could reflect polarization in case selection, with more controversial executive actions reaching the court, or genuine changes in judicial philosophy about executive power.

That said, several important limitations must be acknowledged. First, and perhaps most significantly, this analysis excludes the shadow docket. Emergency applications and stays have become increasingly important in recent years, particularly for cases involving significant issues relating to immigration, pandemic response, and other executive actions. The shadow docket may tell a separate story about deference to executive power, and analyzing it requires accounting for different legal standards and procedural postures.

Second, we have excluded cases involving agency deference where the United States was not directly a party. We have also not examined cases where the president or a cabinet member’s name is in the case caption instead of the United States (such as those over presidential immunity) or where other government officials may be a named party. I plan to do so in a follow-up study.

Third, the analysis does not distinguish between Trump’s two presidencies. During Trump’s first term, the Roberts court decided numerous cases involving his administration. The current term remains in its early stages with limited data. Separating these periods might well reveal different patterns.

Fourth, the analysis treats all cases involving the United States equally, without accounting for issue area, case importance, or the strength of the government’s legal position. Criminal cases, civil litigation, and constitutional challenges might present different voting patterns, and a more granular analysis could reveal that the court is deferential in some domains but not others (and might also help explain why even certain Democratic-appointed justices favor the United States in Republican versus Democratic administrations – something quite notable but beyond the scope of the current article).

Finally, examining whether support is Trump-specific or party-specific requires additional work. The clustering of current justices around similar support rates suggests that partisan differences may be less pronounced than in earlier eras, but this could also reflect the types of cases reaching the court or the strength of legal arguments presented. Additionally, since the sample size for the current court composition is still relatively low, comparisons between this court and previous eras will become clearer as the justices work through more cases.

The bottom line

Despite claims to the contrary, the Roberts court, rather than showing exceptional deference to executive power, actually falls below the historical average in its support for the federal government when it appears as a party on the merits docket.

But perhaps what most emerges from a historical analysis is a complex picture that resists simple narratives. The court’s relationship with executive power varies across eras, reflects changing understandings of federal authority, and appears influenced by both partisan considerations and broader jurisprudential trends. At the very least, this initial analysis provides a foundation for deeper examination of these patterns and their implications for the separation of powers in these politically fraught times.",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/PXL_20231002_1955025892-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 10:58:33.511303

A WBEZ and Sun-Times analysis of ICE detention data made available by the Deportation Data Project through mid-October finds the number and rate of self-deportations among detainees booked into Broadview appears to have soared during the first five and a half weeks of Operation Midway Blitz.
The analysis focused on detainees who were initially booked into the Broadview facility, which appears by name as “Broadview Service Staging” in the data.
However, a department spokesperson strongly denied that there are “subprime conditions” or barriers to legal counsel for detainees at Broadview.
The analysis indicates recent arrestees who began their ICE detention at Broadview were sent to facilities all over the country, more than 57 facilities in 14 different states.","In just a few months, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in west suburban Broadview has transformed from an immigration holding center that rarely booked more than 10 people a day to a de facto detention center processing dozens of detainees during almost all hours of the day.

People held there have described a litany of inhumane conditions: overcrowded and unsanitary holding cells; not enough food and water; and freezing conditions at night.

They were also signing a form to voluntarily leave the country — to self-deport — at alarmingly high rates, according to a WBEZ and Chicago Sun-Times analysis of recently released federal data. Legal experts said, in many cases, detainees at Broadview were coerced into signing paperwork before even speaking to a lawyer.

“They’re agreeing to voluntary departure, but the voluntary part is not accurate,” said Samuel Cole, chief immigration litigation counsel at ACLU Illinois. “They’re not knowingly and truly voluntarily agreeing to give up the rights to fight their case.”

Cole said some detainees sign the voluntary departure form to escape difficult conditions in Broadview and don’t understand what legal options are available to them.

A WBEZ and Sun-Times analysis of ICE detention data made available by the Deportation Data Project through mid-October finds the number and rate of self-deportations among detainees booked into Broadview appears to have soared during the first five and a half weeks of Operation Midway Blitz.

From Sept. 8 through Oct. 15, at least 154 people who were initially booked into Broadview have self-deported, more than nearly every other ICE detention facility in the nation during that time.

That’s about 36% of all detainees booked into Broadview during that period who were no longer in ICE detention as of Oct. 15, faster than the 11% self-deportation rate during Trump’s second term before the immigration blitz began and much faster than a rate of 6% during the last year of the Biden administration.

The self-deportation rate among those booked into Broadview during the first five and a half weeks of the Chicago-area immigration enforcement campaign was also faster than it was nationwide. Among all detainees initially booked into any ICE facility from Sep. 8 to Oct. 15, the rate of self-deportations was about 19%, nearly half of what it was for those initially detained at Broadview.

WBEZ and the Sun-Times defined individuals as self-deportees if the data indicated they had left ICE detention, had a date they departed the country and had “3-Voluntary Departure Confirmed” as their case status. The analysis focused on detainees who were initially booked into the Broadview facility, which appears by name as “Broadview Service Staging” in the data.

Questions about DHS provided data

Data released this month was a result of a lawsuit won by the Deportation Data Project and offers the first detailed data about those detained at Broadview during the first five and a half weeks of the feds’ Chicago-area immigration enforcement blitz. ICE collects data on every person it arrests, detains and deports, but the agency stopped regularly publishing metrics in January.

Still, some advocates are also concerned about the accuracy of data published by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the parent agency for ICE.

“Some data on the number of people who were detained in Broadview just doesn’t match, for example, how many sandwiches were ordered,” said Cole with the ACLU. “There are significant differences.”

Why are self-deportations up?

Cole, who served as a federal immigration judge for nearly 10 years before formally stepping down this fall, said the use of voluntary departure has significantly shifted under the Trump administration.

Before, an immigration judge would determine if a person was “removeable,” and then offer the option of voluntary departure. Now, people are getting arrested and almost immediately “coerced” into signing voluntary departure paperwork, Cole said.

People are presented with forms before even talking to a lawyer and often in a language they don’t understand, Cole said. And these could be people who have valid ways to stay in the country but do not know it.

They’re told their options are to sign the papers and leave or wait in detention, potentially for weeks, until a judge can hear their case, according to Cole.

“The end result is people feel that they’re being forced to take voluntary departure without having an ability to talk to a lawyer, without having their case presented to an immigration judge,” Cole said.

By design, the conditions inside Broadview have also forced some to quickly self-deport, according to Alexa Van Brunt, director of the MacArthur Justice Center’s Illinois office.

“The administration’s deportation machine was built with cruel intentions and complete disregard of humanity,” said Van Brunt in a written statement to WBEZ and the Sun-Times.

“By subjecting detainees to intolerable conditions and by using tactics of coercion and misrepresentation, people are self-deporting instead of being held in ICE facilities. It’s clear that this administration is more interested in meeting its arbitrary, self-imposed deportation quotas instead of giving detainees an opportunity to make their case in U.S. courts,” wrote Van Brunt.

DHS did not respond to a request to clarify the data. However, a department spokesperson strongly denied that there are “subprime conditions” or barriers to legal counsel for detainees at Broadview.

“All detainees are provided with 3 meals a day, water, and have access to phones to communicate with their family members and lawyers,” said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, in an email to WBEZ. “No one is denied access to proper medical care. There is a privacy wall around the toilet for detainees.”

Last week, DHS also announced a $3,000 stipend and a paid one-way plane ticket for people who chose to self-deport through a government app before the end of the year.

“We encourage every person here illegally to take advantage of this offer and reserve the chance to come back to the U.S. the right legal way to live American dream. If not, you will be arrested and deported without a chance to return,” McLaughlin wrote.

Detainees held at Broadview increased sharply during the blitz

During the first five and a half weeks of Operation Midway Blitz, 1,854 people were booked into Broadview, more than almost every other facility in the country. Only hold rooms in Dallas and Montgomery, Ala., took in more detainees during that time.

Broadview was never designed to serve as a detention center. The processing center, which contains four holding rooms, was intended to hold people picked up by immigration authorities for no more than 12 hours.

In late June, ICE quietly expanded the maximum time people could be held in processing centers like Broadview to 72 hours, or three days.

But a Sun-Times and WBEZ investigation found officials were often holding immigrants at Broadview beyond the 72-hour mark.

The MacArthur Justice Center and Roger Baldwin Foundation of ACLU filed a class action lawsuit against the Trump administration in October, alleging Broadview was a “black box in which to disappear people from the U.S. justice and immigration systems.”

Former detainees testified that 100 people were crammed into a holding room at one time. They also said they were given no hot meals or places to sleep. One former detainee broke down explaining how he’d have to wake people up to go to the bathroom at night because they were sleeping beside the toilet.

U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman issued a temporary restraining order requiring ICE to provide people bedding, “sufficient space to sleep,” adequate hygiene supplies and three full meals with water. Gettleman also ordered ICE to ensure detainees had access to lawyers and a phone.

A WBEZ and Sun-Times analysis shows the number of people held at Broadview at 5 a.m. each day, based on detainee book-in and book-out times, increased sharply after Operation Midway Blitz began in September, and exceeded 100 people on more than a dozen days.

Under the Biden administration, people detained at Broadview were typically sent to detention facilities in the Midwest. In 2024, the last full calendar year of the Biden administration, more than 90% of people detained at Broadview were sent to the Clay County Justice Center in Brazil, Ind., or the Dodge County Jail in Juneau, Wis., according to a WBEZ and Sun-Times analysis of federal data obtained by the Deportation Data Project.

In a written statement to WBEZ and the Sun-Times, a DHS spokesperson said the agency makes facility determinations based on bed space to ensure detainees’ “presence for immigration proceedings or removal from the United States.”

But the facilities to which detainees are sent often are far from where they were arrested and many are likely outside of the court jurisdiction where their cases are being heard, advocates said. The analysis indicates recent arrestees who began their ICE detention at Broadview were sent to facilities all over the country, more than 57 facilities in 14 different states. “[It’s] undoubtedly because of how many people are detained right now,” Cole said. “They’re constantly battling crowding at facilities, and they’re moving people around because of it.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c37b82b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7716x4405+0+371/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa1%2Fd4%2F17fad7f340f5b78e207651c24a18%2Fbroadviewcurfew-111425-01.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 10:58:38.481381

Pennsylvania.

The article, “The worst Supreme Court case you’ve never heard of, and what it tells us about Trump’s immigration enforcement,” recounts the 1837 case of Edward Prigg and other slave catchers who, under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793, kidnapped Margaret Morgan, a free Black woman, and her children from Pennsylvania and took them to Maryland.

In the years that followed, Pennsylvania enacted a “personal liberty law” requiring slave catchers to appear before a state magistrate before removing alleged fugitives from the state. Under this law, Prigg initially brought the Morgan family before a magistrate but was denied authorization to remove them because Jerry Morgan was “clearly free,” while Margaret’s legal status was disputed.

Pennsylvania later prosecuted Prigg after he returned while Jerry was away, abducted Margaret and the children, and transported them to Maryland without authorization. Despite the prosecution, the Supreme Court struck down the statute. Justice Joseph Story, writing for the court, ruled that states could not impose restrictions on slaveholders reclaiming enslaved people under the Constitution’s fugitive slave clause, except to prevent a “breach of the peace or any illegal violence.”

The SCOTUSblog article emphasizes how this ruling left Black people in free states unprotected from abduction, violence and other humanitarian harms, including those who were legally free. The author writes, “We don’t know what happened to Margaret and her children,” adding that Jerry Morgan never learned their fate despite desperately trying to find them. This decision, which stripped states of the power to protect their residents, is presented as a parallel to present-day immigration enforcement.

The article cites reports of families separated during immigration actions, noting that the author “cannot look at that picture without thinking of Jerry Morgan,” referring to an image of a man crying outside a Chicago-area ICE facility after his wife was taken. One need not equate immigration enforcement with slavery, she writes, “to recognize the inhumanity of what is occurring.”

Approximately 6 million children — about 82% of whom are U.S. citizens — have at least one parent who is undocumented, with more than 14 million U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents also living with an undocumented immigrant. These figures support the article’s reference to reports that the Trump administration set a quota of 3,000 detentions per day.

With people being “seized by armed and masked men” and denied the chance to establish their legal status, contact loved ones or say goodbye, the article critiques the reasoning and implementation of the civil laws the administration uses as a framework. The author argues this approach “devastates families, communities, and businesses, and spreads massive fear.”

The piece also notes that President Donald Trump ordered agents to focus on Somali communities in the Minneapolis–St. Paul area and describes Somali immigrants as “garbage.” This language raises concerns about racial profiling in immigration enforcement, with the article pointing out that federal agents have relied on factors such as apparent Hispanic ethnicity, speaking Spanish, location and type of work to establish “reasonable suspicion” of unlawful presence.

According to the article, Justice Brett Kavanaugh has endorsed this reasoning by writing that U.S. citizens and lawfully present noncitizens would be only “briefly detained” long enough to establish their status, citing Noem v. Perdomo Vasquez. In contrast, the article notes that U.S. citizens in ICE custody have been held “sometimes for extended periods and sometimes repeatedly,” with agents refusing to accept proof of citizenship or lawful status.

The article also cites findings by U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis in her examination of “Operation Midway Blitz” in Chicago, which documented immigration agents firing pepper balls at unarmed protesters and journalists, deploying tear gas into crowds and vehicles without warning, and physically assaulting observers and demonstrators. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit later stayed Ellis’ injunction, the author notes, though “not because they doubted her factfinding.”

These incidents, along with the shooting of two individuals in Chicago, one of whom died, underscore the extent to which the author argues federal agents are exercising power beyond their roles. The article further cites an instance of law enforcement rappelling into an apartment building at night and removing residents without warrants.

Detainees have reported being held in “filthy and overcrowded spaces” without adequate medical care, bedding, food or access to lavatories. The article states that detainees are sometimes pressured, under threat or physical force, to sign “voluntary” deportation papers without lawyers and that many are unable to read the documents, which are often only in English.

Critiquing the immigration court system and its placement within the Department of Justice, the opinion piece describes the situation as one where “the boss of the prosecutor” is also “the boss of the judge.” Several immigration judges have been fired under the administration, the author writes, despite a backlog of roughly 3.8 million cases.

Those judges include individuals who grant asylum at higher-than-average rates, a context the article says makes Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s posting for a “Deportation Judge” particularly troubling. The SCOTUSblog piece emphasizes that “there is in fact no such job” in federal law.

In concluding, the author reflects on historical and contemporary forms of resistance. In the 19th century, slave-catcher watches and community rescues helped advance protective efforts even when courts struck down laws. Such actions, described as “acts not only of protest and solidarity, but also of constitutional vision and commitment,” are framed as part of a tradition that eventually led to the Reconstruction Amendments.

Similarly, the author writes, today has seen the rise of mutual aid and activism, including whistleblowing, filming enforcement actions and sustained support for families affected by immigration enforcement, offering a counterweight amid ongoing humanitarian concerns.

The reduction follows a trend in immigration courts nationwide and constitutes, critics say, an attack on the rule of law that will lead to yet more delays in an overburdened court system.

The reduction in immigration judges has come as the administration scaled up efforts to deport immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. Trump administration officials have described the immigration court process, in which proceedings can take years amid a backlog of millions of cases, as an impediment to their goals.

Nationwide, there were 735 immigration judges last fiscal year, according to the Executive Office for Immigration Review, the arm of the Justice Department that houses immigration courts. At least 97 have been fired since President Trump took office and about the same number have resigned or retired, according to the union representing immigration judges.

California has lost at least 35 immigration judges since January, according to Mobile Pathways, a Berkeley-based organization that analyzes immigration court data. That’s down from 132. The steepest drop occurred at the San Francisco Immigration Court, which has lost more than half its bench.

“A noncitizen might win their case, might lose their case, but the key question is, did they receive a hearing?” said Emmett Soper, who worked at the Justice Department before becoming an immigration judge in Virginia in 2017. “Up until this administration, I had always been confident that I was working in a system that, despite its flaws, was fundamentally fair.”

The administration intends to fill some judge positions, and in new immigration judge job listings in Los Angeles, San Francisco and elsewhere seeks candidates who want to be a “deportation judge” and “restore integrity and honor to our Nation’s Immigration Court system.”

The immigration judges union called the job listings “insulting.”

Trump wrote on Truth Social in April that he was elected to “remove criminals from our Country, but the Courts don’t seem to want me to do that.”

“We cannot give everyone a trial, because to do so would take, without exaggeration, 200 years,” he added.

The National Assn. of Immigration Judges said it expects a wave of additional retirements at the end of this month.

“My biggest concern is for the people whose lives are left in limbo. What can they count on when the ground is literally shifting every moment that they’re here?” said Amber George, who was fired last month from the San Francisco Immigration Court. “Our government institutions are losing their legitimacy.”

Because immigration courts operate under the Justice Department, their priorities typically shift from one presidential administration to the next, but the extreme changes taking place have renewed longtime calls for immigration courts to become independent of the executive branch.

The Trump administration recently added 36 judges; 25 of them are military lawyers serving in temporary positions.

This summer, the Pentagon authorized up to 600 military lawyers to work for the Department of Justice. That took place after the department changed the requirements for temporary immigration judges, removing the need for immigration law experience.

The Department of Justice did not respond to specific questions, but said judges must be impartial and that the agency is obligated to take action against those who demonstrate systemic bias.

Former judges say that, because terminations have happened with no advance notice, remaining court staff have often scrambled to get up to speed on reassigned cases.

Ousted judges described a pattern: In the afternoon, sometimes while presiding over a hearing, they receive a short email stating that they are being terminated pursuant to Article II of the Constitution. Their names are swiftly removed from the Justice Department website.

Jeremiah Johnson is one of five judges terminated recently from the San Francisco Immigration Court.

Johnson said he worries the Trump administration is circumventing immigration courts by making conditions so unbearable that immigrants decide to drop their cases.

The number of detained immigrants has climbed to record levels since January, with more than 65,000 in custody. Immigrants and lawyers say the conditions are inhumane, alleging medical neglect, punitive solitary confinement and obstructed access to legal counsel. Requests by immigrants for voluntary departure, which avoids formal deportation, have surged in recent months.

Many of those arrests have happened at courthouses, causing immigrants to avoid their legal claims out of fear of being detained and forcing judges to order them removed in absentia.

“Those are ways to get people to leave the United States without seeing a judge, without due process that Congress has provided,” Johnson said. “It’s a dismantling of the court system.”

The judges in San Francisco’s Immigration Court have historically had higher asylum approval rates than the national average. Johnson said grant rates depend on a variety of circumstances, including whether a person is detained or has legal representation, their country of origin and whether they are adults or children.

In November, the military judges serving in immigration courts heard 286 cases and issued rulings in 110, according to Mobile Pathways. The military judges issued deportation orders in 78% of the cases — more often than other immigration judges that month, who ordered deportations in 63% of cases.

“They’re probably following directions — and the military is very good at following directions — and it’s clear what their directions are that are given by this administration,” said Mobile Pathways co-founder Bartlomiej Skorupa. He cautioned that 110 cases are a small sample size and that trends will become clearer in the coming months.

Former immigration judges and their advocates say that appointing people with no immigration experience and little training makes for a steep learning curve and the possibility of due process violations.

“There are multiple concerns here: that they’re temporary, which could expose them to greater pressure to decide cases in a certain way; and also they lack experience in immigration law, which is an extremely complex area of practice,” said Ingrid Eagly, an immigration law professor at UCLA.

Immigration courts have a backlog of more than 3 million cases. Anam Petit, who served as an immigration judge in Virginia until September, said the administration’s emphasis on speedy case completions has to be balanced against the constitutional right to a fair hearing.

“There are not enough judges to hear those cases, and this administration [is] taking it upon themselves to fire a lot of experienced and trained judges who can hear those cases and can mitigate that backlog,” she said.

Complementary bills introduced in the U.S. Senate and House this month by Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Rep. Juan Vargas (D-San Diego) would prevent the appointment of military lawyers as temporary immigration judges and impose a two-year limit of service.

“The Trump administration’s willingness to fire experienced immigration judges and hire inexperienced or temporary ‘deportation judges,’ especially in places like California, has fundamentally impacted the landscape of our justice system,” Schiff said in a statement announcing the bill.

The bills have little chance in the Republican-controlled Congress but illustrate how significantly Democrats — especially in California — oppose the administration’s changes to immigration courts.

Former Immigration Judge Tania Nemer, a dual citizen of Lebanon and the U.S., sued the Justice Department and Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi this month, alleging that she was illegally terminated in February because of her gender, ethnic background and political affiliation. In 2023, Nemer ran for judicial office in Ohio as a Democrat.

Bondi addressed the lawsuit in a Cabinet meeting.

“Most recently, yesterday, I was sued by an immigration judge who we fired,” she said Dec. 2. “One of the reasons she said she was a woman. Last I checked, I was a woman as well.”

Other former judges have challenged their terminations through the federal Merit Systems Protection Board.

Johnson, of San Francisco, is one of those. He filed his appeal this month, claiming that he was not given cause for termination.

“My goal is to be reinstated,” he said. “My colleagues on the bench, our court was vibrant. It was a good place to work, despite all the pressures.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b4474f3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6051x3177+0+430/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb5%2F28%2F87bc0f50449f9db96dc4ba93022b%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2219062487,N,,2025-12-29 08:56:46.982499

☂️Possible rain with highs in the 40s. Sunset is at 4:19 p.m.

Federal immigration officers have detained thousands of people in Massachusetts this year, part of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation policies. About 70% of the immigrants detained nationwide between January and October had no criminal record, according to government data. While some people have been deported and some remain in custody across the country, others have been released, seen their cases dropped, or are out on bond while they await future court hearings. Today we have four stories from people detained locally and released back to their New England communities, as reported by GBH News’ Sarah Betancourt, who has been following these cases all year.

After detention: What life’s been like for four immigrants in New England

GBH News reporter Sarah Betancourt has been following the cases of immigrants detained in Massachusetts this year. Here are the stories of four people detained and released, and how they’re doing now.

Rümeysa Öztürk, the Tufts graduate student detained on the street outside her apartment in Somerville and kept in federal custody for 45 days — sometimes without access to her asthma medication — is now working on her Ph.D. dissertation, her attorney said. “Really, it’s an example of how she is really dedicated to her Ph.D. related to child study and human development,” her attorney Mahsa Khanbabai said on GBH’s Boston Public Radio. Öztürk still has ongoing legal cases: an immigration court case through which the U.S. government attempted to deport her and a case in federal court in which she challenged her detention.

Khanbabai noted that Öztürk’s case shows the vast power the U.S. government has over immigrants: the Trump administration revoked Öztürk’s student visa without her knowledge and detained her after she co-wrote an op-ed for the Tufts student paper about Israel’s war in Gaza. “Essentially it means Secretary [of State Marco] Rubio can say, ‘I don’t like that person for whatever reason. And I’m going to revoke their visa,’” Khanbabai said.

Marcelo Gomes da Silva, the Milford High School student detained while driving to volleyball practice over the summer, said he’s focusing on his senior year of high school and thinking about college. “In the beginning it was obviously hard because my parents were super nervous. They were really scared,” Gomes da Silva told Betancourt. “But after time it slowly started getting better because we were able to do things that have to do with our documentation, like apply for asylum and things like that. So slowly things have been getting better.”

He said his memories of the ICE detention center in Burlington, where he slept on concrete in one room with 35 other men and did not have access to hygiene supplies, “will never go away.” He’s been advocating for other immigrants in detention. “I wanna go to college for political science and hopefully go to law school. I’m really interested in being a politician and I feel like if I educate myself more and more, I will be able to help others around me,” he said.

June 12: Inside ICE custody in Burlington: Milford teen shares his story

Lucas Dos Santos Amaral has welcomed a son, Theo, since his release from ICE custody. He’s also been singing gospel in churches across New England and has a valid work permit. His next court hearing is two years away, in the winter of 2027. “We are ending another year united and stronger, because I believe that this battle I faced will serve the benefit of all of us immigrants,” Dos Santos Amaral said in a message to Betancourt. “Our Christmas will have a taste of victory and gratitude.”

The ICE agents who pulled him over in January were looking for a different person, and local elected officials at the time said it appeared they pulled over Dos Santos Amaral because they had racially profiled him. He was taken to ICE detention in Plymouth, then moved to Texas. After a judge ordered him released, ICE let him out without his identification, so friends flew to Texas to bring him documents so he could travel back to his family — his pregnant wife and their first daughter — in Massachusetts.

“My life has never been the same — those were frightening and traumatic days, hope was scarce, but my faith in God never wavered,” he said.

March 24: Marlborough father recalls ‘nightmare’ of ICE detention as he adjusts to life back in Mass.

Fabian Schmidt, a New Hampshire resident and Green Card holder, was detained at Logan airport in March, where he says he was violently interrogated and denied the ability to contact his family, an attorney, or the embassy for his home country, Germany. Federal authorities kept him in custody for two months, then dropped his case and released him.

The weekend of his release, Schmidt proposed to his partner. They’ve since gotten married and Schmidt returned to work. “I love this country so much. My daughter, my wife, my whole life is here,” he told Betancourt. “So I’m trying to become an American as soon as possible. And if there was some kind of magic trick to make that happen now, I would totally sign my paperwork.”

He said he feels the trauma of the experience. He’s developed stomach ulcers because of the stress.

“Honestly, I don’t think that’s gonna fade for quite a while. I think about it every day. Every day, I think about my own pain — It still makes an impact on me for sure,” he said.

The judge says Carlitos Ricardo Parias, who goes by Richard LA online, was denied access to his lawyers while being held in detention.

He also cites the government's failure to meet discovery deadlines, including the timely release of body camera footage of the shooting.

ORIGINAL REPORT: TikToker shot by federal agents, deputy US marshal hit by ricochet bullet during South LA operation

The shooting happened in the 400 block of East 20th Street near Trinity Street around 8:52 a.m. Federal officials said it began as a targeted enforcement traffic stop on an undocumented immigrant who had previously avoided capture.

Agents accused Parias of ramming his car into their vehicles after they boxed him in, but video from the scene raises questions about their claims.

In a statement back in October, Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), said Parias ""weaponized his vehicle and began ramming the law enforcement vehicle in an attempt to flee. Fearing for the safety of the public and law enforcement, our officers followed their training and fired defensive shots.""

Parias was accused of ramming his Toyota Camry into law enforcement vehicles in front of and behind him after they boxed him in. First Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said Parias spun the car's tires, spewing smoke and debris into the air and causing the car to fishtail, ""causing agents to worry for their safety.""

Essayli said an agent broke into his side window, but it wasn't enough to subdue Parias. That's when an agent opened fire.

Parias was shot once in the elbow, and a deputy U.S. marshal was shot in the hand by a ricochet bullet, according to DHS.

His trial was supposed to start on Tuesday. He was charged with assault on a federal officer.

The judge dismissed the indictment with prejudice, preventing prosecutors from refiling the same charges.

But, Parias could remain in detention as his immigration case moves forward.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18053849_102125-KABC-FED-AGENTS-SHOOTING-SPLIT-TN-2-img.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-12-29 07:57:03.885749

It’s the most rapid loss in legal status for immigrants in recent United States history, experts in immigration policy told States Newsroom. The Trump administration curtailed legal immigration by terminating Temporary Protected Status for more than 1 million immigrants and ending Humanitarian Parole protections for half a million more individuals.

“I don’t think we’ve ever, as a country, seen such a huge number of people losing their immigration status all at once,” said Julia Gelatt, the associate director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute.

The move to strip so many immigrants of their work authorization is likely to not only affect communities, but also batter the economy, both immigration and economic experts told States Newsroom.

“Seeing well over 1 million people lose their work authorization in a single year is a really huge event that has ripple effects for employers and communities and families and our economy as well,” Gelatt said.

Dozens of lawsuits have been filed by immigrant rights groups and TPS recipients themselves challenging the terminations as unlawful.

“This is the continuation of the Trump administration attack against the immigrant community, and specifically about the TPS program, a program that, for many of us has been a good program, a life-saving program,” said Jose Palma, a TPS recipient from El Salvador and coordinator of the National TPS Alliance, which is part of several TPS lawsuits.

Who is granted Temporary Protected Status?

A TPS designation is given because a national’s home country is deemed too dangerous to return to due to violence, war, natural disasters or some other unstable condition.

When Congress created the program in 1990, it was initially meant to be temporary, which is why authorizations can be as short as six months and as long as 18 months.

Immigrants who are granted TPS must go through background checks and be vetted each time their status is renewed, but the program does not provide a path to citizenship.

Under the Biden administration, the number of TPS recipients grew, as did the category of humanitarian parole.

That policy decision was heavily criticized by Republicans, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem vowed to reevaluate TPS country designations for terminations during her Senate confirmation hearing this year.

“This program has been abused and manipulated by the Biden administration, and that will no longer be allowed,” Noem said during her hearing.

Before the Trump administration came into office in late January, there were more than 1.3 million immigrants in the TPS program, hailing from 17 countries. Under the first Trump administration, there were roughly 400,000 TPS recipients.

“Almost a million new people got onto TPS protections under President Biden, so we saw a really rapid expansion, and now we’re seeing a very rapid contraction, which is all to say that in the first Trump administration, there weren’t so many people who had TPS,” Gelatt said.

Noem has terminated TPS for immigrants from 11 countries, and the more than 1 million immigrants affected will lose their protections by February.

Noem extended six months’ protection for South Sudan earlier this year, but decided in November to terminate protections by January. She most recently terminated a TPS designation for Ethiopia on Dec. 12.

The other countries with TPS termination are Afghanistan, Burma, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria and Venezuela.

“We’ve never seen this many people lose their legal status in the history of the United States,” David Bier, the director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said. “This is totally unprecedented.”

People losing their status are also concentrated in certain areas. Florida has more than 400,000 TPS recipients, and Texas has nearly 150,000. Bier said he expects certain industries with high TPS workers to feel the impact, such as construction and health care.

Haiti, Venezuela

Immigrants from two countries — Haiti and Venezuela – make up a majority of recipients set to lose their TPS protections, at nearly 935,000 people.

Venezuelans, who make up 605,000 of those 935,000 TPS recipients, were first granted protections during Trump’s first term.

On his final day in office in 2021, his administration issued 18-month deportation protections for Venezuelans — known as Deferred Enforcement Departure, or DED — citing the country’s unstable government under President Nicolás Maduro.

“Through force and fraud, the Maduro regime is responsible for the worst humanitarian crisis in the Western Hemisphere in recent memory,” according to the Jan. 19, 2021 memo. “A catastrophic economic crisis and shortages of basic goods and medicine have forced about five million Venezuelans to flee the country, often under dangerous conditions.”

After the Trump administration’s 18-month DED designation, the Biden administration issued the TPS designation for Venezuelans who came to the U.S. in 2021 and again in 2023. The move created two separate TPS groups for Venezuelans.

“The bottom line is that removing the 935,000 Venezuelans and Haitians would cause the entire economy to contract by more than $14 billion,” said Michael Clemens, a professor in the Department of Economics at George Mason University.

He added that not all the TPS recipients are in the labor market. Some are children or elderly dependents who cannot work. Clemens said the TPS workforce population of Haitians and Venezuelans is about 400,000.

Humanitarian Parole program

Separately, under the Biden administration, nearly 750,000 immigrants had some form of humanitarian parole, granting them work and temporary legal status due to either Russia’s war in Ukraine or efforts by the administration to manage mass migration from Central American countries.

DHS has moved to end humanitarian parole for 532,000 immigrants hailing from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, opening them up for deportation proceedings.

“The onslaught of attacks that we’ve been seeing on temporary forms of immigration status, specifically with a humanitarian focus, is truly saddening and concerning,” said Alice Barrett, a supervising immigration attorney at the immigrant rights group CASA.

Not every recipient has been affected. The agency has kept humanitarian parole for 140,000 Ukrainians who came to the United States after Russia’s invasion in 2022, and 76,000 Afghans who were brought in after the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from their country.

But since the National Guard shooting last month in Washington, D.C., allegedly by an Afghan national granted asylum, the program is under increased scrutiny and all immigration-related paperwork from Afghans has been halted.

Court decisions influential

This is not the first time the Trump administration has tried to end TPS.

During the president’s first term, he tried to end TPS for Haiti, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Sudan, but the courts blocked those attempts in 2018.

This time is different, said Palma of the National TPS alliance.

“The only thing different right now is that the Supreme Court is allowing the Trump administration to continue with termination of TPS, even though lower courts are saying, ‘No, we should stop the cancellation of TPS for now, until it’s clear whether the decision was illegal or not,’” he said.

So far, in emergency appeals, the high court has allowed the Trump administration to move forward in stripping legal status for the two groups of Venezuelan TPS recipients and individuals in the humanitarian parole program.

Barrett at CASA, which is leading the legal challenge of TPS termination for Cameroon and Afghanistan, said when it comes to TPS termination, “what we are seeing in the second Trump administration is a supercharged version of what we saw in the first Trump administration.”

“We are essentially seeing during this administration more actual terminations happening early on even while litigation is pending, which has certainly been disappointing for members of the community, because they’re still left in this limbo,” she said.

Barrett added that even when TPS recipients try to apply for longer-term legal status they face multiple hurdles.

“For example, we are seeing them questioned or denied relief at asylum interviews because they did not apply for asylum within one year of entering the United States, even though the Code of Federal Regulations clearly creates an exception to this one-year filing deadline for people who have been in other valid status before applying for asylum,” Barrett said.

“These members of our community who have been in lawful status therefore now risk being placed in removal proceedings and even (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) detention, where conditions are increasingly inhumane and dangerous,” she continued.

TPS recipients are still continuing to fight in the courts and share their stories, Barrett said.

“These cases are still in progress, and we remain hopeful that despite preliminary rulings leaving so many hardworking individuals and their families in a state of uncertainty, upon thorough review and litigation of these cases the courts will recognize the improper nature of recent TPS terminations and restore status for those seeking safety here in the United States,” she said.",https://ottumwaradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/johann-teran.avif,N,,2025-12-29 09:58:33.072847
