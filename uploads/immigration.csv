Good had moved to Minneapolis from Kansas City, and local leaders say video contradicts the federal version of events.

U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II, who represents Missouri's 5th District in Kansas City, told KCUR's Up To Date that the Trump administration's labeling of Good as a ""domestic terrorist"" is ""completely irresponsible.""

""What I observed is the woman is trying to turn right and not trying to hit an officer,"" he said. ""It is completely irresponsible to say this was a domestic terrorist. Here's someone with no background that would suggest anything about that, and I would rather wait until the investigation that's conducted by the FBI and the Minnesota Attorney General's office.""

The FBI informed Minnesota investigators that it would no longer cooperate on the investigation of Good's death with state authorities. Cleaver disagrees with that decision.

“With the FBI director being who he is, any kind of investigation is going to going to be tainted,"" Cleaver said. ""As an old civil rights advocate in the bad old days, you know, we wanted the FBI involved. But times have changed.”

Cleaver also criticized the U.S. intervention in Venezuela following the Trump administration's capture of President Nicolas Maduro last week. He said that Congress was left completely in the dark about the operation ahead of time.

""I'm a member of Congress, and I don't know who you can talk to to get a clear picture of why we did what we did,"" he said. ""We — and only we — in Congress have the power to declare war.""

He also told Up To Date that he believes gaining access to Venezuelan oil was a major reason the U.S. took military action in the South American country.

Cleaver added that Trump's proposed takeover of Greenland, which is a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark, would put the U.S. in a bad position not just with the Danes but also fellow NATO allies.

The freeze applies to the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, the Social Services Block Grant program and the Child Care and Development Fund.

Gen. Rob Bonta announced Thursday.

The lawsuit was filed jointly by the five states targeted by the freeze — California, New York, Minnesota, Illinois and Colorado — over the Trump administration’s allegations of widespread fraud within their welfare systems. California alone is facing a loss of about $5 billion in funding, including $1.4 billion for child-care programs.

The lawsuit alleges that the freeze is based on unfounded claims of fraud and infringes on Congress’ spending power as enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“This is just the latest example of Trump’s willingness to throw vulnerable children, vulnerable families and seniors under the bus if he thinks it will advance his vendetta against California and Democratic-led states,” Bonta said at a Thursday evening news conference.

The $10-billion funding freeze follows the administration’s decision to freeze $185 million in child-care funds to Minnesota, where federal officials allege that as much as half of the roughly $18 billion paid to 14 state-run programs since 2018 may have been fraudulent. Amid the fallout, Gov. Tim Walz has ordered a third-party audit and announced that he will not seek a third term.

Bonta said that letters sent by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announcing the freeze Tuesday provided no evidence to back up claims of widespread fraud and misuse of taxpayer dollars in California. The freeze applies to the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, the Social Services Block Grant program and the Child Care and Development Fund.

“This is funding that California parents count on to get the safe and reliable child care they need so that they can go to work and provide for their families,” he said. “It’s funding that helps families on the brink of homelessness keep roofs over their heads.”

Bonta also raised concerns regarding Health and Human Services’ request that California turn over all documents associated with the state’s implementation of the three programs. This requires the state to share personally identifiable information about program participants, a move Bonta called “deeply concerning and also deeply questionable.”

“The administration doesn’t have the authority to override the established, lawful process our states have already gone through to submit plans and receive approval for these funds,” Bonta said. “It doesn’t have the authority to override the U.S. Constitution and trample Congress’ power of the purse.”

The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Manhattan and marked the 53rd suit California had filed against the Trump administration since the president’s inauguration last January.

Yesterday's deadly shooting in Minneapolis is raising questions about the use of force by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. An ICE agent shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in her vehicle while the agency was conducting an immigration enforcement operation in the city. She is not the first person killed by immigration agents over the past year of the Trump administration. NPR's Sergio Martínez-Beltrán joins us now to tell us more. Hi there.

SERGIO MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN, BYLINE: Hey.

SUMMERS: Sergio, what have you learned about what happened in Minneapolis?

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Yeah, we know there's an ongoing federal investigation and we know a bit more about what happened yesterday, Juana. So Vice President JD Vance says immigration agents were conducting an enforcement operation going door to door to find undocumented immigrants, which is unusual. And there are still conflicting interpretations of what happened or who is to blame. But the FBI took over the investigation, pushing out the state agency in charge of investigating these types of incidents.

SUMMERS: And that detail seems significant here - of the FBI taking over. What makes this case stand out?

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Well, multiple things, but I think the big one is that the person shot and killed in this case - Renee Good - was a U.S. citizen who was not the subject of any law enforcement investigation. There's also a lot of video evidence of this incident, yet there are important details that we don't know yet. For instance, videos show Good's car was perpendicular in the street. DHS says she was impeding agents. But a witness told NPR Good was there as a legal observer, although Good's mother told the Minnesota Star Tribune that her daughter was not an observer nor a protester. But we do know that there were protesters in the street.

SUMMERS: And we have seen ICE agents in the past engage with protesters besides arresting immigrants. Has that been their role in the past?

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: ICE agents are not trained to do crowd control. That is not their role. Here's John Sandweg, who served as ICE's acting director during the Obama administration.

JOHN SANDWEG: The way in which this administration is deploying the agents, the way in which - you know, and especially with tasking the agents with being, you know, the front line on the crowd control, you know, you're creating a toxic stew there.

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: He says this shows how Trump's deployment of ICE puts both the public and the agents at risk.

SUMMERS: And as we mentioned, Renee Good is not the first person to be involved in a violent incident during the Trump administration, right?

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Right. Look, Juana, it's no secret the Trump administration has pushed for an aggressive crackdown on immigration - legal and illegal. And you're right, we've seen shootings by ICE agents. In fact, The Trace - a nonprofit newsroom that focuses on gun violence - has identified at least 14 shootings in ICE raids since January of last year.

Now, NPR hasn't independently confirmed all of these shootings, but we've reported on some of them. Chicago has seen some of the most high-profile shootings. Last year, a Mexican immigrant was killed after attempting to drive away from immigration agents. Also last year in Chicago, agents fired at a woman while she was still in her car, injuring her. Here's Sandweg, the former acting ICE director, again.

SANDWEG: Remember, ICE has been in operation for almost 20 years now - a little over 20 years, I think, right? And during that time, they've made millions of arrests. And we really haven't seen anything in those 20 years like we've been seeing with this administration. And it's a direct by-product of this kind of - these shifting tactics that we saw, you know, really beginning in March, where the administration started, you know, promoting and these surges of agents and for these very flashy, high-profile operations in cities.

SUMMERS: Sergio, seems like the Trump administration's response to yesterday's fatal shooting in Minneapolis is just one piece of a bigger picture.

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Right. The Trump administration hasn't shied away from promoting its operations in cities across the country. And they're fiercely defending the agent that was accused of shooting Renee Good and have vowed to continue their immigration crackdown as well.

SUMMERS: NPR's Sergio Martínez-Beltrán, thanks.

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: You're welcome.

Pretty common for these protesters to use vehicles to ram ICE agents.
ICE agents have been put at risk.” In a social media post, Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin called for an investigation into the shooting death.
This should have never happened.” In a social media video, Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann, a Republican, criticized the comments about ICE agents from Frey, the Minneapolis mayor, and Minnesota Gov.
“There must be accountability to the fullest extent of the law for this shooting,” Hughes said.","Wisconsin Democrats are denouncing the Wednesday shooting death of a Minnesota woman by federal immigration agents, with some calling for ICE to be dismantled.

Meanwhile, Wisconsin Republicans are standing by law enforcement, accusing the woman of engaging in “domestic terrorism” and hinting that Democrats are inciting people to break the law.

Widely distributed videos show an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent draw his gun and shoot 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in her SUV. Good attempted to drive forward on a Minneapolis road as another officer demanded she exit her vehicle.

President Donald Trump and members of his administration said the agent who killed Good was acting in self defense. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz have disputed that Wednesday, with Frey telling ICE to “get the f— out of the city.”

During a Thursday appearance on WPR’s “Wisconsin Today,” Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson called it a “tragedy all the way around” and said he’d like to see elected officials “stop inciting people to impede lawful operations.”

“Don’t obstruct justice,” said Johnson. “Don’t put yourself at risk. And again, this is a tragedy all the way around. It didn’t have to happen. Pretty common for these protesters to use vehicles to ram ICE agents. ICE agents have been put at risk.”

In a social media post, Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin called for an investigation into the shooting death.

“But this we do know: Trump is sending in masked agents into our neighborhoods, is causing chaos, and is not making our communities any safer,” said Baldwin.

During a Wednesday interview with Stephen A. Smith, U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Prairie du Chien, said he’s not going to second-guess anything until there’s a thorough investigation of what happened.

“But it sure as heck looks like this is an act of domestic terrorism by this woman trying to run over a federal agent, and he was acting out of self defense,” said Van Orden.

U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison, posted on social media that “Donald Trump’s ICE just murdered a woman in cold blood” and suggested that if the agent who shot Good isn’t arrested and tried, the Department of Homeland Security “is a rogue agency lacking appropriate training and leadership.”

Democrats, Republicans running for governor weigh in

Wisconsin’s field of candidates running to replace outgoing Gov. Tony Evers also had a lot to say about who they thought was to blame for the Good’s death in Minneapolis.

On Thursday afternoon, Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany sent a statement to WPR stating that “when a law enforcement officer repeatedly instructs someone to exit a vehicle and that person instead ignores the command and accelerates toward an officer, those choices can carry unfortunate consequences.”

“I respect the ongoing investigation into this tragic death and remain committed to restoring respect for the rule of law and supporting the men and women who enforce it,” said Tiffany.

Former Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes posted that “Trump said he would deport criminals, instead Americans are being killed.”

“Nothing about sending masked agents into our streets without accountability is making us safer,” said Barnes. “My heart is with Minnesota today and the victim’s family. This should have never happened.”

In a social media video, Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann, a Republican, criticized the comments about ICE agents from Frey, the Minneapolis mayor, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who was a vice presidential candidate the 2024 election.

“The statements from the mayor, the statements from the governor, are ridiculous,” Schoemann said. “Let ICE do their work. We need to support law enforcement 100 percent.”

Wisconsin state Rep. Francesca Hong, D-Madison, called Wednesday’s shooting “a dark day in America” on social media and shared a fundraising link for Good’s family.

“No one should live in fear of their government murdering its own people when neighbors are trying to protect one another,” Hong said.

In a subsequent post, Hong said “dismantling ICE is the bare minimum” and “removing enforcers of fascism is not enough.”

Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said in a written statement his “heart is with Renee Nicole Good and all who loved her.”

“When executive power is exercised without restraint, and when accountability is treated as hostility, we are no longer talking about public safety,” said Crowley. “We are talking about fear.”

Former Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation CEO Missy Hughes, who is also running for governor as a Democrat, said in a Wednesday post that she is “heartbroken” by Good’s killing by an ICE agent.

“There must be accountability to the fullest extent of the law for this shooting,” Hughes said. “We can do two things at once — uphold the law and protect human life.”",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26008837420596-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 11:59:16.920214

Republican National Committee | Constitutional Accountability Center,Not Available,,,,,https://www.theusconstitution.org/litigation/watson-v-rnc/,"The Republican National Committee challenged Mississippi’s law, claiming that it violated the federal laws setting the date for elections for federal office.
First, the text and history of the federal election laws establish that “election day” is the deadline for casting ballots—not for receiving them.
Multiple states established a grace period of several weeks after Election Day, far longer than Mississippi’s modern law allows.
In passing that law, Congress chose not to mandate same-day receipt of ballots.
Federal law sets the day by which votes must be cast, not the day by which they must be received.","Mississippi law, like the law of many states, provides that as long as ballots are completed and mailed by Election Day, they should be counted if they are received shortly afterward. This ensures that absentee voters have the same deadline to vote as in-person voters, without being penalized because of delays in the mail. The Republican National Committee challenged Mississippi’s law, claiming that it violated the federal laws setting the date for elections for federal office. Though the district court upheld the law, the Fifth Circuit reversed. According to the Fifth Circuit, an “election” under federal law encompasses both the casting of votes and their receipt by officials—meaning ballots must be received by Election Day. Mississippi asked the Supreme Court to hear the case, and it agreed to do so.

CAC filed an amicus brief explaining why the Fifth Circuit’s interpretation is wrong and Mississippi’s law is lawful. Our amicus brief makes two principal points.

First, the text and history of the federal election laws establish that “election day” is the deadline for casting ballots—not for receiving them. The laws setting out the timing of federal elections follow in the tradition of the Constitution, which makes clear that when Congress sets an election day, it is setting only the date by which voters must indicate their choice of candidate. Article II of the Constitution provides that “Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors.” Congress sets the time of choosing, not the time of receiving, counting, or certifying those choices. Throughout the Constitution, “elections” are consistently treated as synonymous with “chusing”: Representatives are “chosen . . . by the People,” and when the House of Representatives selects a President, it “shall choose . . . by ballot.” And Founding-era dictionaries uniformly defined “election” as the act of choosing—not the receipt of choices by officials. The Supreme Court has confirmed this understanding, holding in United States v. Classic that an election occurs when voters express their choice of candidates.

Second, historical practice reinforces this reading. During the Civil War, when absentee voting first emerged at scale, states across the Union and Confederacy enacted soldier-voting laws that expressly contemplated ballots being received after Election Day. Multiple states established a grace period of several weeks after Election Day, far longer than Mississippi’s modern law allows. States passed laws directing that election judges delay counting ballots for several weeks to allow for soldiers’ ballots to be received. Congress enacted the first federal statute establishing a uniform day for congressional elections—just seven years after the Civil War ended—against the backdrop of these widespread state practices. In passing that law, Congress chose not to mandate same-day receipt of ballots.

The Fifth Circuit’s decision should be reversed. Federal law sets the day by which votes must be cast, not the day by which they must be received.",https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Web-Previews_facebook.png,N,,2026-01-09 11:11:56.342089

The consolidated case is now pending against Doximity in federal court in Massachusetts.","Key criminal law issues to watch this year include the continuing shift in state-level reforms. More states are expected to consider decriminalizing marijuana, as well as adopting “Death with Dignity” physician-assisted suicide laws, reflecting evolving public attitudes toward autonomy and harm reduction. Another major development is the Model Penal Code’s revised sexual assault provisions, which modernize consent standards but have yet to be adopted by any state—an implementation gap worth monitoring. Finally, the nationwide trend toward eliminating the death penalty continues to gain momentum, and the coming year will reveal whether additional states join the movement away from capital punishment.

In Cox v. Sony, the Supreme Court will decide the responsibility of an internet service provider (ISP) to police its users’ copyright infringement. A group of more than 50 music companies, including Sony, sued Cox, claiming it was indirectly liable for its users’ infringement of more than 10,000 works. It alleged that Cox received 160,000 notices of repeat copyright infringement on its network but loosened its copyright enforcement policies and terminated only 33 subscribers (in a period in which it cut off access to more than 600,000 for nonpayment). A jury found Cox liable for $1 billion (though the appellate court rejected one of the bases of liability, remanding for a recalculation of damages). In contrast, Cox claims that the internet connection it provides has many uses that have nothing to do with infringement. It also contends that the required “material contribution” to infringement requires more active behavior like encouragement of unlawful acts, not failing to terminate access. Cox also warns that being forced to terminate service could punish innocent users in households, coffee shops, hospitals, universities, and military barracks, resulting in widespread disruption to internet access. The Court’s conclusion will have vast consequences for ISPs, and thus all of us.

Ever since the Supreme Court’s 1935 decision in Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, the conventional wisdom has been that Congress can create so-called “independent agencies.” These agencies–like the FCC, SEC, FTC, and Federal Reserve–are often run by multimember boards or commissions with bipartisan membership and statutory protection from at-will firing by the President. Since the start of his second term, however, President Trump has taken the position that these statutory removal restrictions are unlawful because they interfere with his constitutional authority over the executive branch. On that view, he fired Rebecca Slaughter, a Democratic commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission. Her fight for reinstatement has now arrived at the Supreme Court as Trump v. Slaughter, a case in which President Trump has asked the Court to overrule Humphrey’s Executor and to recognize a conclusive and preclusive presidential power to remove executive officers. But even if the Court upholds the legality of Slaughter's statutory removal protection, another question in the case is whether courts have any authority to order reinstatement–as opposed to some other remedy, like backpay–when an unlawful firing occurs. A final important factor lurking in the background of Slaughter's case is the Federal Reserve: If President Trump wins, can the Court craft a rule that does not result in political control over U.S. monetary policy, an outcome that could have important consequences for confidence in the U.S. economy?

Arguably one of the most important legal issues to be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court this term is whether President Trump’s Executive Order 14160 (E.O. 14160), which seeks to redefine who may acquire U.S. citizenship by birth, violates the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Fourteenth Amendment provides that “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof” are U.S. citizens. E.O. 14160, issued on January 20, 2025, the first day of President Trump's return to the White House, provides that persons who are born in the United States are not “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” if the parents are undocumented or in the country lawfully but present on a temporary basis. To acquire birthright citizenship under the executive order, at least one parent has to be a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident. The Trump administration has faced multiple lawsuits from individuals, organizations, and states challenging the constitutionality and validity of the executive order. On December 5, 2025, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in Trump v. Barbara, a case brought by parents on behalf of their U.S.-born children. The question presented is “whether the Executive Order complies on its face with the Citizenship Clause and with 8 U.S.C. 1401(a), which codifies that Clause.”

Many issues relating to LGBTQ+ rights are on the docket at the Supreme Court this year–with a particular focus on transgender rights. The Supreme Court has already ruled in Trump v. Orr (on the shadow docket) that a Trump Administration policy requiring all passports to reflect sex assigned at birth is likely constitutional, and can go into effect. This is a ruling that has profound negative effects for transgender Americans who have long been able to obtain passports that match their gender identity and presentation, and who face harassment, inconvenience, and risks to their safety when traveling with documentation that effectively outs them any time they are forced to provide it. In addition, the Court has three other major LGBTQ+ cases on its merits docket, including a First Amendment challenge to Colorado’s ban on conversion therapy (i.e., efforts to change LGBTQ+ status) for minors, and Equal Protection and Title IX challenges to state laws categorically banning trans women and girls from female athletics. However these cases are decided, they are likely to have a substantial doctrinal impact, both for LGBTQ+ rights, and for broader civil rights law.

OpenEvidence v. Doximity is one of the first cases to test whether strategic prompting of a generative AI model to learn how it was designed, developed, or fine-tuned constitutes trade secret misappropriation. The case follows an earlier lawsuit, OpenEvidence v. Pathway. OpenEvidence operates a widely used medical AI chatbot for clinicians. In early 2025, OpenEvidence sued Pathway Medical, alleging that Pathway conducted a “prompt injection attack” to induce the chatbot to reveal portions of its system prompt code. OpenEvidence characterizes this system prompt code as a core trade secret central to how the chatbot interacts with users. It later sued Doximity on similar grounds. Doximity then acquired Pathway Medical. The consolidated case is now pending against Doximity in federal court in Massachusetts. The litigation raises two central questions: whether system prompt code qualifies as a trade secret and whether strategic prompting is an improper means of acquisition or a lawful form of reverse engineering. Notably, the pleadings also show that defendants accessed the professional version of the chatbot using another person’s medical provider number, a form of misrepresentation unlikely to be excused under trade secret law. Moreover, the defendants’ conduct appears to have violated OpenEvidence’s Terms of Use, and many courts treat such violations as improper means under trade secret law.

Since 1984, the federal compassionate release statute, 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A), has formally allowed judges to reduce criminal sentences based on “extraordinary and compelling reasons.” But there wasn’t much legal activity on the issue until the First Step Act of 2018 allowed prisoners to file their own motions in federal court. Since then, almost 5,000 federal prisoners have won compassionate release, for reasons such as violence they were subjected to by Bureau of Prisons staff, as well as extreme disparities in their and their codefendants’ sentences. But federal prosecutors have sought—and some courts have imposed—limits on what types of circumstances judges may consider in compassionate release cases. In fall 2025, the Supreme Court heard arguments in two cases—Fernandez v. United States and Rutherford v. United States—in which it could dramatically limit what federal judges are allowed to consider “extraordinary and compelling circumstances” when they consider prisoners’ motions.

“Multilateral cooperation is central to the international human rights system that the United States helped build over successive Republican and Democrat-led administrations, a leadership legacy that the Trump administration appears hell-bent on extinguishing,” said Uzra Zeya, President and CEO of Human Right First. “The organizations slandered and repudiated by the White House make important contributions to Americans’ security, prosperity, and freedom – from curbing rights-abusing technology and corruption, to protecting survivors of conflict-related sexual violence, and supporting successful transitions from authoritarian to democratic governance over decades. U.S. retreat leaves the field to U.S. adversaries to further extend influence in the multilateral system.”

The consequences of this move will be felt most acutely by those already at greatest risk—children, women, and marginalized communities—through the erosion of protections for education, health, gender equality, and fundamental freedoms. “This is not happening in a vacuum,” Zeya added. “The same day this announcement was made, President Trump called for a record $1.5 trillion military budget and threatened multiple countries with military action.

The Houston-based carrier, founded in 2021, said its deal to handle Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation flights did not sufficiently boost the airline's financial position.
The federal agency also subcontracts with other charter companies, including GlobalX, which handled more than half of DHS' charter flights in 2025, according to ICE Flight Monitor at Human Rights First, a group that tracks ICE deportation flights.
""ICE never contracted directly with Avelo Airlines,"" DHS said in a statement to CBS News.
""For months, communities across the country spoke out, organized, protested and demanded that Avelo Airlines end its deportation flights.","Avelo Airlines said that it will no longer carry out migrant deportation flights for the Department of Homeland Security, ending a contract that supported the U.S. government's immigration enforcement efforts.

The Houston-based carrier, founded in 2021, said its deal to handle Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation flights did not sufficiently boost the airline's financial position. As a result, the low-cost carrier is shutting down its hub at Mesa Gateway Airport in Phoenix, where its migrant flight operation was based, the company said in a statement to CBS News.

""Avelo will close the base at [Mesa Gateway Airport] on January 27 and will conclude participation in the DHS charter program,"" an Avelo spokesperson said. ""The program provided short-term benefits but ultimately did not deliver enough consistent and predictable revenue to overcome its operational complexity and costs.""

Avelo operates low-cost flights to dozens of destinations, including the Caribbean, from four U.S. hubs. It is planning to open a fifth base in Dallas in late 2026.

DHS has long partnered with CSI Aviation, which subcontracted with Avelo to provide ICE with air charter services. The federal agency also subcontracts with other charter companies, including GlobalX, which handled more than half of DHS' charter flights in 2025, according to ICE Flight Monitor at Human Rights First, a group that tracks ICE deportation flights.

""ICE never contracted directly with Avelo Airlines,"" DHS said in a statement to CBS News. ""ICE will continue to utilize its contracted service provider, which works with multiple airlines to support the American people's mandate for mass deportations of criminal illegal aliens.""

In April, Avelo founder and CEO Andrew Levy expressed confidence that the airline's deportation business would help drive the carrier's growth, while conceding that handling deportation flights was a ""sensitive and complicated topic.""

Mesa's charter program has sparked public backlash and protests against its decision to work with ICE.

The Indivisible Project, a nonprofit group that led protests against Avelo Airlines, on Thursday applauded the carrier's move to end its contract with DHS.

""For months, communities across the country spoke out, organized, protested and demanded that Avelo Airlines end its deportation flights.

The Department of Homeland Security described the vehicle’s passenger as “a Venezuelan illegal alien affiliated with the transnational Tren de Aragua prostitution ring” who had been involved in a recent shooting in Portland. When agents identified themselves to the vehicle occupants Thursday afternoon, the driver tried to run them over, the department said in a written statement.

“Fearing for his life and safety, an agent fired a defensive shot,” the statement said. “The driver drove off with the passenger, fleeing the scene.”

There was no immediate independent corroboration of those events or of any gang affiliation of the vehicle’s occupants. During prior shootings involving agents involved in President Donald Trump’s surge of immigration enforcement in U.S. cities, including Wednesday’s shooting by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis, video evidence cast doubt on the administration’s initial descriptions of what prompted the shootings.

According to the Portland police, officers initially responded to a report of a shooting near a hospital at about 2:18 p.m.

A few minutes later, police received information that a man who had been shot was asking for help in a residential area a couple of miles away. Officers then responded there and found the two people with apparent gunshot wounds. Officers determined they were injured in the shooting with federal agents, police said.

Their conditions were not immediately known. Council President Elana Pirtle-Guiney said during a Portland City Council meeting that Thursday’s shooting took place in the eastern part of the city and that two Portlanders were wounded.

“As far as we know both of these individuals are still alive and we are hoping for more positive updates throughout the afternoon,” she said.

The shooting escalates tensions in an city that has long had a contentious relationship with President Donald Trump, including Trump’s recent, failed effort to deploy National Guard troops in the city.

Portland police secured both the scene of the shooting and the area where the wounded people were found pending investigation.

“We are still in the early stages of this incident,” said Chief Bob Day. “We understand the heightened emotion and tension many are feeling in the wake of the shooting in Minneapolis, but I am asking the community to remain calm as we work to learn more.”

Portland Mayor Keith Wilson and the City Council called on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to end all operations in Oregon’s largest city until a full investigation is completed.

“We stand united as elected officials in saying that we cannot sit by while constitutional protections erode and bloodshed mounts,” a joint statement said. “Portland is not a ‘training ground’ for militarized agents, and the ‘full force’ threatened by the administration has deadly consequences.”

The city officials said “federal militarization undermines effective, community‑based public safety, and it runs counter to the values that define our region. We’ll use every legal and legislative tool available to protect our residents’ civil and human rights.”

They urged residents to show up with “calm and purpose during this difficult time.”

“We respond with clarity, unity, and a commitment to justice,” the statement said. “We must stand together to protect Portland.”",https://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2026/01/AP26009039426357.jpg?w=780,N,,2026-01-09 09:58:18.671018

Experts expect that premiums for enrollees of the plans will roughly double without the subsidies.
The Republican speaker, Mike Johnson, has opposed the credits, arguing they would enable fraud while calling the landmark 2010 law passed under Barack Obama the “Unaffordable Care Act”.
“All of those options were rejected, unfortunately, by House leadership, so it left us with two options – either expiration or clean extension.
Fitzpatrick predicted that the Senate will “put their stamp on” the three-year extension, and then the House will consider it again.","The US House of Representatives on Thursday passed legislation to re-establish tax credits that lowered premiums for Affordable Care Act (ACA) health plans, after a small group of Republicans broke ranks and joined with Democrats to defy Donald Trump on a key healthcare issue that could sway voters ahead of the November midterm elections.

The chamber voted 230-196 to approve a bill that would extend for three years the credits, which were first created under Joe Biden but expired at the end of last year despite a concerted effort by the Democratic minority to continue them.

All Democrats voted for the measure along with 17 Republicans, many of whom were moderates who said they could not tolerate a hike in healthcare costs for their constituents, but acknowledged the House measure will likely be revised by the Republican-controlled Senate before it is enacted.

“I am voting in favor of this discharge and of this legislation to send it to the Senate, so that the Senate will have the opportunity to put forth a reform package that can pass Congress and become law,” Republican congressman Mike Lawler said during a preliminary vote on the bill on Wednesday.

Trump has opposed extending the tax credits, and the Senate last month rejected a Democratic-backed measure similar to the bill that passed the House. Experts expect that premiums for enrollees of the plans will roughly double without the subsidies.

The Republican speaker, Mike Johnson, has opposed the credits, arguing they would enable fraud while calling the landmark 2010 law passed under Barack Obama the “Unaffordable Care Act”. Democrats made an extension a centerpiece of their demands during the record-long government shutdown that began in October, while moderate Republicans sought to strike a compromise that would be palatable to both parties.

But after Johnson refused to bring any deal to the floor, four Republicans last month signed a discharge petition that forced a vote on the legislation extending the credits for three years, in a significant rebuke of the speaker.

“All of those options were rejected, unfortunately, by House leadership, so it left us with two options – either expiration or clean extension. And clean extension is a far better option, in my view, and that’s why I proceeded down the path that I did,” House representative Brian Fitzpatrick, one of the four Republican signatories, said in an interview with NPR on Thursday.

Fitzpatrick predicted that the Senate will “put their stamp on” the three-year extension, and then the House will consider it again.

Democrats see the tax credits as part of their emphasis on fighting the “affordability crisis”, a key plank of their pitch to voters ahead of the midterm elections in November, when they will seek to retake the Senate and House. Trump, meanwhile, has dismissed the concerns about affordability as a “hoax”, though Johnson has said that Republicans plan to outline their own proposals to lower healthcare costs in the weeks to come.

“The affordability crisis is not a hoax, it is very real, despite what Donald Trump had to say,” the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, said in a Thursday morning press conference. “Today, we have an opportunity to take a meaningful step forward, lower the high cost of living for everyday Americans, particularly as it relates to healthcare.”

His counterpart in the Senate, the minority leader Chuck Schumer, said that the party did not plan to let the issue go.

“Democrats are going to make healthcare and other high costs, the high cost of living, the No 1 issue for all of 2026,” Schumer said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c734f1977548c4792d99eab46113c659a1d351d2/414_0_4101_3280/master/4101.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4da08e4eb71b46dc82672cf7ad5ca040",N,,2026-01-09 12:12:28.638869

Filed Wednesday by Republican Sen. Jonathan Martin, the 34-page bill would presume certain non-citizens are at fault in car accidents, severely restrict their employment, and prevent state banks from loaning them money.

It’s the most wide-ranging immigration bundle proposed so far ahead of the 2026 session, and would extend a 2025 crackdown that removed in-state tuition for undocumented students, imposed state-level penalties for illegally entering Florida, and required all counties to partner with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

READ MORE: Florida bill would ban public colleges from admitting undocumented students

The nationwide push to quash all avenues for undocumented immigration has been exemplified in Florida, the first state to create a state-run migrant detention center. Since President Donald Trump’s inauguration last January, Sunshine State officials have mirrored his anti-illegal immigration agenda.

This includes deputizing hundreds of state and local officials to act as immigration officers; Florida is the only state to have all of its (67) counties entering into 287(g) agreements, which are partnerships with ICE.

Martin didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

E-Verify penalties

SB 1380 would create civil penalties for employers who fail to properly use E-Verify, a federal database that checks whether new hires are legally authorized to work in the country. This builds off of another Martin bill, which would require all businesses to use E-Verify.

Employers who fail to check workers’ immigration status through E-Verify before submitting workers’ compensation claims would be personally liable for any costs, expenses, or benefits for undocumented employees.

Purposely not checking their status, however, would result in suspension of business licenses for one year and fines up to $10,000. Doing it again would result in a five-year license suspension alongside a $100,000 fine, and a third violation would mean permanent license revocation and a $250,000 fine.

If the employer purposely flouts this section and the undocumented worker then ends up injuring another person, the employer’s license would be suspended for five years with a $100,000 fine. If the worker kills another person, the licenses would be permanently revoked with a $500,000 fine.

In a similar vein, the bill would impose a third-degree felony charge for an employer who knowingly hires more than 50 undocumented workers. The business would permanently lose its license. The bill would create a cause of action against the employer for any person injured or the next of kin of a person killed by the actions of an undocumented worker.

These provisions evoke a recently closed, two-year federal investigation into Archer Western, a road-building company hired by the state that employed undocumented immigrants for years, as the Tampa Bay Times has reported.

Officials opened the investigation after an undocumented Archer Western employee driving heavy machinery in 2022 hit and killed a Pinellas County deputy. At least 18 of his coworkers on that state-funded construction site were also undocumented.

Car accidents, foreign remittances, and licensing

SB 1380 would create a rebuttable presumption of fault in car accidents involving undocumented immigrants from other states. This means if an out-of-state driver who is undocumented is involved in a car accident in Florida, authorities could presume he or she was at fault — as long as the other motorist wasn’t driving recklessly, under the influence, or clearly at fault.

Insurers could not pay benefits or settle claims with an unauthorized out-of-state driver, the bill says.

Additionally, the bill requires law enforcement officers investigating car accidents to verify whether the parties are legally in the country.

Other provisions would ban the state Division of Risk Management from approving a claim submitted by an adult undocumented immigrant. Unauthorized immigrants would be barred from sending money to other countries and state banks could not accept IDs traditionally used by undocumented immigrants or those illegally in the state with down payments or loans.

All licensing procedures, relicensing instruction, and licensing testing must be conducted in English, the bill says. Interpreters, translators, or alternate language accommodations would be banned.

Here’s what else you need to know to get up to speed and on with your day.

1️⃣ Immigration tensions

Two American cities are on edge after separate shootings involving federal immigration agents this week. In Minneapolis, demonstrations are flaring after an ICE officer shot and killed a 37-year-old US citizen on Wednesday, with protestors demanding the Trump administration end its immigration crackdown in the city. The White House, meanwhile, is defending the actions of the ICE agent involved. In a separate incident, a married couple was hospitalized in Portland, Oregon, after being shot by Border Patrol agents on Thursday. A law enforcement official said the agents were conducting a traffic stop and fired when the suspects attempted to run them over. Portland’s mayor has called on ICE to suspend operations in the city until the shooting is fully investigated.

2️⃣ Presidential powers

Lawmakers are pushing to limit the powers of President Donald Trump in Venezuela as uncertainty mounts over his next steps in the deepening conflict. On Thursday, a handful of Republicans joined Democrats to advance a resolution that would limit future US military force in Venezuela without congressional approval. The final resolution is not guaranteed to pass, but the vote deals a symbolic rebuke to the president. It comes just days after the Trump administration launched a strike on Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro without the approval of Congress.

3️⃣ Iran internet blackout

Iran was hit with a nationwide internet blackout on Thursday as mass anti-government protests spread amid anger over economic hardship and security crackdowns. Authorities shut down internet access and phone lines shortly after protests erupted in Tehran and other major cities, though the blackout did not immediately stop videos of the demonstrations — now in their second week — from circulating online. At least 45 protesters have been killed since the unrest began, according to the Iran Human Rights NGO. The group says hundreds more have been injured and more than 2,000 people detained.

4️⃣ Home prices

President Trump said he wants to ban large institutional investors from buying single-family homes, citing the current strain on American homebuyers. This comes as corporations such as Blackstone, JPMorgan Chase, and other banks and investment firms have increasingly snapped up family homes in recent years and turned them into rentals. Critics say the practice has driven up home prices and hurt affordability, but some housing experts argue the president’s proposal would have minimal effect on overall housing supply. The cost of buying a home in the US has surged in recent years, fueled by historically low inventory and mortgage rates above 6%. Between early 2020 and the third quarter of 2025, home prices rose nearly 55% nationwide, according to a report from the National Association of Home Builders.

5️⃣ White House

New details emerged on Thursday about President Trump’s East Wing expansion at the White House — including a “grand stair” — and changes to the West Wing Colonnade as well. For the first time, a second story on the West Wing Colonnade was unveiled. It is designed to mirror the East Wing addition after the previous building was demolished last year. Architect Shalom Baranes offered new insight into the size and scope of the project, which drew mild pushback from some members of the National Capital Planning Commission. The East Wing expansion will include a 22,000-square-foot ballroom capable of seating 1,000 guests, with the overall expansion totaling roughly 89,000 square feet. Above-ground construction is expected to begin around April.

“They usually – they make just extreme movements with their vehicles.” Trump administration officials have cited that June case as evidence that ICE agents face deadly threats that compel them to react with extreme force.
“That very ICE officer nearly had his life ended, dragged by a car, six months ago,” Vice President JD Vance told reporters on Thursday.

Ross’s deadly encounter with Good began on Wednesday as ICE agents worked in Minneapolis.","Last summer, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent found himself in a perilous situation.

His arm was pinned into the back window of a car as a suspect sped away, dragging him across the pavement for about 100 yards, according to court documents. The agent, who suffered injuries to his arm and hand, fired his Taser at the man during the encounter, records show.

Roughly six months later, the same officer faced another driver who hit the gas as he tried to stop her vehicle. This time, he fired with his service weapon – killing 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good.

The officer in the June case is identified in court documents as Jonathan Ross. A senior Department Homeland Security official confirmed that case involved the same officer who fired the shots that killed Good this week.

As authorities and lawmakers nationwide seek to untangle the circumstances behind the fatal shooting, Ross’s actions during the incident last summer and his professional background are facing renewed scrutiny.

A transcript of Ross’s testimony from the June case reviewed by CNN adds new detail to his experience, which includes a tour of duty with the National Guard in Iraq as a gunner from 2004 to in 2005. In his testimony he describes performing “hundreds” of traffic stops in his career over nearly two decades in Border Patrol and then ICE – including encounters with drivers seeking to flee.

“They do erratic behaviors, they take great risks, and they seem to not be aware of other people driving on the road,” Ross told the jury. “They usually – they make just extreme movements with their vehicles.”

Trump administration officials have cited that June case as evidence that ICE agents face deadly threats that compel them to react with extreme force.

“That very ICE officer nearly had his life ended, dragged by a car, six months ago,” Vice President JD Vance told reporters on Thursday. “You think maybe he’s a little bit sensitive about someone ramming him with an automobile?”

But local lawmakers and some experts say that this week’s situation was far from life-threatening to the ICE officer, as Good appeared to be swerving away from him as he began shooting.

“To use deadly force… the elements of that have to be so concerning to open up fire on an individual,” said former Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, adding in a CNN interview that the agent should simply have gotten out of the way of Good’s car.

Michael Harrigan, a retired FBI agent who now consults on law enforcement practices and tactics, said it’s not unreasonable to believe that the prior car dragging case may have been on the ICE officer’s mind as he pulled the trigger. But Harrigan said agents are trained to evaluate every incident individually.

“The fact is every incident has to stand alone,” Harrigan said. “It doesn’t really matter what they went through before. It’s never going to be a justification for something else. They know that.”

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, who declined to name Ross, citing violent threats to ICE agents, said he “is a longtime ICE officer who has been serving his country his entire life.” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has defended the officer’s actions.

“This is an experienced officer who followed his training, and we’ll continue to let the investigation unfold into the individual and continue to follow the procedures and policies that happen in these use of force cases,” Noem said at a news conference.

Ross served in Iraq from 2004 to 2005 with the Indiana National Guard, he testified in court, and then joined Border Patrol in 2007. He said he worked with the agency near El Paso, Texas, where he worked on intelligence about “cartels and drug smuggling,” before joining ICE in 2015.

With ICE, he said, he works in fugitive operations in the Minneapolis area and regularly collaborates with other federal agencies. “I target higher value targets,” he testified.

The agent’s experience in ICE included a selection to a Special Response Team, McLaughlin said, which requires 30 hours of tryouts, continuous training and expert marksman qualifications.

His violent encounter with a suspect last June began when federal officials moved in to arrest Roberto Carlos Muñoz-Guatemala, an undocumented immigrant who had been charged with sexually abusing a teenage relative in 2022, according to a court affidavit written by an FBI agent involved in the case.

At the time, ICE had requested local officials hold him in jail, but that request was denied, the affidavit said. The affidavit refers to Muñoz-Guatemala as being from Guatemala, while a DHS press release described him as being from Mexico.

On June 17, 2025, federal officials tracked Muñoz-Guatemala to his home in Bloomington, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis, and conducted a traffic stop as he started to drive away.

Ross, who was one of several federal agents involved in the arrest, initially drew his service weapon, but holstered the gun after Muñoz-Guatemala stopped his car and raised his hands, according to the affidavit.

The affidavit does not name Ross, only referring to him as an officer for ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations division, but other court documents including an exhibit and witness list make clear that it is Ross.

Muñoz-Guatemala handed Ross an “identification document,” but refused to follow Ross’s commands to lower his window and open the door, the affidavit says. Ross pointed his Taser at Muñoz-Guatemala, used a “spring-loaded window punch” to break the car’s rear passenger door window, and put his arm through the window to try to open the door.

Muñoz-Guatemala responded by driving the car onto the curb and accelerating away “at a high rate of speed,” according to the affidavit, and Ross was pulled along by his right arm. A door-camera video posted by news channel WCCO shows Muñoz-Guatemala driving away quickly across a lawn, with several officers running after him.

“I was fearing for my life,” Ross testified during the trial.

Ross said he discharged ten rounds of his Taser, hitting Muñoz-Guatemala, and yelled for him to stop “over and over and over again at the top of my lungs.”

Muñoz-Guatemala swerved the car down the street and dragged Ross about 100 yards, according to the affidavit, before the agent was knocked away from the vehicle. Muñoz-Guatemala then drove with the Taser hanging out of the car window, and was arrested about a mile away by local police officers.

Ross suffered a cut to his right arm that required 20 stitches, as well as a cut to his left hand that required 13 stitches, according to the affidavit, which includes photos of Ross’s bloody limbs.

“Some of the wounds they couldn’t close. There wasn’t enough skin to close it with stitches,” Ross said.

Ross also said in court in December that ICE’s field office in the Twin Cities didn’t have a body-worn camera policy. Body-worn cameras were “rolled out to certain offices throughout ICE, and ours was not one of them that was rolled out at that time,” Ross said. As a result, he said, immigration agents in the Minneapolis area “cannot wear them.”

Muñoz-Guatemala was charged with assault on a federal officer with a dangerous or deadly weapon and resulting in bodily injury, and was convicted by a jury in December after a three-day trial. His sentencing is pending.

Ross’s deadly encounter with Good began on Wednesday as ICE agents worked in Minneapolis. Video shows that Good’s vehicle was partially blocking a road that agents were attempting to drive down.

As two other agents rushed toward her window, gesturing at her and trying to open the vehicle’s door, Ross walked to the front of her vehicle.

Good briefly put the vehicle in reverse, then shifted into drive and hit the gas, with the wheels seemingly turned to the right instead of directly ahead toward Ross. It’s unclear whether her vehicle made significant contact with the agent as he began firing, striking her. Her vehicle accelerated down the road, crashing into parked cars nearby. She was later pronounced dead.

In the minutes after the shooting, Ross is seen in witness videos approaching Good’s crashed vehicle, before walking away and telling other officers to call 911. He and at least one other agent then drove away in another vehicle.

Experts in law enforcement questioned Ross’s actions in the shooting, telling CNN that the agent appeared to violate several key rules for engaging with suspects in vehicles.

ICE’s own general policy is that agents should not chase vehicles or fire at them unless there is imminent danger, said John Amaya, a former deputy chief of staff for the agency during the Obama administration. He said that many agents are not trained in crowd control practices or interacting with residents, adding that that can make certain interactions “a recipe for disaster.”

Charles Ramsey, a former Philadelphia police commissioner, told CNN that many law enforcement agencies around the country have restricted officers in their interactions with suspects in vehicles.

“You don’t reach into cars – that’s how you wind up getting dragged down the street,” Ramsey said. “You don’t stand in front or behind a car with the engine running… Policies around the country have pretty much prohibited firing at a moving car.”

Some of Ross’s actions could be legally justified, Ramsey noted. “But just because you can doesn’t mean you should,” he said. “Use of deadly force is an absolute last resort when you don’t have other options. He had other options. Don’t stand in front of the freaking car – that’s option number one.”

Today's top stories

Two separate incidents that happened this week are calling attention to shootings by federal immigration authorities. Yesterday in Portland, Ore., a Customs and Border Patrol agent shot and injured two people. The mayor of Portland is now calling for an end to all ICE activity in the area. The incident comes a day after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in Minnesota. Good was shot while inside her car during an encounter with multiple ICE agents.

🎧 NPR has confirmed the identity of the shooter to be Jonathan Ross, NPR's Meg Anderson tells Up First. Department of Homeland Security officers say he is an experienced officer, not a recent hire. The FBI has taken over the investigation, Anderson adds. State authorities say they no longer have access to evidence about the shooting, which means the federal government is the only entity investigating a shooting committed by its own agent. Yesterday, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz questioned the fairness of the investigation.

➡️ Protests are growing in Minneapolis over Good's death. These photos provide a glimpse into the community's reaction since the shooting occurred.

🎧 Shootings by immigration authorities appear to be becoming more frequent as the Trump administration ramps up its immigration crackdowns, NPR's Sergio Martínez-Beltrán says. Yesterday, Vice President JD Vance confirmed that immigration agents in Minneapolis were going door to door to find undocumented migrants. Martínez-Beltrán says this strategy is unusual given that ICE operations are typically targeted. He adds that these shootings could be a devastating side effect of this broader approach.

A new NPR/Ipsos poll reveals that while Americans across the political spectrum want the U.S. to be a global moral leader, fewer believe it holds that title today. The survey highlights a significant gap: 61% of respondents believe the U.S. should be a moral leader, while 39% believe it actually is one. The latter figure shows a steep decline from 2017, when 60% of Americans viewed the nation as a moral leader in a similar survey. This is what the poll says about American foreign policy.

A group of 17 House Republicans joined Democrats yesterday to pass a measure to restore health insurance subsidies that expired at the end of last year. While the three-year extension passed by a vote of 230 to 196, the measure faces a likely dead end in the Senate, where a similar proposal failed just last month. However, a bipartisan group of senators says they are close to a deal on a compromise bill.

Special series

President Trump has tried to bury the truth of what happened on Jan. 6, 2021. NPR built a visual archive of the attack on the Capitol, showing exactly what happened through the lenses of the people who were there. ""Chapter 5: The pardons and rewriting of Jan. 6"" examines how Trump's pardons, political messaging and use of power reshaped the public narrative.

While Trump initially condemned the Jan. 6 attack, he soon switched his stance by embracing the rioters as ""political prisoners."" On Jan. 12, 2025, just eight days before Trump's inauguration, incoming Vice President Vance said that the administration would not pardon defendants convicted of assaulting police. But one of Trump's first acts in office was to grant full pardons to most defendants. Only 14 defendants — all of whom were linked to extremist groups — received commutations, meaning they were released from prison, but the convictions remained on their records. The Trump administration then deleted a government database containing cases linked to the attack. Evidence began disappearing from a site that shared court exhibits with the media. Explore the aftermath of the pardons, including which Trump appointees advocated for Jan. 6 defendants.

Tim Walz is also disputing the White House version of events.","The official White House narrative of how a U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE) officer shot and killed a U.S. citizen in her vehicle in Minneapolis is bumping hard up against what can be seen in videos of the incident.

U.S. President Donald Trump, Vice-President JD Vance and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem are all insisting that the victim, Renee Nicole Good, deliberately rammed her vehicle into an ICE officer who then fired shots in self-defence because he feared for his life.

Yet three videos from the scene — each verified by CBC News as authentic — contradict these claims and raise serious questions about why the White House is defending the fatal shooting as justified.

What the videos show

Two of the videos were filmed from street level in close proximity to Good's vehicle, at similar angles from the rear and sides. The third was filmed from above, at some distance away, showing the front of the vehicle.

Good's SUV, a burgundy Honda Pilot, is seen parked horizontally across partially snow-covered Portland Avenue, its engine idling and driver's side window rolled down.

A grey pickup truck drives up to about a car-length away from the driver's side of Good's vehicle. Two masked ICE officers emerge, walk briskly toward the SUV and repeatedly order Good to get out. One of the officers grabs the driver’s side door handle and tries to open it.

Then, as the SUV reverses briefly, a third ICE officer is seen stepping in front of the vehicle, from the passenger side.

Good turns her front wheels to the right and her vehicle starts to move forward. At that point, the third officer appears to be less a metre in front of the driver's side edge of the SUV's hood.

The officer then pulls his gun and fire s what appears to be three shots into the vehicle. It is unclear if the front of the vehicle has passed him as he fires the first shot.

What Trump, Vance and Noem say happened

Just two hours after the shooting, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a statement blaming Good. The statement, posted on X, claimed that ""rioters began blocking ICE officers"" as the incident unfolded. No sign of rioters can be seen in any videos of the shooting.

“One of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them,” read the DHS statement. “An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots.”

A few hours later, Noem told reporters the woman ""attacked"" ICE officers ""and attempted to run them over"" in what she described as ""an act of domestic terrorism.""

Trump issued a social media post on Wednesday afternoon, attaching the video that was filmed from furthest away. He claimed that Good was ""very disorderly, obstructing and resisting"" and that she ""violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense.”

None of the videos show Good's vehicle running over the officer.

'Tragedy of her own making'

Vance has been the most vehement in suggesting the shooting was justified and blaming Good.

""The reason this woman is dead is because she tried to ram somebody with her car,"" he told a news briefing at the White House on Thursday.

""It's a tragedy of her own making,"" Vance said. ""You have a woman who aimed her car at a law enforcement officer and pressed on the accelerator. Nobody debates that.""

Numerous officials in Minneapolis are, in fact, debating just that. Yet Vance insisted that the video evidence backs up his version of events.

""When you look at all angles of that video, it is very clear that her vehicle went right for the guy. She actually collided with him. And then that's, of course, when he fired his shots. That's obvious.""

It is unclear from the videos whether the vehicle makes contact with the officer. The officer stayed on his feet for the entire duration of the shooting and can be observered walking around the scene after the shooting with no apparent injury.

""She was trying to ram this guy with her car. He shot back. He defended himself,"" Vance s aid. He also accused media outlets that are reporting what happened any differently of ""lying about this attack.""

Videos don't support White House narrative: expert

John Gross, an associate professor of law at the University of Wisconsin Law School who has written extensively about police use of force, reviewed the videos and concluded that what they show does not match the narrative from the White House.

""The claim that this is some act of domestic terrorism is nonsensical,"" Gross told CBC's Power and Politics on Thursday.

""She never attempted to ram the officer who eventually shot her,"" he said.

""The idea that the vehicle was being used as a weapon or was targetting the officers, it's clearly not supported by video evidence that we have from the scene.""

Gross says the bullet hole just a few centimetres from the lower driver's side corner of the windshield, indicates the officer first fired from beside the vehicle.

He says the two subsequent shots came as the car was turning away from the officer.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is also disputing the White House version of events.

""People in positions of power have already passed judgment, from the president to the vice-president to Kristi Noem, have stood and told you things that are verifiably false, verifiably inaccurate,"" Walz told a news conference on Thursday.

With the two most powerful elected officials in the U.S. already attempting to exonerate the officer, there are now concerns that the FBI investigation into what happened will lack independence.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said in a social media post on Thursday that Noem ""doesn't want an impartial investigation because she knows her narrative about domestic terrorism is bullshit.""

Frey's post came in response to the news that Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension would not have access to any evidence gathered by the FBI as part of its probe into the shooting.","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/caf0c9cb-cbcc-47bf-81ac-5b73d22f0f39,1767899104677/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%28200%2C416%2C3194%2C1796%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2026-01-09 11:59:28.490704

The procedural paradox Belarus’s engagement with Interpol shows how legal structures designed for cooperation can be repurposed into tools of transnational repression.","When Belarusian filmmaker and activist Andrei Hnyot was detained at a Serbian border crossing in October 2023, the charges seemed routine: tax evasion. But Hnyot had fled Belarus after participating in the 2020 protests, and the Interpol Red Notice that triggered his arrest originated from Minsk. Despite intervention by the European Parliament and credible evidence of political motivation, he spent a year in detention before his release. His case is not an exception; it is a pattern.

In October 2025, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the situation in Belarus, urging the EU and its member states to “put an end to the alarming level of transnational repression conducted by the Lukashenka regime.” Naming Belarus among the top ten perpetrators of transnational repression, the resolution specifically warned of Minsk’s instrumentalisation of Interpol’s intelligence and data-sharing mechanisms to persecute exiled Belarusians beyond its borders.

Following the fraudulent 2020 presidential election, the mass protests, and the subsequent brutal governmental crackdown, more than 500,000 Belarusians sought safety in European states. For those who escaped, many of them opposition figures, activists, and journalists, repression did not end at the border. The Lukashenka regime declared them fugitives and developed an array of tactics to persecute and silence them, with Interpol as a key instrument.

These practices directly implicate EU constitutional law, creating what might be called a procedural paradox: cooperation systems built on mutual trust must now routinely filter politically motivated data to uphold non-refoulement obligations. These include examining compliance with Articles 3 and 6 ECHR and Articles 19 and 47 of the Charter. The prohibition on political persecution requires much stronger systems to catch fabricated and politically motivated cases.

EU constitutional challenges

Politically motivated Interpol alerts test the limits of mutual trust, the principle that EU member states can rely on each other’s judicial systems meeting baseline rule-of-law standards. When corrupted alerts enter shared enforcement systems, European authorities face a dilemma. They must balance maintaining effective judicial and law-enforcement cooperation with protecting fundamental rights guarantees.

The Court of Justice has addressed analogous tensions within the EU itself. In Aranyosi and Căldăraru, the Court held that even the high level of trust underpinning the European Arrest Warrant can be rebutted where systemic deficiencies in detention conditions create a real risk of inhuman treatment. Member States must then assess individual circumstances before executing a warrant. The logic extends to third-country data entering EU systems: where a state demonstrates systematic rule-of-law deficits, European authorities cannot simply process alerts at face value but must apply enhanced scrutiny to protect fundamental rights.

First, abusive alerts engage non-refoulement obligations. Article 3 ECHR and Article 19 of the EU Charter are substantive prohibitions against returning individuals to states where they face persecution or torture. Second, they undermine the prohibition of political persecution, which remains central both to extradition law and asylum procedures. Article 18 ECHR, which prohibits the use of restrictions on rights for purposes other than those prescribed, is also engaged parasitically to Articles 3 and 6 ECHR, where prosecution requests are used for political ends. Third, they threaten fair-trial and due-process guarantees under Article 6 ECHR and Article 47 EU Charter when individuals cannot access or challenge the data held against them. This last concern is particularly acute in the Belarusian context: when the Minsk National Central Bureau (NCB) applies data-access restrictions, and the Commission for the Control of Interpol’s Files cannot compel disclosure, targeted individuals are effectively denied the right to an effective remedy, a core Article 47 guarantee. Belarus’s exploitation of Interpol not only creates constitutional tension but also undermines the protection of fundamental rights on European soil. Understanding these constitutional stakes requires a brief look at Interpol’s framework and its vulnerabilities.

Interpol’s architecture and its vulnerability

Interpol’s mandate is narrowly defined. Created to facilitate police cooperation against transnational crime, it provides a secure communication network, databases, and a colour-coded notice system. The International Criminal Police organisation operates through decentralised National Central Bureaus (NCBs), embedded in domestic law-enforcement structures. NCBs submit data and request alerts on Interpol’s platform.

Red Notices request the location and provisional arrest of a particular person. Once issued by Interpol’s General Secretariat, it is circulated to all 196 member states and copied into national systems, such as the Schengen Information System, national watchlists or immigration databases. While not an international arrest warrant, Red Notices are the “sniper rifle of autocrats”, used to persecute dissidents across borders.

Interpol does not investigate underlying facts, evaluate political context, or assess the human-rights situation of the requesting state. Its framework assumes that NCBs act in good faith. Article 3 of Interpol’s Constitution prohibits political activity, and the Rules on the Processing of Data (RPD) require reliable judicial information before an alert is issued. However, compliance depends largely on the requesting state, which creates a structural vulnerability.

Belarus systematically exploits this weakness. Leaked audio recordings from 2021 reveal senior law-enforcement officials, including NCB staff, discussing how to conceal the political nature of cases by reframing them as ordinary criminal charges. Charges of tax evasion, fraud, property offences or defamation are particularly popular in Minsk. The formal labels satisfy Interpol’s technical thresholds while the political intent remains concealed.

Data restrictions and information blackout

This misuse of Interpol by Belarus extends beyond charge manipulation. A more recent and worrying tactic adopted by the NCB in Minsk is the extensive use of data-access restrictions. While intended to protect sensitive investigations, such restrictions prevent individuals from confirming whether they appear in Interpol’s systems. They block access to the information needed to challenge a Notice before Interpol’s quasi-judicial review body, the Commission for the Control of Interpol’s Files (CCF).

Interpol’s rules require NCBs to justify every restriction. But if an NCB provides vague or inconclusive responses, the CCF cannot compel disclosure. When the requesting authority is uncooperative, restrictions can therefore persist. Belarusian lawyers face parallel obstacles: defence counsel are routinely denied access to case files for clients abroad. The combined effect is an information blackout. This makes it nearly impossible for exiles to verify accusations, contest data, or defend themselves.

How politically motivated alerts enter EU systems and create structural challenges

The consequences of politically motivated alerts unfold outside Interpol. Once a Red Notice or diffusion (direct alert between NCBs) is circulated, it is processed by border police, immigration authorities, and courts bound by procedural safeguards and human-rights obligations. EU systems designed for rapid information exchange cannot instantly distinguish between politically motivated data and legitimate alerts. Red Notice Monitor has documented this issue in the UK immigration context.

The case of Belarusian filmmaker and activist Andrei Hnyot illustrates the stakes. Hnyot, who participated in the 2020 protests, was detained in Serbia in October 2023 on a Belarus-requested Red Notice alleging tax evasion. He sought asylum, citing a credible risk of torture. The European Parliament urged Serbia not to extradite him, and independent media questioned the charges. Nonetheless, Hnyot spent a year in detention before his release in late 2024. Similarly, in 2024, Polish police detained a Belarusian man, already granted protection in Poland, on the basis of a Red Notice. Previously, Valiantsin Vlasik, who had received a humanitarian visa in Poland, was detained at the Hungarian border on the basis of a request alleging financial crimes. He had spent six months in a pre-trial detention centre before being released and able to return to Poland.

In these cases, courts ultimately refused extradition. The political motives were apparent, and the risk of ill-treatment overwhelming. But the cases reveal the core constitutional tension: Belarus exploits procedural legitimacy to trigger EU legal obligations designed for democratic partners bound by the rule of law. This exploitation of Interpol penetrates the foundations of European cooperation and thereby jeopardises fundamental rights guarantees on European soil.

EU responses and the procedural paradox

The EU has begun to respond. Courts consistently refuse extradition to Belarus. Asylum authorities treat alerts from states with systemic human-rights violations as strong indicators of risk. Several Member States have issued internal guidance to police and migration officials on handling high-risk alerts. The European Parliament has repeatedly called for stricter scrutiny and stronger safeguards. In November 2025, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on addressing transnational repression.

The issue for the EU is not a lack of awareness but the practical difficulty of filtering politically motivated data in real time while respecting the rule of law. So far, the adopted measures do not eliminate the initial impact. Individuals may still be detained, questioned when travelling, or face delays in immigration procedures. To challenge and have a Notice deleted from Interpol’s databases can take many months, even years. After deletion from Interpol’s systems, outdated data often lingers in national systems until manually removed by the respective NCB. This leaves individuals in legal limbo. An atmosphere of fear ensues, and Belarus achieves the desired effect of transnational repression: to silence dissent.

These dynamics create a procedural paradox. EU authorities ultimately comply with fundamental-rights requirements, yet politically motivated information generates operational friction in a system premised on trust. Immigration, law enforcement, and legal systems face administrative strain in processing information that should never have entered shared databases. Such abuse of Interpol is not only a tool of repression but exposes structural vulnerabilities in the Schengen architecture.

This paradox is amplified by Western policy incoherence. Since 2021, the regime has orchestrated engineered migration flows, airspace provocations, and other forms of non-military pressure. Many Belarusians face visa refusals, banking restrictions, renting obstacles, and administrative discrimination in Europe, partly a by-product of Western sanctions and political tensions. Between 2020 and 2023, Western states oscillated between slow-moving sanctions, diplomatic isolation, and reactive measures, creating unpredictable incentives for Minsk. Unable to settle on a unified Belarus strategy, the West inadvertently left space for Belarusian coercive practices to spill into international policing systems.

Regional authoritarian networks and Russian alignment

Belarus’s deepening alignment with Russia since 2020 adds a further layer of concern. As Minsk integrates into a Russian-anchored authoritarian security system that includes other post-Soviet states, the potential for coordinated misuse increases. These networks share prosecution strategies and policing infrastructure. A single alert can circulate across multiple jurisdictions that assume it reflects legitimate criminal suspicion. This increases the volume of politically motivated data entering international systems. For authoritarian states it is a low-cost tool of pressure, while democratic states must invest time, resources, and legal safeguards to mitigate the harm.

The procedural paradox

Belarus’s engagement with Interpol shows how legal structures designed for cooperation can be repurposed into tools of transnational repression. The European Parliament resolution of October 2025 recognised this threat, urging Member States to end the alarming level of transnational repression conducted by the Lukashenka regime. Yet the challenge remains: cooperation systems built on mutual trust must now routinely filter politically motivated data. European authorities comply with fundamental-rights requirements, but the process generates operational friction, administrative strain, and prolonged legal limbo for targeted individuals. Belarus achieves its desired effect, silencing dissent through fear, even when extradition is ultimately refused.

A path forward

Addressing this problem requires a shift from reactive case-by-case handling towards coordinated structural safeguards. Member States should adopt presumptive non-enforcement protocols for Belarus-originated alerts, requiring enhanced verification before any enforcement action. Embedding country-risk indicators directly into Schengen Information System II would allow authorities to flag alerts from states with systemic rule-of-law deficiencies. Rapid-response legal assistance mechanisms for targeted individuals would reduce the disproportionate burden currently placed on exiled Belarusians navigating opaque procedures to clear their names.

Interpol itself must strengthen its Commission for the Control of Files by enabling automatic disclosure challenges when restrictions lack proper justification. Periodic audits of national bureaus with documented patterns of misuse would help prevent the repeated insertion of unreliable data into international policing systems.

The misuse of Interpol is more than a human-rights issue; it is a test of whether European information-sharing systems can withstand deliberate attempts to manipulate their procedural foundations. Closing these structural vulnerabilities is essential not only to protect those who have fled persecution but to ensure that international police cooperation remains anchored in the rule of law.",https://verfassungsblog.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/feature_vb.png,N,,2026-01-09 09:58:57.589113

The FBI’s Portland office said it was investigating an “agent involved shooting” that happened around 2:15 p.m. According to the the Portland Police bureau, officers initially responded to a report of a shooting near a hospital.

A few minutes later, police received information that a man who had been shot was asking for help in a different area a couple of miles away. Officers then responded there and found the two people with apparent gunshot wounds. Officers determined they were injured in the shooting with federal agents, police said.

Their conditions were not immediately known. Council President Elana Pirtle-Guiney said during a Portland city council meeting that Thursday’s shooting took place in the eastern part of the city and that two Portlanders were wounded.

“As far as we know both of these individuals are still alive and we are hoping for more positive updates throughout the afternoon,” she said.

The shooting comes a day after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a woman in Minnesota. It escalated tensions in an city that has long had a contentious relationship with President Trump, including Trump’s recent, failed effort to deploy National Guard troops in the city.

Portland police secured both the scene of the shooting and the area where the wounded people were found pending investigation.

“We are still in the early stages of this incident,” said Chief Bob Day. “We understand the heightened emotion and tension many are feeling in the wake of the shooting in Minneapolis, but I am asking the community to remain calm as we work to learn more.”

Portland Mayor Keith Wilson and the City Council called on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to end all operations in Oregon’s largest city until a full investigation is completed.

“We stand united as elected officials in saying that we cannot sit by while constitutional protections erode and bloodshed mounts,” a joint statement said. “Portland is not a ‘training ground’ for militarized agents, and the ‘full force’ threatened by the administration has deadly consequences.”

The city officials said “federal militarization undermines effective, community‑based public safety, and it runs counter to the values that define our region. We’ll use every legal and legislative tool available to protect our residents’ civil and human rights.”

They urged residents to show up with “calm and purpose during this difficult time.”

“We respond with clarity, unity, and a commitment to justice,” the statement said. “We must stand together to protect Portland.”

U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, urged any protesters to remain peaceful.

Renee Nicole Good, 37, was shot in the head on Wednesday as she apparently tried to drive away from agents in the northern US city as they approached her car, which they said blocked their way.

Vice President JD Vance said, without providing evidence, Good was part of a ""broader left-wing network"" opposed to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and insisted the officer acted in ""self-defense."" The White House asserted that US law enforcement was under ""organized attack"" and presented a version of the shooting disputed by officials in Minnesota, who contend that federal forces are making the streets more dangerous.

Large, noisy crowds gathered around Minneapolis in protest on Thursday, chanting slogans against ICE. Federal immigration officers armed with pepperball guns and tear gas wrestled several protesters to the ground.

In a separate incident Thursday afternoon, US federal agents shot and wounded two individuals in the western city of Portland, Oregon, local police said. ""Two people are in the hospital following a shooting involving federal agents,"" a statement from Portland Police said, adding a man and a woman were wounded by ""apparent gunshot wounds.""

Speaking at a news conference late Thursday, Oregon Governor Tina Kotek voiced concern about the use of force by federal agents in Portland and called for a full investigation into the shooting.

'Smoke and mirrors'

Trump and senior officials have claimed that in the Minneapolis incident, Good was trying to kill the ICE agents. ""I want to see nobody get shot. I want to see nobody screaming and trying to run over policemen either,"" the president told The New York Times.

Footage from Wednesday shows an agent attempting to open Good's car door before another officer, standing near the front bumper, fires three times into the moving Honda SUV. The vehicle veers into parked cars, as horrified onlookers hurl abuse at the federal officers before her bloodied body appears slumped at the wheel.

Vance alleged Thursday that Good was part of a broader effort ""to attack, to doxx, to assault and to make it impossible for our ICE officers to do their job."" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said ""law enforcement are under organized attack.""

Immigrant deportations

Protests in Minneapolis grew after Minnesota's Democratic Governor Tim Walz called it a ""patriotic duty"" to demonstrate. ""Watching that woman get murdered yesterday – no more. This can't continue to happen. And I can't sit home and just watch it,"" 62-year-old Shanda Copeland told AFP at a protest in the city on Thursday. ""I feel like at least I'm here and I'll raise my voice as loud as I can.""

Minneapolis schools were closed Thursday and Friday in anticipation of unrest. Walz said Minnesota must participate in the shooting probe alongside federal investigators – otherwise Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ""is judge, jury and basically executioner.""

But Vance suggested the officer would be cleared by a federal probe that would exclude state-level officials. ""The idea that this was not justified is absurd,"" he said.

Wednesday's incident came during protests over immigration enforcement in southern Minneapolis, where locals are expressing widespread anger over Trump's vow to arrest and deport ""millions"" of undocumented people. The victim's mother, Donna Ganger, told the Minnesota Star Tribune her daughter ""was probably terrified"" and ""not part"" of anti-ICE activity.

Religious leaders addressed crowds at the scene of Good's death, where a memorial of flowers and candles was growing.

Metropolitan Police Department officials have said D.C. police officers do not patrol with ICE agents, but federal officers who do patrol with city officers may conduct immigration enforcement.","A report by the D.C. Council Committee on Public Works and Operations criticizes Mayor Muriel Bowser’s administration, accusing it of failing to be transparent with residents about police collaboration with federal immigration authorities.

Bowser and city officials, including D.C. police, have insisted officers do not participate in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activities. However, the report cites witness testimony and media reports placing D.C. police at the scene of some ICE operations.

On Thursday, the day after ICE agents in Minneapolis shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good, Bowser weighed in.

“You have people who are unaccustomed to urban policing trying to police in an urban environment,” Bowser said. “I’m not a police officer; I’m not in law enforcement, but what I saw was completely avoidable. And a woman died.”

Bowser would not directly comment on the report, but said she is reviewing it.

The outgoing mayor did say she understands people’s outrage when it comes to ICE’s deployment, but that outrage should be placed where it belongs: Congress.

“You could ask me a thousand questions; you could send a thousand questions to the chief about ICE,” she said. “ICE is patrolling American cities. If we don’t want that, Congress has to stop funding ICE because thousands of agents who are untrained to police in urban environments are on our streets. That’s where the questions should be placed.”

D.C. Council members have repeatedly asked officials why police officers were present at immigration enforcement scenes, but officials have declined to explain. Testimony in the report indicated it appeared the officers were cooperating with ICE.

The committee noted Bowser faced a challenging situation under President Donald Trump, who is known for retaliating against politicians who’ve defied him. Nevertheless, the report urged Bowser and D.C. police to reverse policies that facilitated greater cooperation with federal immigration agents and called for increased transparency about the nature of that collaboration.

Immigration enforcement in D.C. intensified in August after Trump declared a crime emergency and assumed control of the city’s police department for 30 days.

Metropolitan Police Department officials have said D.C. police officers do not patrol with ICE agents, but federal officers who do patrol with city officers may conduct immigration enforcement.

Despite the terrible facts on the ground in Minneapolis and the unsavory associations with authoritarianism ICE tactics represent, it could be worse for Trump’s party.","Within a day of an ICE agent fatally shooting a Minneapolis motorist, members of the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress had almost uniformly concluded that the shooting was legitimate and probably the fault of the deceased victim. Hardly any Republican officials said, “I have no comment until an investigation has taken place” or hedged bets about the facts and their meaning. As journalists and average social-media users pored over grainy images of the shooting and began to question the official account, Trumpworld’s solidarity with the shooter showed no signs of weakening. Whatever private misgivings Republicans have about Kristi Noem’s immediate and repeated claims that Renee Nicole Good’s death was the result of her own complicity in “domestic terrorism,” they’re closing ranks for the time being, with Vice-President J.D. Vance leading cheers for ICE.

This “rush to judgment” (as a former ICE director, John Sandweg, called it) suggests a highly politicized reaction to the shooting. Yes, some Democrats were quick to call the shooting a criminal act (and their position seems pretty clearly to be supported by the evidence we currently have). But it’s the GOP reaction that is most formidable and puzzling. Much of it could simply reflect the customary GOP deference to Trump, who immediately called the shooting an act of self-defense and identified the victim with the usual “radical left” suspects he fingers whenever something bad happens. But the broader optics of the incident suggest an extraordinary degree of collective Republican self-confidence that, facts aside, support for the shooter is good politics for the GOP.

Seen from 40,000 feet, the shooting and the entire set of controversies over ICE and its terroristic tactics represent the confluence of two issues Republicans think will invariably work in their favor: immigration and crime/policing. It’s true that immigration remains a relative bright spot for Trump among generally negative job-approval ratings. And the mass-deportation initiative that is ICE’s principal mission is very close to the heart of the MAGA movement. Meanwhile, the 2024 presidential campaign made it very clear Republicans believe that pandemic-era protests about police brutality (galvanized by the police murder of George Floyd less than a mile from where Renee Nicole Good had her own fatal encounter with law enforcement) have boomeranged and fed widespread public concerns about crime and disorder, real or just perceived. An associated “Back the Blue” movement is evident around the country, particularly in MAGA-land, and it’s entirely possible Republicans figure they can extend that presumption of police benevolence to ICE, hard as it might be to envision these armed and masked tormenters of immigrants as heroes.

More generally, Republicans may figure a national focus on ICE tactics wrong-foots Democrats, not only by reidentifying them with the phantom menace of “defunding the police” (with scattered Democratic calls for the total abolition of ICE contributing to that caricature) but by shifting the partisan battleground in the GOP’s direction. At present, Democratic politicians are being constantly hectored by consultants to put on blinders and ignore every issue other than “affordability.” In particular, they’ve been warned again and again not to “take Trump’s bait” by letting his rhetorical excesses (again on vivid display in his callous reaction to the Minneapolis shooting) distract them from obsessively talking about housing and grocery prices. The last week has been sheer torment for such Democrats between the Venezuela military strike and now the tragedy in Minnesota. A national debate on mass deportation and ICE tactics that spills over into disputes about the legitimacy of anti-ICE protests and general attitudes toward law enforcement is a nice distraction from Trump’s unpopular economic and foreign-policy agenda. And to the extent this debate remains focused on events in Minnesota, it keeps attention fixed on a blue state that Republicans would love to keep talking about, given the ongoing scandal over illegal pandemic-era spending in child-care programs linked to criminal immigrant networks of fraudsters.

All in all, Republicans probably found it easy to follow Trump’s lead in defending the Minneapolis shooter because this posture gratifies the MAGA base while muddying adverse waters of current events. Before last week, the GOP was staring down the barrel of a midterm-election defeat and fretting about a president who blamed voters for ingratitude about the glorious blessings he had bestowed on them. Now they’re on more familiar and comfortable ground, even as Democrats prepare for more wrangling about how they talk about immigration and policing.

Cuts hit nearly every major federal agency

Budget data points to little cost savings

WASHINGTON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. federal workforce has fallen to its lowest level in at least a decade, according to government data published on Thursday, a result of President Donald Trump’s campaign to shrink the government.

Cuts this year have hit nearly every major federal agency, according to the statistics from the Office of Personnel Management. Several lost more than a quarter of their staff, including the Departments of Education, Agriculture and Housing and Urban Development. The Department of Homeland Security is an exception, with headcount barely fluctuating since Trump took office.

The U.S. government employs 2.1 million workers, according to OPM statistics.

The federal government has long been seen as a stable employer, with staff commonly spending decades working inside U.S. agencies. Trump and his team sought to change that at the start of his second term, as he argued that the federal government was bloated and inefficient. Thursday's figures showed the administration’s progress on that goal.

""This effort ensures taxpayer dollars support a workforce that delivers efficient, responsive and high-quality services,"" said OPM Director Scott Kupor.

Budget data points to little, if any, cost savings. The government has spent close to $244 billion on federal salaries since Trump returned to the White House, 3% more than it did during the same period under Trump's Democratic predecessor Joe Biden, according to a Reuters analysis of daily spending figures released by the Treasury Department.

Overall, federal spending under Trump is up about 7%, driven by growth in Social Security outlays and interest payments on the national debt, according to the same daily Treasury statements.

Billionaire and former Trump adviser Elon Musk initiated the downsizing effort, with backing from his team at his Department of Government Efficiency. Days after Trump's second term began, his administration sent a buyout offer by email to civilian federal employees, saying that the administration could not give ""full assurance"" that their positions would not be eliminated.

That email prompted tens of thousands of them to leave their jobs. Other messages from Musk and his team put employees on edge, including his requirement that they send an email listing five things they accomplished that week.

Thousands of employees left their agencies in the following weeks, after the Trump administration directed cabinet secretaries to dismiss employees who were new to their roles.

Agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services and the IRS, later dismissed more employees as part of mass layoffs. Disease researchers, tax collectors and medical-device staffers were among the employees that lost their jobs.

Federal worker unions and their allies sued over the terminations. Many of the lawsuits are still pending in court.

Musk left the Trump administration in May, following a public clash with Trump. DOGE no longer exists as a centralized entity, Kupor told Reuters in November.

The head of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA), the state’s investigations agency, said that federal officials are barring the office from accessing any evidence necessary to investigate the killing.

Despite initially agreeing to conduct the investigation jointly with the BCA on Wednesday morning, the U.S. Attorney’s Office and FBI changed course that afternoon. As the Trump administration was furiously spinning lies about the shooting, the BCA was informed that the FBI would assume sole responsibility for the probe.

The FBI said that the BCA would “no longer have access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews necessary to complete a thorough and independent investigation,” said BCA Superintendent Drew Evans.

“Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands. As a result, the BCA has reluctantly withdrawn from the investigation,” Evans said.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended the decision on Thursday, saying that state investigators “don’t have any jurisdiction in this investigation,” despite crimes like murder typically not rising to a federal offense unless a federal officer is killed.

The move has sparked outcry, with critics saying that the Trump administration is trying to cover up the killing.

“You don’t cut out investigators unless you’re hiding something. Kristi Noem’s DHS is covering up the killing of a U.S. citizen,” said the Democrats on the House Homeland Security Committee in a post on X.

Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress are also seeking to shield DHS from facing accountability for the killing.

In the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday, Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley (Massachusetts) motioned to subpoena DHS and ICE for records and footage of the shooting in order for members of Congress to help hold the government accountable.

However, Republicans blocked the move, with every GOP member voting against it.

“DHS’ claim that an agent shot in self-defense is a bold-faced lie and the video footage is damning,” said Pressley in a statement after the vote. “But after I moved to subpoena all records and footage related to this killing, Republicans shamefully voted it down — demonstrating once again that they have never cared about law and order or keeping our communities safe.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2026/01/2026_01-08-minneapolis-ice.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 02:57:04.667684

The protest, which officially began at 11 a.m., comes one day after the fatal shooting of a 37-year-old woman by an ICE officer in an immigration-related operation in Minneapolis.

""Protesters in San Diego are calling for an end to violent, out-of-control immigration operations with ICE raiding communities and tearing families apart,"" a statement from SEIU Local 221 said.

The local represents more than 12,000 workers in San Diego and Imperial counties, which also said that ""fear, displacement and dehumanizing politics [are being] used to attack and kill working people must stop.""

A governmental protest at the site has been taking place every Thursday for months, though Thursday's event was by far the largest NBC 7's immigration reporter Shelby Bremer said she had witnessed.

NBC 7 asked ICE for a statement about Thursday's protest and was told that, while the agency supports people's rights to free speech and to peacefully assemble, ICE agents are the targets of retribution and endangered for performing their jobs.

San Diego County Board of Supervisors Terra Lawson-Remer and Paloma Aguirre were scheduled to attend the demonstration, along with members of multiple labor and activist organizations, including the San Diego & Imperial Counties Labor Council AFL-CIO, Unión del Barrio and San Diego Education Association.

“People have a right to protest against ICE’s brutality,"" said Emily Von Gerichten, an organizer with the Party for Socialism and Liberation, in a news release issued on Thursday morning. ""Any politician who is urging people to stay home and shut up is part of the problem. We have seen time and again that the Trump administration will try to criminalize people exercising their free speech rights. But we will not be intimidated and we will continue to raise our voice until we win justice for Renee Nicole Good and end ICE’s mass deportations once and for all.”

At one point on Thursday night, a confrontation broke out between protesters and a van. Seconds after, volunteers were pushing protesters to clear the area as the San Diego Police Department closed in on the street.

Renee Nicole Good, 37, was killed while attempting to leave an Immigrations & Customs Enforcement stop. In a series of viral videos, an ICE agent, who has yet to be identified, is seen standing to the front left of Good's vehicle as she turned her wheels to the right. He shot her through the windshield.

Good died at the scene. She is survived by a partner and a 6-year-old child.

""Renee was one of the kindest people I've ever known,"" Donna Ganger, Good's mother, told the Minnesota Star Tribune. ""She was extremely compassionate. She's taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.""

Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minnesota, described Good as a ""legal observer."" Minneapolis Police Department Chief Brian O'Hara said it does not appear the woman was the ""target of any law enforcement investigation or activity.""

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the ICE agent acted ""in self-defense"" and that Good hit him with her car, requiring a hospital visit.

Former Vice President Kamala Harris had a different view.

""Many of us have seen the horrifying and painful video, which makes it clear that the Trump administration's explanation of this shooting is pure gaslighting,"" Harris said.

President Donald Trump wrote on social media, ""I have just viewed the clip of the event which took place in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is a horrible thing to watch. The woman screaming was, obviously, a professional agitator, and the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self-defense. Based on the attached clip, it is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital. The situation is being studied, in its entirety, but the reason these incidents are happening is because the Radical Left is threatening, assaulting and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis.

The bills that advanced Thursday would codify the directive almost exactly into state law.","“Anyone who is an ancestor of a Holocaust survivor will tell you, this is how it starts,” state Sen. Britnee Timberlake said before the state Senate Judiciary Committee. Timberlake had a translator sharing her comments in Spanish to a packed committee room.

“If you don’t believe me, just ask the children of the 37-year-old woman from Minnesota, a white American citizen, who was just shot and killed by ICE.”

The shooting of the woman, Renee Good, sparked nationwide outrage, particularly among Democrats. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker called for the resignation of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who oversees Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul said Thursday she intends to push for expanded legal protections against the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement. And in New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy told reporters Thursday that the shooting was “horrifying, deplorable, despicable” and not “remotely merited.”

New Jersey lawmakers advanced the trio of bills in their Assembly and Senate committees along party lines, teeing them up for a full vote in the Legislature next week. The effort and comments from state lawmakers — which began in the Statehouse shortly before the Minnesota shooting — have already received pushback from the White House.

“ICE officers are facing a massive increase [in] assaults against them because of dangerous, untrue smears from elected Democrats,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement to POLITICO. “ICE officers act heroically to enforce the law and protect American communities with the utmost professionalism. Anyone pointing the finger at law enforcement officers instead of the criminals are simply doing the bidding of criminal illegal aliens.”

The Trump administration opposes states and cities that restrict cooperation with federal immigration authorities, which are colloquially referred to as “sanctuary” jurisdictions — although it is not a legal term.

The centerpiece of the three-bill package would codify into state law the Murphy administration’s statewide practice — known as the Immigrant Trust Directive — that restricts when state and local law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration authorities. Another bill seeks to create “model policies” for how places like hospitals and schools, should respond to immigration enforcement; another bill would bar the state, local government and hospitals from requesting or collecting information on immigration status, with narrow exceptions.

If the bills pass the full Legislature, they would then go to Murphy’s desk with just days to act before he leaves office Jan. 20. While Murphy has said he supports his administration’s policy of limiting state and local police working with federal immigration authorities, it’s unclear if he would sign the bills. His office declined to comment on the pending legislation.

White House officials opposed the new anti-ICE efforts from New Jersey Democrats, accusing them of supporting “criminal aliens who kill” New Jerseyans. Trump administration officials have cited a recent tragedy when a man in the country without authorization — previously arrested for domestic violence — killed a mother and daughter while driving under the influence in Central Jersey.

In Trenton, some Democratic lawmakers are pushing back forcefully against ICE. Timberlake, a progressive Democrat, compared their activity to war crimes.

“What the federal government is directing ICE to carry out is wrong,” she told reporters. “I do believe, and look for a day in the future where history will speak for itself, and that those who are carrying out these illegal acts will find themselves in the same position as those who carried out the illegal acts in Nazi Germany through the Nuremberg trials.”

Democrats supportive of limiting state and local police working with federal immigration authorities argue that doing so helps public safety, since immigrants feel comfortable working with police on issues not related to immigration enforcement.

“When people go underground, it gets more dangerous for all of us, including our heroes in local and state law enforcement,” state Sen. Raj Mukherji, a Democratic and sponsor of the bills, said during a Thursday committee hearing.

Mukherji said that keeping local police out of federal immigration enforcement would ensure they would not be involved in scenarios like the Minnesota shooting.

“Now they’re killing Americans on the street. Now imagine if local police were involved in an incident like that here in New Jersey,” he said. “Should our constituents and local taxpayers be on the hook for the damages that will inevitably result from those lawsuits?”

The Immigrant Trust Directive severely limits when local police work with federal immigration authorities. For example, they cannot work on civil immigration enforcement operations or provide equipment to ICE. Progressive Democrats want to codify the directive into state law, which could be undone by a future state attorney general.

The directive also says local authorities cannot keep someone in detention just to hand them over to ICE, unless the person has been charged or convicted of a serious crime or subject to a final order of deportation.

U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly, D-Lynwood, who is running in the Democratic primary for retiring Sen. Dick Durbin’s seat, said she plans to file articles of impeachment against Noem.

“She has turned ICE into a rogue force, violating the Constitution, tearing families apart, and leaving death in her wake,” Kelly said in a statement. “From Chicago to Minneapolis, her recklessness cost lives, including Renee Nicole Good. This isn’t just dangerous — it’s impeachable. I’m fighting back.”

Alongside Kelly is her Democratic primary opponent, Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Schaumburg, who wrote on social media that “I’ll be your first cosponsor.”

“When federal agents are unleashed without restraint or oversight, the consequences are deadly — and the responsibility for this killing is on their hands,” he said, adding that he will be “demanding full answers and accountability from the Trump administration.”

The third leading candidate in that Senate race, Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton, said Noem should “resign or be removed,” adding “we won’t let you get away with this.”

Impeachment unlikely

Kelly’s impeachment push is likely symbolic at this point due to Democrats’ minority status in the U.S. House. And removal doesn’t appear likely either, as Trump and Republicans in his administration and Congress put out statements backing the ICE officer’s conduct.

Good, 37, was killed by a federal immigration agent while apparently attempting to flee a traffic stop. DHS, in a statement, said she “weaponized her vehicle” and attempted to run over agents in “an act of domestic terrorism” while the officer, “fearing for his life,” fired defensive shots.

However, multiple videos of the incident directly contradicted the Trump administration’s narrative by showing that Good was driving away from — not toward — the officer when he opened fire, raising doubts about the necessity of using lethal force.

The ICE agent later was seen on video walking around the scene with no apparent injuries, even though Trump said on social media the officer was hospitalized. Trump deemed the victim a domestic terrorist.

For Illinois’ elected leaders, there was a sense of déjà vu as the accounting of the fatal shooting echoed patterns in two shootings involving immigration officers during the height of Operation Midway Blitz in the Chicago region last year.

Silverio Villegas Gonzalez was fatally shot by ICE agents in Franklin Park in September after attempting to flee a traffic stop. As in Good’s case, DHS said that Villegas Gonzalez tried to use his vehicle as a weapon, that agents feared for their lives, acted in self-defense and were “seriously injured.” But, bodycam footage later obtained by the Chicago Sun-Times found that the ICE officers deemed their injuries as “nothing major.”

In October, Marimar Martinez was shot by a federal agent in Chicago’s Brighton Park neighborhood. DHS called her a “domestic terrorist” who used her car as a weapon. But evidence poked holes in that narrative and federal charges against her were dropped.

‘We’ve seen this playbook before’

Gov. JB Pritzker, speaking at an unrelated bill signing Wednesday morning, said that “we’ve seen this playbook before,” casting the federal government’s version of events in Orwellian terms.

“Kristi Noem and Donald Trump have told Americans to disbelieve clear, indisputable video evidence,” Pritzker said. “They want you to question what your eyes and ears are telling you and instead blindly believe anything that they say.”

The governor then encouraged people to watch videos of the incident for themselves.

Pritzker had one other message: “It’s time for Kristi Noem to go.”

“ICE is not making Minneapolis safer — just as it did not make Chicago safer,” U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth said, calling the shooting “horrific” and saying the agency’s behavior “needs to stop.”

Durbin, in a statement, said that “a full investigation must be completed so the truth can be revealed.”

“Video of the incident starkly contradicts DHS’ narrative, and the fact that DHS has jumped to characterize this shooting in ‘self-defense’ is rushed, at best, and a lie, at worst,” he said.

Durbin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, called on his Republican counterparts to issue a subpoena to compel Noem to testify before the committee.

Noem is one of the faces of the Trump administration’s aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration. She made several appearances in Illinois during Midway Blitz, the campaign DHS says resulted in the arrests of more than 4,500 immigrants who were living in Chicago and its suburbs without legal permission.

But the raids often led to violent confrontations between masked federal agents and protestors during various operations in the city and suburbs, including near an Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility in suburban Broadview. Many of these skirmishes resulted in the deployment of tear gas and other chemical agents.",https://i0.wp.com/capitolnewsillinois.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Noem-ICE-JA-2-2.jpg?fit=1140%2C760&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2026-01-09 04:57:07.514706

Tragic death

What they're saying:

Immigration attorney Brandon Vesely said Good's death was tragic but predictable given the increased presence of ICE agents in communities across the country.

""It's heartbreaking, and it's horrible, and it's, and I think I agree with what others just said that it's not surprising when our government decides to kind of unleash the military and our cities is kind of a predictable result,"" said Vesely.

A small group of protesters from the Interfaith Movement for Human Integrity demonstrated in front of ICE headquarters in San Francisco.

Amy Argenal from the Rapid Response Network in Santa Cruz said the killing was a jolt to the rapid responder community, but she said there is a constant threat to them and to the immigrants whom they're protecting.

""I mean, I think we're always cautious and thinking about safety, but you know what, this administration they can do anything at any time, and we're seeing that domestically,"" Argenal said. ""We're seeing it internationally, and so I'm not necessarily more fearful now.""

Violence hits home

In the South Bay, many of the rapid response network said they're speaking from personal experience. ""This violence is not distant. It is happening here in California,"" said Yesenia Campos from the Rapid Response Network in Santa Clara County. ""It is happening here in San Jose.""

""I am not speaking about the silence from a distance,"" said Campos. ""I was detained by ICE here in San Jose during a legal observation.""

But they say the immigrants they hope to protect are more likely to face violence.

""Here in Santa Clara County we have seen it. I've already seen the consequences of ICE's, violent and reckless enforcement tactics,"" said Stephanie Jayne from the Rapid Response Network in Santa Clara County. ""We have documented multiple cases in which community members were hospitalized as a result of brutal force used during arrest here in Santa Clara County.""

The UW center’s report looked to New York, which it said has cut off Nlets access to both ICE and CBP.
But in the news conference, some acknowledged that other federal agencies could also access Nlets and share information with immigration agents.","More than a half dozen years after Washington began limiting access to driver’s license data for immigration enforcement, federal officials were still using the information for immigration arrests as recently as late last year, a report released Thursday shows.

And despite the state implementing new restrictions twice last year, some immigration authorities still have access to driver’s license data, according to state officials and the report by the University of Washington Center for Human Rights.

Gov. Bob Ferguson stands “prepared to take further action,” according to a 10-page joint statement by his office, State Patrol and Washington’s Department of Licensing. But the statement said the governor “will do so with reason and care.”

“Governor Ferguson is committed to complying with applicable laws and finding the right balance in protecting individuals’ data without compromising legitimate law enforcement investigations of criminal acts that are necessary to preserve public safety,” the statement continued.

The UW center report documented nine cases of immigration arrests between August and November last year that followed queries by federal agents to Nlets, a national computer system that allows law enforcement agencies to access state driver’s license data, criminal history and other information stored throughout the country. Such queries, in Washington, go through a State Patrol platform called ACCESS, which acts as a “switch” to send information back to Nlets and the requesting parties, according to the UW report and state officials.

The Seattle Times, separately, obtained information about another case – the widely publicized arrest of Kirkland high school theater manager Fernando Rocha – indicating federal agents queried Nlets for state licensing information six times before his arrest last July.

Officials can enter a driver’s license number into Nlets and retrieve the registered owner’s information, including their home address, date of birth, height and hair color. They can also get a photo. Officials can then check that information against Department of Homeland Security data for alleged immigration violations and use the data to verify or identify targets for arrest, according to the UW report.

In several cases tracked by the UW center through public disclosure documents and ICE records, federal agents looked up information on a truck or van, then followed the vehicle and made a traffic stop leading to an arrest.

Federal agents queried Nlets about one man’s license plate after he left a Latino grocery story, saying in reports they were “performing systems checks on vehicles moving near the location of a targeted subject,” according to the report. They determined he lacked authorization to be in the U.S. and arrested him. The man later told UW researchers he had been pistol-whipped, tased and pepper-sprayed in his eyes as he was arrested.

Such arrests, aided by state licensing information, have turned roads into immigration enforcement “hunting grounds,” the UW report says.

Washington’s attempt to limit driver’s license information sharing started in 2018, after the Seattle Times revealed that the Department of Licensing was routinely giving out data to immigration agents directly by email. Then-Gov. Jay Inslee halted the practice.

But immigration agents remained able to access data through computerized systems, including one controlled by the licensing department. A King 5 investigation led the state in August to revoke U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement access to that system. That still left Nlets as a point of access.

Dozens of Democratic elected officials, including U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden from Oregon, sounded an alarm about immigration enforcement implications of Nlets late last year. Washington officials, in their joint statement, said the state cut off ICE’s access to Nlets on Nov. 19.

But Angelina Snodgrass Godoy, director of the UW center, said she was told in writing last month by a State Patrol spokesperson that ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations division, which investigates criminal activity such as drugs and weapons smuggling, continued to have access to Nlets.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection also has access to the system and conducted eight of the nine queries documented by Godoy’s center. Seven of the nine cases involved civil immigration violations rather than criminal activity, according to the report.

The state is now reviewing CBP’s use of Nlets, according to the officials’ joint statement, which also presented reasons why the agency’s continued access might be important. CBP might, for instance, use Nlets “to find out that the man about to board a plane with a small child is wanted for human trafficking,” the statement said

It added that queries do not reveal the purpose data is sought and therefore objected to suggestions in the UW report that state officials are actively participating in civil immigration enforcement. The statement called parts of a draft report reviewed by state officials “misleading” and “incendiary.”

At a news conference Thursday, Godoy and other immigrant advocates nevertheless presented the state’s role in sharing driver’s license information as a betrayal of public trust and a violation of a 2019 state law that limits most forms of state cooperation with immigration enforcement.

”Washington has long said it is a welcoming state,” said Burien City Councilmember Hugo Garcia, who, like others, pointed out that the state was the first in the country to allow all residents driver’s licenses regardless of immigration status. But faith in the state collapses, he said, “when state systems are used directly or indirectly to aid immigration enforcement.”

Noting he is an immigrant himself and speaking initially in Spanish at the news conference, held the day after an ICE official fatally shot a woman in Minnesota and the same day two people were allegedly shot by federal immigration agents in Portland, Garcia said many immigrants are feeling “fear that something as ordinary as driving to work, taking your kids to schools or picking up groceries, could lead to detention or separation from your family.

He said he met with one Burien man detailed by immigration enforcement agents while taking his kid to school. The child walked home alone afterwards.

Advocates called for a comprehensive way to end information sharing with immigration officials, rather than partial measures, though how to do so isn’t totally clear.

The UW center’s report looked to New York, which it said has cut off Nlets access to both ICE and CBP. (Washington officials’ statement said New York has only partially stopped CBP access.) But in the news conference, some acknowledged that other federal agencies could also access Nlets and share information with immigration agents.

Under President Donald Trump, many federal agencies have been drafted to work on immigration enforcement. Information about Rocha, the Kirkland theater manager, obtained through public disclosure appears to show the Drug Enforcement Administration conducted one Nlets search, along with others conducted by ICE and CBP.

The UW report also suggested a technical configuration that would limit Nlets searches in Washington to data from enhanced driver’s licenses, which are held only by U.S. citizens.

In their joint statement, Washington officials cited historic challenges to limiting Nlets access, including lawsuits and threats to federal funding. Officials did not respond to an email asking whether those challenges still exist.",https://thumb.spokesman.com/l2sMHX5ZvY-IivJJOF8GNS33NSY=/600x0/media.spokesman.com/graphics/2020/08/sr_placeholder.png,N,,2026-01-09 01:57:41.885680

In a post on X, DHS said the passenger in the vehicle was from Venezuela and illegally in the United States and affiliated with the transnational Tren de Aragua prostitution ring. DHS said the person had also been involved in a shooting in Portland.

""When agents identified themselves to the vehicle occupants, the driver weaponized his vehicle and attempted to run over the law enforcement agents. Fearing for his life and safety, an agent fired a defensive shot. The driver drove off with the passenger, fleeing the scene,"" DHS said.

The shooting happened outside the Adventist Health clinic near Southeast Main Street at around 2:20 p.m. The two wounded people drove more than 2.5 miles to Northeast 146th Avenue and East Burnside, where they were found and taken to the hospital.

Portland police said their officers were called to the area of the clinic where said they confirmed federal agents were involved in a shooting. They said they were not involved in the shooting.

The two people who were wounded were taken to the hospital.

Residents in the area told KATU that a red Toyota truck was driven to an apartment complex. A man at the scene said he saw the wounded man stopped in the truck, who then got out and was bleeding.

FBI agents were seen collecting evidence from the scene. At about 6:35 p.m., a tow truck towed the truck away and all law enforcement left the area.

Mayor Calls For An End Of ICE Operations in Portland

The shooting in Portland came a day after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis, rattling city leaders in Portland.

In a statement shortly after the shooting was confirmed, Mayor Keith Wilson called on the Trump administration to end Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in the city until an independent investigation into the shooting could be completed. He restated the demand in a news conference flanked by other city leaders, city councilors, Multnomah County commissioners, the county sheriff, the city police chief, state lawmakers, faith leaders and the governor of the state.

“When the [Trump] administration talks about using full force, we are seeing what it means on our streets. The consequences are not abstract. They are felt in hospital rooms and living rooms, in the quiet moments when families try to make sense of what happened, what is happening,"" Wilson said. ""We know what the federal government said happened here. There was a time when we could take them at their word. That time has long passed.""

Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek echoed the sentiment that the trust between the federal government and local leaders had been broken. She also called for an independent investigation.

“The priority right now is a full, completed investigation, not more detentions,"" Kotek said. ""My message to the federal government is this we demand transparency. We demand your cooperation with Portland police and the Multnomah County DA, because we need to investigate this incident efficiently and effectively so we can rebuild trust with our nation's government.”

During that news conference, a large group of people gathered outside City Hall to protest the shooting.

Portland City Councilor Sameer Kanal expressed frustration and anger. His sentiment echoed Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey’s criticism of ICE when one of its agents killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in that city on Wednesday. Frey told ICE to “get the f***” out of his city.

“You are hearing and you are seeing attempts to justify the unjustifiable, to completely defend the indefensible from our federal government,” Kanal told the people gathered outside Portland City Hall. “It’s unacceptable. We’re going to stand against it. We see through your bullshit.”

He said his thoughts were with those in hospitals and in detention, and he said he stood in solidarity with Good’s family and loved ones, as well as with the Minneapolis community.

Late Thursday night, a large group of people gathered at the ICE facility in South Portland. The facility has been the site of protest against ICE activities since last June.

Portland police and state troopers responded to the facility. Portland police used a public address system to order people to disperse. Several people were taken into custody.

Watch the live video:

The FBI said on social media that it is investigating the shooting but it appeared it later deleted its posted on X. FBI agents were seen at the site of the shooting.

U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, posted on X, urging people to keep any protests of the Trump administration peaceful.

""Trump wants to generate riots. Don't take the bait,"" he wrote.

City Councilors Shaken

Portland city councilors were holding its meeting Thursday night when suddenly they adjourned. A KATU reporter covering the meeting said the councilors rushed to the fourth floor where the mayor’s office is located.

The reporter learned from protesters at the meeting who were there to protest federal actions that a shooting involving federal agents had happened.

KATU immediately began working to confirm the information.

At 3:40 p.m., city councilors reconvened in the council chambers and announced they had learned federal agents had someone.

“I’m sorry to be delivering this news today,” Pirtle-Guiney said upon reconvening the meeting. “We are all holding both Ms. Good’s family and the families of these Portlanders. As we sit here as far as we know, both of these individuals are still alive, and we are hoping for more positive updates.”

This is a breaking news story and will be updated when more information becomes available.

With its access to the case materials, witnesses and evidence revoked, the BCA said it had to “reluctantly” withdraw from the investigation.
The agent was identified independently by the Guardian as Jonathan E Ross, a Minnesota resident and 10-year veteran of federal law enforcement.
“We will never accept that a single federal agent can be judge, jury and executioner in our streets,” the Minnesota representative said.
This story was amended on 8 January 2025 to correct the name of the ICE officer who shot Renee Nicole Good, which is Jonathan E Ross, not Jonathan David Ross.","The FBI has taken full control of the investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) officer in Minneapolis, it emerged on Thursday.

In a statement, the Minnesota bureau of criminal apprehension (BCA) said it was initially called upon to help investigate the shooting before federal officials “reversed course” and said the case would be “solely led by the FBI”. With its access to the case materials, witnesses and evidence revoked, the BCA said it had to “reluctantly” withdraw from the investigation.

Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, homeland security secretary Kristi Noem denied that the BCA had been cut out of the investigation and said it was a matter of jurisdiction. “They have not been cut,” she said. “They don’t have any jurisdiction in this investigation.”

But Minnesota’s governor, Tim Walz, told a news conference that “Minnesota must be part of this investigation. It feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome. And I say that only because people in positions of power have already passed judgment.”

Indeed, the reversal from federal law enforcement comes as the Trump administration continues to justify Wednesday’s deadly shooting by accusing Good of engaging in “an act of domestic terrorism” and claiming that the ICE agent who shot her was acting in “self-defense”, alleging she had tried to run him over.

That narrative is at odds with video footage of the incident, which has been widely shared online. It shows Good reversing her car and letting at least one ICE vehicle pass before an officer tells her to get out of the car; she then tries to turn and drive away. An agent shoots her multiple times, remains on his feet and walks away apparently uninjured as her car crashes into a lamp-post and parked vehicle.

The agent was identified independently by the Guardian as Jonathan E Ross, a Minnesota resident and 10-year veteran of federal law enforcement. Noem continued on Thursday to defend the federal agent – whom she described as “an experienced officer” that was “following his training” – and said he had been treated in hospital after the incident. Both she and the vice-president noted that Ross had been injured in an incident six months ago when an undocumented immigrant resisted arrest in a vehicle.

Vance also defended the shooting, repeatedly claiming, baselessly, that Good was part of a “leftwing network” of people who are trying to “incite violence against our law enforcement officers”.

He told the White House press briefing without evidence that the young mother was “a victim of leftwing ideology” and had been “brainwashed”, and doubled down on the administration’s claim that the officer had acted in self-defense. Good, 37, was “dead because she tried to ram somebody with her car”, Vance said.

The deadly incident, which occurred less than a mile from the spot where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020, escalated tensions that have been building for weeks in Minnesota amid ramped-up federal immigration enforcement operations and fraud investigations by the Trump administration.

Authorities in Minneapolis had canceled school classes across the city on Thursday amid safety concerns and rising political tension after the US citizen and mother of three was killed during a large-scale immigration enforcement operation the day before.

Dozens of clergy members from all faith backgrounds gathered with hundreds of people at the site of the shooting in south Minneapolis at noon to show that the city was unified in its response. “Renee Good stood for her neighbors. We now must stand for her,” said JaNaé Bates, a co-executive director of the interfaith group Isaiah.

The crowd chanted “ICE out now” throughout the event, against visible signs of the tragedy: red paint in the snow read “ICE kills”, and writing on the street called for ICE to leave.

But emotions remained high in the city, and across the US, as the basic facts of the incident remain the subject of fierce debate.

Ilhan Omar posted on social media Thursday morning that thousands of people had gathered to honor Good last night, and that “ICE needs to get out of Minneapolis”.

“We will never accept that a single federal agent can be judge, jury and executioner in our streets,” the Minnesota representative said.

Jacob Frey, the Minneapolis mayor, also made several appearances on television networks on Wednesday night calling for peaceful protests and doubling down on his comments at a press conference earlier in the day in which he called for ICE “to get the fuck out of Minneapolis”.

“People are being hurt. Families are being ripped apart. Long-term Minneapolis residents that have contributed so greatly to our city, to our culture, to our economy are being terrorized, and now, somebody is dead,” Frey said.

He said the homeland security department was already “trying to spin this as an action of self-defense”, a claim he said was “bullshit”.

Some Republicans seized on Frey’s comments as incendiary, with Nancy Mace, a South Carolina representative, calling for the resignations of the mayor and Walz.

Despite local officials’ calls for federal law enforcement to leave the state, the New York Times reported on Thursday that the Trump administration will deploy more than 100 US Customs and Border Protection agents and officers to Minnesota following the fatal shooting of Good.

The agents will be redirected from operations in Chicago and New Orleans. The deployment is expected to last until Sunday, the newspaper reported, citing documents it obtained.

Noem also stated that ICE operations would continue in Minneapolis, which saw a surge of about 2,000 federal agents this week to target immigrant populations.

This story was amended on 8 January 2025 to correct the name of the ICE officer who shot Renee Nicole Good, which is Jonathan E Ross, not Jonathan David Ross. Also, an incorrect reference to Ross being a resident of Minneapolis was removed.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f563985a39c97b511b75a1230b76987d184c637b/338_0_2650_2120/master/2650.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=957c931df3050fb7751c2d8cd0d510fe",N,,2026-01-09 00:11:53.795303

The Senate passed a bipartisan resolution this morning to require congressional authorization for military force against Venezuela. Trump has threatened a ""second wave"" of attacks on the Venezuela and said the U.S. would run the country after the extradition of its president, Nicolás Maduro.

Sen. Tim Kaine’s (D-Virginia) resolution passed a key hurdle on Thursday, advancing in a 52 to 47 vote. It seeks to assert Congress’s power over the military’s aggression against Venezuela, which entered a new stage on Saturday, and bar Trump from further hostilities unless explicitly authorized by Congress.

All Democrats and five Republicans voted for resolution to advance: Senators Susan Collins (Maine), Josh Hawley (Missouri), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Rand Paul (Kentucky), and Todd Young (Indiana).

Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pennsylvania) also voted to advance the legislation, despite previous statements that he was opposed to a war powers resolution on Venezuela and his previous “no” vote on a similar resolution in October.

Republicans who voted to advance the resolution said that they voted “yes” because they oppose further escalations like a ground invasion, even if they do support the illegal abduction of Maduro.

“With regard to Venezuela, my read of the Constitution is that if the President feels the need to put boots on the ground there in the future, Congress would need to vote on it. That’s why I voted yes on this morning’s Senate resolution,” said Hawley in a post on X.

Two previous attempts to pass a war powers resolution on hostilities against Venezuela in the Senate failed.

The advancement allows the resolution to come to a vote next week. It only needs a simple majority to pass. From there, it will go to the House, where its fate is unclear — with a handful of Republicans vocally opposed to the administration’s Venezuela operations.

Even if it clears that hurdle, however, the resolution is almost certain to be vetoed by Trump, who took to Truth Social on Thursday to rail against the Republicans in the Senate who voted for its advancement.

Naming the Republicans, Trump said they “should never be elected to office again,” and complained that lawmakers sought to curb his power.

Still, the vote could show growing dissent within Congress regarding Trump’s ever-expanding operation against Venezuela, which legal experts have said is illegal at every step of escalation taken by the administration. The Trump administration has repeatedly snubbed Congress during the operation, and on Saturday, kept lawmakers in the dark even as Trump kept oil companies informed as the military carried out its attack.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2026/01/2026_01-08-venezuela-war-power.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 04:57:11.447844

Many of the local officials who spoke out compared the incident to the deadly shooting earlier this week in Minneapolis, and condemned the behavior of federal immigration enforcement agencies under the Trump administration. Several others called on the community for calm.

Portland police confirmed that officers responded to the location of Adventist Health Portland near Interstate 205 at 2:18 p.m. for reports of a shooting. Minutes later, police learned that a man who had been shot was calling to request help near Northeast 146th Avenue and East Burnside.

Police responded to both scenes and found a man and a woman with apparent gunshot wounds at the second location. Both patients were taken to a hospital, and police confirmed they were connected to the shooting and that it involved federal agents.

The following list of public statements will be kept updated:

Oregon Governor Tina Kotek

Remarks at Thursday evening news conference:

We are standing here today united as a state, wanting peace and safety in our communities. We are all shaken and outraged by another terrible, unnecessary, violent event instigated by the reckless agenda of the Trump administration — this time in our own state, in our largest city, coming just one day after the tragedy in Minnesota.

While the details of the incident remain limited, one thing is very clear: when a president endorses tearing families apart and attempts to govern through fear and hate rather than shared values, you foster an environment of lawlessness and recklessness. Trust is essential to maintaining community safety and the rule of law. Federal agents, at the direction of the Department of Homeland Security, are shattering trust. They are hurting people and they are destroying, day by day, what we hold dear.

Our sense of safety, and our literal safety, are severely undermined by what happened this afternoon in Portland. I'm so thankful that no one died and more people weren't hurt. The attorney general and other leaders have been clear about our concerns with the excessive use of force by federal agents in Portland, and today's incident only heightens the need for transparency and accountability.

Oregonians deserve clear answers, and I am aligned with the mayor; the priority right now is a full, completed investigation, not more detentions. My message to the federal government is this: we demand transparency, we demand your cooperation with Portland police and the Multnomah County DA, because we need to investigate this incident efficiently and effectively so we can rebuild trust with our nation's government.

There are those who want to cause chaos, but Oregonians know how to stand up and speak out peacefully. We must remain united in peaceful opposition to efforts to tear our community apart. We must not turn against each other. We must stand neighbor to neighbor. We must not take the bait.

And I want to end by saying I'm grateful to the first responders who have been managing this incident today here in Portland, and I stand and we stand united with Americans across our country and with Minneapolis and Minnesota in light of these very troubling events.

Portland Mayor Keith Wilson

Statement via press release:

Just one day after the horrific violence in Minnesota at the hands of federal agents, our community here in Portland is now grappling with another deeply troubling incident. Earlier this afternoon, two people were shot and injured by federal agents in the Hazelwood neighborhood.

We cannot sit by while constitutional protections erode and bloodshed mounts. Portland is not a 'training ground' for militarized agents, and the 'full force' threatened by the administration has deadly consequences. As Mayor, I call on ICE to end all operations in Portland until a full investigation can be completed.

Federal militarization undermines effective, community‑based public safety, and it runs counter to the values that define our region. I will use every legal and legislative tool available to protect our residents' civil and human rights.

I call on every Portlander to represent our values and to show up with calm and purpose during this difficult time. Portland does not respond to violence with violence. We respond with clarity, unity, and a commitment to justice. We must stand together to protect Portland.

The City of Portland will continue to provide updates as they become available. We are grateful to our first responders for their support of the victims.

Portland Metro Councilors

Joint statement via news release:

Twice in two days, in two cities that stand in staunch opposition to the Trump administration’s agenda, federal agents have used deadly force against members of the public.

These federal agents are not making us safer. They are creating a climate of fear. And where that climate of fear has existed for immigrant communities since these increased enforcement actions started a year ago, it is now hitting home for all of us.

We all – as Oregonians, as patriotic Americans – must oppose this violence. We cannot allow this to become normalized and must peacefully condemn this violence at every opportunity.

We also must continue to stand together, united peacefully for change. Violent actions, including damaging property, do nothing to address the real issue here, but violent actions do cause harm and fear to our fellow Oregonians. There are some who are seeking to provoke chaos – we cannot take their bait.

Instead, we must focus on justice – a just society that protects the rights and freedom of all. The investigation of today’s incident, in pursuit of trust and justice, must include local law enforcement officials.

The Metro Council has worked, and will continue to work, to support those affected by the Trump administration’s ongoing violence against our neighbors. Those who lost a loved one in Minnesota are in our thoughts, and those who are worried about their loved ones shot by federal agents here are in our thoughts. We send our thanks to those who responded to the victims and to everyone who will demonstrate our values peacefully in the hours and days to come.

Metro Council President Lynn Peterson

Councilor Ashton Simpson

Councilor Christine Lewis

Councilor Gerritt Rosenthal

Councilor Juan Carlos González

Deputy Council President Duncan Hwang

Oregon Senate Majority Leader Kayse Jama, Reps. Andrea Valderrama and Lamar Wise

Joint statement via news release:

Let’s be clear: the violence carried out today by federal agents in Portland is a predictable escalation of the lawlessness and recklessness we have seen from the Trump administration. Federal agents opened fire in the Hazelwood neighborhood. That is not public safety; it is a dangerous and unacceptable use of force by a federal agency operating without accountability.

We stand in solidarity with all Portlanders seeking justice. Our communities are not collateral damage. Residents should not have to fear armed federal agents escalating violence in their neighborhoods. This incident reflects a broader pattern: an administration that prioritizes intimidation over constitutional rights, violence over public safety, and suffering over human dignity.

This was an abuse of power, plain and simple. We stand with the Mayor of Portland and demand that federal agents immediately cease terrorizing neighborhoods in our city and that these actions are fully investigated. Portland does not consent to federal agents bringing violence into our neighborhoods.”

Portland City Councilors Candace Avalos, Jamie Dunphy and Loretta Smith

Joint statement via news release:

Today ICE shot two of our East Portland neighbors – just one day after an ICE agent shot and killed a Minneapolis mother. We are still waiting for more information at this time, but this is part of a pattern of violence that we have seen too many times across our country.

ICE in our communities does not make us safe. It should be crystal clear to everyone that the real threat to community safety is the ICE agents harassing, targeting, detaining — and in some tragic cases — killing our neighbors. This violence is unacceptable, it is criminal, and it is against the constitution of the United States.

This federal government is going to spin the story like they do every time one of their agents hurts a community member. We saw that when they tried to send in the National Guard. It's on all of us to keep speaking the truth, to keep on bearing witness, because our community's voices outweigh their lies every time. It's up to each and every one of us to keep us safe.

As your East Portland councilors, we have stood united to protect Portlanders from aggressive immigration enforcement and federal overreach and we will continue to do everything in our power to keep our communities safe. We are asking our counterparts at every level of government to do the same.

We thank our first responders for their swift response. We're holding the two victims and their families in our hearts at this time and our offices will provide more information when it is available.

ICE must be abolished. The work of our time is to tear down the system that built it and remake it into one that embraces and designs systems that include all people from all places. This work will be done, because the alternative is unbearable.

Portland Police Chief Bob Day

Statement via news release:

We are still in the early stages of this incident. We understand the heightened emotion and tension many are feeling in the wake of the shooting in Minneapolis, but I am asking the community to remain calm as we work to learn more.

Multnomah County Board of Commissioners

Joint statement from Chair Jessica Vega Pederson and Commissioners Meghan Moyer, Shannon Singleton, Julia Brim-Edwards and Vince Jones-Dixon via news release:

This afternoon, federal Customs and Border Protection agents shot two people in East Portland. We are in close coordination with our government partners and law enforcement to learn everything we can, and encourage patience in sharing information to ensure accuracy. We are holding the families and communities of those impacted in our thoughts.

What we can say now is enough is enough. The terror and violence ICE is causing in our neighborhoods must end now. The County will not stand by as the federal government attacks our neighbors. We stand united in our support for our immigrant and refugee neighbors. Just this morning, we unanimously voted to extend an emergency declaration in response to the ongoing harm caused by ICE activity, and we will keep showing up every way we can.

We know County residents are angry. We are angry. Portlanders have a proud tradition of opposing injustice through nonviolent protest, and we encourage our community to keep showing up as they have been to oppose this horrific violence. We must stand together.

Multnomah County District Attorney Nathan Vazquez

Remarks during media huddle at the shooting scene:

We are here from the District Attorney's office to monitor and to assist and to make sure that there's a thorough and complete investigation, that evidence is fully preserved, and that we're certainly hoping that we can get all of the facts about what transpired here today. And we will work to update the public as we go forward and get more information.

Right now, I don't have a lot to say about [who is leading the investigation] as this investigation is starting to unfold, and certainly the different agencies involved are coming together. But we are working closely with Portland police and the FBI, certainly, is here, and we're making sure that they have all the resources that they need, and of course our priority and main concern is that there's a thorough and complete investigation and that all facts that can be learn are obtained, and that we can get as much information as possible.

I think the message to the community is that local officials are very carefully monitoring this, and we're making sure that the interests of the this community are well-represented and that this investigation is done in a thorough and complete manner.

Multnomah County Sheriff Nicole Morrisey O'Donnell

Statement via news release:

The use of deadly force by law enforcement weighs heavily on all of us who serve.

I am monitoring the situation that occurred this afternoon in Southeast Portland. The Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office was not involved in the shooting, nor were we on scene when it happened.

My thoughts are with those who were injured during this shooting, their families, and anyone who witnessed it.

Moments like this can create even greater fear and I recognize the weight of emotion our country and now our community is carrying right now.

This investigation is being conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office is here to keep people safe. This is a tense and emotional moment, but our commitment remains the same. MCSO deputies will continue to respond with professionalism and care for everyone in our community.

As Sheriff, I support the community’s right to peacefully and lawfully assemble. If people choose to gather, we ask that it be done lawfully and safely. As a community, we must commit to responses that heal rather than destroy. MCSO stands ready to support the Portland Police Bureau (PPB) to advance public safety.

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield

Statement via news release:

We are deeply troubled by reports that two people were shot and injured in Portland today during an incident involving federal agents. We have been clear about our concerns with the excessive use of force by federal agents in Portland, and today’s incident only heightens the need for transparency and accountability. Oregonians deserve clear answers when people are injured in their neighborhoods.

Our office is closely monitoring this situation and will take appropriate action to protect the rights and safety of Oregonians as more facts come to light. We also encourage community members to review the Oregon DOJ Immigration Services & Support Resources toolkit to understand their rights and available resources during federal enforcement activity.

I'm monitoring the first awful reports of two people shot in Portland by federal law enforcement. I'll keep you updated, but Trump's deployment of federal agents in my hometown is clearly inflaming violence -- and must end.

U.S. Rep. Maxine Dexter (OR-03)

Statement via news release:

Just one day after the horrific murder in Minneapolis, I received reports that two people in my district were shot by federal immigration officials this afternoon in East Portland. Both individuals are alive, but we do not know the extent of their injuries.

ICE has done nothing but inject terror, chaos, and cruelty into our communities. Trump’s immigration machine is using violence to control our communities—straight out of the authoritarian playbook. ICE must immediately end all active operations in Portland.

I will share more updates as they become available. I am demanding full accountability and transparency. I encourage our community to stay calm and show courage in this moment. We must allow our local law enforcement to do its work. There must be a comprehensive investigation without Trump’s interference.

This isn’t law enforcement, it’s state-sponsored terrorism. Stop f—ing with us. This is the second shooting this week by agents following the orders of a wannabe dictator who is trying to take over cities and rule by instilling terror in the hearts of American people. When the President deployed his guardsmen to our city earlier this year, we told him their presence was unwelcome and unhelpful. Today, we saw just how dangerous this is – we need these goons gone. Get to steppin’.

Yet, as in Minneapolis, controversial law enforcement killings continue to occur.","Minneapolis is once again the focus of debates about violence involving law enforcement after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother, in her car.

The incident quickly prompted dueling narratives. Trump administration officials defended the shooting as justified, while local officials condemned it.

The shooting will also likely prompt renewed scrutiny of training and policy of officers and the question of them shooting at moving vehicles. There has been a recent trend in law enforcement toward policies that prohibit such shootings. It is a policy shift that has shown promise in saving lives.

Decades ago, the New York City Police Department prohibited its officers from shooting at moving vehicles. That led to a drop in police killings without putting officers in greater danger.

Debates over deadly force are often contentious, but as I note in my research on police ethics and policy, for the most part there is consensus on one point: Policing should reflect a commitment to valuing human life and prioritizing its protection. Many use-of-force policies adopted by police departments endorse that principle.

Yet, as in Minneapolis, controversial law enforcement killings continue to occur. Not all agencies have implemented prohibitions on shooting at vehicles. Even in agencies that have, some policies are weak or ambiguous.

In addition, explicit prohibitions on shooting at vehicles are largely absent from the law, which means that officers responsible for fatal shootings of drivers that appear to violate departmental policies still often escape criminal penalties.

In the case of ICE, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, its policy on shooting at moving vehicles – unlike that of many police agencies – lacks a clear instruction for officers to get out of the way of moving vehicles where feasible. It’s an omission at odds with generally recognized best practices in policing.

ICE’s policy on shooting at moving vehicles

ICE’s current use-of-force policy prohibits its officers from “discharging firearms at the operator of a moving vehicle” unless it is necessary to stop a grave threat. The policy is explicit that deadly force should not be used “solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing suspect.”

That point is relevant for evaluating the fatal shooting in Minneapolis. Videos show one officer trying to open the door of the vehicle that Good was driving, while another officer appears to be in front of the vehicle as she tried to pull away.

Shooting to prevent the driver simply from getting away would have been in violation of agency policy and obviously inconsistent with prioritizing the protection of life.

ICE’s policy lacks clear instruction, however, for its officers to get out of the way of moving vehicles where feasible. In contrast, the Department of Justice’s use-of-force policy makes it explicit that officers should not shoot at a vehicle if they can protect themselves by “moving out of the path of the vehicle.”

Notably, President Joe Biden issued an executive order in 2022 requiring federal law enforcement agencies – like ICE – to adopt use-of-force policies “that are equivalent to, or exceed, the requirements” of the Department of Justice’s policy.

Despite that order, the provision to step out of the way of moving cars never made it into the use-of-force policy that applies to ICE.

The rationale for not shooting at moving vehicles

Prioritizing the protection of life doesn’t rule out deadly force. Sometimes such force is necessary to protect lives from a grave threat, such as an active shooter. But it does rule out using deadly force when less harmful tactics can stop a threat. In such cases, deadly force is unnecessary – a key consideration in law and ethics that can render force unjustified.

That’s the concern involved with police shooting at moving vehicles. It often is not necessary because officers have a less harmful option to avoid a moving vehicle’s threat: stepping out of the way.

This guidance has the safety of both suspects and police in mind. Obviously, police not shooting lowers the risk of harm to the suspect. But it also lowers the risk to the officer in the vast majority of cases because of the laws of physics. If you shoot the driver of a car barreling toward you, that rarely brings a car to an immediate stop, and the vehicle often continues on its path.

Many police departments have incorporated these insights into their policies. A recent analysis of police department policies in the 100 largest U.S. cities found that close to three-quarters of them have prohibitions against shooting at moving vehicles.

The gap between policy and best practices for protecting life

The shooting in Minneapolis serves as a stark reminder of the stubborn gap that often persists between law and policy on the one hand and best law enforcement practices for protecting life on the other. When steps are taken to close that gap, however, they can have a meaningful impact.

Some of the most compelling examples involve local, state and federal measures that reinforce one another. Consider the “fleeing felon rule,” which used to allow police to shoot a fleeing felony suspect to prevent their escape even when the suspect posed no danger to others.

That rule was at odds with the doctrine of prioritizing the protection of life, leading some departments to revise their use-of-force policies and some states to ban the rule. In 1985, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional for police to shoot a fleeing suspect who was not a danger.

Banning that questionable tactic notably led to a reduction in killings by police.

This history suggests that clear bans in law and policy on questionable tactics have the potential to save lives, while also strengthening the means for holding officers accountable.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/711506/original/file-20260108-56-abr8f9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C42%2C3500%2C1750&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-09 01:12:30.980482

(AP) — Federal immigration officers shot and wounded two people in a vehicle outside a hospital in Portland, Oregon, on Thursday, a day after an officer shot and killed a driver in Minnesota, authorities said.

The Department of Homeland Security described the vehicle’s passenger as “a Venezuelan illegal alien affiliated with the transnational Tren de Aragua prostitution ring” who had been involved in a recent shooting in Portland. When agents identified themselves to the occupants during a “targeted vehicle stop” Thursday afternoon, the driver tried to run them over, the department said in a written statement.

“Fearing for his life and safety, an agent fired a defensive shot,” the statement said. “The driver drove off with the passenger, fleeing the scene.”

There was no immediate independent corroboration of that account or of any gang affiliation of the vehicle’s occupants. During prior shootings involving agents involved in President Donald Trump’s surge of immigration enforcement in U.S. cities, including Wednesday’s shooting by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis, video evidence cast doubt on the administration’s descriptions of what prompted the shootings.

Trump and his allies have consistently blamed Tren de Aragua for being at the root of the violence and illicit drug dealing that plague some U.S. cities.

The shooting escalates tensions in an city that has long had a contentious relationship with President Donald Trump, including Trump’s recent, failed effort to deploy National Guard troops in the city. Trump’s decision to send militarized personnel into U.S. cities to conduct immigration enforcement drew long-running nightly protests outside the ICE building in Portland.

According to the Portland Police bureau, officers initially responded to a report of a shooting outside Adventist Health hospital at about 2:18 p.m. Thursday.

A few minutes later, police received information that a man who had been shot was asking for help in a residential area a couple of miles away. Officers then responded there and found a man and a woman with gunshot wounds. Officers determined they were injured in the shooting with federal agents, police said.

Their conditions were not immediately known. Portland police said officers applied a tourniquet to one of the wounded. Council President Elana Pirtle-Guiney said during a Portland city council meeting that “as far as we know both of these individuals are still alive and we are hoping for more positive updates throughout the afternoon.”

At a news conference Thursday night, Portland Police Chief Bob Day said the FBI was leading the investigation and that he had no details about the events that led to the shooting.

Portland Mayor Keith Wilson and the city council called on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to end all operations in Oregon’s largest city until a full investigation is completed.

“We stand united as elected officials in saying that we cannot sit by while constitutional protections erode and bloodshed mounts,” a joint statement said. “Portland is not a ‘training ground’ for militarized agents, and the ‘full force’ threatened by the administration has deadly consequences.”

Wilson also suggested at a news conference that he didn’t necessarily believe the federal government’s account of the shooting: “There was a time we could take them at their word. That time is long past.”

Democratic State Sen. Kayse Jama, who lives near the shooting scene, said Oregon is a welcoming state — but he told federal agents to leave.

“You are not welcome,” Jama said. ”You need to get the hell out of Oregon.”

The city officials said “federal militarization undermines effective, community‑based public safety, and it runs counter to the values that define our region. We’ll use every legal and legislative tool available to protect our residents’ civil and human rights.”

They urged residents to show up with “calm and purpose during this difficult time.”

“We respond with clarity, unity, and a commitment to justice,” the statement said. “We must stand together to protect Portland.”

U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, urged any protesters to remain peaceful.

The nonprofit tracks the flights through its ICE Flight Monitor using publicly available aviation data, according to its website.
That leaves only a handful of resources available to track ICE flights.
The deportation flights are organized by two aeronautical service companies that have contracts with Harry Reid, Bertaki said.
Avelo ranked third last year for its number of deportation flights, operating more than 1,700 of the flights through November 2025.","Avelo Airlines will end its contract with the airline broker hired by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and stop its deportation flights by Jan. 27, spokesperson Courtney Goff told The Nevada Independent Tuesday.

The budget, Houston-based airline operated the majority of the 124 ICE-chartered flights that stopped at Las Vegas’ Harry Reid International Airport in 2025, according to new data shared exclusively with The Indy by the immigrant- and refugee-focused nonprofit Human Rights First. That’s more than double the 60 ICE-chartered flights that passed through Las Vegas in 2024.

Of last year’s flights, 74, or nearly 3 of 5, were operated by Avelo, which ceased commercial operations in Las Vegas in August.

Goff said Avelo’s contract “provided short-term benefits but ultimately did not deliver enough consistent and predictable revenue to overcome its operational complexity and costs.”

It is unclear why deportation flights stop in Nevada and if the planes pick up detainees held in detention centers in the state. ICE discloses little information about the flights’ passengers or paths, multiple immigration experts told The Indy.

ICE representatives did not respond to requests for comment from The Indy.

Federal immigration authorities use the flights to transfer detainees between detention centers and major deportation facilities and to deport detainees.

Some detainees are placed on multiple domestic flights before being sent to deportation facilities in a process Human Rights First refers to as the domestic “shuffle.”

The Obama and Biden administrations also shuffled detainees around the country, but the pace of such flights has increased dramatically under the Trump administration. The ICE Flight Monitor counted more than 7,300 domestic shuffle flights between Jan. 20 and Nov. 30, 2025, a 114 percent increase compared with the number of shuffle flights during the same period in 2024.

The Los Angeles Times reported in September 2025 that detainees were being transferred at much higher rates under the second Trump administration than under Biden, with twice as many detainees being transferred at least four times compared with in 2024.

How deportation flights work

Deportation flights are notoriously difficult to track and the process has grown even more opaque under the second Trump administration, said Savi Arvey, director of research and analysis at Human Rights First.

The nonprofit tracks the flights through its ICE Flight Monitor using publicly available aviation data, according to its website.

Arvey told The Indy that while the Biden administration also kept data on deportation flights secret, it was generally more forthcoming when detainees were removed to foreign countries.

ICE contracts its air operations through the company CSI Aviation, which in turn subcontracts operations to 10 airline carriers. Although federal immigration agents are usually onboard, flights are primarily staffed by the airlines’ civilian crews.

At least some of the airlines with deportation contracts, including Avelo, have removed their logos from aircraft used to transport detainees, leaving only tail numbers as identification. The airlines have also utilized a federal aviation law that allows them to block certain planes from appearing on flight tracking websites.

That leaves only a handful of resources available to track ICE flights. Human Rights First’s flight monitor relies on a “very complex process that took us a long time to learn,” said Arvey.

Beyond the lack of public transparency over flight patterns, immigration experts told The Indy that detainees often have no idea where they are going and whether they are being sent to another domestic facility or being permanently deported.

“This can make people terrified,” said Michael Kagan, a UNLV professor who directs the university’s immigration law clinic. “ICE moves people with no warning. Lawyers aren’t told. Family isn’t told. … They’ll even sometimes reverse the move and bring people back to the first detention center with no explanation.”

Kagan also said ICE fails to regularly update its detainee locator.

Relocations make it harder for detainees to secure adequate legal representation, Kagan said. Sometimes detainees are transferred out of state before lawyers can complete their intake requirements, he said, and some states have residency requirements for legal filings that make it impossible for detainees to secure consistent representation.

“It’s definitely not what you would do if you wanted fair procedures and to make sure the law is applied correctly,” he said.

Lucas Guttentag, a professor at Stanford Law School who tracks federal immigration policy, told The Indy he believes the increase in domestic transfers is part of “the public spectacle and private terror of the Trump administration’s actions.”

The purpose of domestic shuffles, he argued, “is to frighten people about enforcement actions.”

Last year, both ProPublica and The American Prospect reported on allegations by multiple flight attendants of inadequate security and safety measures on ICE-chartered flights, including federal agents forcing detainees to remain handcuffed while in the air and failing to check detainees’ luggage before takeoff.

Airports also have little information about or control over deportation flights.

Harry Reid International Airport spokesperson Monika Bertaki told The Indy that they do not receive advance notice of ICE-chartered flights and do not receive information on passengers onboard. “Armed federal agents that are on airport property” do trigger additional security measures, she said.

The deportation flights are organized by two aeronautical service companies that have contracts with Harry Reid, Bertaki said. Neither of those companies responded to The Indy’s requests for comment.

Of ICE’s partner airlines, Avelo is sole commercial operation

In May 2025, Avelo announced it had agreed to operate deportation flights, becoming the first — and so far only — commercial airline to do so. The other airlines that signed contracts with ICE’s flight broker are charter airlines.

Avelo ranked third last year for its number of deportation flights, operating more than 1,700 of the flights through November 2025. Avelo-owned planes made their first immigration-related stops in Las Vegas in May 2025.

For a number of months last year, it was the only ICE-contracted airline that made stops in Las Vegas.

The Avelo-ICE partnership was criticized by Democrats nationwide, some of whom introduced legislation aiming to cut Avelo’s public funding. Critics also organized protests in or near airports to lobby against the Avelo contract and signed online pledges to boycott the company.

But Goff, the Avelo spokesperson, denied such actions were part of Avelo’s decision.

“We did not see an impact in regard to customers choosing to fly,” Goff wrote. “It was a commercial decision.”

The Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits federal agencies from spending beyond their allotted funding and simultaneously restricts federal employees from working on a volunteer basis. The Act provides, in relevant part:

An officer or employee of the United States Government or of the District of Columbia government may not accept voluntary services for either government or employ personal services exceeding that authorized by law except for emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.

31 U.S.C. § 1342 (emphasis added).

During lapses in federal funding, voluntary services are only authorized in very limited circumstances, but the parameters of the “safety of human life” or “protection of property” exceptions have not been uniformly defined nor applied across the courts.

The U.S. Department of Justice’s 2026 Contingency Plan anticipated civil litigation would be curtailed or delayed, absent cases that would substantially affect the protection of human life or property interests. Indeed, the Contingency Plan instructed federal civil litigators to “approach the courts and request that active cases, except for those in which a delay would compromise to a significant degree the safety of human life or the protection of property, be postponed until funding is available.” Nevertheless, the Contingency Plan also seemingly deferred to federal courts whether to stay proceedings, providing:

If a court denies such a request and orders a case to continue, the Government will comply with the court’s order, which would constitute express legal authorization for the activity to continue. The Department will limit its civil litigation staffing to the minimum level needed to comply with the court’s order and to protect life and property. Receipt of summonses, pleadings and motions by mail may be delayed.

A natural tension arises between the Anti-Deficiency Act, which aims to postpone cases, and Article III of the United States Constitution, which vests federal courts with the power to decide cases and controversies within its jurisdiction. See U.S. Const. Art. III, § 2, cl. 1. As the cases discussed below illustrate, courts over time have endeavored to strike a balance between complying with the federal law and their constitutional authority during federal shutdowns.

In 2013, the D.C. Circuit court in United States, et al. v. US Airways Group, Inc. et al., contemplated whether a stay of proceedings due to a lapse in appropriations was warranted in a time-sensitive civil proceeding. 979 F.Supp.2d 33 (D.C. Cir. 2013). There, the federal government initiated the suit and sought injunctive relief to block a merger between two airline corporations. Although the government argued that the Anti-Deficiency Act only allowed employees to work in limited emergency circumstances, the court noted the time-sensitive nature of the matter, the substantial amount of money at issue, and the impact of a stay on swift resolution of the matter. Accordingly, the court denied the government’s motion to stay and allowed the matter to proceed during the federal shutdown.

During the 2019 federal shutdown, the D.C. Circuit also denied a request to stay oral argument in a civil proceeding. See Kornitzky Grp., LLC v. Elwell, 912 F.3d 637 (D.C. Cir. 2019). The concurring judges noted that the DOJ’s FY 2019 Contingency Plan, similar to the 2026 Contingency Plan, provided that if a court denies a stay, “the Government will comply with the court’s order, which would constitute express legal authorization for the activity to continue.” Specifically, the concurrence observed that the federal courts uniformly denied the government’s request to stay oral arguments during the 2013 federal shutdown and the government attorneys still appeared for oral argument.

Most recently, during the 2025 federal shutdown, a federal court denied the Department of Labor’s motion to stay proceedings and suggested that the DOL carried a burden to show “good grounds for either a stay or an extension of the deadlines previously established,” which was not met. Lehman v. Dep’t of Labor, 2025 WL 2808472, *2 (E.D. Mich. Oct. 2, 2025). While the court acknowledged the limitations set forth in the Anti-Deficiency Act, it recognized a circuit split on how strictly courts adhere to the general rule that government attorneys are not authorized to work during federal shutdowns—even on a volunteer basis—absent exceptional circumstances. Whereas the Sixth Circuit has traditionally taken a more literal interpretation of the Anti-Deficiency Act—finding government attorneys may exclusively work on “emergency” matters during a federal shutdown—the D.C. Circuit has taken a “less sanguine view” and has denied stays on the grounds that government attorneys must comply with federal court litigation timelines. Id. at *1 (comparing United States v. Trevino, 7 F.4th 424, 421 n.6 (6th Cir. 2021) (“The prosecution cannot continue without expenditures[,] [and] The Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits any government official from carrying out the prosecution on an unpaid, volunteer basis.”) with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals v. USDA, 912 F.3d 641 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (declining to stay scheduling deadlines during the 2019 federal shutdown)).

The Lehman court further explained that the Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct apply to federal government attorneys who appear before the state’s courts and provide that “[w]hen ordered to do so by a tribunal, a lawyer shall continue representation notwithstanding good cause for terminating the representation.” Id. at *2 (quoting Mich. Rule of Prof. Conduct 1.16(c)). While non-attorney government staff are not bound by the ethical rules, the court noted the DOL publicly announced that it has staff available to meet court-imposed deadlines. Unlike in US Airways Group and Kornitzky, which focused on the type of litigation and the stage of the proceedings to warrant postponement, here, the court appeared to focus on the government’s failure to show “good grounds” for a stay or deadline extension.

The Lehman approach was subsequently followed in New Jersey v. U.S. Office of Management & Budget, 2025 WL 3089495 (D. Ma. Nov. 5, 2025), wherein the court echoed that federal courts retain the power to stay litigation and the Anti-Deficiency Act “does not require that non-emergency litigation cease.” There, the substantive issue was whether the federal government defendants could properly terminate funding for a federal grant that was formerly awarded to plaintiffs. After the federal shutdown took effect, defendants requested a stay to file a reply brief while plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment was pending. The court rejected defendants’ request, weighing the parties’ competing interests and finding a stay “could allow [d]efendants to continue to terminate funding but close off [p]laintiffs’ opportunity to resolve this matter pursuant to the parties’ agreed-upon schedule.” Stated differently, the court acknowledged that a stay could lead to a procedural advantage for the federal defendants by effectively preserving a status quo that is under scrutiny.

Conversely, in Dash Markets, Inc. v. United States, 2025 WL 3502097 (W.D. N.Y. Oct. 21, 2025) the court deviated from Lehman and New Jersey v. U.S. Office of Management & Budget by deferring to the Anti-Deficiency Act. There, the plaintiff sued the United States, seeking remission of $3 million in Employee Retention Credits and the government requested a stay due to the 2025 federal shutdown. While the court recognized that stays are “subject to the sound discretion of the court,” the court stated that it was “disinclined to subject [d]efendant’s counsel to the risk of violating the [Anti-Deficiency] Act” and does not find plaintiff’s “alleged financial plight to constitute a potential emergency exception to the Act.” Id. Accordingly, the government’s requested stay was granted. Id.

As illustrated by the courts’ differing approaches to the Anti-Deficiency Act, federal shutdowns create significant uncertainty for clients involved in civil litigation with federal agencies or personnel. While the current shutdown has ended, this moment demonstrates the need for practitioners and clients alike to remain vigilant in anticipating delays for future lapses in federal appropriations.

According to the the Portland Police bureau, officers initially responded to a report of a shooting near a hospital at about 2:18 p.m.

A few minutes later, police received information that a man who had been shot was asking for help in a residential area a couple of miles away. Officers then responded there and found the two people with apparent gunshot wounds. Officers determined they were injured in the shooting with federal agents, police said.

Their conditions were not immediately known. Council President Elana Pirtle-Guiney said during a Portland city council meeting that Thursday's shooting took place in the eastern part of the city and that two Portlanders were wounded.

Morning Reads

Trump talks up his tariffs with Supreme Court decision looming (Cory Smith, The National News Desk) — President Donald Trump continued to talk up his tariffs on Tuesday after news broke that the Supreme Court may release opinions on Friday. “We’re getting rich because of tariffs, by the way,” the president said at a retreat with House Republicans, according to The National News Desk. “I hope everyone understands that. … We’ll have over $650 billion poured into our country, or coming in shortly, because of tariffs.”

DeSantis calls for special session on Florida 2026 redistricting (Jim Rosica and James Call, USA Today) — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is calling for a special session of the Florida Legislature to be held in April as the state plans a redistricting push ahead of the 2026 elections that would make it “the latest in a series of GOP-led states heeding a push from President Donald Trump to try to create a more favorable electoral climate for his party,” according to USA Today. “DeSantis … said the state needs to wait for a pending U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the Voting Rights Act before moving forward with new maps.” It can’t wait too long, however, unless lawmakers vote “to delay the candidate qualifying period for congressional races, currently scheduled for late April.”

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette says it will close down, citing losses and labor rules (Laura Wagner and Scott Nover, The Washington Post)(Paywall) — After 240 years and a lengthy labor battle, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette is shutting down. “The newspaper will print its final edition May 3, according to a statement it issued Wednesday hours after the U.S. Supreme Court denied its request to stay a federal appeals court’s November order that the newspaper adhere to the terms of an earlier labor agreement with its union,” according to The Washington Post. “Recent court decisions would require the Post-Gazette to operate under a 2014 labor contract that imposes on the Post-Gazette outdated and inflexible operational practices unsuited for today’s local journalism,” the newspaper’s owner, Block Communications, wrote in the statement.

Seventh Circuit shuts down Satanic Temple challenge to Indiana abortion law (Caitlyn Rosen, Courthouse News Service) — The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit from the Satanic Temple, “a nonreligious group that advocates for benevolence and empathy,” that aimed to force changes to Indiana’s 10-week abortion ban, which was enacted “in 2022, shortly after … Roe v. Wade was overturned,” according to Courthouse News Service. The Satanic Temple had contended that Indiana’s abortion law “unfairly blocks the organization from providing telemedicine abortion care” and subjects its members to “a stigmatic injury” because they are “perceived as evil” due to their support for abortion. The 7th Circuit panel held that these injuries were not concrete enough to give the Satanic Temple “standing to sue the state.”

NFL, three teams appeal to Supreme Court in coach Brian Flores’s discrimination suit (Zach Schonfeld, The Hill) — The NFL and three NFL teams have asked the Supreme Court to weigh in on a lawsuit filed by coach Brian Flores, now the defensive coordinator for the Minnesota Vikings, who contends that he participated in “sham” interviews for head coach openings in the past and that the league and teams are engaged in racial discrimination, according to The Hill. “In a petition docketed Tuesday, the NFL and the teams — the Denver Broncos, Houston Texans and New York Giants — urged the justices to reverse a ruling that would allow the case to proceed before a jury. The league says it should proceed in arbitration.”

U.S. Appeals Court Won’t Take Up Case to Resurrect 9/11 Plea Deal (Carol Rosenberg, The New York Times)(Paywall) — The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit announced on Tuesday that it will not rehear a dispute over a plea deal reached between a senior Pentagon official and three people accused of plotting the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, including the alleged mastermind of the plot, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. “Under the agreement, each would admit to his role in the plot in exchange for life sentences and avert a death-penalty trial,” according to The New York Times. Days after the deal was finalized, then-U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III “declared it void,” which led to the current battle over whether Austin’s decision came too late. “Two military courts ruled that Mr. Austin had acted too late and that the contract was still valid. Then, in July, a three-judge panel of the appeals court sided with Mr. Austin, 2 to 1, and again nullified the deal.” The full D.C. Circuit has now declined to revisit the panel’s decision, “leaving the Supreme Court as the last place to potentially consider the question.”

A Closer Look: Monsanto Company v. Durnell

Moving forward, we plan to explore at least one petition per week, with a focus on particularly notable, unique, or interesting disputes.

At their private conference on Friday, the justices will consider taking up Monsanto Company v. Durnell, a case on Roundup weedkiller and policies governing product safety labels. Monsanto, which developed the pesticide, has asked the court to determine whether it can be held liable under state laws for not including a cancer warning on Roundup containers when such a warning was not required by – and indeed, according to the company, conflicted with – federal law. (Monsanto has also filed petitions for review in two other, very similar cases, but it has encouraged the court to grant cert in Durnell.)

The dispute is part of a “tidal wave” of lawsuits aimed at holding Monsanto liable for causing cancer. The first such cases were filed more than a decade ago, soon after the International Agency for Research on Cancer, part of the World Health Organization, described glyphosate, a key Roundup ingredient, as “probably carcinogenic to humans.” Since then, the company has paid billions in damages and in settlement agreements and been acquired by Bayer, which maintains that Roundup does not cause cancer.

In its Supreme Court petitions, Monsanto urges the justices to resolve a disagreement between the federal courts of appeals that has emerged as thousands of Roundup-related cases have worked their way through the legal system. The petition asks whether Monsanto can be held liable for violating state-level labeling requirements when it believed – and, at one point, was actually told by the EPA – that it could not satisfy these requirements without violating federal labeling rules. Specifically, according to the Durnell petition, the EPA said in 2019 that changing the labels to reflect the International Agency for Research on Cancer’s claims about glyphosate would “render a pesticide ‘misbranded.’”

For his part, Durnell – who was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma following his exposure to Roundup and won a jury award of $1.25 million in his failure-to-warn case against Monsanto – claims that the company was not prevented by federal law “from warning consumers that Roundup may be carcinogenic or that they should wear protective gear when spraying it.”

In a friend-of-the-court brief filed at the invitation of the court, U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer agreed with Monsanto’s position, arguing that “EPA’s approval of Roundup labels without a cancer warning, combined with an EPA regulation that prohibits petitioner from adding such a warning without agency approval, preempts [Durnell’s] failure-to-warn claim.” Sauer acknowledged that the federal government took the opposite position when it weighed in on a similar petition for review in 2022, which the court later denied. Since that 2022 brief was filed, Sauer noted, a new administration has entered the White House.

Monsanto contends that “tens of thousands of claims” over Roundup “remain pending in courts across the country,” which raises the stakes of the pending petitions. We could hear as soon as Friday afternoon if the justices vote to take up the case.

Good's death follows several fatal encounters involving federal immigration agents in recent months.","Hundreds gathered on the steps of the Georgia State Capitol on Thursday night, demanding accountability in the killing of Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis.

Protesters in Atlanta described the moment as a tipping point — not only for immigration enforcement practices, but for long-standing concerns about excessive use of force in everyday community spaces.

Good, a mother, poet, and active neighbor in her south Minneapolis community, was killed during a federal immigration operation. Officials say Johnathan Ross, the ICE officer who shot Good, fired in self-defense, claiming Good attempted to use her vehicle as a weapon.

But eyewitnesses and circulating video paint a conflicting picture, intensifying national scrutiny of ICE's tactics and raising comparisons to the 2020 killing of George Floyd, which occurred less than a mile from where Good was shot.

At Thursday's Atlanta demonstration, organizers emphasized that Good was not the subject of any arrest warrant. She was simply driving through her neighborhood when the confrontation happened.

Local voices echo national outrage

Organizers filled the Capitol steps with posters, chants, and calls for both a federal investigation and a suspension of ICE operations pending an independent review.

One Atlanta protester told CBS News Atlanta, ""Working-class people are seeing the need to mobilize. Both yesterday and today a strong crowd showed up to say that we need ICE out of our communities. We demand an end to the mass deportation machine.""

They went on to say, ""What we see is that all of these situations of violence from ICE exemplify the reason why we don't need ICE in our communities. Their brutality, the militarization of our neighbors, of our immigrant brothers and sisters... We need money for education and jobs and housing, not for these racist deportations.""

Civil rights groups: ""This action shows none of us are safe""

A coalition of civil rights and immigrant justice organizations issued a joint statement condemning Good's killing, calling it ""a violation of due process and human dignity.""

The statement emphasized that Good did not exercise any form of violence, despite ICE's claims, and called her death a ""systemic failure.""

The organizations wrote: ""Every person, regardless of immigration status, has the right to due process — to be free from excessive force and to be treated with dignity under the law… No law enforcement agency is above the Constitution, and the use of force must be strictly limited, transparent, and subject to accountability.""

The groups called for a full, independent investigation into the officer's actions as well as a broader review of federal enforcement protocols.

A national debate with local implications

Although the fatal shooting happened in Minneapolis, Atlanta organizers say the stakes are deeply local.

Georgia continues to expand cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration agencies — a policy that immigrant rights groups argue heightens the risk of escalation during routine community interactions.

Good's death follows several fatal encounters involving federal immigration agents in recent months. Advocates say these incidents are part of a troubling pattern — one that echoes earlier national questions around policing, civil rights, and federal authority.

Many Atlantans who marched on Thursday night said the proximity of Good's killing to the site of George Floyd's death is impossible to ignore. Both incidents underscore the power imbalance between law enforcement and civilians during moments of rapid escalation.

What comes next

Organizers are calling on Georgia lawmakers to publicly condemn the killing and review local cooperation agreements with ICE.

National organizations are pushing for federal oversight, arguing that Good's killing represents not just a localized tragedy, but a constitutional crisis.

Their statement concludes: ""Justice requires that we protect both the rule of law and the basic rights that bind us together. We stand with Renee's family and all our communities in demanding full accountability and an independent investigation.""

Federal court hearing canceled

What we know:

A federal court hearing over a lawsuit filed by the ACLU against DHS and ICE was canceled this week hours after an ICE agent shot and killed a woman in her vehicle.

The ACLU filed the lawsuit weeks before the deadly shooting.

The ACLU argued DHS and ICE are trying to intimidate, harass and threaten those who try to observe and protest ICE in Minnesota.

In the lawsuit, the ACLU asked a judge to limit ICE and other federal agents from the use of crowd control weapons like chemical irritants and flash-bang grenades.

""Our worry has been and continues to be the disproportionate reaction that we have been seeing with ICE,"" said Teresa Nelson, Legal Director of ACLU-Minnesota.

ICE operations and lawsuits

Dig deeper:

Large scale immigration operations have led to similar lawsuits in other cities where ICE agents were accused of using excessive force while responding to protests.

In Chicago, a federal judge recently noted that ICE officers do not ""receive regular training on crowd control.""

A video submitted as part of the Minnesota case shows a man being arrested during a chaotic scene in south Minneapolis last year.

The ACLU argued federal agents used overly aggressive tactics.

Lawyers for the Department of Homeland Security argued that the man was the aggressor, shouting obscenities and throwing rocks at ICE agents.

The Trump Administration has made similar arguments in other cities subjected to increased immigration operations and did so again after Wednesday’s deadly shooting.

Press Secretary reacts

What they're saying:

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Democrats are ""impeding immigration enforcement operations daily"" and creating ""extremely heightened and dangerous circumstances.""

Nelson said the ACLU recognizes the need to balance legitimate law enforcement activity and the rights of people to engage in protected speech.

""There does need to be a balance and the balance right now has been tipping toward really unprecedented violence against people who are engaged in that First Amendment-protected activity,"" she said.

Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) will propose sweeping reforms to DHS, including requiring a warrant for arrests, banning masks during enforcement operations and requiring Border Patrol to remain at the border after an ICE officer killed a woman in Minneapolis this week, Axios has learned.

Why it matters: It's one of the biggest anti-ICE pushes by elected Democrats since the days of ""Abolish ICE"" — and less than two years after an election where Democrats feel like they got beaten badly on the immigration issue.

But the polling has shifted, with a majority of Americans saying last year that President Trump is doing ""too much"" on deportations, according to Pew.

Driving the news: Murphy, the top Democrat on the Senate appropriations subcommittee that oversees DHS, is also trying to build a coalition of Democrats to insist on some restraints on DHS' authority as a condition of their support for a spending bill for the department — with funding set to lapse Jan. 30.

But Democratic leaders, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), have already taken a shutdown at the end of the month off the table after weathering a bruising shutdown fight last fall.

Murphy and his staff are in conversations about his new bill with lawmakers from Minnesota, California and Illinois, where DHS has deployed large contingents of agents, a source familiar with the talks told Axios.

""It's hard to imagine how Democrats are going to vote for a DHS bill that funds this level of illegality and violence without constraints,"" Murphy told Axios on Thursday. ""There's gotta be some reasonable constraints.""

Murphy's proposal also would limit the use of firearms by ICE when conducting civil matters and require agents to wear identification.

Zoom out: Republicans will need a handful of Democratic votes in the Senate to pass spending bills.

A number of House Democrats also said Wednesday that the party should use the appropriations process to rein in DHS.

Yes, but: It's hard to see Republicans agreeing to Democratic demands for new constraints.

Hundreds of people protesting the shooting of Renee Good as she tried to drive away marched in freezing rain Thursday night down one of Minneapolis' major thoroughfares chanting ""ICE out now"" and holding signs saying, ""killer ice off our streets."" Protesters earlier vented their outrage outside of a federal facility that's serving as a hub for the administration's latest immigration crackdown on a major city.

The shooting in Portland, Oregon, took place outside a hospital Thursday afternoon and the conditions of the two people wounded were not immediately known. The FBI's Portland office said it is investigating.

Just as it did following the Minneapolis shooting, the Department of Homeland Security defended the actions of the officers in Portland, saying the shooting occurred after a Venezuelan man with alleged gang ties and who was involved in a recent shooting tried to ""weaponize"" his vehicle to hit the officers. It wasn't clear yet if witness video corroborates that account.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, President Donald Trump and others in his administration have repeatedly characterized the Minneapolis shooting as an act of self-defense and cast Good as a villain, suggesting she used her vehicle as a weapon to attack the officer who shot her.

Vice President JD Vance said the shooting was justified and that Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was a ""victim of left-wing ideology.""

""I can believe that her death is a tragedy while also recognizing that it is a tragedy of her own making,"" Vance said, noting that the officer who killed her was injured while making an arrest last June.

But state and local officials and protesters rejected that characterization, with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey saying video of the shooting shows the self-defense argument was ""garbage.""

An immigration crackdown quickly turns deadly

The shooting happened on the second day of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown on the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, which Homeland Security said is the biggest immigration enforcement operation ever. More than 2,000 officers are taking part, and Noem said they have already made more than 1,500 arrests.

It provoked an immediate response in the city where police killed George Floyd in 2020, with hundreds of people turning up to the scene to vent their outrage at the ICE officers and the school district canceling classes for the rest of the week as a precaution.

Good's death - at least the fifth tied to immigration sweeps since Trump took office - has resonated far beyond Minneapolis, as protests took place or were expected this week in many large U.S. cities.

""We should be horrified,"" protester Shanta Hejmadi said. ""We should be saddened that our government is waging war on our citizens.""

Protesters blocked the street in Minneapolis where Good was shot with makeshift barricades constructed out of garbage cans, Christmas trees and canopies. People gave out coffee and water, while fires burned in metal drums to keep visitors warm.

Who will investigate?

On Thursday, the Minnesota agency that investigates officer-involved shootings said it was informed that the FBI and U.S. Justice Department would not work with the department, effectively ending any role for the state to determine if crimes were committed. Noem said the state has no jurisdiction.

""Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands,"" Drew Evans, the bureau's superintendent, said.

Gov. Tim Walz publicly demanded that the state be allowed to take part, repeatedly emphasizing that it would be ""very difficult for Minnesotans"" to accept that an investigation that excludes the state could be fair.

Noem, he said, was ""judge, jury and basically executioner"" during her public comments about the confrontation.

""People in positions of power have already passed judgment, from the president to the vice president to Kristi Noem - have stood and told you things that are verifiably false, verifiably inaccurate,"" the governor said.

Frey, the mayor, told The Associated Press: ""We want to make sure that there is a check on this administration to ensure that this investigation is done for justice, not for the sake of a cover-up.""

Deadly encounter seen from multiple angles

Several bystanders captured footage of Good's killing, which happened in a neighborhood south of downtown.

The videos show an officer approaching an SUV stopped across the middle of the road, demanding the driver open the door and grabbing the handle. The Honda Pilot begins to pull forward, and a different ICE officer standing in front of it pulls his weapon and immediately fires at least two shots at close range, jumping back as the vehicle moves toward him.

It isn't clear from the videos if the vehicle makes contact with the officer, and there is no indication of whether the woman had interactions with ICE agents earlier. After the shooting the SUV speeds into two cars parked on a curb before crashing to a stop.

ICE officer in Minneapolis shooting identified as officer who suffered injuries during June arrest

The ICE officer who fired the shots that allegedly killed Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis on Wednesday has been identified as Jonathan Ross, according to sources and federal court records from a prior case in which Ross was injured.

The Department of Homeland Security says the officer fired on Good after she allegedly tried to ram officers with her vehicle.

In a social media post on Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security said the officer was ""dragged in June by a child sexual predator trying to evade an immigration enforcement arrest. He suffered severe injuries and required 33 stitches. ICE officers put their lives on the line every day to defend American communities.""

The post also links to a previous post by DHS in June when the incident occurred, identifying the suspect as Roberto Carlos Munoz. Federal court records in that case identify the ICE officer Jonathan Ross as witness in the case and include photos of his injuries. The court record also describes two separate cuts requiring 20 and 13 stitches, respectively.

When asked for comment on the identity of the ICE agent who fired the shot that allegedly killed Good, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin responded: ""We are not going to expose the name of this officer. He acted according to his training.""

She added, ""This officer is a longtime ICE officer who has been serving his country his entire life.""

Without naming the officer, she said he has more than 10 years of experience as ICE deportation officer and was selected for ICE's Special Response Team. She said the officer had training in several specialized skills, including advanced firearms training.

""DHS will never confirm or deny attempts to dox our law enforcement officers,"" McLaughlin said. ""Doxxing our officers put their lives and their families in serious danger.""

“MAGA loves it,” Trump said in an interview with NBC News this week, defending his foreign policy approach.","Five years after the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol by President Trump’s supporters, the White House released a website this week attempting to revise history.

Reasserting Trump’s false claim that he had won the 2020 presidential election, the administration doubled down on his decision to issue blanket pardons for the rioters, blamed Capitol Police for escalating tensions that day, and denounced Trump’s vice president at the time, Mike Pence, for “refusing to act” in defiance of the Constitution to stop congressional certification of Trump’s loss.

It was a display of political audacity that has become the hallmark of Trump’s second act — challenging anyone to stop him from asserting raw executive authority, both at home and increasingly abroad.

Whether on foreign or domestic policy, lawmakers have struggled to respond to an administration that moves with unfettered restraint and exceptional speed. The U.S. Supreme Court has only facilitated Trump’s expansion of unitary executive power. And governments abroad accustomed to Trump’s lack of predictability now face a president whose entire philosophy toward foreign interventionism appears to have turned on a dime.

“There are political checks. They are checks, though, that have been degraded,” said William Howell, dean of the School of Government and Policy at Johns Hopkins University and author of “Trajectory of Power: The Rise of the Strongman Presidency.”

“They are checks that are looked upon not just with frustration, but an outward animosity by the president,” Howell added. “It’s a feature of his populist politics for him to say, ‘anything that stands in my way is illegitimate.’”

Unitary rule

Trump’s extraordinary use of executive authority has no comparison in recent times. The president has issued more than 220 executive actions in his first year back in office — more than the 220 orders he issued throughout his entire first term, and dwarfing the 276 actions that President Obama issued over eight years in office.

Directing the Justice Department to prosecute his political enemies, and deploying his pardon power to shield his friends and allies, Trump risks fueling the very sort of politicized system of justice he campaigned against as a presidential candidate.

And his administration has shown derision for Congress, controlled by the president’s own party, approving historically few bills and neglecting those that have passed, such as the Epstein Files Transparency Act. Trump has attempted to unilaterally rename the Defense Department and the Kennedy Center, despite straightforward laws requiring acts of Congress to do so, and has impounded funds appropriated by Congress for child care and family assistance allocated to Democratic states.

“The nature of presidential power is that it is given as much as taken,” said Andrew Rudalevige, a professor of government at Bowdoin College and author of “The New Imperial Presidency.” “You can’t have an imperial presidency without an invisible Congress. And certainly, the current Congress is setting new records for intentional invisibility.”

After Trump bulldozed the East Wing of the White House, a reporter asked his press secretary what was stopping him from knocking down the entire building. Karoline Leavitt demurred. “That’s a legal opinion that’s been held for many years,” she said, suggesting he could, in fact, demolish the rest of it.

“The institutional constraints on the unilateral presidency are weak,” said Dino Christenson, a political science professor at Washington University in St. Louis and co-author of “The Myth of the Imperial Presidency.” “The conservative majority of the [Supreme] Court has also recently chosen to back executive power.

“Arguably,” he added, “international constraints are even weaker, at least for powerful nations like the U.S.”

‘Governed by force’

Trump’s order over the weekend to depose Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, seizing him and his wife from their bedroom in a stunning military raid, was the type of rare exercise in American power that has defined past presidencies. But Trump said he was just getting started.

Beaming from the operational success in Caracas, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he was considering military action against no fewer than five countries, allies and foes alike. His homeland security advisor, Stephen Miller, said that no one would even try to stop Trump from militarily taking over Greenland, an autonomous region of Denmark, a NATO ally and European Union member state.

“We live in a world,” Miller told CNN, “that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power.”

At the State Department, veteran U.S. diplomats waited anxiously for guidance from the administration on how it would justify the operation based on international law on the global stage. It never came. “At least with Iraq, Libya, Syria, there was an effort to seek legal cover,” one diplomat said, granted anonymity to speak candidly. “This is just grab-and-go.”

After the president vowed to run Venezuela going forward as a vassal state, Trump’s energy secretary said the United States would exert control over its oil production “indefinitely.”

And the Trump administration ordered the seizure of two foreign tankers on Wednesday in international waters that have violated its unilateral oil embargo against Caracas, risking precedent governing the laws of the seas that have for decades ensured international commercial flows.

It was a surprising turn for a president who had campaigned on a promise to focus on domestic policy, under a slogan of “America first.”

“So many of the claims that he was making — both in terms of his power and his politics — was about an inward turn, about standing up for America and attending to core problems that it had failed to face, whereas all these foreign entanglements were distractions to be avoided,” Howell said. “So it is striking that he has assumed this new posture of outward imperialism — land grabs, oil tankers, removing heads of state — all at once.”

Several Republican lawmakers expressed skepticism over Trump’s new posture, warning the president against entrenching the U.S. military in foreign conflicts. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, warned that U.S. military action against Denmark in Greenland “would not be appropriate” after the White House issued an explicit threat of force.

Scholars of the imperial presidency often say that public opinion — not the legislature or the courts — remains the strongest check on executive authority. Trump is ineligible for a third term in office, and has signaled in recent weeks that he recognizes that constitutional limit as unambiguous.

“I don’t think Trump is immune from the laws of political gravity,” Rudalevige said. “Despite his bluster, he is a lame duck. He has never had a Gallup approval rating above 50%, and that rating is in the 30s. His policy actions are even less popular.”

But he also said he believes the public supports him in his brash use of power, telling lawmakers there could be a “constitutional movement” to keep him in office.

“MAGA loves it,” Trump said in an interview with NBC News this week, defending his foreign policy approach. “MAGA loves what I’m doing. MAGA loves everything I do.”

“MAGA is me,” he added. “MAGA loves everything I do, and I love everything I do, too.”

WASHINGTON — Today, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released new statistics on assaults against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) law enforcement who now face a more than 1,300% increase in assaults, a 3,200% increase in vehicular attacks against them, and an 8,000% increase in death threats.

Sanctuary politicians have created an environment that encourages rampant assaults on law enforcement.

During the first year of the Trump administration, from January 20 – December 31, 2025, DHS officials reported 275 assaults as compared to the 19 reported assaults during the same period in 2024. This is a horrific 1,347% increase in assaults against ICE officers.

From January 21, 2025 – January 7, 2026, ICE law enforcement officers experienced 66 vehicular attacks against them, compared to only 2 during the same time period the previous year. This is a 3,200% increase in vehicular attacks.

“This unprecedented increase in violence against law enforcement is a direct result of sanctuary politicians and the media creating an environment that demonizes our law enforcement and encourages rampant assaults against them. Dangerous criminals – whether they be illegal aliens or U.S. citizens – are assaulting law enforcement and turning their vehicles into weapons to attack law enforcement,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “Still, the brave men and women of DHS will not be deterred and will continue arresting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens. Anyone who attacks law enforcement will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

Below are just a few samplings of the violent rhetoric against DHS law enforcement:

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz called ICE law enforcement the “modern-day Gestapo.”

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called for ICE to “get the f**k out of Minneapolis.”

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called for people to “fight” President Trump’s agenda “in the streets.”

Governor Pritzker claimed the United States is ""essentially"" becoming Nazi Germany as a result of ICE’s heroic efforts.

Boston Mayor Michelle Wu compared mask-wearing ICE agents to a Neo-Nazi group.

Rep. Becca Balint likens ICE law enforcement officers to “vigilantes” engaging in “kidnapping.”

This rhetoric is contributing to a more than 1,300% increase in assaults against DHS law enforcement.

A non-exhaustive list of physical assaults include:

A pedophile and criminal illegal alien hammered an ICE officer in the face with a metal coffee cup, breaking his lip open with a laceration requiring 13 stitches.

A group of at least ten violent individuals opened fire on ICE officers at the Prairieland Detention Center.

A criminal illegal alien viciously bit an ICE officer while resisting arrest.

A sniper indiscriminately opened fire on the Dallas ICE facility and shot three detainees, killing two and injuring a third.

A violent crowd attacked Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agents who were conducting arrests of rioters who previously threw rocks at federal law enforcement vehicles at a marijuana facility.

A non-exhaustive list of vehicular assaults includes:

A criminal illegal alien and suspected Tren de Aragua gang member, Luis Jesus Acosta Gutierrez,rammed a law enforcement vehicle into a tree during a vehicle stop.

ICE officers were targeted duringtwo separate vehicular assaults in the Chicago metro area during Operation Midway Blitz.

An illegal alien hit an ICE officer with a vehicle, nearly crushing the officer

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem’s message is clear: you will not stop or slow us down. ICE and our federal law enforcement partners will continue to enforce the law. And if you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

ST. PAUL, Minnesota. Jan. 8, 2026 – Education Minnesota President Monica Byron released the following statement demanding ICE stay away from Minnesota schools in the wake of yesterday’s ICE actions involving educators and students.

“Yesterday’s actions by ICE in Minnesota—including the shooting of a community member, the unjust detention of a Minnesota educator, and the use of pepper spray on students—are unconscionable in a civil society.

ICE’s continued operations make every Minnesotan less safe. Their presence near our schools puts students and educators at serious risk. Every moment they remain near schools endangers children, educators and families. We demand that ICE operations be kept away from schools so students, educators and staff can learn and work in safety and peace.

Beyond the physical danger, ICE’s actions directly undermine teaching and learning. Yesterday, an elementary school was placed on lockdown, and schools in Minnesota’s largest city were forced to close for two days—two days of learning our students will never get back. Seats are empty in Minnesota classrooms across the state right now as families keep students at home in an attempt to keep them safe from ICE. This disruption comes on top of the ongoing fear and emotional harm students experience when ICE operates in their communities.

As Minnesotans and Americans, we agree that schools must be places of safety, learning and belonging. This is not a partisan issue—it is a moral one. The Trump Administration must act now and order all ICE operations to stay away from schools and out of all school zones across Minnesota.”",https://educationminnesota.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/News-release-graphic.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 21:57:26.292294

""I just wish this administration didn't make such a drastic leap,"" she said. If families can't get child care subsidies. that's going to impact so many people in so many horrible ways that I don't think they're grasping.

The Trump administration's crackdown on the $12 billion Child Care and Development Fund, which subsidizes care for 1.4 million children from low-income households, has rattled child care providers and families that rely on the aid money. Citing unspecified allegations of fraud, Trump administration officials are requiring states to provide extra documentation before receiving the money.

It's unclear if or when child care providers and families like Rodriguez's would feel the pinch.

Child care centers are bracing for scrutiny and possible cuts

The administration announced last week that state officials will be required to provide additional information to receive the federal child care money. On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced it would freeze the funding for child care subsidies until they provided even more exhaustive documentation.

The department said it also would withhold other federal safety net money for those states — California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York — including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, which supports low-income parents with children under 18 with direct payments and by providing them with child care.

The administration has not released information about the fraud allegations that prompted the new scrutiny.

WATCH: Federal agents probe fraud allegations targeting Somali child care providers in Minnesota

HHS said in a statement that it ""identified concerns that these benefits intended for American citizens and lawful residents may have been improperly provided to individuals who are not eligible under federal law.""

The actions raised fears of payment delays and disruptions for the beleaguered child care industry, which has been struggling under staff shortages, long waits for subsidy programs and the effects of the Trump administration crackdown on immigration.

Ruth Friedman, who headed the federal Office of Child Care under President Joe Biden, said she was concerned the new requirements would lead to delays in funding, which could immediately endanger child care programs. The information the administration asked for might not be readily available, she said.

Providers say they already face extensive regulations

Already, child care providers comply with extensive regulations to receive federal subsides. Dawn Uribe, who runs Mis Amigos Preschool with several Minnesota locations, said staff have to make sure kids sign in and out with the correct ID, and it can take a month to get paid for services. For years, inspectors have regularly visited to assess their records.

""There's already so much oversight that goes into this so I don't really understand how much more they can do,"" Uribe said.

Uribe, like other child care providers, stressed how tightly federal funds are in her state, so much so that she's considering forgoing them altogether, In addition to the administrative burden, child care providers lose money when they enroll children who receive subsidies.

""It's so much work to accept subsidies from the government,"" Uribe said.

Karen DeVos, who runs three childcare facilities in rural northwest Minnesota, is preparing her staff to pull records on the spot in case an investigator shows up unannounced. Daycare centers are regularly subjected to audits and attendance checks, she said.

""If we continue to view every provider as somebody who could be committing fraud, we are going to lose really valuable resources in our child care providers,"" DeVos said. ""There is only so much stress that people can take and not knowing every single day if somebody is going to knock on your door and accuse you of something is terrifying.""

Beyond official investigators, some providers are wary of amateur sleuths showing up at their doors like Nick Shirley, the right-wing influencer who claimed he'd found rampant fraud at day care centers operated by Somali residents in Minneapolis. The Trump administration has cited his viral video in its decision to cut off certain federal funding streams.

Grants provide a lifeline for parents

Even with two incomes, Charity Pallum said she and her husband would not be able to afford child care for their 1-year-old twins. But because of the federal child care subsidies, both Pallum, a teacher, and her husband, who works at a car dealership, are able to work full-time.

If Pallum's family were to lose that support, her husband might have to stop working, putting a pinch on their family budget.

""I guess our plans are, 'We're just going to see how this goes,'"" said Pallum, a teacher living in Ada, Minnesota.

Pallum said neither she nor her husband want to risk missing paychecks if they lose the child care subsidy.

The Trump administration’s immigration enforcement strategy has prioritized political theater over public safety. By abandoning clear enforcement priorities, it has driven up arrests of people with no criminal history and pushed agents chase numbers instead of genuine threats. Under pressure to increase arrests and rapidly hire 12,000 new officers, the administration has tolerated tactics that are unprofessional, dangerous, and deadly—from chokeholds and teargas to wrongful arrests of US citizens and armed confrontations with bystanders. The expanded use of masks has opened the door to impersonations by criminals and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has justified these trends by citing dramatic increases in assaults on ICE officers that are not supported by available evidence. With thousands of hastily hired, minimally trained officers now in the pipeline, these problems are poised to escalate unless significant course corrections are made.

Lack of Priorities

For the first time since 1999, U.S. interior immigration enforcement is operating without explicit enforcement priorities. On his first day in office, President Trump issued an executive order that rescinded the Biden administration’s priorities and instructed ICE, among other agencies, to set their own priorities that “protect the public safety and national security interests of the American people.” This broke with 26 years of continuous, explicit interior immigration enforcement priorities, maintained across Democratic and Republican administrations.

The consequences are already visible. Even though ICE has stopped publishing arrest or deportation statistics, detention data released through the end of November—as required by the FY 2020 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill—shows a marked increase in the number of people detained with no criminal record. As of December 13, 2025, 70% of individuals in immigration detention had never been convicted of a crime. Communities are experiencing enforcement that is broader, less targeted, and less tethered to public safety than at any point in recent memory.

Masking and Problematic Policing Tactics

There has been a significant rise in high-profile arrests of noncitizens and citizens alike in which ICE and other federal law enforcement officers are using masking and other concerning policing tactics. Videos have caught ICE and other federal officers pulling US citizens from their vehicles, pointing guns at crowds or specific bystanders, impersonating utility workers, and using excessive force, such as chokeholds, kneeling on a target’s head, vehicle maneuvers, pepper balls against peaceful protesters and reporters, and tear gas at close range and in residential areas. The enforcement push has included at least fourteen shootings so far, two of which were fatal. One was the shooting of a 37-year old US citizen in Minneapolis, who appeared to be driving away from the scene, but who the administration quickly labeled as having tried to commit “an act of domestic terrorism.”

Despite the widespread evidence of problematic policing tactics and violations of DHS’s own use of force policies, DHS has given no indication that any officers have been disciplined. Instead, in response to a report on potential violations of DHS’s use of force policy, DHS issued a statement praising the officers’ “incredible restraint in exhausting all options before force is escalated.”

Early on in the administration, local police began speaking out against ICE tactics and the ways they are eroding trust with law enforcement. Recently, when discussing ICE’s tactics, Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, explained that police departments in some cities are getting 911 calls from community residents reporting the presence of armed masked men in their neighborhoods.

Gil Kerlikowske, former commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection and police chief in Seattle, has also spoken out against the tactics, saying “These are tactics and strategies that are clearly not needed to be able to do their job… I couldn’t be more disappointed.” Kerlikowske also explained that federal immigration officers “do not have the training or skillset or experience to police an urban environment.”

Arrests of US Citizens

News and social media sites are flooded with stories of US citizens being arrested and detained by ICE, the vast majority of which are later released without charge. Here are some of the more appalling examples:

In Alabama, US. citizen Leonardo Garcia Venegas has been arrested twice by federal agents. During both arrests, which occurred one month apart, agents dismissed his Real ID as being fake. During one of the arrests, agents refused to remove his handcuffs until hours later when Venegas provided his social security number.

In California, George Retes, a 25-year-old veteran and US citizen, was attempting to enter his workplace in Ventura County, CA, when he was stopped and detained by immigration agents. Agents used tear gas to try and disperse protesters, which filled up his car, leaving him choking. Agents then refused to verify his identification, smashed his window, pepper sprayed Retes, knelt on him, and left him zip tied for four hours until being transferred to a cell. He was held for three days, was not allowed to make a phone call or contact a lawyer, and missed his daughter’s third birthday.

In Florida, Silvia was detained with her undocumented husband while they were on their way to work, despite attempts to prove her citizenship. Her family claims that federal agents didn’t believe her since she didn’t sound Puerto Rican to them. Silvia, who was pregnant at the time, was thrown to the ground and handcuffed, remaining detained for 5 hours. Silvia says the incident led to her later losing her unborn child.

In Oklahoma, a US citizen mother and her three US citizen daughters were woken in the middle of the night, forced to stand in the rain in their underwear, and had their phones, laptops, and all of their cash savings confiscated. The federal agents were executing a search warrant for the family’s home, but none of the individuals listed on the warrant lived in the home. The agents also failed to listen to the family’s pleas that they were US citizens.

The US government does not keep track of the numbers of US citizens arrested in the course of immigration enforcement operations. In October, ProPublica compiled and reviewed publicly available incidents and found more than 170 US citizen arrests that occurred during the first nine months of President Trump’s second administration. Third Way is also collecting cases of US citizens arrested by federal immigration agents and would be happy to share this resource.

Imitation of ICE Officers

Federal agents’ use of masks and failure to identify themselves have created an opening for bad actors to impersonate ICE officers. Examples include:

In Delaware, two men wearing vests labeled “ICE” pulled a man over, removed him from his vehicle, and took his wallet, while wielding a knife and a firearm.

In Colorado, a masked man walked into a grocery store with a semi-automatic gun in a holster on his hip. When an employee told him that firearms were not allowed in the business, he flashed a fake ICE badge.

In Florida, a woman wearing an ICE shirt and a mask kidnapped a hotel clerk, who was later able to escape.

In Pennsylvania, a man wearing a mask and impersonating ICE, entered an auto repair shop, yelled “Immigration!” tied up a woman who remained in the store, and stole $1,000 in cash before fleeing.

In New York, a man ordered a woman into a basement stairwell after telling her he was an ICE agent. He assaulted and robbed her.

Also in New York, three men in black vests entered a restaurant claiming to be ICE agents. Inside, they tied up two workers, kicking one to the ground and pulling a garbage bag over the others’ head.

In North Carolina, a man allegedly posed as ICE, showing a badge, and threatening to deport a woman if she didn’t have sex with him at a motel.

In South Carolina, a man presented himself as an ICE agent to pull over and detain a group of Latino men.

While there is no official count of alleged ICE officer impersonations, a CNN review found two dozen incidents of such in 2025, a significant rise from prior years. The problem has become so persistent that in October, the FBI issued a law enforcement bulletin warning of criminals posing as US immigration officers who have carried out robberies, kidnappings, and sexual assaults.

Safety of ICE Officers

The Trump administration has defended its masking policy by claiming attacks on ICE officers are up “more than 1,000 percent” and death threats by “8,000%.” Yet DHS has provided no data to substantiate those numbers.

While there is no doubt assaults on ICE officers have increased, and attacks on law enforcement should be taken seriously, there is no public evidence backing the administration’s claim that they have spiked dramatically. An NPR analysis of court records found a 25% rise in charges for assault against federal officers compared to the same period in the prior year—a far cry from a “more than 1,000 percent” increase. For the administration’s claims to be true, there would have to be thousands of assaults that did not result in criminal charges.

One of the best ways to improve both officer and community safety is de-escalation. However, despite ICE training on de-escalation and its role in DHS’s use of force policy, it is not being consistently used. The many videos featuring aggressive tactics and unnecessary escalations suggest the problem is systemic.

Talking Points

A US citizen is dead following an ICE operation. When civil immigration enforcement results in lethal force against an American, it raises profound questions about training, escalation, and command responsibility that Congress has an obligation to answer.

The Trump administration’s initial response utterly failed to meet the gravity of the moment. Instead of calling for a thorough investigation and preserving public trust, senior officials rushed to rhetoric and narrative-setting. That instinct—to defend first and investigate later—undermines accountability and public safety.

Interior enforcement works best when it is focused on genuine threats—not political theater. By abandoning clear enforcement priorities for the first time in 26 years, this administration has pushed ICE officers to chase numbers instead of public safety.

The data we do have shows enforcement drifting away from its mission of keeping Americans safe. Detention records reveal a sharp increase in people being swept up despite having no criminal history—a sign of an unfocused system and a waste of limited resources.

No one should tolerate unprofessional or dangerous policing tactics in immigration enforcement. We’ve now seen chokeholds, tear gas, masked arrests, and armed confrontations with bystanders—tactics that have no place in routine civil enforcement.

Republican lawmakers are abdicating their duties to their own constituents. More than 170 US citizens have been detained by ICE this year alone—people pulled from cars, zip-tied for hours, left in the rain in their underwear, and in some cases hospitalized. This is a systemic failure that needs Congressional oversight.

The widespread use of masks has created serious public-safety risks. Criminals are impersonating ICE officers to carry out robberies, kidnappings, and assaults—so frequently that the FBI issued a national bulletin. Police officers and the public both pay the price for ICE masking.

Local law-enforcement are raising alarms. Police chiefs across the country are coming out of the woodwork to say ICE’s tactics are undermining trust and generating 911 calls about “armed masked men”—showing just how far routine enforcement has drifted from community-policing standards.

Every assault on an ICE officer is unacceptable—and we take those threats seriously. But the administration’s claims of a 1,000% increase in assaults is not backed by evidence. The best way to protect officers and communities alike is through proven de-escalation tactics that reduce risk, not escalate it.

The administration’s rush to hire and deploy 12,000 new officers is a recipe for more mistakes. Flooding the field with minimally trained agents increases risks for the public, other federal officers, and the agents themselves.

Public safety demands a reset: clear priorities, accountable practices, and professional standards. When enforcement is targeted, transparent, and grounded in best practices, it protects communities and preserves trust in the immigration system.

Democrats support strong, smart, and lawful enforcement. That means focusing resources on individuals who pose threats, not sweeping up people at random; enforcing the law with professionalism; and ensuring federal officers have the training they need to keep everyone safe.

Dems Discussing Interior Immigration Enforcement

Voters have continuously questioned Democrats’ handling of immigration and border security issues and continue to place more trust in Republican tactics despite disagreeing with the current approach by the Trump administration. To gain this trust, Democrats need to be vocal about their stances on immigration, especially as this issue continues to be at the forefront of concerns for voters. Here are some examples of Democrats speaking well on the administration’s current approach to interior immigration enforcement:

Representative Greg Stanton calls attention to how the administration raced to hire and deploy thousands of federal agents without proper training, leading to the death of a woman killed by ICE.

Representative Nikki Budzinski responds to the death of a woman shot by ICE, calling for a full investigation and accountability from the administration.

Senator Alex Padilla speaks on several instances of US citizens being detained by federal immigration officers.

Representative Gabe Vasquez, in an op-ed piece, writes that immigration enforcement operations hinder local law enforcement, reduces public safety, and calls for smart investments that keeps the border secure, holds criminals accountable, and creates legal pathways to citizenship.

Senators Mark Warner and Ed Markey discuss the constitutional concerns that Americans face with Border Patrol’s use of license plate surveillance technologies.

Senator Elissa Slotkin, in an interview with the New York Times, speaks on Democrats being scared of offending immigrant advocacy groups or people further on the left, doubling down that Democrats need be more comfortable with clamping down on the rules when it comes to legal immigration.

Representatives Tom Suozzi and Brian Fitzpatrick discuss where the administration has been right such as securing the border, deporting violent criminals, and targeting narcoterrorism while simultaneously reinforcing how it shouldn’t go after hard working individuals with families and how most of these tactics don’t truly address the current immigration system.

Representative Tom Suozzi advocates for lawmakers to lean in on legalizing individuals who have been here for decades and haven’t committed a crime.","https://uploads.thirdway.org/cdn-cgi/image/format=baseline-jpeg,quality=90,width=1200,height=630,fit=cover,gravity=auto/https://uploads.thirdway.org/products/HG_shutterstock_2683835855%401.5x.jpg",N,,2026-01-09 01:57:06.260747

The Minneapolis shooting occurred Wednesday morning on a residential street.","The fatal shooting of a 37-year-old woman by a federal immigration agent during an operation Wednesday in Minneapolis sparked public outrage and protests across the country, including in California, where agents have been involved in several shootings.

California lawmakers and immigrant rights groups condemned the killing of the woman, who was identified by family as Renee Nicole Good, a wife and mother of three.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom took to social media to say President Trump had a role in the violence.

“His deliberate escalation of intimidation and chaos has consequences,” Newsom wrote. “His reckless crackdown must end.”

In a written statement, Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn called on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to withdraw Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from Los Angeles County and other areas of the United States.

“These ICE agents are undertrained and trigger-happy and everyone who has seen this video knows ICE murdered this woman,” Hahn said. “These ICE agents are too dangerous and they should not be operating on our streets.”

In a strongly worded statement, Assemblymember Mark González (D-Los Angeles) called the shooting a “public execution.”

“ICE does not give a single s— who you are, how long you’ve lived here, or how hard you’ve worked. They are coming for ALL of us. They are armed with fear, force, and zero accountability,” he wrote. “I unequivocally condemn the actions of federal agents in Minneapolis. The fatal shooting of Renee was a public execution, NOT self-defense.”

Masih Fouladi, executive director of the California Immigrant Policy Center, said it was not the first time immigration enforcement operations “resulted in violence and bloodshed.” He said federal immigration agents have fired on at least nine people in five states and Washington, D.C.

On New Year’s Eve, Keith Porter Jr. was fatally shot by an off-duty ICE agent outside his apartment complex in Northridge. Family members and their attorney said Porter was firing a gun into the air to celebrate and posed no threat.

“The tragic killings of people by ICE agents are yet another example of how mass immigration raids endanger our communities and erode our constitutional rights,” Fouladi said.

Porter’s death is just one of several shootings and use-of-force incidents involving ICE agents in Southern California.

In October immigration agents shot and wounded Carlos Jimenez, a U.S. citizen, in Ontario, just days after TikTok streamer Carlitos Ricardo Parias was shot in the arm. And in August a federal agent in San Bernardino opened fire on people inside a truck. The driver sped off after an agent smashed the driver’s side window.

The Minneapolis shooting occurred Wednesday morning on a residential street. Videos taken by witnesses and shared on social media show the driver of a maroon compact sport utility vehicle reversing before accelerating forward and turning to leave when an agent — standing in front of the vehicle — opens fire.

Noem said during a news conference that the woman “weaponized her vehicle” and that it was an “act of terrorism.” She defended the actions of the agent, who she claimed had been dragged by a vehicle in June, and reported that the agent was hospitalized and released.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey disputed Noem’s description of events leading up to the shooting.

“Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly: That is bull—,” he said. “This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.”

President Trump took to social media to say the situation was being “studied” and also defended the actions of the agent.

“They are just trying to do the job of making America safe,” he wrote in part. “We need to stand by and protect our law enforcement officers.”

Hours after the slaying, thousands descended at the site of the shooting to hold a vigil for the woman while hundreds of demonstrators banged on the glass windows of a federal courthouse building in downtown Minneapolis, chanting, “ICE out now!”

In downtown Los Angeles, dozens gathered at Placita Olvera to call for an end to immigration raids that have brought terror to American communities, and Thursday morning the nonprofit Clergy and Laity United for Economic Justice held a demonstration outside of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services building.

Videos shared on social media show people chanting “ICE out of L.A.” while holding signs, including some that read: “From Minneapolis to Los Angeles, stop ICE terror.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1acc8e0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7012x3681+0+498/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0b%2F02%2F9f8a0a9047b29e9f156ed01a1bd8%2F1536595-me-ice-agent-shooting-northridge-jja-0028.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 22:57:15.210018

PPB officers responded to Southeast Main Street near I-205, the location of Adventist Health Portland, for a report of the shooting at 2:18 p.m. Officers confirmed at the scene that federal agents were involved in the shooting, which happened in the hospital parking lot.

At 2:24 p.m., police learned that a man who had been shot was calling to request help near Northeast 146th Avenue and East Burnside. Portland police officers responded and found a man and a woman with apparent gunshot wounds.

PPB said they applied a tourniquet and called for emergency medical help. Both patients were taken to the hospital, and PPB said their conditions are unknown. Police confirmed they were connected to the shooting involving federal agents.

Police have secured both scenes for an investigation. East Burnside is closed westbound between Northeast 145th Avenue and 148th Avenue.

""We are still in the early stages of this incident,"" said Chief Bob Day. ""We understand the heightened emotion and tension many are feeling in the wake of the shooting in Minneapolis, but I am asking the community to remain calm as we work to learn more.""

Staff at Legacy Emanuel Medical Center confirmed to KGW that the hospital was on lockdown shortly before 3:30 p.m. on Thursday. OHSU said it was not on lockdown.

At Adventist Health Portland, located on Southeast Main Street by I-205, a KGW crew saw an area outside the hospital surrounded with yellow police tape, with Portland police officers and ICE agents on-scene. Staff confirmed that there had been an incident in one of the parking lots.

In the middle of the roped-off parking lot, KGW saw a damaged vehicle with its doors open.

In a tweet, FBI Portland said it was the lead agency investigating an ""agent involved shooting"" involving ""Customs and Border Patrol"" officers — referring either to Border Patrol or the overarching agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection — and that two people were wounded. They later deleted the tweet.

FBI agents could be seen Thursday afternoon at the scene on East Burnside, where Portland police found the two injured people.

'Show up with calm and purpose'

The incident Thursday happened to coincide with a protest against ICE happening downtown. Demonstrators planned to go up to Mayor Keith Wilson's office at city hall to demand he revoke the permit for the ICE facility in Portland, spurred on by the agency's recent deadly shooting of a woman in Minneapolis.

RELATED: Mayor Wilson responds to Minnesota governor after deadly ICE shooting

But outside Wilson's office, a constituent consultant told the small group of demonstrators that there'd been an incident in the city involving ICE, and that the mayor was in an emergency meeting.

Almost simultaneously, around 2:40 p.m., Portland City Council President Elana Pirtle-Guiney abruptly broke into an ongoing debate over the election of a new council president, saying that the council needed to immediately go on recess.

Just before 4 p.m., Pirtle-Guiney returned and adjourned the meeting for the day, after looking to reschedule for Wednesday, Jan. 14.

Minutes later, Mayor Keith Wilson put out a statement, saying in part:

""We cannot sit by while constitutional protections erode and bloodshed mounts. Portland is not a 'training ground' for militarized agents, and the 'full force' threatened by the administration has deadly consequences. As Mayor, I call on ICE to end all operations in Portland until a full investigation can be completed.

""Federal militarization undermines effective, community‑based public safety, and it runs counter to the values that define our region. I will use every legal and legislative tool available to protect our residents' civil and human rights.

""I call on every Portlander to represent our values and to show up with calm and purpose during this difficult time. Portland does not respond to violence with violence.

But immigration agents remained able to access data through computerized systems, including one controlled by the licensing department.
The UW center’s report looked to New York, which it said has cut off Nlets access to both ICE and CBP.
But in the news conference, some acknowledged that other federal agencies could also access Nlets and share information with immigration agents.
Under President Donald Trump, many federal agencies have been drafted to work on immigration enforcement.","More than a half dozen years after Washington began limiting access to driver’s license data for immigration enforcement, federal officials were still using the information for immigration arrests as recently as late last year, a report released Thursday shows.

And despite the state implementing new restrictions twice last year, some immigration authorities still have access to driver’s license data, according to state officials and the report by the University of Washington Center for Human Rights.

Gov. Bob Ferguson “stands prepared to take further action,” according to a 10-page joint statement by his office, State Patrol and Washington’s Department of Licensing. But the statement said the governor “will do so with reason and care.”

“Governor Ferguson is committed to complying with applicable laws and finding the right balance in protecting individuals’ data without compromising legitimate law enforcement investigations of criminal acts that are necessary to preserve public safety,” the statement continued.

The UW center report documented nine cases of immigration arrests between August and November last year that followed queries by federal agents to Nlets, a national computer system that allows law enforcement agencies to access state driver’s license data, criminal history and other information stored throughout the country. Such queries, in Washington, go through a State Patrol platform called ACCESS, which acts as a “switch” to send information back to Nlets and the requesting parties, according to the UW report and state officials.

The Seattle Times, separately, obtained information about another case — the widely publicized arrest of Kirkland high school theater manager Fernando Rocha — indicating federal agents queried Nlets for state licensing information six times before his arrest last July.

Officials can enter a driver’s license number into Nlets and retrieve the registered owner’s information, including their home address, date of birth, height and hair color. They can also get a photo. Officials can then check that information against Department of Homeland Security data for alleged immigration violations and use the data to verify or identify targets for arrest, according to the UW report.

In several cases tracked by the UW center through public disclosure documents and ICE records, federal agents looked up information on a truck or van, then followed the vehicle and made a traffic stop leading to an arrest.

Federal agents queried Nlets about one man’s license plate after he left a Latino grocery story, saying in reports they were “performing systems checks on vehicles moving near the location of a targeted subject,” according to the report. They determined he lacked authorization to be in the U.S. and arrested him. The man later told UW researchers he had been pistol-whipped, tased and pepper-sprayed in his eyes as he was arrested.

Such arrests, aided by state licensing information, have turned roads into immigration enforcement “hunting grounds,” the UW report says.

Washington’s attempt to limit driver’s license information sharing started in 2018, after The Seattle Times revealed that the Department of Licensing was routinely giving out data to immigration agents directly by email. Then Gov. Jay Inslee halted the practice.

But immigration agents remained able to access data through computerized systems, including one controlled by the licensing department. A King 5 investigation led the state in August to revoke U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement access to that system. That still left Nlets as a point of access.

Advertising

Dozens of Democratic elected officials, including U.S. Senator Ron Wyden from Oregon, sounded an alarm about immigration enforcement implications of Nlets late last year. Washington officials, in their joint statement, said the state cut off ICE’s access to Nlets on Nov. 19.

But Angelina Snodgrass Godoy, director of the UW center, said she was told in writing last month by a State Patrol spokesperson that ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations division, which investigates criminal activity such as drugs and weapons smuggling, continued to have access to Nlets.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection also has access to the system and conducted eight of the nine queries documented by Godoy’s center. Seven of the nine cases involved civil immigration violations rather than criminal activity, according to the report.

The state is now reviewing CBP’s use of Nlets, according to the officials’ joint statement, which also presented reasons why the agency’s continued access might be important. CBP might, for instance, use Nlets “to find out that the man about to board a plane with a small child is wanted for human trafficking,” the statement said

It added that queries do not reveal the purpose data is sought and therefore objected to suggestions in the UW report that state officials are actively participating in civil immigration enforcement. The statement called parts of a draft report reviewed by state officials “misleading” and “incendiary.”

At a news conference Thursday, Godoy and other immigrant advocates nevertheless presented the state’s role in sharing driver’s license information as a betrayal of public trust and a violation of a 2019 state law that limits most forms of state cooperation with immigration enforcement.

“Washington has long said it is a welcoming state,” said Burien City Councilmember Hugo Garcia, who, like others, pointed out that the state was the first in the country to allow all residents driver’s licenses regardless of immigration status. But faith in the state collapses, he said, “when state systems are used directly or indirectly to aid immigration enforcement.”

Noting he is an immigrant himself and speaking initially in Spanish at the news conference, held the day after an ICE official fatally shot a woman in Minnesota and the same day two people were allegedly shot by federal immigration agents in Portland, Garcia said many immigrants are feeling “fear that something as ordinary as driving to work, taking your kids to schools or picking up groceries, could lead to detention or separation from your family.”

He said he met with one Burien man detailed by immigration enforcement agents while taking his kid to school. The child walked home alone afterwards.

Advocates called for a comprehensive way to end information sharing with immigration officials, rather than partial measures, though how to do so isn’t totally clear.

The UW center’s report looked to New York, which it said has cut off Nlets access to both ICE and CBP. (Washington officials’ statement said New York has only partially stopped CBP access.) But in the news conference, some acknowledged that other federal agencies could also access Nlets and share information with immigration agents.

Under President Donald Trump, many federal agencies have been drafted to work on immigration enforcement. Information about Rocha, the Kirkland theater manager, obtained through public disclosure appears to show the Drug Enforcement Administration conducted one Nlets search, along with others conducted by ICE and CBP.

The UW report also suggested a technical configuration that would limit Nlets searches in Washington to data from enhanced driver’s licenses, which are held only by U.S. citizens.

In their joint statement, Washington officials cited historic challenges to limiting Nlets access, including lawsuits and threats to federal funding. Officials did not respond to an email asking whether those challenges still exist.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01082026_tzr_tzr_135059.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2026-01-08 19:57:38.175171

Previously, state and federal officials had been slated to work together on the investigation into the killing of Renee Nicole Macklin Good, 37, a mother of three who was shot dead in her car on Wednesday.

“The investigation would now be led solely by the FBI, and the BCA would no longer have access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews necessary to complete a thorough and independent investigation,” BCA Superintendent Drew Evans said on Thursday.

“Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands.”

Good’s death has become a political flashpoint in the US, with observers denouncing ICE’s actions as excessive and the administration of President Donald Trump defending the shooting as an act of self-defence.

The decision to exclude state authorities from participating in the investigation has further exacerbated tensions, as Minnesota officials accuse the Trump administration of playing politics with the case.

“Minnesota must be part of this investigation,” Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, told reporters at a Thursday news conference.

He pointed out that the BCA has staff dedicated to investigating use-of-force incidents by law enforcement officers.

“These are nonpartisan, career professionals that have spent years building the trust of the community,” Walz said.

He added that the high-profile nature of the shooting – and the misrepresentations he has seen from the Trump administration – leads him to fear for the outcome of the investigation.

“Now that Minnesota has been taken out of the investigation, it feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome,” Walz said. “And I say that because people in positions of power have already passed judgement, from the president to the vice president to Kristi Noem.”

Noem, the head of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has publicly accused Good of “domestic terrorism” since her death, though there is no definitive evidence to support that claim.

Still, state officials, including Minnesota’s Democratic Attorney General Keith Ellison, have signalled they may continue to pursue charges in the case.

“If federal authorities are saying they won’t even entertain a joint and inclusive investigation, that is deeply disturbing,” Ellison told CNN.

He added that state authorities could still launch their own independent probe, with or without the cooperation of the federal government. “The federal government can’t stop Minnesota from doing its own, but I would hope that it wouldn’t come to that.”

Shooting sparks nationwide outrage

Good’s shooting on Wednesday has drawn renewed scrutiny to the Trump administration’s decision to surge immigration officers to communities across the US – and the clashes that have resulted between protesters and agents.

Since taking office for a second term, Trump, a Republican, has pursued a hardline immigration policy that includes a campaign of mass deportation.

Trump has concentrated many of his immigration enforcement actions on Democrat-led jurisdictions, including Minneapolis, where he has blamed the large Somali American community for a fraud scandal that has roiled the state.

After a series of racist remarks against Somali Americans in December – including calling them “garbage” – his administration announced an uptick in enforcement actions in Minnesota.

Democratic officials have accused the Trump administration of needlessly ratcheting up tensions with its crackdowns.

State and federal officials have offered starkly different accounts of Wednesday’s shooting, in which an unidentified ICE agent shot Good, a US citizen, in a residential neighbourhood.

The ‍ICE agent who shot Good was ⁠among 2,000 federal officers deployed to the Minneapolis area in what the Department of Homeland Security described as the “largest DHS operation ever”.

DHS officials, including Noem, have accused Good of intentionally trying to ram agents.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, called that assertion “bulls***” and “garbage”, pointing to bystander videos that appeared to contradict the government’s account.

Videos appeared to show masked officers approaching Good’s car, which was stopped on a Minneapolis street. Good appeared to be waving for other vehicles to pass her.

As one officer ordered Good out of the car and grabbed at her door handle, the car briefly reversed and then began driving forward, turning to the right in an apparent attempt to leave the scene.

Another officer, who had been filming the scene before walking to the front of Good’s car, drew his gun after the car’s bumper appeared to have passed by his body. He is believed to have fired three times, penetrating the driver’s windows.

Videos circulated online did not appear to show contact between the car and the agents, and the officer stayed on his feet, though Noem said he was taken to a hospital and released.

Trump falsely claimed on social media that the woman “ran over the ICE Officer”.

In a statement to local media, Good’s mother identified her as the shooting victim. According to The Washington Post, Good leaves behind her 15-year-old daughter and two sons, aged 12 and six.

Uproar spreads across country

In the wake of Good’s killing, protesters took to the streets in Minneapolis to condemn the ICE agent’s actions and the wider ICE presence in the city, which has been met with frequent demonstrations.

On Thursday morning, about 1,000 demonstrators gathered at a federal building where an immigration court is housed, chanting “shame” and “murder” at armed and masked federal officers.

At least one protester was detained as federal officers armed with PepperBall guns and tear gas confronted the crowd of demonstrators, according to the AFP news agency.

Governor Walz called for Friday to be a “day of unity” in memory of Good’s death. “While we cannot bring back Renee Nicole Good, we can honour her life by standing together for decency, democracy, compassion and our shared values,” he said.

Protests have taken place and are planned in New York City, Seattle, Detroit, Washington, DC, Los Angeles, San Antonio, New Orleans and Chicago in reaction to the shooting.

Demonstrations are also scheduled in smaller cities in Arizona, North Carolina and New Hampshire later this week.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/afp_695ff7922bac-1767896978.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2026-01-08 21:57:40.038936

Video and eyewitness accounts, which show the woman attempting to flee from ICE as they aggressively attempted to enter her vehicle, contradict the Trump administration’s claims that agents acted in self-defense. The killing has intensified outrage and grief across Minnesota and the nation, as calls grow for accountability and an end to ICE crackdowns that are driving fear and putting communities in danger.

Rev. Paul Brandeis Raushenbush, President and CEO of Interfaith Alliance, released the following statement:

“This shocking killing is another tragic example of ICE’s brutality, and the deadly consequences of the Trump administration’s reckless and authoritarian immigration crackdown. Our hearts are with the victim’s loved ones and the Minneapolis community, as they grieve and respond to this horrific tragedy.

Wednesday’s shooting is the latest example of what happens when an administration makes dehumanization, aggression, and cruelty the foundation of its agenda. The American people don’t want blood on the streets or armed government forces surrounding our homes, schools, and places of worship.

Religious leaders and communities now face a fundamental choice: to choose love, not ICE. Across faith traditions, we are called to protect human dignity, care for the vulnerable, and resist systems that thrive on fear. When the Department of Homeland Security attempts to cloak ICE brutality in divine language, it draws directly from Christian nationalist ideology — one that teaches some human lives matter more than others. It’s an attempt to prime the public to accept violence against those deemed outsiders. People of faith must reject this distortion of religion and refuse to let our faiths be weaponized to serve the authoritarian whims of President Trump.

‍The way forward demands both moral clarity and courageous action. Faith communities must speak out, stand in solidarity with immigrant families, and insist on accountability for this killing and other acts of violent repression. We will continue to take to the streets in peaceful and principled resistance to authoritarian abuse. Choosing love over ICE is not just a slogan — it is a moral stance rooted in the belief that safety comes from solidarity, not terror, and that our shared future depends on dignity, compassion, and justice for all.”

Officials within the Trump administration quickly defended the ICE agent's actions as justifiable use of force, after civilian footage taken at the scene seemed to show Renee Good's SUV attempting to drive away from masked ICE agents, one of whom subsequently fired three shots into the driver's window, killing the 37-year-old wife and mother.

During Thursday's White House press conference, Vice President Vance said, ""I don't care what Tim Walz says"" and added that the ICE agent's life was in danger during the incident.

""You have a woman who was trying to obstruct a legitimate law enforcement operation. … You have a woman who aimed her car at a law enforcement officer and pressed on the accelerator,"" Vance said.

At the core of each press conference was a different understanding of the facts.

At the White House, Vance said, ""This is absolutely a tragedy, but it's a tragedy of the making of the far left. They have radicalized a very small segment of the population, taught them that ICE agents are engaging in wide-scale violation of people's rights.""

To get a better understanding of what happened, both men said an investigation would be necessary.

Walz said that Minnesota has the experience required to handle high-profile investigations such as this, pointing to the 2020 murder of George Floyd at the hands of former police officer Derek Chauvin.

""The only way we find the answers is a thorough investigation by nonpartisan professionals,"" Walz said. ""We've delivered that. We've been able to do it.""

The state's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which was initially tapped to conduct a joint investigation with the FBI, released a statement on Thursday stating that the agency had been kicked off the search in favor of allowing the federal government to conduct the operation on its own.

Memories of the chaos that followed the killing of George Floyd

Amid that mounting tension, the Trump administration announced Tuesday that it was sending more than 2,000 federal officers to the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul in what it claimed would be the biggest immigration enforcement operation in history.

READ MORE: What we know so far about the ICE shooting in Minneapolis

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer who killed Renee Good during a protest Wednesday against the immigration raids opened fire just blocks from where, in 2020, a Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd. The parallels were painful and frightening for many in the area, including Stephanie Abel, a 56-year-old Minneapolis nurse, who is keeping her gas tank full and cash handy in memory of the chaos that followed that slaying.

""I thought the federal government would realize that now is not the time to be toying with people,"" Abel said. ""What are they going to try to do to get Minneapolis to ignite?""

Floyd's death sparked the biggest protests of Trump's first term. The president, who is still publicly bitter about the unrest, contends it should have been met with a stronger show of force.

That's the approach Trump has adopted in his second term, trying to cow blue states by surging military and immigration agents into their cities and insisting that anyone who doesn't comply with federal demands will face severe consequences.

Immigration operations that started last summer in liberal strongholds such as Chicago,Los Angeles and Portland also generated large protests. Good is at least the fifth person killed during ICE enforcement efforts.

On Thursday, Vice President JD Vance said Good's death was ""a tragedy of her own making,"" blamed ""leftist ideology"" and said the media had encouraged protests against Trump's immigration crackdown.

Federal investigators have Somalis in their sights

Watch the segment in the player above.

The Twin Cities operation is intertwined with a conservative effort to make Minnesota the poster child for government fraud. Though prosecutions for the fraudulent use of hundreds of millions of dollars of federal COVID-19 and health aid by social service groups began in the Biden administration, Trump and conservatives have seized on the scandal in recent weeks.

In November, Trump called Minnesota ""a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity"" after a report by a conservative news site, City Journal, claimed federal money was fraudulently flowing to the militant group al-Shabab. There has been little, if any, evidence, proving such a link. Nevertheless, the president said he would end Temporary Protected Status for Somalis in Minnesota.

The allegations got a new charge late last month when conservative influencer Nick Shirley posted an unconfirmed video claiming that day care centers in Minneapolis run by Somalis had fraudulently collected over $100 million in government aid.

Jamal Osman, a Somali immigrant and Minneapolis city councilman who lives just a few blocks from the location of the ICE shooting, said he and other prominent Somalis in the area have been swamped with angry calls and messages since Trump made his statements. The vitriol, he said, mainly comes from out of state.

""We have whole groups of people who've never been to Minnesota,"" Osman said in an interview. ""Minnesota is probably one of the nicest places to live. It's a beautiful area with very nice people and we blended in, it's all very nice. We don't really see bad things happening here normally.""

The Trump administration on Tuesday said is withholding funding for programs that support needy families with children, including day care funding, in five Democratic-led states over concerns about fraud. Joining Minnesota on the list were California, Colorado, Illinois and New York.

'Leave our state alone'

Watch the video in the player above.

Minnesota's place on a list of targeted blue states is not unexpected.

Under Walz, Minnesota has become something of a beacon for liberals as an example of a state that expanded the public safety net even as the nation swung to the right. Since Trump's first election, the state has seen large increases in education spending, free school breakfasts and lunches, and improved protection of abortion rights.

Trump lost Minnesota by only 4 percentage points in 2024, making it significantly less liberal than California and New York. Still, it has been reliably Democratic throughout the Trump years, a rarity in the swingy upper Midwest.

The state's political tilt reflects the size of the Twin Cities metro area and its robust population of college-educated liberals, which overwhelm the state's more conservative rural reaches.

It's the sort of cleavage that has defined national politics during Trump's years in office.

""Minnesota is a microcosm of a lot of the tensions we have in our society,"" said David Schultz, a political scientist at Hamline University in St. Paul. ""We're a country that's hugely polarized, Democrats-Republicans, urban-rural.""

On Thursday, Minnesota was an ominous indicator of the damage those divisions can inflict. Minneapolis schools remained closed after immigration agents clashed with high school students at one campus on Wednesday. The state's National Guard remained on standby at Walz's directive.

Walz begged Trump to ease up, saying Minnesota's residents are ""exhausted"" by the president's ""relentless assault on Minnesota.""

""So please, just give us a break,"" Walz said during a news conference Thursday. ""And if it's me, you're already getting what you want, but leave my people alone. Leave our state alone.""

Under Trump’s crackdown, immigration officers have been connected to 14 shootings, according to data compiled by the Trace, a non-profit newsroom focused on gun violence in the US. As of 7 January, it identified 28 incidents overall, including the 14 shootings. Since July, when the first shooting occurred under the administration, immigration agents have killed four people and injured five more.

The NYC Jail Holding Maduro Has a History of Big Names and Dangerous Conditions

Nicolás Maduro is being held in a New York City jail notorious for its high-profile inmates and dangerous conditions. The Metropolitan Detention Center, or MDC, a federal jail in Brooklyn, has struggled with issues of overcrowding, violence, medical neglect and inmate deaths in recent years — prompting several judges to refuse to send people there. One judge said he would vacate a 75-year-old’s tax fraud charges and place him under house arrest rather than send him to MDC, citing “inhumane treatment” at the facility. The other ordered a man convicted in a drug case to remain free until sentencing rather than wait in that particular facility.

“And I expect that to continue to happen, as we are seeing in Minneapolis right now.” jmeisner@chicagotribune.com","A federal judge in Chicago on Thursday cited the fatal shooting of a U.S. citizen by an immigration agent in Minneapolis in declining to immediately dismiss a lawsuit that led to her landmark injunction limiting the use of force by immigration agents during Operation Midway Blitz.

In pressing the pause button, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis told the parties in court she still had concerns over her obligation to protect the class of journalists, clergy and other protesters certified in the lawsuit, noting “if I dismiss this case the preliminary injunction ceases to exist.”

“And it doesn’t give me much comfort in reading news reports that someone … who was described as a legal observer was shot yesterday in Minneapolis,” Ellis told the parties in an afternoon hearing. “So that is my concern.”

Ellis said that “given recent events,” she wants to do a little more digging on the law before making a final decision. She set the next hearing for Jan. 22.

After the hearing, lawyers for the plaintiffs said they had no concerns about the judge’s move, and said they were prepared to bring new litigation should there be a future surge in immigration enforcement here that violates the civil rights of citizens to observe and protest.

“We stand ready to do whatever is necessary to stop President Trump, to stop (Department of Homeland Security Secretary) Kristi Noem, to stop (Border Patrol chief Gregory) Bovino, and their agents from violating the most sacred rights of the people of Chicago,” said Craig Futterman, an attorney for the Mandel Legal Aid Clinic.

Futterman also spoke emotionally about Wednesday’s fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good, a mother who had been out recording immigration operations in Minneapolis when she was shot by an officer while seemingly trying to pull away in her vehicle.

He said the Trump administration’s claims that Good tried to run over the officer before he opened fire have been easily debunked only because “ordinary citizens had the courage to videotape what happened.”

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately return messages seeking comment Thursday.

The case brought by the Chicago Headline Club and other media groups led to a sweeping preliminary injunction by Ellis in November limiting the use of tear gas and other chemical munitions against the media and protesters and also requiring agents to wear body cameras and clear identification.

The plaintiffs moved to drop the suit last month, however, following ominous signs from the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, which called Ellis’ order overbroad and a potential infringement on the separation of powers.

In the request, the plaintiffs claimed victory, saying Bovino and his surge of agents left town soon after Ellis’ injunction was entered on Nov. 8 and that there had been no reports of any unconstitutional behavior by agents in nearly a month.

But an attorney for the Trump administration said in a hearing Dec. 4 that, contrary to media reports, Operation Midway Blitz has not ended and that the administration of President Donald Trump continues to carry out “lawful” immigration enforcement — though she declined to say when or if another surge in Border Patrol agents would hit the city.

Department of Justice attorney Elizabeth Hedges also claimed the dismissal of the lawsuit would bar journalists and protesters from bringing similar claims of constitutional violations in the future — an argument that was immediately called out by Ellis and plaintiffs’ attorneys as a misstatement of the law.

“While it was the government’s position that no agent did anything illegal or unconstitutional, having watched the videos, and having read the reports, and having listened to the witnesses, I strongly disagree,” Ellis said.

Because the lawsuit involved a certified class of plaintiffs, Ellis set a deadline of Thursday for any class members to object to it. None has come forward, the plaintiffs’ attorneys told the judge in court.

Meanwhile, lawyers for the Tribune and other media outlets on Thursday won the release of reams of other evidence that was submitted to the judge for consideration in the case, including use-of-force reports and more footage of incidents around the city.

Department of Justice attorney Andrew Warden, who had objected to the release, said the batch of body-cam videos, which includes footage from up until the judge’s written injunction ruling on Nov. 21, is four times larger than what had previously been released and totals at least 400 hours.

Ellis granted the government time to review the footage and make necessary redactions before it is made public on a “rolling basis” over the next four months.

The judge also agreed to unseal a transcript of testimony given in October by Department of Justice attorney Sean Skedzielewski, which was done in a closed courtroom after the government claimed there were national security concerns.

If Ellis ultimately agrees to dismiss the suit, it will end a case that came to symbolize the havoc Midway Blitz caused in Chicago and shed light on how the operation was carried out, through sworn depositions by Bovino and other leaders as well as the release of body-camera footage showing agents deploying tear gas, pointing guns from passing cars and tackling civilians on the street.

Ellis had tentatively set a hearing on permanent injunction for March.

The 7th Circuit later granted an emergency stay of Ellis’ injunctive relief pending appeal, a process that will also be shelved once the dismissal is approved.

Since then, Bovino and a contingent of Border Patrol agents have already returned once to Chicago, in the form of a seemingly made-for-television jaunt shortly before Christmas. Agents made several arrests in supermarket parking lots and tamale stands while goading angry residents who confronted them and threatening to unleash tear gas.

As recently as Dec. 30, Bovino posted on social media: “If you think we’re done with Chicago, you’d better check yourself before you wreck yourself.”

On Wednesday, meanwhile, Bovino was spotted in Minneapolis where more than 2,000 immigration agents were carrying out an enforcement action there that immediately exploded in controversy with the shooting of Good, 37, a mother of three who’d recently moved to Minnesota.

The New York Times reported Thursday that the Department of Homeland Security had temporarily abandoned a planned immigration enforcement surge in Chicago and ordered agents to report to Minneapolis for support as protests mounted.

Speaking to reporters after Thursday’s hearing, plaintiffs’ attorney Steve Art said the decision to dismiss the Chicago Headline Club suit made strategic sense, given both the 7th Circuit’s stay and the fact that, for now, the Trump administration’s ongoing immigration push has turned its sights elsewhere.

“If they come back and the situation on the ground changes, then we will have the grounds to file another lawsuit,” Art said.

Art also drew direct parallels to the litigation in Chicago and the tragedy currently unfolding in Minnesota.

“What this case has shown is that citizens on the street and the press can very quickly reveal whether or not the federal government is telling the truth when it engages with civilians in different jurisdictions,” Art said. “And I expect that to continue to happen, as we are seeing in Minneapolis right now.”

Shooting prompts local outrage Local residents took to the streets Wednesday and Thursday to protest the shooting and ICE's presence.","A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a 37-year-old woman Wednesday morning during an operation in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and President Trump described the shooting as self-defense, but the mayor and governor disputed that, citing videos from the scene.

The shooting comes as the Trump administration has deployed about 2,000 federal immigration and investigative agents to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area as part of a crackdown on the state's fraud scandal and immigration.

Here's more of what we've learned about the shooting so far.

Woman who was shot, Renee Good, was a 37-year-old U.S. citizen

The city of Minneapolis said police responded to a call reporting a shooting at about 9:30 a.m. local time in a south Minneapolis neighborhood and found that a woman in a vehicle had been shot in the head.

Minneapolis firefighters rushed the woman to Hennepin County Medical Center, where she died, the city said.

The woman who was killed was identified as 37-year-old Renee Good, a mother of three who had recently moved to the area with her partner and 6-year-old son.

Her ex-husband told The Associated Press that Good had just dropped the child off at school and was driving home with her partner when she encountered the ICE agents.

She was a U.S. citizen, federal sources confirmed to CBS News. Minnesota city leaders said Good was a legal observer of federal actions in the city and wasn't a target for an ICE-related arrest.

She grew up in Colorado Springs as one of five children, her father, Timothy Granger, told ""CBS Evening News"" anchor Tony Dokoupil. He said she had recently moved to Minneapolis to restart her life after what he described as an awful stretch following the sudden death of her second husband.

He described her as warm, witty, and with a bubbly personality, and as someone who always cared deeply about other people.

CBS affiliate KCTV in Kansas City spoke to a former neighbor who knew Good when she lived there until 2024. She said Good lived there with her partner, their young son and their dogs, and had two older children who visited routinely. She said she didn't know the family well but called them ""lovely neighbors.""

Good graduated from Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, in December 2020 with an English degree, the school said.

Feds say she was shot during ""targeted operations"" by ICE

Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, said in a statement that the shooting occurred while ICE officers were conducting ""targeted operations.""

McLaughlin described the woman who was killed as one of several ""violent rioters"" who were ""blocking"" ICE officers.

According to McLaughlin, the woman ""weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them.""

An ICE officer, ""fearing for his life,"" then ""fired defensive shots,"" McLaughlin said.

In a news conference following the shooting, Noem described the driver's actions as an ""act of domestic terrorism.""

Noem alleged the ICE officers had gotten stuck in snow and ""were attempting to push out their vehicle"" when ""a woman attacked them and those surrounding them and attempted to run them over and ram them with her vehicle.""

In a post on Truth Social, also claiming that the shooting was self-defense, Mr. Trump alleged that the woman ""viciously ran over the ICE Officer"" before being shot. However, a video clip from a local newscast that Mr. Trump attached to the post showed no sign that an officer had been run over.

Video, witness accounts and local and state officials challenge federal claims

Statements from witnesses and local officials, who point to several videos of the encounter, dispute the accounts from federal officials of the circumstances that led up to the shooting.

In a fiery news conference, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey contested McLaughlin's narrative that the shooting was an act of self-defense, calling the federal government's account ""bull****.""

""Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly: that is bulls***,"" Frey said. ""This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.""

In another news conference, Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he had seen the video as well and also challenged the account of self-defense.

""Don't believe this propaganda machine,"" Walz said. ""The state will ensure there is a full, fair and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.""

One video taken by a man at the scene and provided to CBS Minnesota shows the woman in a maroon Honda Pilot SUV blocking the street with her car. An ICE agent walks behind the car and circles around to the passenger side of the vehicle.

In another angle, she can be seen apparently attempting to wave someone to go around her before two agents then park their silver pickup truck and get out, walking towards the Honda's driver-side door.

In that video, one of the officers from the pickup truck can be heard telling the woman to ""get out of the f****** car"" as he approaches. He reaches for the Honda's door handle and the car starts moving in reverse. As the Honda is reversing, another agent moves in front of the vehicle from the opposite side. The Honda then starts to move forward, and the agent in front of the vehicle draws his weapon and fires into the Honda.

That agent then moves to the side of the car, although it's unclear if he was hit or not, and fires two more shots as the car continues moving forward.

The videos show the SUV driving off a bit further before crashing into another car down the street.

Multiple witnesses reaffirmed what was seen in the videos and told CBS Minnesota that whistles had sounded to alert neighbors of ICE's presence at about 9:30 a.m.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said the FBI and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension are jointly investigating the shooting.

ICE officer part of specially trained tactical unit

A senior DHS official confirmed to CBS News that the agent who opened fire was a member of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) Special Response Team — a specially trained tactical unit within ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations.

Noem said the officer was taken to the hospital after the shooting and has since been released.

""The very same officer who was attacked today had previously been dragged by an anti-ICE rioter who had rammed him with a car and drug him with a car back in June,"" Noem said. ""He sustained injuries at that time as well.""

According to court records and the suspect's defense attorney from that June 17, 2025 incident, the agent's name is Jonathan Ross.

During that June incident, immigration officers in St. Paul were attempting to arrest a 39-year-old man previously convicted of sexually assaulting a minor, according to a senior DHS official.

According to the official, the suspect refused to roll his window down or get out of his car, so the officer broke a rear window and reached inside the car to unlock the door. At that point, the suspect drove off, dragging the officer approximately 100 yards with his arm inside the car. The suspect was accelerating and weaving to try to shake the officer off. The officer twice fired a Taser in an unsuccessful attempt to stop him. He was eventually knocked free of the vehicle, and suffered significant lacerations that required 33 stitches, the official said. The suspect was later federally charged with assaulting a federal officer with a dangerous weapon.

Court records show Ross has been working with ICE in Minnesota since at least 2017.

Will the officer face charges or discipline?

It was unclear if the officer would face any charges or discipline at the early stages of the investigation. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, however, criticized the Trump administration for allegedly cutting state investigators out of the process.

""The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, the BCA, spent the day yesterday trying to get that accountability. We have learned that the Trump administration has now denied the state that ability to participate in the investigation,"" Walz said at a Thursday news conference.

""It feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome,"" he said of that decision, accusing Mr. Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Noem of making statements about the incident that are ""verifiably false.""

The BCA said in a statement it was initially invited to participate in the investigation but that the FBI later said it would be the sole lead and ""the BCA would no longer have access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews necessary to complete a thorough and independent investigation.""

""Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands. As a result, the BCA has reluctantly withdrawn from the investigation,"" the agency said.

Noem, however, said Thursday, ""They have not been cut out. They don't have any jurisdiction in this investigation.""

""This is an experienced officer who followed his training, and we will continue to let the investigation unfold into the individual and continue to follow the procedures and policies that happen in these use of force cases,"" she added.

Shooting prompts local outrage

Local residents took to the streets Wednesday and Thursday to protest the shooting and ICE's presence. Many attended a vigil for Good, creating an impromptu memorial where the shooting occurred. Local officials implored those demonstrating to remain peaceful.

In his news conference Wednesday, Frey had a blunt message to federal immigration officers, ""get the f*** out of Minneapolis.""

""They are not here to cause safety in this city. What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,"" the mayor said.

About 1,500 ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations agents and 650 Homeland Security Investigations agents have been deployed to the Twin Cities in recent weeks, CBS News has learned, an increase 15 times the normal ICE presence in the region.

Walz in his Wednesday news conference said the state ""doesn't need any further help from the federal government.""

""To Donald Trump and Kristi Noem, you've done enough,"" Walz said.

The governor also directed the Minnesota National Guard to prepare in the event that it was need to assist state and local authorities amid the fallout from the shooting.

Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota said in a statement that ""ICE must stop terrorizing our communities.""

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Mr. Trump's decision to send thousands of federal agents to Minnesota is ""causing serious harm and spreading terror"" through the community.

Minneapolis Public Schools announced late Wednesday that, ""out of an abundance of caution,"" classes would be canceled districtwide for all schools both Thursday and Friday ""due to safety concerns related to today's incidents around the city."" All after-school activities and athletics would be canceled as well.

Walz on Thursday demanded federal agents ""stay out of our schools.""",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/07/faf641b7-1814-40d6-b269-7db7e842ee69/thumbnail/1200x630/2db65e0b0cf9f188c4ff80a7223fda0a/gettyimages-2254518279.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 18:59:36.410166

“They killed my wife. I don’t know what to do,” the woman says through sobs in the footage, with a damaged SUV visible in the distance behind her. ""We stopped to videotape, and they shot her in the head,” the woman cries.

“We have a 6-year-old at school,” she says, almost unable to breathe, as a chaotic scene in which federal officers prevented at least one doctor who was on the scene from assisting the shot victim unfolds. “We’re new here,” the distraught woman says in despair.

The video emerged hours after Good was fatally shot Wednesday morning near East 34th Street and Portland Avenue during what the Department of Homeland Security has described as its largest immigration enforcement surge ever in Minnesota. Roughly 2,000 federal agents have been deployed across the state as part of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown.

Good was identified late Wednesday by her mother, Donna Ganger, who told The Minnesota Star Tribune that her daughter lived in the Twin Cities with her partner and was not involved in protests or any activity confronting ICE agents. Ganger said her family was notified of the death late Wednesday morning.

“She was probably terrified,” Ganger told the paper. “Renee was one of the kindest people I’ve ever known. She was extremely compassionate. She’s taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.”

Good was previously married a man named Timmy Ray Mackin, who died in 2023 at age 36, and had her son with him, according to the Star Tribune.

DHS has said that “rioters began blocking ICE officers” during what it called “targeted operations,” alleging that one person “weaponized” a vehicle, prompting an agent to fire what the agency described as “defensive shots.” The department characterized the killing as an act of self-defense and labeled the incident “domestic terrorism.”

But multiple videos circulating online appear to tell a different story. Separate footage shows a dark SUV attempting to drive away from the scene when three shots ring out, sending bystanders into panic. Moments later, the vehicle crashes into a light pole and parked cars as people scream and rush toward the wreckage. Authorities have not publicly reconciled those images with DHS’s account.

In another video, a person wearing the same outfit as the distraught woman can be seen leaning over a bloodied body in the driver’s seat of the SUV.

Late Wednesday afternoon, President Donald Trump weighed in on his social media site, Truth Social, claiming he had “just viewed the clip” and asserting that the woman filming was “obviously, a professional agitator” and that the driver had “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer,” calling the shooting an act of self-defense and blaming what he described as a “Radical Left Movement of Violence and Hate.”

Condemnation has grown from civil rights and advocacy groups nationwide.

Human Rights Campaign President Kelley Robinson grieved with the Minneapolis community in a statement to The Advocate.

""Today, a woman was senselessly killed in Minneapolis during an ICE action — a brutal reminder that this agency and the Trump regime put every community at risk, spreading fear instead of safety,"" Robinson said. ""Reports that she may have been part of the LGBTQ+ community underscore how often the most vulnerable pay the highest price. Her family and the people of Minneapolis deserve a full investigation, real accountability, and decisive action. And we must remove ICE and their terror from all our communities before even more preventable violence occurs. As Governor Walz requested, we join the nation in standing with Minneapolis.”

Los Angeles LGBT Center CEO Joe Hollendoner also released the a statement, saying, ""The fatal shooting of Renee Good — an LGBTQ+ United States citizen exercising her right to protest ICE activity in Minneapolis—is a horrifying and senseless loss of life. Renee’s death lays bare the dangerous reality of an agency that continues to operate with impunity, fueled by a Trump administration that has normalized violence, cruelty, and the erosion of basic human rights. This is now the fifth known killing linked to ICE agents amid an aggressive escalation of raids and abuses. These are not isolated incidents — they are the predictable and devastating consequences of a federal agenda that treats immigrant communities, and those who stand in solidarity with them, as expendable.""

Amnesty International accused the Trump administration of “unnecessary lethal force,” of misrepresenting the circumstances, and of using militarized immigration crackdowns that have made communities unsafe.

Common Defense Executive Director Jose Vasquez said ICE’s “uninvited presence in Minneapolis is not only destabilizing, it is dangerous and deeply unjust,” calling the killing “heartbreaking and unforgivable.” He said the shooting reflects an “unnecessary escalation” and demanded ICE leave Minneapolis immediately.

Local leaders also pushed back forcefully. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey told reporters, “To ICE, get the fuck out of Minneapolis. We do not want you here,” while Gov. Tim Walz said the state would ensure a “full, fair, and expeditious investigation.”

Minnesota State Rep. Leigh Finke, the state’s first out transgender legislator, said the killing left her “heartbroken” and warned that the federal immigration surge had created the conditions for violence long before Wednesday’s shooting.

“My reaction is one of great sadness,” Finke told The Advocate. “For those of us here in Minnesota who’ve been seeing what these federal agents — ICE, CBP, others — have been doing and how they’ve been treating our communities and our neighbors, something like this felt very possible. But we’ve just had so many tragedies here. Waking up to this news was heartbreaking. It’s terrible. It’s one too many of these things.”

Finke said the sudden influx of roughly 2,000 federal agents announced earlier this week created an inherently volatile situation.

“That kind of influx of law enforcement, often untrained young people coming in with a mandate to kidnap neighbors and abduct people and deport them, violence is the only way that something like that can go at some point or another,” she said, adding that what happened to Good was “devastating” and “the kind of violence being bred by our federal government.”

Finke also called for accountability, saying state law enforcement must “arrest the killer and prosecute that person to the fullest extent of the law,” even as legislative options are constrained by Minnesota’s divided legislature.

And in a message to Minnesotans shaken by the shooting, Finke urged solidarity, noting that immigrant, transgender, and LGBTQ+ communities are bearing the brunt of the federal crackdown.

“We all need to remember that we are in this together,” she said. “We are going to continue to fight for it. We are going to stand up nonviolently with peace and love and fight for our communities no matter what.”

The Advocate has contacted Walz and Minneapolis city officials, including Frey and the police department, for comment.

Wednesday evening, hundreds of protesters gathered in Good's neighborhood for a vigil and march. “She was peaceful, she did the right thing,” Jaylani Hussein, the executive director of CAIR-MN, said at the event, the Star Tribune reports. “She died because she loved her neighbors.”

Another speaker at the event, identified only as Noah, denounced those who called Good a domestic terrorist. Instead, he said, Good was watching the terrorists.

Moments later, the vehicle crashes into a light pole and parked cars as people scream and rush toward the wreckage. Authorities have not publicly reconciled those images with DHS’s account.

In another video, a person wearing the same outfit as the distraught woman can be seen leaning over a bloodied body in the driver’s seat of the SUV.

Late Wednesday afternoon, President Donald Trump weighed in on his social media site, Truth Social, claiming he had “just viewed the clip” and asserting that the woman filming was “obviously, a professional agitator” and that the driver had “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer,” calling the shooting an act of self-defense and blaming what he described as a “Radical Left Movement of Violence and Hate.”

Condemnation has grown from civil rights and advocacy groups nationwide.

Human Rights Campaign President Kelley Robinson grieved with the Minneapolis community in a statement to The Advocate.

""Today, a woman was senselessly killed in Minneapolis during an ICE action — a brutal reminder that this agency and the Trump regime put every community at risk, spreading fear instead of safety,"" Robinson said. ""Reports that she may have been part of the LGBTQ+ community underscore how often the most vulnerable pay the highest price. Her family and the people of Minneapolis deserve a full investigation, real accountability, and decisive action. And we must remove ICE and their terror from all our communities before even more preventable violence occurs. As Governor Walz requested, we join the nation in standing with Minneapolis.”

Los Angeles LGBT Center CEO Joe Hollendoner also released the a statement, saying, ""The fatal shooting of Renee Good — an LGBTQ+ United States citizen exercising her right to protest ICE activity in Minneapolis—is a horrifying and senseless loss of life. Renee’s death lays bare the dangerous reality of an agency that continues to operate with impunity, fueled by a Trump administration that has normalized violence, cruelty, and the erosion of basic human rights. This is now the fifth known killing linked to ICE agents amid an aggressive escalation of raids and abuses. These are not isolated incidents — they are the predictable and devastating consequences of a federal agenda that treats immigrant communities, and those who stand in solidarity with them, as expendable.""

Amnesty International accused the Trump administration of “unnecessary lethal force,” of misrepresenting the circumstances, and of using militarized immigration crackdowns that have made communities unsafe.

Common Defense Executive Director Jose Vasquez said ICE’s “uninvited presence in Minneapolis is not only destabilizing, it is dangerous and deeply unjust,” calling the killing “heartbreaking and unforgivable.” He said the shooting reflects an “unnecessary escalation” and demanded ICE leave Minneapolis immediately.

Local leaders also pushed back forcefully. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey told reporters, “To ICE, get the fuck out of Minneapolis. We do not want you here,” while Gov. Tim Walz said the state would ensure a “full, fair, and expeditious investigation.”

Minnesota State Rep. Leigh Finke, the state’s first out transgender legislator, said the killing left her “heartbroken” and warned that the federal immigration surge had created the conditions for violence long before Wednesday’s shooting.

“My reaction is one of great sadness,” Finke told The Advocate. “For those of us here in Minnesota who’ve been seeing what these federal agents — ICE, CBP, others — have been doing and how they’ve been treating our communities and our neighbors, something like this felt very possible. But we’ve just had so many tragedies here. Waking up to this news was heartbreaking. It’s terrible. It’s one too many of these things.”

Finke said the sudden influx of roughly 2,000 federal agents announced earlier this week created an inherently volatile situation.

“That kind of influx of law enforcement, often untrained young people coming in with a mandate to kidnap neighbors and abduct people and deport them, violence is the only way that something like that can go at some point or another,” she said, adding that what happened to Good was “devastating” and “the kind of violence being bred by our federal government.”

Finke also called for accountability, saying state law enforcement must “arrest the killer and prosecute that person to the fullest extent of the law,” even as legislative options are constrained by Minnesota’s divided legislature.

And in a message to Minnesotans shaken by the shooting, Finke urged solidarity, noting that immigrant, transgender, and LGBTQ+ communities are bearing the brunt of the federal crackdown.

“We all need to remember that we are in this together,” she said. “We are going to continue to fight for it. We are going to stand up nonviolently with peace and love and fight for our communities no matter what.”

The Advocate has contacted Walz and Minneapolis city officials, including Frey and the police department, for comment.

Wednesday evening, hundreds of protesters gathered in Good's neighborhood for a vigil and march. “She was peaceful, she did the right thing,” Jaylani Hussein, the executive director of CAIR-MN, said at the event, the Star Tribune reports. “She died because she loved her neighbors.”

Another speaker at the event, identified only as Noah, denounced those who called Good a domestic terrorist. Instead, he said, Good was watching the terrorists.

The center expected to receive records Thursday on other arrests tied to the state data.","Despite vows to restrict immigration authorities’ access to Washington state Department of Licensing information, the data sharing continued in a new form, researchers revealed Thursday.

The University of Washington Center for Human Rights reports that federal immigration agents searched Department of Licensing data before stopping drivers at least nine times between August and November.

State officials say they cut off U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement access to this data in mid-November.

In a joint statement, the licensing department and Washington State Patrol said Gov. Bob Ferguson “stands prepared to take further action” in the face of the Trump administration’s escalating immigration enforcement tactics.

“But he will do so with reason and care,” the agencies said. “Governor Ferguson is committed to complying with applicable laws and finding the right balance in protecting individuals’ data without compromising legitimate law-enforcement investigations of criminal acts that are necessary to preserve public safety.”

The researchers say U.S. Customs and Border Protection still has access to the data, but the state argues that’s necessary for the agency’s work at the Canadian border and airports.

The state’s Keep Washington Working Act, passed in 2019, prevents state data from being shared with federal authorities for civil immigration purposes. Washington is one of 19 states that offer driver’s licenses regardless of immigration status.

Concerns over federal access to this state data date back to at least 2018. But the worries have ramped up in the past year as President Donald Trump has pushed for drastic increases in immigration enforcement and deportations. The Trump administration has focused on accessing various troves of state data to apparently fuel its immigration operations.

Over the summer, KING 5 revealed continued data sharing through the Department of Licensing’s driver and plate database, known as DAPS. The investigation found hundreds of searches of Washington records after Trump retook office, prompting outcries from immigration advocates.

After this, state officials announced they’d stop ICE from accessing Washington’s driver license data through this avenue.

Malou Chávez, executive director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, said it’s “clear that there are cracks in systems here in Washington state that need fixing to truly protect our communities.”

“Washington, as a welcoming state, cannot and should not aid the federal government in its goal of mass detention, mass deportation by providing access to information, allowing our data to be used for civil immigration enforcement when we have laws specifically prohibiting this from happening,” she told reporters.

How it works

The form of data sharing revealed Thursday forces federal agencies to use a different route than the one that drew scrutiny last year.

It’s facilitated by a nonprofit that police agencies use to share driver’s license data across states. This allows them to easily search through a platform known as Nlets for information on drivers from out of state that officers pull over.

A Washington State Patrol platform called ACCESS allows users into the state’s data held by Nlets. The Department of Licensing data shared through this platform includes drivers’ license numbers and photos, home addresses and vehicles’ registered owners, according to the UW researchers.

So, for example, agents could stake out a business, run the license plates of all the cars parked there to get the owners’ names, then look up their immigration statuses and arrest them.

The UW center’s report includes instances where the licensing department information has been used.

In one case in November, ICE agents saw a Washington resident in Oregon leaving a Latino grocer. They ran his license plate through the Washington State Patrol system, then searched his name through their own database and found he wasn’t authorized to be in the country, according to the report.

Federal authorities pulled over his vehicle and arrested him, according to researchers.

“These folks are real Washingtonians who have been affected,” said Angelina Godoy, director of the UW Center for Human Rights. “They are people with lives and families and communities and rights, and they have been harmed by the fact that the DOL allows these agencies to access its data for civil and not criminal immigration enforcement.”

Call for action

In November, Democrats in Congress alerted many states that they were unknowingly sharing information with ICE.

In letters to the states’ governors, they noted Washington, along with Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota and New York, had blocked ICE access to their driver’s license data. They wrote that Washington made the move after “engaging with Congressional Democrats.”

Washington state officials said “thousands of attempted queries from ICE have been denied” since shutting off access to Nlets data on Nov. 19.

But this still leaves the door open for U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Homeland Security Investigations, an ICE subagency, to continue searching Washington’s data, the UW researchers believe.

Customs and Border Protection conducted the data searches in eight of the nine arrests the center documented. Almost all of the arrests were for civil immigration enforcement, not criminal matters. Though when searching the data, the federal agencies don’t need to note if it’s for a criminal or civil investigation.

“The state is granting them that access on the good faith assumption that they’re only going to use it for criminal investigations, and the data that we’ve presented here shows that that is not the case,” Godoy said. “They are using it in ways that are contrary to state law.”

The researchers called on the state to block all federal immigration authorities from accessing Washington’s Nlets data.

“We are reviewing CBP’s use of Nlets, what actions other states have taken, and are looking at all options to protect Washingtonians while also protecting public safety,” reads the statement from the Department of Licensing and state patrol.

In an executive order in September, Ferguson ordered state agencies to “continue to review their data collection, sharing, and retention policies to ensure they are treating the protection of residents’ personal and private information as a matter of public interest and safety.”

The letters to governors, led by Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, said that in the year preceding Oct. 1, federal immigration authorities searched driver’s license databases roughly 900,000 times across the country.

The center expected to receive records Thursday on other arrests tied to the state data. Godoy said the nine cases documented so far “likely represent the tip of the iceberg.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ice-officer-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 17:59:55.512369

The data was gathered by the University of Washington Center for Human Rights (UWCHR).

The nine cases in the report were Washington drivers who were subjected to immigration enforcement while driving, following a search of their license plate number in the Washington Department of Licensing (DOL)’s database by federal agents. These agents used a national data-sharing platform called Nlets, made possible through the Washington State Patrol (WSP)’s ACCESS platform, according to UWCHR.

""In at least seven of these cases, UWCHR researchers were able to confirm that the arrests were acts of civil immigration enforcement,"" the UWCHR report said.

""While state authorities now claim to have curtailed access by one of ICE’s sub-agencies to DOL data via ACCESS, in eight of the nine confirmed cases discussed in this report, it was CBP, not ICE, who conducted the query. There is therefore no reason to believe that this process does not continue to date,"" the report continued.

DOL and WSP jointly submitted feedback in response to the draft report, shared with the Governor’s Office last Friday, according to the statement.

""ICE access to Nlets was shut off on November 19,"" the joint statement said.

The Governor’s Office directed WSP and DOL to shut off ICE’s access to DOL data through Nlets as early as Nov 7, 2025, the statement further claimed.

However, it took longer than anticipated for WSP’s data vendor to implement that change, and ICE’s access to Nlets was finally blocked on the morning of Nov. 19.

WSP confirmed that since shutting off ICE access to DOL data through Nlets, thousands of attempted queries from ICE have been denied.

TIMELINE OF IMMIGRATION ARRESTS, CASES IN THE REPORT

The first of the nine confirmed cases the report covers occurred on Aug. 22, 2025.

ICE records show that ICE ERO, ICE HSI, and USBP officers went to a residential address in Edmonds to look for a person they believed to be undocumented.

In the second case, the arrest occurred on Sept. 20, 2025. ICE records show that agents observed a truck and, according to the documents, “Seattle ERO conducted a registration query on a 2103 Ford F-150 with Washington license plate number XXXXXXX.""

In the fourth documented case, the arrest occurred on Oct 4, 2025. ICE records state that an arrest team located a vehicle, and agents conducted a registration query using the car’s license plate, obtaining the registered owner’s name.

The last arrest was reported on Nov. 16, 2025. A Washington resident was in Gresham, Oregon, for work, and had just left a Latino grocery store when ICE officers spotted him.

From Jan. 1, 2025, to Nov. 30, 2025, federal agencies used ACCESS/Nlets to query WA DOL data a total of 2,671,776 times, according to data provided by DOL to UWCHR.

The number represents the use of Washington resources to conduct civil immigration enforcement; the figure includes the verification of documents at U.S.-Canadian border crossings and many other lawful purposes, the report said.

The cases verified by UWCHR researchers likely form part of a much broader pattern of federal agents tapping into WA DOL data to target Washingtonians for arrest for civil immigration violations.

COMMUNITY CONCERNS

The sharing platform, called Nlets, is different than Flock camera systems.

""It's not Flock focused, but it's looking at the data sharing system Nlets and ongoing WA Dept of Licensing - ICE/CBP data sharing, allowing federal immigration enforcement to obtain WA driver data to assist them in immigration arrests,"" a UWCHR researcher said.

Due to increased community concerns about data collection, access, and privacy protections, several cities across western Washington decided to deactivate their FLOCK cameras late last year.

In October 2025, the City of Auburn announced that any agency found using Auburn's Flock data for immigration enforcement will have its access permanently revoked.

""The types of enforcement we have seen in recent months—warrantless arrests by unidentified masked men driving unmarked vehicles, sometimes accompanied by acts of shocking violence—threaten the civil liberties of all Washingtonians,"" the report said in its recommendations to the state.

“Extremism has led them to offer to bring our country to its knees and compromise our resources,” she added.","Venezuelan interim President Delcy Rodríguez alluded on Wednesday to Donald Trump’s announcement that oil revenues would henceforth be used exclusively to purchase American products, stating that “it is not unusual or irregular that economic relations exist between the United States and Venezuela.” She made these remarks during a meeting at Miraflores Palace with a delegation of members of the new National Assembly, including opposition figures Stalin González and Antonio Ecarri.

According to Rodríguez, “71% of Venezuelan exports go to eight countries and 27% to the United States.” She added there will be no supervised investments because “Venezuela must have economic relations with all countries in the hemisphere,” without specifically mentioning Trump.

The new Venezuelan president referred to the “kidnapping” of Nicolás Maduro as “a stain” that contaminates the relationship between the two countries and asserted that drug trafficking and human rights “were an excuse” for the U.S. intervention, “because the real motive is Venezuelan oil.” On Wednesday, the state-owned oil company PDVSA announced the existence of trade negotiations with the United States, just four days after the capture of the Chavista leader and his wife, Cilia Flores.

However, the official discourse emphasized Venezuela’s commercial sovereignty over third parties: “Energy resources must serve our development and that of other countries around the world,” Rodríguez said. “We are an energy powerhouse. It has brought us tremendous problems because of the energy voracity of the Global North.”

In recent days, the president has issued contradictory rhetoric. While in official statements she has expressed her willingness to work “jointly” with the United States, in speeches such as the one delivered Wednesday she insisted that the opposition’s extremism has led the country to “kneel” before foreign governments.

In that vein, Rodríguez, who until now had not addressed the opposition, stated that “the wound of January 3” was fueled by the opposition’s “fascist” elements. “A parliament at the service of foreign governments cannot be tolerated, nor can fascist social expressions be allowed, as they have been extremely dangerous for the Republic,” she asserted. “Extremism has led them to offer to bring our country to its knees and compromise our resources,” she added. While launching her attacks against the opposition, Rodríguez offered to initiate “a dialogue to heal the wound left in our people [by the U.S. intervention], which was supported and promoted by Venezuelan fascism and extremism.”

Almost simultaneously with the president’s speech, the other strongman of her government, Diosdado Cabello, stated on his program on state television that the number of deaths on the night of January 3 stood at 100, significantly raising the previously known figure of 32 Venezuelan military personnel, 24 Cubans, and two civilian women.

On the same program, Cabello insisted that the U.S. operation had not initially planned to take Cilia Flores, “the first combatant,” as she is known in Chavista rhetoric, but that it was she who, out of loyalty to her husband, said: “If you take him, take me too.” “In this way, she saved his life,” the minister said.",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/VPAF3CZMYNNBXHI4FLQ3AEKFWM.jpg?auth=a276909091cdef282eeccf4b8da71360a8407cc149a3b0f3b2299f87e3d1779a&width=1200,N,,2026-01-08 18:00:06.751335

Democrats had failed to pass several such resolutions in the months that Trump escalated his campaign against Venezuela. But lawmakers argued that now that Trump has captured Maduro and set his sights to other conquests such as Greenland, the vote presents the Republican-controlled Congress with an opportunity.

""It's time for Congress to assert its control over military action of this kind, and it's time to get this out of secrecy and put it in the light,"" said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who forced the vote.

Lawmakers' response to the Venezuela operation

Republican leaders have said they had no advance notification of the raid early morning Saturday to seize Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, but mostly expressed satisfaction this week as top administration officials provided classified briefings on the operation.

The administration has used an evolving set of legal justifications for the monthslong campaign in Central and South America, from destroying alleged drug boats under authorizations for the global fight against terrorism to seizing Maduro in what was ostensibly a law enforcement operation to put him on trial in the United States.

Republican leaders have backed Trump.

""I think the president has demonstrated at least already a very strong commitment to peace through strength, especially in this hemisphere,"" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. ""I think Venezuela got that message loudly and clearly.""

A vote on a similar resolution in November narrowly failed to gain the majority needed for passage. Paul and Murkowski were the only Republicans voting in favor then.

Paul, an outspoken proponent of war powers resolutions, acknowledged that Maduro is seen as a ""bad guy"" and ""a socialist and an autocrat."" But, Paul added, ""The question is about who has the power to take the country to war?""

Some progressive Democrats have suggested inserting language in a defense appropriations bill to limit certain military actions, but that idea met resistance from more pragmatic members of the caucus. Democratic leaders have tried to cast Trump's foreign ambitions as a distraction from the issues that voters face at home.

""The American people are asking what the hell is going on in Venezuela and why is this president, who campaigned on 'America First,' now spending all his time and energy on escapades overseas?"" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said in a floor speech.

House Democrats were also introducing a similar resolution on Thursday.

The rarely enforced War Powers Act

Congress was once again left in the dark during the military operation in Venezuela, with Trump later confirming that he talked to oil executives but not leaders on Capitol Hill. That reflects a broader pattern in Trump's second term, unfolding under a Republican-controlled Congress that has shown little appetite for reasserting its constitutional authority to declare war.

Under the Constitution, Congress declares war while the president serves as commander in chief. But lawmakers have not formally declared war since World War II, granting presidents broad latitude to act unilaterally.

Congress attempted to rein in that authority after the Vietnam War with the War Powers Resolution, passed over Republican President Richard Nixon's veto. The law requires presidents to notify Congress within 48 hours of deploying forces and to end military action within 60 to 90 days absent authorization — limits that presidents of both parties have routinely stretched.

Democrats argue those limits are being pushed further than ever. Some Republicans have gone further still, contending congressional approval is unnecessary altogether.

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a close Trump ally who traveled with the president aboard Air Force One on Sunday, said he would be comfortable with Trump taking over other countries without congressional approval, including Greenland.

""The commander in chief is the commander in chief. They can use military force,"" Graham said.

Greenland may further test the limits

Graham's comments come as the administration weighs not only its next steps in Venezuela, but also Greenland. The White House has said the ""military is always an option"" when it comes to a potential American takeover of the world's largest island.

While Republicans have cited Greenland's strategic value, most have balked at the idea of using the military to take the country, instead favoring a potential deal to purchase the country.

Democrats want to get out in front of any military action and are already preparing to respond. Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego said he is working on a resolution ""to block Trump from invading Greenland.""

""We must stop him before he invades another country on a whim,"" Gallego wrote on X. ""No more forever wars.""

Kaine also said Wednesday that a resolution on Greenland would soon be filed, in addition to Cuba, Mexico, Colombia and Nigeria.

Greenland belongs to a NATO ally, Denmark, which has prompted a much different response from Republican senators than the situation in Venezuela. Paul said Republicans discussed Trump's plans for Greenland at their Wednesday luncheon and he heard ""zero support"" for taking military action to seize it.

Sen. Thom Tillis, a co-chair of the Senate NATO Observer Group, used a Senate floor speech to criticize White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller for comments this week that the U.S. should take control of Greenland. Tillis said such remarks were ""amateurish"" and ""absurd.""

""This nonsense on what's going on with Greenland is a distraction from the good work he's doing,"" Tillis said of the president. ""And the amateurs who said it was a good idea should lose their jobs.""",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2026/01/2026-01-05T221653Z_154738508_RC27VIAV3N0A_RTRMADP_3_USA-VENEZUELA-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 16:58:40.933099

It is an ugly beast from head to toe.
In these darkest of times, people of good conscience in the United States must stand tall and resist this authoritarianism that seeks to wreck all that is good at home and to export its carnage around the earth.","Last Sunday, Stephen Miller, the chief wingman to the newly minted neo-imperialist Donald Trump, wrote an extraordinary post on X. For its brazen rewriting of history, it is worth reading in full:

None of this is true: The 18th and 19th century colonial projects were never about making the natives wealthy and successful‚ any more than slavery was about improving the condition of the slaves—a ludicrous and offensive position that Lost Cause advocates still argue. Colonialism was—and is—about the use of raw power to accumulate more power, more resources, more markets, more military bases, and more cheap and expendable labor. Miller’s “reverse colonization,” or—to use language not borrowed from Nazis such as Anders Breivik—a more liberal, race-neutral immigration system, never gave preferential treatment to new residents or naturalized citizens, but it did attract labor and talent and investments and dreamers from across the world.

Allowing more immigration was—and is—not about “self-punishment”; it’s about keeping countries economically dynamic. Immigrants—be they refugees, asylum seekers, or any other visa holders—start companies, provide needed medical and homecare skills, staff child care centers, and pick the crops that homegrown populations have long since decided they don’t want to pick. Take away immigration and remove immigrants, and you have a smaller, meaner, narrower, and poorer culture left behind.

Of course, the fact that Miller’s white-supremacist philosophy is based on lies and historically untenable claims should surprise no one. This is a political regime that, like all authoritarian regimes, thrives on misinformation and a Stalinesque rewriting of history to suit the needs of the moment. Witness the efforts by the White House this week around the fifth anniversary of the Trump-inspired insurrection to recast the murderous MAGA mob as peace-loving protesters attacked by the Capitol police at the behest of Nancy Pelosi. There is a Goebbels-like quality to their realization that if you simply repeat the Big Lie loudly and frequently enough, it will gain traction. They have embraced the Orwellian notion that if you use the levers of state power to maximize your propaganda, a shockingly large number of people will eventually accept that two-plus-two equals five.

For Lucan Way, a distinguished professor of democracy at the University of Toronto who has been writing on America’s slide into “competitive authoritarianism,” the GOP’s collaboration with Trump’s rewrite of January 6 is the clearest indication that the party as a whole has abandoned its commitment to democracy. “The GOP’s open embrace of authoritarianism is,” he said, “the most important fact of the American political system.”

Way believes that the United States has been functionally authoritarian since March, when Trump 2.0 began its onslaught against law firms that represented Democrats and advocacy organizations and against universities that the administration argued were too “woke” in their approach to academics. “In a democracy, we can oppose the government, and we don’t face a cost to our careers. In an authoritarian regime, you have to worry about contracts, about being investigated by the DOJ. That’s clearly the case in the US.”

This week, the fanaticism and authoritarianism of Miller, the fluffer-in-chief for Trump’s masturbatory fantasies of aggrandizement, has been on full display. In addition to embracing Breivik’s foul anti-immigration creed, he also espoused Hitler’s philosophy of international relations. “We live in a world, in the real world, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power,” he declared, in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper in which he asserted that the United States would seize Greenland and its vast mineral resources, refusing to rule out the use of military force to accomplish that aim. “These are the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time.”

In other words, we are big and have a military with almost unlimited capacity to inflict harm, so—be you allies like Denmark or longtime foes like Venezuela—bend to our will or expect to get the shit kicked out of you.

Might is right is the philosophy behind the Trump administration’s decision to kidnap the admittedly odious leader of Venezuela, to hold a gun to the head of the remaining leadership after that act of international piracy, and to promptly steal tens of millions of barrels of Venezuelan oil—to be sold by the United States on the open market with the profits personally controlled by one Donald J. Trump. What is unfolding is no different from the Elizabethan era privateers who, with government support, would ransack ships on the high seas, steal their treasures, and head back to England to add to the riches of the country’s crown.

Pretty it up with statements about investment opportunities for hedge funds, oil companies, and other corporate raiders, and you’re still left with the taste of vinegar in your mouth. The raid into Venezuela was never about restoring democracy or protecting human rights or raising the quality of life for the tens of millions of Venezuelans who have languished under Maduro’s nutty dictatorship—it was always about the United States enriching itself on another country’s oil reserves. “This is not America First,” Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts noted. “This is Authoritarianism First.”

And if Trump goes next into Colombia or Cuba or Panama or even Denmark, you can bet your bottom crypto dollar that it will also have zero to do with human rights and everything to do with accessing resources that America’s gold-and-baubles-obsessed modern-day Midas craves.

“They’re not pushing for democracy or economic development or peace,” said Antonia Juhasz, an investigative journalist who has written several books on the oil industry and the influence that that industry exerts over US politics. “It was all about getting Maduro out,” and then installing a deputy who will do the United States’ bidding when it comes to oil demands.

Ad Policy

While the United States has fought many wars over oil, Juhasz told me that past administrations felt that they had to at least produce some sort of fictive justification under international law. “What makes it [the attack on Venezuela] different is the Trump administration is making no effort to abide by international law at all. This is a very public action; it’s not a secret mission. It’s the public removal of the president of another country without any feint toward legality.” And that opens the door to a 21st-century jungle in which the strongest simply consume the weak.

For Juhasz, what we are seeing is the consolidation of an informal alliance of authoritarians whose power is propped up by the vast amounts of money generated by the fossil fuel industry. “The Trump administration’s effort to control the Western Hemisphere and to do that through energy and to prop up fossil fuels further aligns Trump with his favorite authoritarians, Putin and Mohammed bin Salman. It divides up the world into spheres, which allows authoritarians to dominate their spheres of influence.”

This is what American authoritarianism looks and sounds like. It is an ugly beast from head to toe.

As I wrapped up this column, an ICE agent in Minneapolis shot dead a peaceful protester as she was attempting to drive away after blocking a road to ICE vehicles. Witnesses say that when they tried to help her, armed ICE officers prevented them from reaching the scene. It is a tragedy that has been in the making for the past year. The mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, made a furious speech in response. “To ICE, get the fuck out of Minneapolis,” Frey said. “People are being hurt, families are being ripped apart…and now, somebody is dead. That’s on you. And it’s also on you to leave. It’s on you to make sure further damage, further loss of life and limb is not done.” He denounced ICE’s claim that the agent fired in self-defense as “garbage,” as was Kristi Noem’s absurd attempted justification of the killing by labelling the victim a “domestic terrorist.”

I hope that Frey’s message is heard. I fear, instead, that the federal government is going to ramp up its military occupation of cities. In these darkest of times, people of good conscience in the United States must stand tall and resist this authoritarianism that seeks to wreck all that is good at home and to export its carnage around the earth.",https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/stephen-miller-authoritarianism-getty.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 18:00:12.058225

Here's a recap of the Trump administration's comments about the fatal shooting in Minneapolis

Vice-president JD Vance appeared at the White House news briefing today, and repeated claims that the ICE agent who killed Renee Nicole Good was acting in “self-defense”. Vance said that Good, 37, was “dead because she tried to ram somebody with her car”, and claimed, baselessly, that she was part of a “left wing network” of people trying to incite violence against federal law enforcement officers. The vice-president further defended the ICE agent in question, by noting that he was “dragged by a car six months ago” and might be “a little bit sensitive about somebody ramming him with an automobile”.

At a press conference in New York today, homeland security secretary Kristi Noem continued to say that the shooting was in response to an “act of domestic terrorism”. Noem said that the officer who killed Good was “following his training” when he shot the 37-year-old. She added that the ICE agent “was hit by the vehicle, went to hospital and received treatment, was released, and is spending time with his family now” before noting that he is an “experienced officer”. Noem also said she was “not opposed” to sending more federal immigration agents to Minneapolis “to keep people safe”.

As demonstrations in response to Wednesdays’s shooting continue throughout the state, attorney general Pam Bondi warned protesting Minnesotans to “not test our resolve”. She said that “obstructing, impeding, or attacking federal law enforcement is a federal crime” and noted that those who “cross that red line” will be “arrested and prosecuted”.

After news of the shooting, Donald Trump spoke with the New York Times and insisted that Good “behaved horribly”. According to the four reporters in the room, Trump replayed the eyewitness video of the incident. “She didn’t try to run him over, she ran him over,” he said. However, multiple angles of the shooting show Good reversing her car and letting at least one ICE vehicle pass before an officer tells her to get out of the car, she then tries to turn and drive away. The agent shoots her multiple times, remains on his feet and walks away apparently uninjured as her car crashes into a lamp-post and parked vehicle.

Walz authorizes national guard to prepare to deploy

Minnesota governor Tim Walz has authorized the state’s national guard troops “to be staged and ready to support local and state law enforcement in protecting critical infrastructure and maintaining public safety”.

“Minnesotans have met this moment. Thousands of people have peacefully made their voices heard. Minnesota: thank you. We saw powerful peace,” Walz said in a statement annnouncing the order. “We have every reason to believe that peace will hold. Yesterday, I directed the National Guard to be ready should they be needed. They remain ready in the event they are needed to help keep the peace, ensure public safety, and allow for peaceful demonstrations.”

Earlier in the day, lieutenant governor Peggy Flanagan told CNN the guard was on standby “out of an abundance of caution” although demonstrations had been peaceful so far.

Republicans, including Donald Trump, criticized Walz after the 2020 murder of George Floyd by saying the governor should have deployed the state’s national guard sooner.

In a statement, Walz said the Minnesota State Patrol has also mobilized 85 state troopers.

Here’s more on the House vote to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies from my colleague Chris Stein:

All Democrats voted for the measure along with 17 Republicans, many of whom were moderates who said they could not tolerate a hike in healthcare costs for their constituents, but acknowledged the House measure will likely be revised by the Republican-controlled Senate before it is enacted .

“I am voting in favor of this discharge and of this legislation to send it to the Senate, so that the Senate will have the opportunity to put forth a reform package that can pass Congress and become law,” Republican congressman Mike Lawler said during a preliminary vote on the bill on Wednesday.

Trump has opposed extending the tax credits, and the Senate last month rejected a Democratic-backed measure similar to the bill that passed the House. Experts expect that premiums for enrollees of the plans will roughly double without the subsidies.

The Republican speaker, Mike Johnson, has opposed the credits , arguing they would enable fraud while calling the landmark 2010 law passed under Barack Obama the “Unaffordable Care Act”. Democrats made an extension to a centerpiece of their demands during the record-long government shutdown that began in October, while moderate Republicans sought to strike a compromise that would be palatable to both parties.

But after Johnson refused to bring any deal to the floor, four Republicans last month signed a discharge petition that forced a vote on the legislation extending the credits for three years, in a significant rebuke of the speaker.

House bill passes to extend ACA subsidies

The House of Representatives has passed legislation that would extend the Affordable Care Act subsidies, 230-196, with a handful of Republicans joining with Democrats to pass the measure despite opposition from Republican leadership.

“Health care costs have skyrocketed for millions of families and this legislation will help bring costs down. This is a win for the American people,” the House Democratic Caucus wrote in a social media post.

The legislation would extend ACA subsidies by three years. The bill will now move to the Senate where pressure to pass a similar bipartisan healthcare agreement is growing.

Minnesota officials expressed frustration with the FBI and Justice Department’s decision to block the state from participating in an investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good, and are considering ways the state might undertake its own investigation.

“We want to make sure that there is a check on this administration to ensure that this investigation is done for justice, not for the sake of a cover up,” said Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey.

Hennepin County attorney Mary Moriarty said her office is “exploring all options to ensure a state level investigation can continue” and that they’re “speaking to our local partners on paths forward.”

A bipartisan group of lawmakers has asked a US District Court to appoint a special master to compel the Justice Department to release the Epstein files. A special master is a neutral, third-party official appointed by a judge to make sure judicial orders are followed.

Congressmembers Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California, and Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, sent a letter to Judge Paul Engelmayer of the Southern District of New York requesting the appointment.

“The Department of Justice is openly defying the law by refusing to release the full Epstein files. Millions of files are being kept from the public,” Khanna said in a press release announcing the letter. “The DOJ has failed to make the necessary redactions to protect survivors while removing records after publication without any explanation. That is why we are requesting the appointment of a Special Master to oversee the release of the files and ensure that the DOJ is following the law.”

“Attorney General Pam Bondi is egregiously violating the requirements of the Epstein Files Transparency Act,” said Massie. “Under her leadership, the Department of Justice is missing statutory disclosure deadlines, making excessive redactions, and illegally withholding the Department’s internal communications. Because the Department of Justice has shown it cannot be trusted with making the disclosures required by law, a Special Master should be appointed to oversee the release of the Epstein files.”

Khanna and Massie wrote the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which required the Justice Department to release the files by 19 December.

Donald Trump issued the first vetoes of his second term late last month, nixing two measures to fund a Colorado drinking water project and the protection of part of the Everglades in Florida.

The bills were uncontroversial enough to pass Congress unanimously, but Republicans in the House of Representatives just declined to override the vetoes, a reminder that the president retains significant sway over GOP lawmakers despite high-profile setbacks over the Jeffrey Epstein case and Affordable Care Act subsidies.

The House needed a two-thirds majority to undo the vetoes, but the Florida measure received only 236 in favor and 188 opposed, while the Colorado bill picked up 248 in favor and 177 against - not enough, in either case, to undo the president’s rejections.

Both vetoes appear to be retaliatory actions by Trump against parties who have defied him. In the Colorado case, the water project lay in the district of Republican congresswoman Lauren Boebert, one of the lawmakers who had championed the bill to release the Epstein files.

“I sincerely hope this veto has nothing to do with political retaliation for calling out corruption and demanding accountability,” Boebert said in a statement to a local broadcaster after the veto.

In the Florida case, the protected area is inhabited by the Miccosukee Tribe of Native Americans, which has clashed with Trump over the “Alligator Alcatraz” migrant detention facility that lies elsewhere in the Everglades.

In his final state of the state address, California Governor Gavin Newsom assailed the Trump administration for inciting a “carnival of chaos,” warning: “None of this is normal.”

“In Washington, the president believes that might makes right, that the courts are simply speed bumps, not stop signs, and that democracy is a nuisance to be circumvented,” Newsom said in his address, speaking from the state Capitol in Sacramento to a joint session of the legislature.

Referencing Trump’s aggressive immigration crackdown, he continued: “Secret police, businesses being raided, windows smashed, citizens detained, Citizens shot, masked men snatching people in broad daylight, people disappearing, using American cities as training grounds for the United States military.”

Newsom, who is widely expected to run for president in 2028, has governed California through historic periods of crisis that overlapped with the end of Trump’s first term, and the first years of his second, as well as the pandemic and the LA fires.

In his address, Newsom cast the state as an American “marvel” and a bulwark against the “twisted nostalgia” of the Trump administration. Pre-empting some of the criticism he will surely face from Republicans should he seek the White House, Newsom argued vigorously that his state still leads the country - and the world - in culture, technology, education and agriculture.

“Every year, the declinists, the pundits and critics suffering from California derangement syndrome look at this state and try to tear down our progress,” he said, touting an environment that has created the “conditions where dreamers and doers and misfits and marvelers with grit and ingenuity get to build and do the impossible”.

As if offering a bit of advice to a potential presidential campaign, the president’s tormentor-in-chief said: “If we’re going to keep the faith of the California spirit we’ve got to do more than just resist what is wrong.”

“We’re not defined by what we’re against,” he added. “We’re defined by what we’re for.”

Today, the Senate unanimously passed a bipartisan resolution to display a commemorative plaque to honor Capitol police and other officers who defended Congress during the January 6 riots.

The plaque will be placed in the Senate wing of the US Capitol until it is permanently installed on building’s west front.

Despite a law approving the plaque’s display passing three years ago, it has never been officially hung. Today, outgoing senator Thom Tillis brought the resolution to the floor, which received no objection by lawmakers.

According to court records, Ross was involved in the June arrest of Roberto Carlos Muñoz, an undocumented Mexican immigrant with an open immigration detainer and a criminal conviction for sexually assaulting his 16-year-old stepdaughter in 2022.

Muñoz was contacted at his residence in Bloomington, Minnesota, by a group of federal agents on 19 June 2025.

According to an affidavit from an FBI agent, Muñoz was in his car when federal law enforcement approached him. He did not comply with commands to get out of his vehicle and drove away. The feds pursued Muñoz and conducted a traffic stop. An enforcement and removal operation (ERO) agent and an FBI agent approached the car and ordered Muñoz in both English and Spanish to put the car in park and provide documentation, which he did. When the ERO agent ordered Muñoz to exit the car, he refused.

At this point, according to the affidavit, the ERO agent broke the rear driver’s side window of Muñoz’s car and tried to unlock the driver’s door.

Muñoz threw the car into drive, speeding off with the agent trapped in the vehicle by his arm and dragged behind the car for 100 yards down the street along the curb, weaving past several cars. The agent was jarred loose from the window, and fell into the street, and Muñoz drove off. The agent suffered serious lacerations on both arms, which required 33 stitches in total to close.

At the White House on Thursday, Vance engaged in a lengthy defense of the officer’s actions and said: “[T]hat very ICE officer nearly had his life ended, dragged by a car six months ago, 33 stitches in his leg. So you think maybe he’s a little bit sensitive about somebody ramming him with an automobile.” The court documents indicate the stitches were on Ross’s arms and hand, not his leg.

Mr. Trump said in an Oval Office interview with New York Times reporters that he was “not happy” about a September raid that detained 475 workers, mostly from South Korea, who were building a Hyundai plant in Georgia. Mr. Trump argued that foreigners attempting to expand U.S. operations in globally competitive sectors would be dissuaded by such hostile treatment. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested 475 people in the raid.

“You have to allow them to bring some of their experts with them or they’re never going to be able to open their plant or factory,” he said of foreign companies in specialized industries that were looking to operate in the United States.

“They brought people that make batteries,” he added about the Hyundai raid. “And those people would have trained our people how to make batteries, and at some point they would have gone back because they want to go back to their country.”

While Mr. Trump presented his views as business-minded pragmatism, they contrasted sharply with those espoused by Mr. Miller, who has called for limiting immigration across the board, with few exceptions for highly skilled workers in competitive sectors.

When asked if that meant he disagreed with Mr. Miller, Mr. Trump did not criticize his aide personally, calling Mr. Miller “a very strong voice” in his administration.

“He feels that people who come into our country should be able to love our county and be able to contribute,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Miller, skipping over Mr. Miller’s hard-line approach to immigrants, including naturalized citizens, and their children.

While much of Mr. Miller’s efforts have focused on deporting immigrants without legal authorization to be in the United States, he also has pushed for the Trump administration to significantly limit the distribution of skilled worker visas and green cards, arguing they pose a threat to U.S.-born workers.

Earlier this year, Mr. Miller also set a target of 3,000 immigration arrests per day, which some have cited as a factor in driving I.C.E. to conduct large-scale workplace raids like the one that rounded up the Hyundai workers in Georgia.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/08/multimedia/08trump-miller-zwcv/08trump-miller-zwcv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 16:58:55.058217

Sakshi Venkatraman

A US immigration agent has shot dead a 37-year-old woman in the city of Minneapolis, sparking protests overnight.

Federal officials said the woman, Renee Nicole Good, had tried to run over immigration agents with her car but the city mayor said the agent who shot her had acted recklessly.

Videos of the incident show ICE agents approaching a car which is in the middle of the street. As it attempts to drive off, one of them points his gun at the driver and at least two shots are heard. The FBI is investigating.

Hundreds of ICE agents have been deployed to Minneapolis, in the state of Minnesota, as part of the White House's crackdown on illegal immigration.

Using an expletive, the city's Democratic Mayor Jacob Frey urged the agents to leave the city, following the fatal shooting.

Minneapolis shooting live updates

Videos posted to social media by onlookers appear to show the moment of the shooting, which occurred around 10:25 local time on Wednesday morning.

From various vantage points, a maroon SUV can be seen blocking a residential street in Minneapolis.

A crowd of people, who appear to be protesting, are lining the pavement.

Law enforcement vehicles appear nearby. ICE agents pull up to the vehicle parked in the street, emerge from the truck and tell the woman behind the wheel to get out of the SUV. One of the agents tugs at the driver's side door handle.

Another agent is positioned near the front of the vehicle.

It's not clear exactly how close the agent is standing or whether he was struck by the vehicle based on the videos reviewed immediately by the BBC.

That agent opens fire as the maroon SUV attempts to drive off.

The vehicle can be seen losing control and crashing into a car parked nearby along the street.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump said an ICE officer was ""viciously"" run over. ""It is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital,"" he wrote.

The Republican president also blamed the ""Radical Left"" for ""threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis"".

Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara said the driver was in her vehicle and was blocking the roadway on Portland Avenue. She was then approached on foot by a federal law enforcement officer, ""and she began to drive off"".

US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the woman was ""stalking and impeding"" officers throughout the day and tried to ""weaponise her vehicle"" in an attempt to run over the officer in an act of ""domestic terrorism"".

The federal agent fired ""defensive shots"" and was himself injured, Noem said, before he was treated and discharged from a local hospital.

The Minneapolis City Council, however, said in a statement that Good was simply ""caring for her neighbours"" when she was shot and killed.

The same agent was also hit by a car in the line of duty in June, Noem said.

She added that ICE operations in the city would continue, and the FBI would investigate Wednesday's incident.

Emily Heller told CNN she was at home when she saw the ICE agents arguing with protesters outside. She said she heard agents shouting at a woman driving an SUV, then one agent tried to open her car door, and the driver went into reverse and began pulling away.

""An ICE agent stepped in front of her vehicle and said, 'Stop!' and then - I mean, she was already moving - and then, point blank, shot her through her windshield in the face,"" Heller told the US network.

Minnesota State Governor Tim Walz also pushed back on federal accounts of the incident.

""Don't believe this propaganda machine,"" Walz wrote in response to a Department of Homeland Security post about the shooting.

""The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.""

Top Democrats, including former Vice-President Kamala Harris and House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, also released statements. Harris called the Trump administration's version of events ""gaslighting"".

Protests and marches took place in several parts of the city as some outraged Minneapolis residents condemned the shooting and called for ICE to leave.

The scene of the shooting is about one mile from where George Floyd was murdered in 2020 by a city police officer, sparking worldwide anti-racism protests.

Protests were being organised in other US cities, including New Orleans, Miami, Seattle and New York City.

Minneapolis Public Schools announced that classes were cancelled for the rest of the week, ""due to safety concerns"". It comes after federal agents reportedly made arrests outside a high school on Wednesday.

Why is ICE in Minneapolis?

The Trump administration deployed an additional 2,000 federal agents to the Minneapolis area in recent weeks in response to allegations of welfare fraud in the state.

The mayor said in the Wednesday press conference that ICE was not making the city safer. ""They're ripping families apart, they're sowing chaos in our streets,"" he said.

The deployment, which began on Sunday, is one of the largest concentrations of Department of Homeland Security personnel in a US city in recent years.

It follows an immigration enforcement campaign launched by ICE late last year to target individuals in Minneapolis who were issued deportation orders, including members of the city's Somali community.

That community has been criticised frequently by Trump, who has called them ""garbage"".

""I don't want them in our country. I'll be honest with you,"" the president has said. ""Their country's no good for a reason. Their country stinks.""

Trump later doubled-down on his remarks after a YouTube video by a conservative online content creator accused daycare centres run by Somali immigrants of mass fraud.

In response, Trump has withheld federal childcare funds from the state of Minnesota.

The Trump administration has sent ICE agents to other cities across the US, where they have made thousands of arrests as part of what the administration says is a crackdown on crime and immigrants who illegally entered the country.

Commissioner Bob Jacobson of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety said state authorities would investigate the shooting with federal authorities.","Dozens of protesters gathered early Thursday outside of a federal building on the edge of Minneapolis that is serving as a major base for the immigration crackdown. They shouted ""No More ICE,"" ""Go Home Nazis,"" ""Quit Your Job,"" and ""Justice Now!"" as Border Patrol officers pushed them back from the gate and fired smoke grenades.

""We should be horrified,"" protester Shanta Hejmadi said. ""We should be saddened that our government is waging war on our citizens. We should get out and say no. What else can we do?""

WATCH: Minneapolis police chief urges 'lawful, peaceful' response to ICE shooting

Bystanders captured video of Macklin Good's killing in a residential neighborhood south of downtown, and hundreds of people turned up for a Wednesday night vigil to mourn her and urge the public to resist the immigration crackdown. Some then chanted as they marched through the city, but there was no violence.

""I would love for ICE to leave our city and for more community members to come to see it happens,"" said Sander Kolodziej, a painter who came to the vigil to support the community.

The videos of the shooting show an officer approaching an SUV stopped across the middle of the road, demanding the driver open the door and grabbing the handle. The Honda Pilot begins to pull forward, and a different ICE officer standing in front of it pulls his weapon and immediately fires at least two shots at close range, jumping back as the vehicle moves toward him.

It is not clear from the videos if the vehicle makes contact with the officer, and there is no indication of whether the woman had interactions with ICE agents earlier. After the shooting the SUV speeds into two cars parked on a curb before crashing to a stop.

In another recording made afterward, a woman who identifies Macklin Good as her spouse is seen crying near the vehicle. The woman, who is not identified, says the couple recently arrived in Minnesota and that they had a child.

Noem called the incident an ""act of domestic terrorism"" against ICE officers, saying the driver ""attempted to run them over and rammed them with her vehicle. An officer of ours acted quickly and defensively, shot, to protect himself and the people around him.""

President Donald Trump made similar accusations on social media and defended ICE's work.

Noem alleged that the woman was part of a ""mob of agitators"" and said the officer followed his training. She said the FBI would investigate.

But Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called Noem's version of events ""garbage.""

""They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defense,"" Frey said. ""Having seen the video myself, I wanna tell everybody directly, that is bulls**t.""

He also criticized the federal deployment and said the agents should leave.

The shooting marked a dramatic escalation of the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations in major cities under the Trump administration. Wednesday's is at least the fifth death linked to the crackdowns.

The Twin Cities have been on edge since DHS announced the operation's launch Tuesday, at least partly tied to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

A crowd of protesters gathered at the scene after the shooting to vent their anger at local and federal officers.

In a scene that hearkened back to crackdowns in Los Angeles and Chicago, people chanted ""ICE out of Minnesota"" and blew whistles that have become ubiquitous during the operations.

Gov. Tim Walz said he was prepared to deploy the National Guard if necessary. He expressed outrage over the shooting but called on people to keep protests peaceful.

""They want a show,"" Walz said. ""We can't give it to them.""

There were calls on social media to prosecute the officer who shot Macklin Good.

Commissioner Bob Jacobson of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety said state authorities would investigate the shooting with federal authorities.

“I want good advice for this president, because I want this president to have a good legacy.","Five Senate Republicans broke with party leaders on Thursday to advance legislation that would rein in President Trump’s use of the U.S. military in Venezuela, a move that comes as a growing number of GOP lawmakers have expressed unease about the White House’s threats to use force to acquire Greenland.

The procedural vote, which came over the objections of Republican leaders, now sets the stage for a full Senate vote next week on a measure that would block Trump from using military force “within or against Venezuela” without approval from Congress. Even with the Senate’s approval, the legislation is unlikely to become law as it is unlikely to pass the House, and President Trump — who has veto power over legislation — has publicly condemned the measure and the Republicans who supported it.

“This vote greatly hampers American Self Defense and National Security, impeding the President’s Authority as Commander in Chief,” Trump wrote in a social media post shortly after the 52-47 vote in the Senate.

The Republican defection on the issue underscores the growing concern among GOP lawmakers over the Trump administration’s foreign policy ambitions and highlights the bipartisan concern that the president is testing the limits of executive war powers — not only in Venezuela but also in Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of Denmark, a U.S. ally.

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Me.), one of the Republicans who voted for the resolution, said that while she supported the operation that led to the capture and extradition of Nicolás Maduro, she did not “support committing additional U.S. forces or entering into any long-term military involvement in Venezuela or Greenland without specific congressional authorization.”

The resolution is co-sponsored by Sens. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). The Republicans who supported it were Sens. Collins, Paul, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Todd Young of Indiana and Josh Hawley of Missouri.

“Finally, the Senate is exercising its constitutional power over the authorization of the use of force to prevent America from being dragged into a new war over oil,” Schiff said in a social media post after the vote.

Vice President JD Vance told reporters at the White House on Thursday that he was not concerned about Trump losing support among Republican lawmakers in Washington, adding that passage of the resolution in the Senate would not “change anything about how we conduct foreign policy over the next couple of weeks or the next couple of months.”

But Republican support for the resolution reflects a deepening concern within the GOP over Trump’s foreign policy plans, particularly his threats to acquire Greenland — a move that prompted European leaders earlier this week to call on the United States to respect the Arctic territory’s sovereignty

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) told reporters on Wednesday that he does not believe “anybody’s seriously considering” using the military to take control of Greenland.

“In Congress, we’re certainly not,” Johnson said.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) struck a similar tone the same day, telling reporters that he does not “see military action being an option” in Greenland.

Other Republican lawmakers have been more openly critical, warning that even floating the idea of using force against a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a defense alliance that includes the United States, risks weakening America’s position on the world stage.

“Threats and intimidation by U.S. officials over American ownership of Greenland are as unseemly as they are counterproductive,” Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in a statement. “And the use of force to seize the sovereign democratic territory of one of America’s most loyal and capable allies would be an especially catastrophic act of strategic self-harm to America and its global influence.”

In a statement Tuesday, the White House said acquiring Greenland was a “national security priority” and that using the military to achieve that goal was “always an option.” A day earlier, Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff for policy, told CNN that “Greenland should be part of the United States.”

“Nobody is going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland,” Miller said.

Miller’s remarks angered Republican senators, including Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) who in an interview with CNN on Wednesday called the idea of invading Greenland “weapons-grade stupid.”

Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C), who has served as the top Republicans on the Senate NATO Observer Group since 2018, criticized the idea as well in a searing Senate floor speech.

“I’m sick of stupid,” Tillis said. “I want good advice for this president, because I want this president to have a good legacy. And this nonsense on what’s going on with Greenland is a distraction from the good work he’s doing, and the amateurs who said it was a good idea should lose their jobs.”

Tillis, who is not seeking reelection this year, later told CNN that Miller needs to “get into a lane where he knows what he’s talking about or get out of this job.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9c36cae/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4777x2508+0+339/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa3%2F04%2Ff8335cb745a0b79a68096e5e7c83%2F2240791863.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 16:58:59.220860

Noem said the shooting occurred after protesters in Minneapolis harassed and impeded ICE agents on Wednesday and that the officer acted to protect himself and fellow officers. She alleged that Good's actions amounted to ""an act of domestic terrorism.""

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison told NPR's Morning Edition that he disagrees with Noem's characterization of Good as a domestic terrorist.

""She was a compassionate neighbor trying to be a legal observer on behalf of her immigrant neighbors,"" Ellison said. ""That's what she was doing at the moment of her death. And she was a poet. She was a mom. She was a daughter. And I am deeply saddened by what happened to her and her family.""

Competing narratives quickly emerge

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and other local officials have dismissed Noem's version of events as political spin. At a news conference on Wednesday, Frey said of the self-defense explanation, ""Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody that is bull****. ""

""This was a federal agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying,"" Frey said, adding that he wants ICE units to leave Minneapolis.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he was angered by the killing, which he linked to President Trump's policy of sending ICE and other federal agents surging into cities such as Minneapolis.

""What we're seeing is the consequences of governance designed to generate fear, headlines and conflict,"" Walz said on Wednesday. ""It's governing by reality TV and today that recklessness cost someone their life.""

Noem said on Wednesday that she had spoken with Walz about the killing, but added that they don't agree on whether it was justified: ""We have two very different viewpoints on what happened.""

Hours after the shooting, Noem defended the ICE officer who shot Good, saying the woman had blocked federal officers with her SUV and disobeyed orders to get out of her vehicle.

""It's clearly established law that a vehicle driven by a person and used to harm someone is a deadly weapon,"" she said, as NPR reported. ""Deadly force is perfectly lawful when a threat is faced by a weapon, so I do believe that this officer used his training in this situation.""

When Noem was asked on Thursday whether the officer remains on field duty, Noem said he had gone to a hospital for treatment, but was then released ""and is spending time with his family now.""

Noem also said the federal surge in Minneapolis will continue, and could even grow.

""We've got thousands of officers there,"" she said, ""and I'm not opposed to sending more if necessary to keep people safe.""

Key details of a controversial shooting

Here is a brief overview of what we know so far about the events leading to Good's death:

When: Police officers responded to reports of shots fired just after 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, according to a timeline published by the city of Minneapolis.

""Minneapolis firefighters then removed the 37-year-old victim from the vehicle and immediately began lifesaving measures until paramedics could respond,"" the city's account states. ""She was transported to Hennepin County Medical Center, where she later died.""

Where: Good was shot in her car on Portland Avenue, near East 34th Street, in a residential area a few blocks north of where police killed George Floyd in May 2020.

ICE agents at the scene were trying to deal with a vehicle that had gotten stuck in the snow, Noem said on Wednesday. As other ICE vehicles arrived, so did protesters, a witness named Caitlin Callenson told member station MPR.

How: Callenson, who recorded a video of the incident, told MPR that agents gave Good conflicting orders: One agent told her to drive away while another told her to get out of her SUV, Callenson said.

(Warning: The video at the following link includes violent actions and profanity.)

Video footage from the scene shows Good's Honda Pilot SUV sitting sideways on a snowy street, with her driver's side window down. Two uniformed officers approach the vehicle from the left. As one officer grabs at her door handle, a third officer who had circled to the front of the SUV from the opposite side draws his gun. As Good begins to drive away, the officer fires into her car.

""The preliminary information that we have indicates that this woman was in her vehicle and was blocking the roadway,"" Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said at a news conference Wednesday. ""At some point, a federal law enforcement officer approached her on foot and the vehicle began to drive off. At least two shots were fired. The vehicle then crashed on the side of the roadway.""

What's next: On Wednesday, O'Hara said the FBI and Minnesota's state agency, the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, would jointly investigate the fatal shooting.

But in a statement Thursday, the BCA said that the U.S. Attorney's Office reversed course at the federal level, and the FBI alone would lead the investigation, as MPR reports. The BCA said it ""has reluctantly withdrawn"" from the process, because it would no longer have access to case materials and evidence.

Ellison, Minnesota's attorney general, said that he believes the FBI should not be involved in the inquiry.

""I know that ICE and FBI are different agencies,"" Ellison said, ""but I think in order for public confidence to be at its best, there is some legitimate question as to what the role the FBI should be playing.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7496x4217+0+392/resize/1400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F06%2F32%2Fe7da77dd416f8d0822d45e65a75f%2Fgettyimages-2254640480.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 18:59:43.877617

Why it matters: Locals said they worry tensions between Massachusetts officials who back immigrant protections and federal enforcement agencies could lead to more ICE presence in metro Boston or a similar deadly incident.

The latest: The Trump administration intensified its legal battle against Boston's sanctuary policies this week, filing court documents arguing the city actively obstructs federal enforcement.

Zoom in: Justice Department lawyers submitted a 28-page motion Tuesday opposing Boston's attempt to dismiss a federal lawsuit challenging the city's sanctuary policies.

Federal prosecutors claim the sanctuary law enables deportable individuals to evade apprehension.

Trump's DOJ characterized Boston's stance as ""obstructionist"" discrimination against federal immigration enforcement.

Yes, but: Boston Mayor Michelle Wu defends the Trust Act as crucial to the city's public safety strategy, claiming it contributes to the city's status as the nation's safest major municipality.

The filing is the latest example of rising tensions between local officials and federal authorities.

State of play: Protesters gathered on Boston Common to condemn the Minneapolis shooting and demand federal accountability, while Worcester activists held a rally outside City Hall on Thursday.

Between the lines: Local immigrant rights organizations are framing the Minneapolis shooting as validation of their warnings about aggressive enforcement.

The death of Renee Nicole Good, 37, prompted furious demonstrations, and protesters were met with tear gas at a federal building Thursday morning. Documents obtained by The New York Times suggested that at least 100 more federal agents were being deployed to Minnesota.

Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis said in an interview on Thursday that the Trump administration would use any chaos as an opportunity to “occupy Minneapolis in some form.”

“Our community members are not taking the bait,” he said.

Officials have described the killing of Ms. Good in starkly different terms. She was killed on Wednesday during a protest on a residential street as federal agents ordered her to move her vehicle.

Administration officials, including President Trump, defended the shooting as lawful, saying that the agent who fired was acting in self-defense. City and state officials described those accounts as “propaganda” and “garbage.”

A video analysis shows that the woman’s vehicle appeared to be turning away from the officer as he opened fire.

State officials initially said they would investigate the killing. But Drew Evans, the superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said on Thursday that the agency had withdrawn because it had been denied access to evidence.

Gov. Tim Walz said at a news conference on Thursday that “Minnesota must be part of this investigation.”

At a news conference in New York City on Thursday, Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said that Minnesota and Minneapolis officials had failed to maintain order.

“They have not been cut out,” Ms. Noem told a reporter who had asked about state investigators. “They don’t have any jurisdiction in this investigation.”

Cindy Burnham, a spokeswoman for the F.B.I. office in the Minneapolis area, declined to comment.

At a White House press briefing, Vice President JD Vance doubled down on claims about the shooting, calling news reporters “agents of propaganda of a radical fringe” for reports indicating that Ms. Good never put the ICE agent in danger before she was shot.

And on social media, Attorney General Pam Bondi warned protesters in Minnesota not to cross a “red line” into obstructing, impeding or attacking federal law enforcement.

Protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement action in Minneapolis have occurred for weeks, but Ms. Good’s killing ratcheted up the tension. Demonstrators gathered Thursday at the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building just outside the city, the home of local ICE headquarters. By 9 a.m., federal agents had pushed protesters across the street after deploying tear gas.

The building also houses an immigration court, which was closed on Thursday. Public schools were also closed across the city, and will remain so on Friday, because of “safety concerns” related to “incidents around the city,” school officials said in a statement.

Many local and state leaders had been warning for weeks that the surge of immigration enforcement work was bound to stoke chaos. Mr. Walz put the blame squarely on Mr. Trump and Ms. Noem, asking them to pull back federal agents and declaring at a Wednesday news conference, “You’ve done enough.”

Now, more federal agents are on the way. The additional 100 federal agents the Trump administration plans to deploy are Customs and Border Protection officials who will travel to Minnesota from Chicago and New Orleans.

The Department of Homeland Security plans to pause operations in Chicago to support the operation in Minnesota.

The deployment of additional Border Patrol agents is expected to last through the weekend, with a planned return to their cities on Sunday. The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on the plans.

Tensions between federal and state officials have been exacerbated by a fraud scheme that siphoned money from social service programs in the Minneapolis area. The president has unleashed xenophobic tirades and made repeated, derisive comments about members of Minnesota’s large Somali diaspora, whose members make up a majority of the fraud defendants.

The shooting on Wednesday happened on Portland Avenue, less than a mile away from the spot where George Floyd was killed by the police in 2020, prompting angry protests and tearful vigils late into the night.

Mr. Frey said on Thursday that there were no major public safety incidents in Minneapolis overnight, and that local officials were still monitoring demonstrations.

The city’s priorities, he said, were “keeping people safe” and then “getting ICE out of here.”

Now, Walz slammed what the state claims is the federal government’s decision to exclude a Minnesota agency from its investigation.","The Department of Homeland Security said Thursday it was ramping up its investigations in Minneapolis.

In an X post, DHS shared a video showing several law enforcement officers entering a building.

“DHS investigations in Minneapolis are accelerating as more of our brave law enforcement enter the state,” the agency said in the post. “We will not be impeded from ending the FRAUD that has ABUSED our nation’s generosity. See you on the streets!”

Context: Earlier this week, DHS said its agents were in Minnesota conducting a large scale investigation on fraud allegations at day care centers and other places.

It is “very disappointing” to see the vice president “rush out to these conclusions” amid the investigation into what happened in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement shooting of a woman in Minneapolis, former ICE acting director John Sandweg said.

“It makes it incredibly hard for me to understand how anyone is going to see the results of that investigation as credible,” Sandweg told CNN’s Brianna Keilar.

He said the “proper protocol” in this incident is to conduct the investigation as required by the Department of Homeland Security and for “department leadership to refrain from making any judgment until that investigation is complete.”

“It’s important for the credibility of the agency, which is so critical for the agency’s ability to operate,” Sandweg added.

Renee Good’s southside Minneapolis home still has holiday decorations up on the front porch and in the window.

A neighbor said Good had a “really sweet family” and had moved to the neighborhood “relatively” recently.

A few houses down, another neighbor, Clark Hoelscher said they would see Good and her family in the neighborhood from time to time, and “her kids’ sidewalk drawings during the summer.”

“I’m a parent … I can’t imagine, that they came home and their mom isn’t gonna be there anymore,” Hoelscher said.

Another community member who lived nearby stood in front of Good’s house much of the day, greeting anyone who attempted to knock on the door and relaying Good’s family would release a statement at the appropriate time.

“She (Good) was a very welcomed member of the community,” said Kimmy Hull.

Hull isn’t surprised organizing efforts are quickly growing.

“What happened with [George] Floyd, there’s a lot of hard things that came out of it. But there’s a lot of really good things. One of the best things was it taught a lot of people how to work together. How to come together,” Hull said.

Good’s home is less than a mile from where George Floyd was killed, now known as George Floyd Square.

Less than 24 hours after the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good by an ICE officer, the Latino community in the Twin Cities was feeling tension and concern today.

Abner Castillo, a 51-year-old Nicaraguan immigrant in Minneapolis, said he has carried his passport with him ever since President Donald Trump came into office and still worries about being accused of the passport being fraudulent.

Damian Plaza’s mother immigrated to the United States to give him a better life. Plaza said his cousins cannot attend school and his uncle does not want to go to work.

Those concerns were echoed by Ricardo Lezama, another resident of Minneapolis: “I don’t think anyone should lose their life over this. All of this is very crazy, and I hope everything changes soon.”

Bella Pesantez said she has lived in Minneapolis for several years “and until yesterday I thought everything was peaceful and calm.” Now, after this shooting, she feels unsafe.

The city of Minneapolis said it was concerned over the state’s claim that the federal government blocked a Minnesota agency from a joint investigation into Wednesday’s fatal shooting of Renee Good.

“The decision to remove the (Bureau of Criminal Apprehension) from the ICE shooting investigation is deeply disappointing. We are concerned that the investigation is proceeding without state partners, and we are calling for a clear and transparent process that includes state investigating agencies,” the city government said in a post on X Thursday.

The state BCA “reluctantly” withdrew from investigating the shooting after the FBI told the agency the US Attorney’s Office “had reversed course” and would no longer allow the BCA “access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews,” BCA Superintendent Drew Evans had said in a statement Thursday.

In a news conference Thursday, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Minnesota “must be part of this investigation.”

“I will continue to press that we be part of the investigation, that we do the investigation, so that Minnesotans can trust what the outcome is,” Walz said.

Vice President JD Vance said that the ICE officer who fatally shot a woman in Minnesota on Wednesday was previously hit by a car and received over 30 stitches in his leg.

“Look, in the past six months, he has been hit twice by a motor vehicle. One time, the first time, it led to over 30 stitches and very serious injuries to his legs. This is a guy who’s actually done a very, very important job for the United States of America. He’s been assaulted, he’s been attacked. He’s been injured because of it. He deserves a debt of gratitude,” Vance said.

CNN has previously reported that the officer who shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good has 10 years of experience with Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s enforcement and removal operations, according to a senior Homeland Security Official.

Enforcement and Removal Operations is the branch of ICE that deals specifically with the arrest and deportation of undocumented immigrants. Of that branch, the officer was part of the special response team, the Homeland Security Official said.

CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report.

For years, religious leaders have called for the renaming of a federal building in the Minneapolis area that has been the site of protests and clashes with federal agents. They say what happens inside the building goes against the beliefs of the man it was named after.

The Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building was named after Minnesota’s first Protestant Episcopal bishop, Henry B. Whipple, who was an advocate for Indigenous people in the 1860s. He was known for his missionary work among the Dakota and Ojibwe people.

In 2019, the Episcopal Church in Minnesota and other religious organizations in the state called for the removal of Whipple’s name from the building.

“The current practices and actions within the Bishop Henry Whipple building are oppositional to the belief, policy, values, practices, and theology of the Episcopal Church,” they said in a news release.

“The fact that the building carries the name of the Episcopal Church in Minnesota’s patriarch, and icon of human rights, is an affront to our church,” they added.

CNN has reached out to the Episcopal Church of Minnesota for comment.

The federal building houses the Fort Snelling Immigration Court in addition to offices for several federal agencies like the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security.

Minneapolis City Council Member Aurin Chowdhury cast doubt on the ongoing investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Good in her city after state officials said they were forced off the case.

“We are worried about the transparency and fairness of what comes out of this investigation,” she told CNN’s Brianna Keilar on Thursday.

Chowdhury, who represents southeast Minneapolis, said local officials have little power to force federal immigration officers to leave the city, but she’ll continue to speak out against their deployment.

She discouraged local police from cooperating with federal immigration agents, which could destroy the trust built in the community, after the 2020 murder of George Floyd.

“If MPD was doing the work of the federal government, that trust would be totally broken. We need MPD to work to protect and ensure the safety of our residents here,” said Chowdhury.

Vice President JD Vance on Thursday cast what happened in Minnesota as “an attack on federal law enforcement.”

“This was an attack on law and order. This was an attack on the American people,” he said from the White House podium, adding that he views media coverage of the shooting as “an absolute disgrace.”

Vance, at points, appeared to be shouting from the podium and argued heightened rhetoric surrounding the shooting “puts our law enforcement officers at risk every single day.”

He also claimed that the victim “was there to interfere with a legitimate law enforcement operation in the United States of America.”

Vance want on to claim that she was “part of a broader left-wing network to attack, to dox, to assault, and to make it impossible for our ICE officers to do their job,” without providing any evidence for his claims.

His comments come as federal and local investigations into the incident are just beginning.

And he fiercely defended the ICE agent. “The president stands with ICE. I stand with ICE. We stand with all of our law enforcement officers,” Vance said.

Vice President JD Vance called yesterday’s fatal shooting by an ICE agent in Minnesota “a tragedy of the making of the far left.”

“Nobody wants an American citizen to be killed. This is absolutely a tragedy. But it’s a tragedy of the making of the far left. They have radicalized a very small segment of the population, taught them that ICE agents are engaging in an wide-scale violation of people’s rights,” the vice president said.

Pressed further by reporters on who he thought was behind what he described as a “broader left-wing network,” Vance said that it was “one of the things we’re going to have to figure out.”

“You see friends of this woman’s or other people who are eyewitnesses saying basically that she was there to engage in obstruction of a legitimate law enforcement operation. How did she get there? How did she learn about this? There’s an entire network,” the vice president added.

Vance also said Good had to have been “a little brainwashed” and claimed without evidence that she had to also have been “radicalized.”

“I think she is a victim of left wing ideology. What young mother shows up and decides they’re going to throw their car in front of ICE officers who are enforcing legitimate law. You’ve got to be a little brainwashed to get to that point, to where you’re willing not just to protest. That’s fine. Not peacefully protest, but throw your vehicle in front of legitimate law enforcement officers and drive your car into them,” the vice president said.

“To get to that point, you have to be, I think, radicalized in a very, very sad way,” Vance said.

This post has been updated to include an additional quote from Vance.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said federal agents have caused more harm than good in his state.

“We believe that the situation has gotten worse and less safe because of their presence,” Walz said at a news conference Thursday.

“There were two incidents yesterday … that just tore at my soul. I saw an individual at the scene identify themselves as medical personnel, a physician, and asked to provide aid, and an ICE agent said, ‘I do not care,’” Walz said.

“That lack of humanity was chilling to me,” Walz said. “And after this incident happened, and after the tensions rose, ICE agents entered a Minnesota school, causing disruptions at that school.”

Walz, a former teacher, said ICE agents should stay out of children’s schools.

“I can’t say this strongly enough as governor, as a parent, as a teacher, to our elected representatives, Democrats and Republicans: I beg you, I implore you, to tell them to stay out of our schools.”

Some parents in Minneapolis are searching for ways to speak to their children about the fatal shooting of a community member by an ICE agent. Sam Clingan, the father of a 5-year-old and a 3-year-old, says he is trying to approach the conversations with honesty.

“We don’t hide the truth of the world from them,” Clingan told CNN today as he visited a memorial at the scene of the shooting.

As a parent, he said he and his wife try to be prepared for unexpected moments when difficult questions arise, like in the car or at the dinner table. Kids process information in their own way, he said.

The couple has tried to explain to their 5-year-old why federal agents are in their community, and what the sound of whistles — used by some residents to warn of agents’ presence — might mean. It’s become a familiar practice for them in a city stricken by other difficult events, like the murder of George Floyd.

“Unfortunately, this isn’t a new practice for us, having tough conversations about things that have happened in our city,” he said.

Protesters barricaded a section of Portland Avenue where the shooting took place using a makeshift wall of trash bins, plywood, construction barricades and wood pallets this morning.

The blocking of the busy road between East 33rd and 34th Streets frustrated some motorist and caused them to be redirected.

“Y’all are disrupting the public!” a frustrated driver yelled out his window while being diverted. “Y’all are the problem!”

Within the barriers, protesters gathered round a fire in a metal trash can at one end and a portable firepit on the other. In between was the shrine to Renee Good, the woman killed in her car by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent yesterday.

There is a mound of colorful bouquets of flowers near the streetlight where Good’s SUV crashed after she was shot.

“I honestly felt useless just staying home, so I thought the next best thing I could do is at least come show my compassion and frustration and sadness,” Caliey Warren said. She held a sign that said “Chinga la Migra,” Spanish for “F**k the immigration authorities.”

Michael McDowell, a longtime activist in Minneapolis, who lives near the area, said he arrived on the scene shortly after Good was shot and was pepper sprayed by ICE agents yesterday.

He said he would like to see people organize a large-scale work strike to protest ICE’s actions.

“Everybody not showing up to work in support of all our immigrant and Latino, Muslim brothers,” would send a message that it’s not okay and “we don’t want ICE here,” McDowell said.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said during a news conference on Thursday that George Floyd’s 2020 murder “tore at the soul of who we were,” but the community healed. Walz said police also built back the trust of the community.

Minneapolis Police “Chief Brian O’Hara came in and took one of the most difficult jobs in America of building back trust in the police force in Minneapolis after Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd,” Walz said. “And he’s earned that, and he’s level and he’s fair, and he’s asking for that.”

“And so Minnesotans, I will continue to press that we be part of the investigation, that we do the investigation, so that Minnesotans can trust what the outcome is,” Walz said during the news conference, which his office said was a public safety update following Wednesday’s shooting of Renee Nicole Good by a federal ICE agent.

Acknowledging that some Minnesotans may be feeling scared, angry or hopeless in this moment, Gov. Tim Walz said all eyes are on the state to keep fighting for democracy.

Protesters have been gathering today in the Minneapolis area after a woman was shot by an ICE agent there yesterday. Now, Walz slammed what the state claims is the federal government’s decision to exclude a Minnesota agency from its investigation.

“It feels to me like we’re at one of those inflection points. That simply asking our government to give us accountability, listen to local leaders, ratchet down the rhetoric, let people feel safe in their person, and let’s let our kids go to school without fear,” the governor said, calling for people to look out for one another.

For the state of Minnesota to be able to file charges, Minnesota Department of Public Safety Commissioner Bob Jacobson said, the state would need a full investigation.

That invesigation, he said, would need to include “the opportunity to have been at the crime scene, to have had the opportunity to take a look at all the video and evidence that the FBI would have in their possession.”

As a public safety professional, Jacobson – who oversees the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) – said he would not jump to any conclusions about who was at fault.

“What I will say, though, is that unless we do that thorough investigation, unless we have access to all of that evidence, unless we have access to the agents that were involved in that, any witnesses - without any of that, we would not be able to put together a quality investigation for any prosecutor to be able to make a determination as to whether or not someone should be charged with a crime.”

Earlier on Thursday, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said it “reluctantly” withdrew from investigating the fatal ICE-involved shooting in Minneapolis after the FBI told the agency the US Attorney’s Office “had reversed course” and would no longer allow the BCA “access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews,” BCA Superintendent Drew Evans said in a statement.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap26007667457388.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-08 14:58:34.667437

It's arguably also the biggest flashpoint yet as Donald Trump's second administration has called on ICE and other agencies to pursue an aggressive deportation strategy.

Here's a look at the history of ICE and some of the major developments and controversies surrounding the agency in the first year of Trump's second term.

ICE expansion over 20 years

ICE came into being after the Homeland Security Act was enacted in 2002, as the United States sought to grapple with the consequences of the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. Individuals from four countries arrived in the U.S. beginning in 2000 and prepared and trained for the plane hijackings on 9/11.

Responsibilities and functions previously carried out by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) workforce under the aegis of the Department of Labour were reconsidered, and ICE was established in 2003 under the Department of Homeland Security, focusing on the removal of unauthorized persons in the U.S. and stamping out cross-border trafficking of migrants.

The U.S. then and now has a significant number of unauthorized persons within its borders — the total is currently estimated at around 12 million by various immigration think-tanks. While president Ronald Reagan granted amnesty to a few million undocumented immigrants in 1986, that kind of measure has not occurred since.

Both Republican and Democratic presidential administrations have utilized ICE — Barack Obama was dubbed by some critics ""the deporter-in-chief."" But from the very first moments of launching his presidential campaign in 2015, Trump has focused on illegal immigration in an unprecedented way.

Speaking to CBC's Front Burner podcast in 2025, U.S. historian Adam Goodman said that over the years, ""we've seen a real shift from the service side of the immigration bureaucracy to the enforcement side of immigration bureaucracy.""

In his first administration, Trump sought through executive orders and his own pulpit to pressure some local and state law enforcement agencies who over the years began to limit their co-operation with ICE in some circumstances.

Since capping his political comeback last year, Trump and some of his closest advisers — including Stephen Miller — have expressed a desire for one million deportations a year.

The first-year Trump budget allocated more than $170 billion US over four years for border and interior enforcement, with $75 billion going to ICE for further arrests of immigrants, including the building of more detention facilities. In an analysis critical of the administration, the liberal Brennan Center for Justice said the ICE budget for 2025, at almost $29 billion, was nearly triple the amount of the previous year's budget.

ICE tactics and arrests

A lot of attention has been focused in the past year on ICE agents wearing masks and not identifying themselves.

Todd Lyons, who has been acting ICE director since last March and is still yet to be confirmed by the Senate, has said in multiple interviews it may sometimes occur to prevent the doxxing of officers.

""I'm not a proponent of the masks. However, if that's a tool [for] the men and women of ICE to keep themselves and their families safe, then I'll allow it,"" he told CBS's Face the Nation in July.

More seriously, ICE and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agents have in some incidents employed chemical agents and flash bangs. In a raid on a Chicago apartment building targeting gang members, agents rappelled from a Black Hawk helicopter.

Lyons has said ICE is focused on detaining the worst offenders for eventual deportation, but that anyone who is in the U.S. without authorization is subject to arrest, given the administration's priorities.

Mike Fox, a legal fellow with the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank in Washington, criticized that approach in September in an interview with CBC News.

""The [deportation] numbers are going to be a lot lower if you're actually focusing on the violent people that you should be focusing on,"" he said. ""It's a lot easier to just stand outside a Home Depot and round people up.""

Cato has been among a number of think-tanks and civil rights groups to point out that the statistics provided by the federal government have shown that significant numbers of people detained by ICE have not incurred a criminal record since entering the U.S.

Lyons has pointed out that data doesn't take into account criminal records in countries of origin.

Dozens of Canadian citizens are among those who have been detained. Given the administration's goals, it's an unsurprising development — in terms of visa overstays in the U.S., Canadians have perennially ranked high on the list.

The courts have not significantly hindered the way ICE goes about its business, with progressive organizations and some Democrats panning what they now call ""Kavanaugh stops,"" since a controversial Supreme Court order in September.

""To be clear, apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion; under this Court's case law regarding immigration stops, however, it can be a 'relevant factor' when considered with other salient factors,"" Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote.

Shootings, but not indictments

Good's killing was the second fatal shooting by an ICE officer in four months. Good, a U.S. citizen, was not the target of any immigration enforcement and it's not clear what agents were doing in the Minneapolis neighbourhood.

ICE agents fatally shot Silverio Villegas González, a 38-year-old cook from Mexico, during a traffic stop in suburban Chicago on Sept. 12. The FBI and DHS have yet to release any information concerning previously announced inquiries into the shooting.

Three other people in the past eight months — two in California and one in Virginia — have died as a result of accidents while running from ICE raids.

Meanwhile, a gunman who opened fire on an ICE facility in Dallas last year killed a detainee instead of federal agents he was allegedly targeting. There were also non-fatal shooting incidents in Texas last summer near an immigration centre and a U.S. Border Patrol facility.

ICE-involved shootings before this year were rare but not unprecedented, according to The Trace, an outlet devoted to gun-related news. What is unheard of are prosecutions.

Obtaining court records from a lawsuit filed by a shooting victim, The Trace said they revealed that between 2015 and 2021, 59 shootings by ICE officers occurred across 26 U.S. states, leading to 23 fatalities.

""There's no evidence any ICE agent was indicted,"" The Trace reported.

According to a Reuters legal analysis, federal agents are generally immune from state prosecution if conducting their official duties. At the federal level, a prosecution would have to deal with the challenge of proving the officer didn't believe they were potentially facing the prospect of death or serious injury.

In terms of civil litigation, ICE agents, like police officers, are entitled to qualified immunity for on-the-job shootings, though some Democrats would like to change that.

It is also worth considering that Trump has made liberal use of his power to pardon or issue commutations to individuals accused or convicted of crimes. In his decade as a politician, Trump has, with the exception of the 2021 Capitol riot, supported aggressive law enforcement tactics.

While Trump's border czar Tom Homan said in a CBS interview on Wednesday that he wanted the investigation into Good's death to ""play out"" before making conclusive statements, the president himself and other officials have quickly sought to push a narrative that absolved the unidentified officer and questioned the victim's actions leading up to the shooting.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said on Thursday that the shooting was in response to ""an act of domestic terrorism.""","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/fba165ac-7f1c-4cee-847e-ac1d20c32c59,1767893749278/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C857%2C8231%2C4629%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2026-01-08 16:59:17.365529

NEW YORK — After a Minneapolis resident was horrifically shot and killed by a federal agent on Wednesday, and the Trump administration’s escalating attacks on immigrants, a broad coalition of New York State elected officials, legal service providers, advocates, and impacted families urged immediate and decisive state action today to protect due process through the Campaign for Access, Representation, and Equity (CARE) for Immigrant Families.

The campaign is calling for $175 million in FY27 to fund sustainable, statewide immigration legal services, along with passage of the Access to Representation Act (ARA) and the Building Up Immigrant Legal Defense Act (BUILD), to safeguard New York from federal overreach that threatens to tear families apart and destabilize communities.

The coalition of more than 100 organizations—including the Vera Institute of Justice, the New York Immigration Coalition, Immigrant Advocates Response Collaborative (Immigrant ARC), New York Civil Liberties Union, Neighbors Link, and Immigrant Children Advocates’ Relief Effort—highlighted the dramatic escalation in federal enforcement, record number of people in detention, and evisceration of due process rights.

The administration’s unprecedented $170 billion enforcement budget enables mass detention, sweeping raids, and the deployment of federal troops—creating unparalleled threats to New York’s immigrant communities. Nearly 12,800 people have been detained in New York through mid-October—more than double the number of people as the same period a year prior.

As of November, pending cases before New York State immigration courts have reached 327,000, and nearly 30 percent of those facing deportation lack legal representation. This number is even higher for detained people in New York immigration courts, with 40 percent of detained people lacking counsel—a stark indicator of an overwhelmed ecosystem now stretched beyond capacity.

In response to this deepening threat, the CARE campaign has outlined a comprehensive defense strategy, calling for

$175 million in FY27 for immigration legal services. This investment includes $85 million to sustain existing programs, $50 million for new emergency deportation defense, and $40 million to expand capacity-building and infrastructure investments.

Passing the Access to Representation Act (ARA). The ARA (A270/S141) would establish a right to counsel in immigration court, ensuring that anyone facing deportation who cannot afford a lawyer is provided one under a universal representation model.

Passing the Building Up Immigrant Legal Defense Act (BUILD). The BUILD Act (A2689/S4538) would provide funding to strengthen legal services infrastructure through workforce development, rural expansion, and the integration of social workers to coordinate client support.

“While Donald Trump continues to rip apart families and ravage immigrant communities, New York will fight back and defend our neighbors,” said Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris. ""We must immediately take every possible action to establish protections in the law against the inhumane abuses we are witnessing more and more every day.”

“As the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda attacks immigrant New Yorkers, we must defend immigrant communities and meet this moment with action,” said Assemblymember Catalina Cruz. “New York has always been a sanctuary for those seeking safety, opportunity, and justice. But without legal representation, too many of our immigrant neighbors are forced to fight for their futures alone in a system stacked against them. Having a trusted and reputable immigration attorney is more essential than ever for reducing wrongful deportations and being able to understand and defend one’s rights in the immigration system. Our state must invest $175 million in legal services to ensure that no New Yorker is left without a fighting chance. Passing proven and effective legislation like the Access to Representation Act and the BUILD Act is not just about policy—it’s about standing up for the fundamental right to due process. This is how we push back against the injustice of a federal agenda that separates families, uproots people from their communities, and is against all that New York stands for.”

“As the Trump White House continues to throw billions of taxpayer dollars toward a hostile detention and deportation campaign, law-abiding immigrants are often left to face a chaotic and overwhelmed court system without access to legal counsel,” said State Senator John Liu. “New York needs to fight back by fully funding immigration legal services, establishing a right to counsel, and bolstering workforce development throughout immigration court. The Access to Representation Act and BUILD Act are not only matters of due process but a reflection of our core values of liberty and justice for all. Many thanks to Senator Mike Gianaris, [Assemblymember Catalina] Cruz, and the thousands of advocates across the state who are relentless in the fight to make sure these critical investments are available to help protect immigrant New Yorkers.”

""President Trump’s escalated enforcement and rhetoric over the last year have placed millions of New York families in jeopardy, creating a real risk of mass deportations and separations that is endangering our communities and New York’s future,” said Kelsey Pirnak, advocacy manager for the Vera Institute of Justice’s Advancing Universal Representation Initiative. “New York State leaders face a definitive choice: stand by as neighbors’ lives are upended or take bold, protective action. We must see unwavering investment in legal defense. That means fully funding immigration legal services at $175 million and passing the Access to Representation Act and the BUILD Act—essential measures to ensure every person who needs legal representation in immigration court in New York receives it.”

“Legal representation can determine whether or not immigrant families are separated, lives are uprooted, or a loved one is deported to a country where their life is at risk,” said Zach Ahmad, senior policy counsel at the New York Civil Liberties Union. “As federal immigration authorities aggressively ramp up arrests to meet cruel immigration quotas, New York lawmakers must step up and pass the Access to Representation Act and the BUILD Act to ensure legal funding is guaranteed for immigrants who need it. Access to a lawyer shouldn’t be incumbent on how much money someone has in their pocket.”

“Immigrant New Yorkers face unprecedented threats to their safety, the well-being of their families, and their ability to stay in their communities. Each day brings escalating violence, more neighbors being abducted and further erosion of due process, as the federal government advances its inhumane and arbitrary deportation agenda,” said Murad Awawdeh, President and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition. “Access to legal counsel in immigration court is the difference between family unity and family separation. We call on our lawmakers to ensure that all New Yorkers in immigration court have equitable access to legal services if they cannot afford it. By making an investment of $175 million in immigration legal services and critical deportation defense work, as well as passing the Access to Representation and BUILD Acts, New York can guarantee no immigrant New Yorker faces immigration court without life-saving representation.”

“The Trump administration is pushing the immigration system to the brink through deliberate cruelty,” said Ellen Pachnanda, CEO of Immigrant ARC. “With the system stacked against them, families and communities pay the price. Without state investment, federal authorities will continue to swiftly deport individuals, tearing families apart. The government shows up with lawyers; families show up alone—setting them up for failure. Fully funding immigration legal services—and passing the Access to Representation Act and BUILD Act—is how New York makes it clear: due process is not optional and justice cannot be selective.”

“Right now, children are being moved through an immigration system that was never designed for them—expected to appear in court, make life-altering legal decisions, and navigate complex processes without an attorney or a trusted adult in their corner,” said Sierra Kraft, executive director of the Immigrant Children Advocates’ Relief Effort (ICARE) Coalition. “At ICARE, we see every day how harmful that is for young people, particularly those navigating trauma, family separation, and high-stakes legal deadlines at a critical stage in their development. The ARA/BUILD Act is urgently needed because it invests in the systems that allow children and youth to stabilize, remain with family, and move forward with dignity. Access to counsel is what separates a child being processed by an enforcement system from a child being protected within it.”

""As we see immigrants across New York facing a widespread federal deportation and detention agenda, the need for immigration legal services is more critical than ever,"" said Karin Anderson Ponzer, director of legal services at Neighbors Link. ""In New York, we have the opportunity to be a national leader in defending the rights of immigrants. Fully funding immigration legal services at $175 million and passing the Access to Representation Act and BUILD Act is a critical step in protecting the rights of immigrant families so they can stay together, continue to work, go to school, and remain in their communities.”

Background

Currently, people facing deportation are not guaranteed a right to appointed counsel. Instead, many who cannot afford to hire legal representation are forced to defend themselves against a trained government lawyer. Investing in legal defense will promote fairness, family unity, and economic stability in a time when immigrants are at acute risk from federal attacks.

Funding for new and expanded immigration legal services is a proven solution to meet the needs of people seeking stability and a chance to work and support their families, protect New Yorkers at risk of deportation, and put into place long-term infrastructure to equip New York to support communities with life-saving legal services. Passing the Access to Representation Act and the BUILD Act will address the uncertainty surrounding the state budget’s annual funding for immigrant legal services by creating a right to an attorney for any New Yorker facing deportation who cannot afford to hire one on their own.

As the Trump administration escalates sweeping arrests and mass deportations, these measures will protect New Yorkers from aggressive federal actions and will promote economic stability as the state faces labor shortages and declining population growth. Investments in legal services will promote community safety and economic stability across New York by ensuring that more parents remain home with their children, more essential workers remain on the job, and more business owners continue to invest in and support our communities.

About the Campaign for Access, Representation, and Equity (CARE) for Immigrant Families: The Vera Institute of Justice, the New York Immigration Coalition, Immigrant ARC, New York Civil Liberties Union, Neighbors Link, and Immigrant Children Advocates’ Relief Effort lead CARE for Immigrant Families, along with a coalition of more than 100 leading organizations, religious groups, labor unions, and elected officials united to call for a $175 million investment in immigration legal services and passage of the Access to Representation Act (ARA) and Building Up Immigrant Legal Defense (BUILD) Act. The ARA (A270/S141) will guarantee access to legal representation for people at risk of deportation in New York. Sponsored by Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris and Assemblymember Catalina Cruz, the legislation would be the first in the nation to create a statewide right to legal representation for people facing deportation who cannot afford it, whether they have recently arrived in the state or have been New Yorkers for decades. The BUILD Act (A2689/S4538) is a companion bill to the ARA that creates a dedicated four-year fund to strengthen New York’s immigration legal services infrastructure, sponsored by Senator John Liu and Assemblymember Catalina Cruz.

Jan 8 (Reuters) - The Trump administration and U.S. Congress are launching a plan this week to overturn former President Joe Biden's mining ban in northern Minnesota and prevent future administrations from taking similar steps, according to officials and documents reviewed by Reuters.

The move has been in development for much of the past year and involves ​a complex series of legislative steps that will benefit Antofagasta's Twin Metals copper, cobalt and nickel project, one of North America's largest untapped reserves of those critical minerals.

Details of the ‌plan have not previously been reported.

It marks a refocus of sorts by Trump on U.S. domestic mining projects, even as his administration continues to angle for access to minerals in Greenland, Ukraine and elsewhere.

The Minnesota plan is almost certain to further escalate ‌tension over where and how to procure minerals crucial for the electrified economy and national defense. Copper, nickel and cobalt are used to build electric vehicles, AI data centers, wind turbines, weaponry and myriad other devices.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD OMISSION

Biden in 2023 blocked mining on 225,504 acres in the Superior National Forest for 20 years, citing environmental concerns and a belief that the region's economy would benefit more from recreational activity than mining.

The mining ban was filed in the Federal Register, which tracks actions by the executive branch, but not the Congressional Record, which tracks legislative moves and serves as an official notice to Congress.

Under a 1976 law known as the Federal ⁠Lands Policy and Management Act, a president is required to notify Congress ‌of public land orders that affect more than 5,000 acres.

Because Biden did not file the notice in the Congressional Record, Trump's Interior Department is doing so now with the expectation that it will be rejected by Congress.

The U.S. House of Representatives was informed earlier this week by the Interior Department. The notice was ‍then sent to Vice President JD Vance, who is head of the U.S. Senate, and is under review by the U.S. Senate parliamentarian.

If approved by the parliamentarian, which is expected by Friday, Congress would have 60 days to approve or reject the plan with a simple majority. That vote would not be subject to a filibuster.

Minnesota Congressman Pete Stauber, a Republican who represents northern Minnesota, plans by Friday to introduce legislation aiming to reject the mining ban. ​If Congress and Trump approve, which is expected in the Republican-controlled body, a future president could not replicate Biden's ban because of a provision in the 1996 Congressional Review Act.

Save the Boundary Waters, ‌a conservation group, said Stauber was using an unprecedented approach to try to force the mine's approval.

""And for what? To benefit a Chilean mining company that sends its minerals to China, will destroy America's most visited wilderness area and leave the mess up to the American and Minnesotan taxpayers,"" said Ingrid Lyons, the group's executive director.

MINING LEASES COULD BE REISSUED

The complex legislative plan came together after efforts failed to include the measure in Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" signed into law last July, congressional staffers said.

""We have industries here in our country that need these critical minerals. We must never rely on foreign adversaries like China for supply,"" Stauber, who is also chair of the U.S. House Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources, told Reuters.

The White House was not immediately available to comment.

If the mining ban is lifted, the Trump ⁠administration would then be free to reissue mining leases for Chile-based Antofagasta, which has been trying to develop the ​mine for decades on land controlled by the federal government. The mine would still need to undergo an environmental review and ​obtain permits.

Stauber said he has been told by the Trump administration that it is working on reissuing the leases, but he did not have additional details.

Antofagasta's Twin Metals unit said it expects to get the leases back in the near future and that it is ""very appreciative of Congress for their efforts to overturn an unnecessary ‍and detrimental action that locked out a significant domestic ⁠source of critical minerals.""

The leases themselves have been a political hot potato since first issued in 1966. Former President Barack Obama took steps to block their re-issuance, before Trump renewed them in his first term, only to have Biden cancel them.

No mining has taken place at the site.

TENSIONS BETWEEN MINING, OUTDOOR RECREATION

The underground Twin Metals mine would, if built, be a major U.S. ⁠source of copper, cobalt and nickel. The only existing U.S. nickel mine is set to close later this decade.

The region is visited each year by more than 150,000 outdoor enthusiasts, many of whom have long feared that any mine disaster could ‌pollute rivers and quickly spread through the 1.1 million acres of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and into the Great Lakes.

Antofagasta has long said it would use the ‌most advanced equipment to protect the environment.

The event happened Wednesday evening at the Henry M. Jackson Federal Building in Seattle.

RELATED: Woman killed by ICE officers in Minneapolis; Mayor tells ICE to 'get the f***' out

The shooting occurred on Wednesday morning at the corner of 34th and Portland Avenue in Minneapolis.

According to preliminary information, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said, the woman was sitting in her vehicle blocking the roadway when a federal law enforcement officer approached on foot.

When the vehicle began to drive away, at least two shots were fired, and the vehicle crashed on the side of the road.

According to the Department of Homeland Security Spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin, the woman was shot and killed after she allegedly attempted to run over law enforcement officers.

In a post on X, McLaughlin said ICE officers were “conducting targeted operations when rioters began blocking ICE officers and one of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them—an act of domestic terrorism.”

“The officer, fearing for his life and the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots,” McLaughlin said, adding that the woman was hit and killed.

In a press conference, Sec. Noem confirmed the officer, who was allegedly hit by the woman's car, has been treated and released from the hospital.

The Trump administration is backing the officer who fatally shot the woman, saying that it was an act of defense. Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said the officers were carrying out lawful enforcement operations, and that the woman had committed “an act of domestic terrorism” by attempting to run over the officer.

President Donald Trump claimed the woman “viciously ran over the ICE Officer.”

In response, emergency protests have erupted in Minneapolis and are expected to continue through Jan. 11.

The Seattle groups are joining the Legalization 4 All Network in calling for an immediate end to ICE raids and mass deportations.

They are also demanding justice and accountability for the woman who was killed, including the release of the name of the ICE agent involved and the names of all agents participating in such operations.

""What ice is doing is unacceptable its horrible, and it has to stop,” said Robert Engel, a spokesperson for the two organizations.

A few hundred protestors gathered at the demonstration on Wednesday evening by around 6:30 p.m., where megaphones, signs of all sizes, and messages sent a clear message across clearly:

“ICE has gone too far; there’s absolutely no reason for anybody to be murdered by ICE, in Minneapolis today, absolutely no reason,” said Raleigh Watts, a lifelong Seattle resident.

Others contended more aggressively that the shooting must made every citizen angry.

""Americans need to do something about it, or the lies and the bloodshed will continue,” said a protestor named Sam, while holding the end of a large banner that read 'Abolish ICE'.

Others, like Bennett Haselton, from Bellevue, say that the deadly shooting is just another symptom of the larger ongoing campaign by Homeland Security and ICE in President Trump's administration to target immigrant communities.

“It’s ridiculous, it’s racist, it’s xenophobic, it’s fomenting hatred toward specific ethnic groups, as well as fomenting hatred toward undocumented people in particular,” said Haselton.

Towards the end of the demonstration, the large crowd marched up Marion Street, to 4th Avenue, before going north for one block, and then heading back over to the Federal office building.

Seattle Police had an SUV following the group to ensure the march went smoothly.

Trump has linked U.S. tariffs on India to India’s purchases of Russian oil, using tariffs as a pressure tool.
How Could U.S. Tariffs On India Affect Indian Americans And The Indian Diaspora?
It also makes it easier for human rights to be treated as “optional” or “inconvenient.” Why Are Human Rights Groups Mentioned In A Post About Trump Modi Remarks?
When geopolitics becomes transactional—trade penalties, arms sales, access games—human rights often get sidelined.","Donald Trump gave us a very clear picture this week of how he wants Americans to think about India—and it’s not “shared democratic values,” “people-to-people ties,” or even “strategic partnership.” It’s dominance.

On January 5, 2026, talking to reporters on Air Force One, Trump praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi as “a good guy,” and then immediately reframed the relationship as something Modi needed to manage around Trump’s personal approval: it was “important to make me happy,” Trump said, because the U.S. can “raise tariffs… very quickly.”

On January 6, 2026, speaking at the House GOP Member Retreat, Trump doubled down on the same story—only more theatrical. He claimed Modi came to him asking, “Sir, may I see you please,” and then added that Modi is “not that happy with me” because India is “paying a lot of tariffs” tied to Russian oil purchases.

We’re not interested in treating this as gossip or “just Trump being Trump.” These comments matter because they show how easily a relationship that affects more than 1.4 billion people can be reduced to a reality-TV power play—tariffs as punishment, flattery as currency, and human rights as the first thing thrown off the boat.

This isn’t only a clash of personalities. It’s a model of politics—strongman competition—that treats trade and migration as weapons and turns diplomacy into humiliation theater. The cost tends to move downward: onto workers, migrants, minorities, and families.

What Trump actually did: turn a complex relationship into a loyalty test

Let’s name the pattern.

Trump isn’t talking about India as a place with workers, farmers, students, journalists, or minorities who deserve protection and dignity. He’s talking about India as a lever in his own performance of power: Who’s in trouble with me? Who’s trying to please me? Who’s paying a price?

In the Air Force One remarks, Trump tied tariffs to India’s oil trade with Russia and framed India’s choices as a response to his displeasure. In the retreat speech, he personalized it further—Modi as the person coming to seek an audience, Modi as the person who must be unhappy now that the tariffs are high.

This isn’t just undignified. It’s dangerous, because it normalizes the idea that international relationships should run on humiliation and coercion rather than law, rights, and accountability.

And it’s not hypothetical. Reuters reported Trump has already doubled import tariffs on Indian goods to 50% (as punishment connected to Russian oil purchasing), and that analysts describe the tariff structure as including a portion tied specifically to Russian crude. The Indian Express summarized the tariff setup as 50% total, with 25% described as a reciprocal levy and 25% tied to purchases of Russian oil.

When leaders play hardball on TV, real people absorb the consequences—especially workers in export-heavy industries, families facing price shocks, and communities that already live with economic precarity.

Here’s the part diaspora progressives recognize immediately

Trump’s remarks about Modi don’t function as ordinary diplomacy so much as a familiar genre in today’s global politics: strongman competition. It’s a contest over status and dominance—who gets to appear as the decisive “protector,” who sets the terms, who gets framed as conceding ground. The narrative is masculinist and dated, but it has returned to the center of international life with surprising force: policy becomes secondary to performance, and entire populations become props in a story about “great men.”

This dynamic lands in distinct ways across the Indian diaspora—and not only as symbolism. Diaspora communities understand, almost instinctively, that when leaders turn international relations into a dominance ritual, someone else pays: prices shift, contracts get canceled, uncertainty spreads through supply chains, and the costs migrate downward to exporters, workers, and small businesses. In other words, this is not just a clash of egos; it is “punish the economy to punish the government,” and everyone can predict who pays. Not presidents and prime ministers—shop owners, factory workers, farmers tied to exports, and households dealing with higher costs and uncertainty.

Many diaspora progressives will read the spectacle as a kind of exposure—less “justice” than revelation. If Modi’s political brand has been marketed internationally as strength and inevitability, there is a bitter clarity in seeing that brand treated as disposable within Trump’s own hierarchy. It underscores a core problem with strongman politics: the currency is dominance, and dominance always requires a target. When the goal is to appear powerful, there is no stable endpoint—only the next opportunity to demonstrate who can coerce whom, and whose economy can be made to flinch.

For sections of the diaspora that support Modi, Trump’s tone can register as a provocation. The same “strength” aesthetic celebrated in India—often alongside minimization of how that strength is exercised against minorities, dissenters, journalists, and civil society—can feel intolerable when the hierarchy flips internationally and Modi is positioned as the one being spoken down to. That reversal is instructive: it shows how quickly the language of pride and national dignity becomes entwined with a preference for hierarchy, rather than a commitment to rights—and how quickly “strength” talk becomes detached from the real question of who bears its costs.

The broader risk is that this style of politics normalizes a framework where relationships between states are managed through public humiliation, transactional loyalty, and punitive leverage, while human rights are treated as peripheral. Trump can call Modi “a good guy” and still reinforce a corrosive model of governance: personal loyalty over institutions, spectacle over accountability, punishment over persuasion. The effect is not simply rhetorical. It shifts what counts as “success” in foreign policy—from measurable improvements in safety and freedom to the optics of dominance—and that is precisely the terrain on which rights are most easily abandoned, while exporters, workers, and ordinary families are left carrying the bill.

The human rights cost of “transactional friendship”

There’s another reason this moment lands differently from an Indian diasporic perspective: when Washington treats India primarily as (a) a market for weapons or (b) a pawn in great-power competition, human rights become easy to downgrade into “noise.” But the human rights situation is not background noise. Human Rights Watch has warned about the high cost of dissent in India, including the misuse of broad laws that fall heavily on critics and minorities, and Freedom House continues to rate India “Partly Free.” These are mainstream, documented concerns—not niche talking points.

So when Trump turns the U.S.–India relationship into a dominance ritual—tariffs up, tariffs down; access granted, access denied—the conversation that gets crowded out is the one that matters most: Are people safer? Are minorities protected? Can journalists report? Can civil society breathe? And just as crucially: who is being sacrificed so two leaders can look “tough”? In this standoff, the real victims are often Indian families on both sides of the border who placed their faith in these strongman narratives—and are now paying the price.

That’s not “anti-India.” It’s pro-democracy, pro-people, and pro-rights—consistently, not only when it flatters whoever is in power.

About the Russia-oil piece: what’s real, what’s claimed, and what’s at stake

Trump is using India’s purchases of Russian oil as the headline justification for trade punishment.

We can hold two truths at once: Russia’s war economy is propped up in part by energy revenue, and countries’ purchase decisions matter. But we should also be clear that the energy priorities of the world’s most developed nations do not automatically take moral or political precedence over everyone else’s—especially when those same nations have long histories of climate and extraction policies that shifted costs onto the Global South. A rights-based approach has to reckon with uneven development, domestic energy needs, and the real distributional impacts of abrupt price shocks. That’s exactly why tariffs-as-shaming is not a serious human rights policy: when it’s delivered as a personalized punishment ritual, it treats entire populations as collateral while sidestepping the harder work of coordinated, transparent strategies that reduce war financing without reproducing global hierarchies.

Trump claimed India has reduced Russian oil purchases. Separately, Reuters reported that India’s imports of Russian oil may drop sharply in January 2026, after Reliance said it isn’t expecting Russian crude deliveries that month. That’s a concrete development—but it still doesn’t justify turning diplomacy into a public hazing ritual.

We should be skeptical of any approach that uses “humanitarian” or “anti-war” language as cover for ego-driven economic coercion—because the human rights results tend to be accidental, not designed.

Two Leaders And Two Political Machines That Thrive On Spectacle And “Strength”

What all of this reveals is a shared architecture: two leaders and two political machines that thrive on spectacle, hierarchy, and the promise of “strength,” even when the costs are pushed onto ordinary people. Trump’s language turns diplomacy into a dominance ritual; Modi’s brand of authority has long leaned on a similar aesthetic at home. When those logics collide, it doesn’t produce clarity or peace—it produces policy-by-posture: tariff threats that ricochet into prices and jobs, immigration moves that strand families and workers, and a public atmosphere that makes racism feel licensed.

For the Indian diaspora, that’s the hard moral test. We are close enough to feel the consequences and influential enough to shape the narrative. If we accept a world where leaders “win” by humiliating each other, we also accept a world where rights become conditional—for migrants in chains, for workers caught in trade crossfire, for students and journalists facing repression, for minorities made into bargaining chips, and for diaspora communities targeted by hate when politics becomes punishment.

A better U.S.–India relationship—one worthy of the word partnership—would be boring in the right ways: less swagger, more rules; less ego, more institutions; less coercion, more accountability. It would measure success by whether people are safer and freer, not by who looked dominant on camera. And it would insist on the same democratic baseline everywhere: pluralism, civil liberties, and minority rights are not side issues to be traded away for a short-term show of force.

FAQ: Trump Modi Remarks, U.S. Tariffs On India, Russian Oil, H-1B, And Anti-Indian Hate

What Did Trump Say About Modi And India This Week?

Trump framed Modi and India through a dominance lens—presenting U.S.–India relations as something managed through personal approval, public pressure, and consequences. The underlying message wasn’t “partnership,” but leverage: who sets terms, who gets treated as subordinate, and who pays when they don’t comply.

Why Are There U.S. Tariffs On India Right Now?

Trump has linked U.S. tariffs on India to India’s purchases of Russian oil, using tariffs as a pressure tool. Whatever the stated rationale, tariffs are a blunt instrument: they create uncertainty quickly and can trigger cascading effects through trade relationships.

How Do U.S. Tariffs On India Affect Indian Exports And Jobs?

Tariffs raise the cost of Indian goods entering the U.S. market, which can reduce demand, cancel contracts, and squeeze margins. That pressure often moves down the supply chain—impacting exporters, smaller suppliers, and workers before it meaningfully impacts political leaders.

How Could U.S. Tariffs On India Affect Indian Americans And The Indian Diaspora?

Diaspora communities are part of the connective tissue of US–India relations. Trade shocks can hit diaspora-run businesses, import/export networks, and family finances. Just as importantly, tariff showdowns can harden identity politics in diaspora spaces—turning “pride” into a loyalty test and crowding out serious conversations about rights and democratic norms.

Why Is Russian Oil Linked To India Tariffs?

Russia’s war economy benefits from energy revenue, and countries’ energy purchases matter. But using tariffs as public punishment isn’t the same as building effective, equitable policy. A serious approach would include coordinated strategies that reduce war financing while also addressing uneven development, energy constraints, price stability, and transition support—so ordinary people aren’t treated as collateral.

What Does This Mean For US–India Relations Long-Term?

When leaders conduct US–India relations as a dominance contest, institutions and norms weaken. The relationship becomes more volatile—less predictable for businesses and families, and less able to address shared challenges like climate, migration, and regional stability. It also makes it easier for human rights to be treated as “optional” or “inconvenient.”

Why Are Human Rights Groups Mentioned In A Post About Trump Modi Remarks?

Because the stakes aren’t just tone; they’re outcomes. When geopolitics becomes transactional—trade penalties, arms sales, access games—human rights often get sidelined. The questions that should remain central are: Are minorities protected? Can journalists report? Can civil society operate without fear? Is democracy expanding to include more people, not fewer?

What’s Happening With Indian Immigrants And Deportations?

Reports have described Indian undocumented migrants deported under visibly punitive conditions (including shackling), as well as third-country deportation tactics that can leave people effectively restricted or detained far from home. These practices raise basic questions of dignity, due process, and state violence—exactly the issues that get ignored when diplomacy becomes a strongman performance.

How Do H-1B Changes Affect Indian Tech Workers?

Policy shifts and enforcement uncertainty can strand Indian workers on either side of the border—unable to travel without risking status, unable to continue jobs, or trapped in long backlogs that shape life decisions for years. This isn’t just a labor-market story; it’s a family stability and rights story.

Is Anti-Indian Hate Rising—And Why Does This Climate Matter?

When leaders and political ecosystems normalize scapegoating and punishment politics, it can intensify a climate where anti-Indian racism spreads faster—online and offline. Slurs and harassment campaigns aren’t just “internet noise”; they shape what people feel permitted to say and do to Indian and South Asian communities, including migrants and visa workers. It is up to us to refuse loyalty-test politics. Ask who is paying for tariff shocks and immigration punishment. Challenge anti-Indian racism directly. And insist on a consistent democratic baseline: rights aren’t a reward for loyalty; they’re a constraint on power—at home in the diaspora, in Indi and across South Asia — and in the international order.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d45b55d7563de000169a046/66900c4f6a6414762936be39/695fa44eec0d4c7dc98f818b/1767878793178/January+26+EventsHolidays+%281%29.png?format=1500w,N,,2026-01-08 16:59:02.970266

Kayla Epstein

The fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis has sparked protests and placed increased scrutiny on the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE).

ICE has made thousands of arrests since Trump returned to the White House, often in public settings.

Those actions have increasingly brought its agents into communities across the country, leading to resistance from some local residents who oppose their operations.

What is ICE and when was it formed?

ICE is taking the lead in carrying out the Trump administration's mass deportation initiative, which was a central promise of Donald Trump's election campaign.

The US president has significantly expanded ICE, its budget and its mission since returning to the White House. The agency enforces immigration laws and conducts investigations into undocumented immigration. It also plays a role in removing undocumented immigrants from the US.

ICE was formed as part of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, a response to the terror attacks on 11 September 2001. The legislation created the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), with ICE as one of its subsidiary agencies.

What powers do ICE agents have to arrest people?

ICE sees its mission as encompassing both public safety and national security. However, its powers are different than the average local police department in the US.

Its agents have the power to stop, detain and arrest people they suspect of being in the US illegally. They can detain US citizens in limited circumstances, such as if a person interferes with an arrest, assaults an officer, or ICE suspect the person of being in the US illegally.

Despite this, according to news organisation ProPublica, there were more than 170 incidents during the first nine months of Trump's presidency in which federal agents held US citizens against their will.

These cases included Americans they had suspected of being undocumented immigrants.

What powers does ICE have to use force?

ICE's use of force actions are governed by a combination of the US Constitution, US law and the Department of Homeland Security's own policy guidelines.

Under the US constitution, law enforcement ""can only use deadly force if the person poses a serious danger to them or other people, or the person has committed a violent crime"", said Chris Slobogin, director of the criminal justice programme at Vanderbilt University Law School.

But the US Supreme Court has historically granted broad leniency to officers making in-the-moment decisions without the benefit of hindsight.

A DHS policy memo from 2023 states that federal officers ""may use deadly force only when necessary"" when they have ""a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury"" to themself or another person.

Where does ICE operate?

Typically, ICE operates inside the US, with some staffing abroad. It's sister agency, US Customs and Border Protection, technically patrols the US borders.

But those roles have become increasingly blurred, as the Trump administration pulled agents from a range of federal law enforcement agencies to participate in immigration enforcement. Border Patrol officers increasingly operate within the US, taking part in raids with ICE.

ICE and other agencies have deployed hundreds of officers to cities like Los Angeles, Chicago and now Minneapolis, in partnership with other federal law enforcement agencies.

As many as 2,000 federal officers will deploy to Minneapolis as part of the latest operation, the Associated Press reported.

What happens to people who are detained by ICE?

The scale of Trump-era deportations have been significant.

The administration said it had deported 605,000 people between 20 January and 10 December 2025. It also said 1.9 million immigrants had ""voluntarily self-deported"", following an aggressive public awareness campaign encouraging people to leave the country on their own to avoid arrest or detention.

An immigrant who encounters ICE can face a variety of outcomes.

Sometimes an individual is temporarily held, then released after questioning. In other circumstances, ICE will detain and transfer that person to a larger detention facility, of which there are several throughout the US.

While many immigrants continue to fight for legal status while detained, if they are unsuccessful, they may ultimately be deported.

About 65,000 people were in ICE detention as of 30 November 2025, according to data obtained by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse's immigration project, a compendium of government data from Syracuse University.

Immigration lawyers have told the BBC that, once ICE detains an individual, it can sometimes take days for families or lawyers to find out where they are.

What are the criticisms of ICE and what opposition have its agents met?

Many communities have pushed back when ICE and partner agencies like the Border Patrol carry out operations.

It is now common for residents to film ICE agents as they carry out arrests. Some encounters between ICE and the public have become aggressive or violent.

During ICE operations in Chicago, Illinois, a collective of media organisations sued the Border Patrol. They alleged agents used improper force against journalists, religious leaders and protesters. A federal judge sided with the group, before an appeals court overturned the decision.

The Minneapolis shooting is not the first time an individual has been injured by gunfire during an immigration enforcement operation.

There were two incidents in Los Angeles in October in which agents shot at drivers, the Los Angeles Times reported. DHS said in both instances that the drivers had threatened the officers with their vehicles.

ICE officers, and other immigration agents, have been criticised for wearing masks while carrying out their operations. DHS officials have defended the practice, saying it protects agents from doxing or harassment.

Tiffany Wertheimer

The woman shot dead by a federal immigration agent in Minneapolis has been identified as Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three who had just moved to the city.

She was a prize-winning poet and a hobby guitarist, who city leaders have said was there as a legal observer of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activities.

But the Trump administration has called her a ""domestic terrorist"".

Good's death has sparked protests across the country, with many people holding signs that read ""Justice for Renee"".

Her mother, Donna Ganger, told the Minnesota Star Tribune that her daughter was ""probably terrified"" during the confrontation with officers that saw her fatally shot and that she was ""one of the kindest people I've ever known"".

""She was extremely compassionate,"" Ganger told the daily newspaper. ""She's taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.""

Her father, Tim Ganger, told the Washington Post that ""she had a good life, but a hard life"".

A fundraiser for Good's family, which was set up with a target of $50,000 (£37,000), raised more than $500,000 in 15 hours.

In what appears to be Good's Instagram account, which has now been made private, Good described herself as a ""poet and writer and wife and mom"", who was ""experiencing Minneapolis"".

A US citizen, Good was originally from Colorado Springs and had moved to Minneapolis just last year from Kansas City.

The Minnesota Star Tribune reports that she used to host a podcast with her second husband, Tim Macklin, who died in 2023. They had a son together, who is now six years old, Macklin's father told the newspaper.

She had two other children with her first husband, who spoke to US media on condition that his name was not used. He said that Good was not an activist and that she was a devoted Christian who went to Northern Ireland on youth missions when she was younger.

She had previously worked as a dental assistant and at a credit union, but had mainly been a stay-at-home mum in recent years, according to the Associated Press.

Good studied creative writing at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, and in 2020 she won an undergraduate prize from the Academy of American Poets for her piece entitled On Learning to Dissect Fetal Pigs.

""When she is not writing, reading, or talking about writing, she has movie marathons and makes messy art with her daughter and two sons,"" her biography from the prize reads, as quoted in US media. It seems to have now been removed.

Good graduated the same year from the university's College of Arts and Letters with a degree in English.

Its president said in a statement that her sudden death was ""yet another clear example that fear and violence have sadly become commonplace in our nation"".

""May Renee's life be a reminder of what unites us: freedom, love, and peace,"" Old Dominion University president Brian Hemphill wrote.

Several state leaders have said that Good was at the scene of an ICE raid in the south of Minneapolis as a legal observer - a volunteer who monitors police and security forces at protests and operations.

Good's mother told the Minnesota Star Tribune that her daughter was ""not part of anything"" that involved challenging ICE agents.

But White House officials, including the president, have said Good was not simply observing, but also interfering in the officers' work.

US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Good had been ""stalking and impeding their work"" all day by ""blocking them in"" with her car and ""shouting at them"".

Good ""weaponised her vehicle"", Noem told reporters, and then tried to run over one of the officers ""in an attempt to kill or cause bodily harm to agents, an act of domestic terrorism"".

The ICE agent feared for his life, Noem said, and ""fired defensive shots"".

This account was backed up by Trump, who wrote on Truth Social that ""the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting"".

He called her a ""professional agitator"" who ""violently, willfully, and viciously"" ran over an ICE officer.

But the city's mayor said the agent who shot Good had acted recklessly.

""Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly: that is bullshit,"" Jacob Frey said. ""This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.""

The proposed spending bill would provide billions to private contractors already profiting from the windfall of funds DHS received last summer, including for private prisons, militarized immigration policing, and surveillance companies. Over the last year, we have seen the danger of aggressive immigration policing, leading to the detention of longtime residents, children, and even U.S. citizens. Passing this bill and giving DHS more money to detain our neighbors is dangerous and may lead to irreversible harm.

Congress reportedly is nearing an agreement to fund DHS for 44,500 immigration detention beds, allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to abduct and deport more people at any given day than ever before. This number is up from 41,500 beds appropriated for FY24 and would be layered on top of the beds ICE is already spending on with the unprecedented $45 billion that Congress allocated as part of the 2025 reconciliation bill. This is especially alarming given reports that ICE is planning to erect new warehouse gulags for potentially over 80,000 people at a time. At Fort Bliss, the nation’s largest detention site, we have already seen people exposed to brutal conditions, including sexual abuse, overcrowding, and inadequate food; we expect these warehouses to similarly be sites of humanitarian catastrophe and immense suffering.

ICE is currently detaining a record breaking population of over 68,000 people with deadly consequences – six people died in ICE custody in December 2025 alone, during the deadliest year for people in detention in decades. Further, there is also nothing in this bill that prevents the administration from using this added funding to detain families, including young children, hundreds of whom have been detained for months in facilities without safe drinking water, medical care, education, or access to lawyers. This is a system that needs oversight, not another windfall in funds.

The Department of Homeland Security plans to pause operations in Chicago — where Gregory Bovino, a Border Patrol official, has led controversial arrest efforts — to support the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota. Border Patrol officials also plan to send all nonlethal weapons housed in Chicago to Minnesota, according to the documents.

The increased presence of Border Patrol agents is expected to last through the weekend, with a planned return to their cities on Sunday. The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on the plans.

The surge of Border Patrol agents in the Twin Cities comes as local officials have called on immigration officers to leave Minneapolis after the killing of Renee Nicole Good on Wednesday.

Federal officials have said that Ms. Good, a U.S. citizen who lived in Minneapolis, tried to use her vehicle to run over law enforcement officers before she was fatally shot by an ICE officer. State and local officials have disputed federal accounts of the shooting.

Surges of immigration agents have at times staged dramatic raids in recent months in a number of Democratic-led cities, including Los Angeles, Portland and Washington, D.C. The deadly encounter in Minneapolis was at least the ninth shooting by an ICE officer since September. The immigration enforcement actions have prompted backlash and protests in those cities, and federal officials say the heated discourse has led to more threats against ICE agents.

Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis suggested that the shooting on Wednesday was the result of reckless actions by an ICE officer. Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, a Democrat, posted on social media about the administration’s account of events: “Don’t believe this propaganda machine.”

The Department of Homeland Security said this week that it had ramped up its presence in the region and deployed 2,000 law enforcement officers to the Twin Cities. Despite calls by local officials to leave, homeland security officials have pledged to continue operations in Minnesota.

Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, said in an interview with Fox News on Thursday that immigration officers briefly paused their work after the shooting but were continuing operations in the region.

“We’re going to keep doing the work,” Mr. Lyons said.

The Trump administration has recently focused on Minnesota after fraud investigations into a Covid-19 program intended to feed children and other safety-net programs that were overseen by the administration of Mr. Walz, who on Monday dropped his bid for re-election.

More than 90 people have been charged with felonies in the federal fraud cases. Most of the defendants are of Somali origin. President Trump has used xenophobic language in recent weeks to attack Somalis living in the United States, saying, “We don’t want them in our country.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/08/multimedia/08DC-bp-minn-ltpj/08DC-bp-minn-ltpj-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 12:58:47.090545

DOJ’s failure to act signals a troubling abdication of its authority to enforce the constitutional limits of federal agents’ coercive power.
Select Incidents Meriting Investigation Over the past seven months, many incidents involving federal immigration agents’ force have been documented on video.
Local prosecutors face significant legal hurdles in bringing charges against federal officials for violating state law: where federal agents’ actions are authorized by federal law and “necessary and proper” for fulfilling their federal duties, they may be immune from prosecution under the Supremacy Clause.
Other states and cities have created online portals that residents can use to report misconduct by federal agents.","On Wednesday morning in Minneapolis, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent shot and killed a woman in her car during a federal immigration enforcement operation. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials characterized the shooting as a response to “an act of domestic terrorism,” stating the woman “weaponized her vehicle” and attempted to “run over” officers. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has disputed that account, describing the incident as “an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying.” Governor Tim Walz described it as “totally avoidable.” The FBI and Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension initially announced they were jointly investigating the matter. Within hours, the U.S. Attorney’s Office reversed course, stripping the state agency of access to case materials and asserting unilateral control over the investigation.

The fatal Minneapolis shooting is among the most serious in a series of incidents over recent months involving federal immigration agents’ use of force. Videos have documented agents firing pepper balls at clergy, shooting rubber bullets at journalists, and deploying tear gas against protesters. Many of these incidents raise questions about whether agents used excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment and federal criminal law. Yet, the Minnesota incident is only the first where the FBI has indicated it is investigating, and so far, DOJ has announced no criminal charges related to any such incident. While the current investigation is an important step, it is far from sufficient.

Private plaintiffs are challenging the legality of many DHS tactics in court. The Department of Justice (DOJ), for its part, has remained conspicuously silent through months of these tactics. This silence is a dangerous abdication of DOJ’s authority and responsibility. Under 18 U.S.C. § 242, which makes it a crime for any government official to willfully deprive someone of their constitutional rights, DOJ can and should investigate and, where appropriate, charge federal agents who use excessive force.

A Pattern of Force Raising Constitutional Questions

Reports of aggressive, violent, and potentially unlawful tactics by some federal agents have followed each surge of officers arriving in a new city to conduct the administration’s immigration enforcement operations. These have included a military-style, nighttime raid on sleeping families at an apartment complex, the firing of tear gas canisters, rubber bullets, and pepper balls at non-violent protestors, and widespread racial profiling followed by stops and detentions without reasonable suspicion or warrants. State and local officials have decried the unreasonable uses of force in court and in public statements, and at least two Senators have publicly called on DOJ to investigate. Nevertheless, the President and Department of Homeland Security leadership have repeatedly defended their tactics.

Traditionally, the DOJ—in any administration—would seek accountability for unlawful, excessively violent tactics by law enforcement officers, by charging them with violating people’s constitutional rights. However, the DOJ has not announced any charges relating to federal immigration enforcement actions, nor (before Wednesday) had it indicated it had even taken notice.

This is not surprising. By now, it is clear to those paying attention that the DOJ is acting as the administration’s enforcer, prioritizing politicized prosecutions against Trump’s perceived enemies, rather than exercising its independent judgment. And while public attention, understandably, has focused on those high-profile questionable prosecutions, DOJ’s omissions—the cases it is choosing not to pursue—also deserve scrutiny. The agency’s silence about violent tactics by federal agents suggests an apparent abandonment of its criminal civil rights enforcement authority, a silence that is destructive to the rule of law itself.

DOJ’s failure to act signals a troubling abdication of its authority to enforce the constitutional limits of federal agents’ coercive power. The federal statute that is most clearly implicated by aggressive ICE and CBP tactics, 18 U.S.C. § 242, is a Reconstruction-era law that makes it a criminal offense for federal, state, or local government officials to willfully deprive a person of their constitutional rights. Congress passed the statute as part of a series of laws intended to protect the rights of Black Americans following the Civil War. The statute was among those aimed at enforcing the protections of the newly enacted Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments.

Investigations and prosecutions under Section 242, while not numerous, are often significant. Career prosecutors under both Republican and Democratic administrations have, for decades, relied on the statute to investigate the conduct of law enforcement officers when needed. DOJ used Section 242 to prosecute the men, including law enforcement officials, responsible for the 1964 murder of three young civil rights activists in Mississippi. In 1993, under the leadership of Attorney General Bill Barr, DOJ obtained indictments against four Los Angeles Police Department officers involved in the 1991 beating of Rodney King, two of whom were later convicted at trial. Nearly three decades later, the first Trump Administration’s DOJ, again under Attorney General Bill Barr’s leadership, opened an investigation into the death of George Floyd. The DOJ later charged four Minneapolis Police Department officers with violating Section 242, ultimately convicting them for violating Mr. Floyd’s constitutional rights.

DOJ’s failure to address apparent uses of excessive force by federal immigration agents, coupled with DHS doubling down on the appropriateness of its violent and constitutionally questionable tactics, makes the situation more dangerous. In prior administrations, agents credibly accused of violating the Constitution by using unreasonable force would commonly be placed on leave, or on desk duty, while the agency (in this case, ICE or CBP) conducted an internal administrative investigation or referred the incident to DOJ. DOJ could then conduct a criminal investigation when warranted and, if no charges resulted, the agency could determine whether it needed to take administrative action or return the officer to enforcement duties. Currently, however, DHS has permitted agents to continue to serve, with few known exceptions—and even lauded their conduct. Meanwhile DOJ’s silence emboldens further aggressive uses of force.

Select Incidents Meriting Investigation

Over the past seven months, many incidents involving federal immigration agents’ force have been documented on video. While each incident requires thorough investigation to determine whether agents violated federal law, the publicly available evidence in many cases appears to implicate Section 242 and merit a full investigation. Indeed, at least one federal court has already concluded that individual and organizational plaintiffs made a “strong showing” that the government’s tactics constituted unreasonable force in violation of the Fourth Amendment.

September 19, 2025 – Broadview, Illinois

To take one widely-reported example, on September 19, 2025, at least one federal agent stationed on the roof of an ICE processing and detention facility in Broadview, Illinois, fired pepper balls at Reverend David Black as he prayed outside the building with a group of protestors holding signs, shouting, and dancing. A video shows Reverend Black, dressed in clerical garb and standing with his arms extended, palms open and empty, in a parking space outside the building, when an agent drew and repeatedly fired a pepper ball launcher at Black, striking him in the head, arms, and torso, and causing him to fall to his knees. Black later stated in a court declaration that the officers had issued no warnings or orders to disperse before firing, and none can be heard in the video. Neither Black nor the other protestors visible in the video appeared to pose any threat to the officers.

While a full investigation would be required, the publicly available evidence indicates that one or more officers may have committed a felony civil rights violation in firing pepper balls at Reverend Black. To establish a violation of Section 242, a defendant must have been (1) acting under color of law when he (2) willfully (3) deprived a person of a constitutional or federal right. Officers act “under color of law” when they act in their official capacity. The agent who fired at Reverend Black was acting under color of law, and in firing pepper balls at Reverend Black and other protesters, the officer may have violated both Black’s First and Fourth Amendment rights.

Focusing on Black’s Fourth Amendment right to be free from the use of unreasonable force by a law enforcement officer, it is not apparent there was a need for any force—the protestors did not pose a discernable threat to the safety of the officers or anyone else, and the video indicates no urgent need for the protestors to move. Firing pepper balls with no warning at a pastor’s head while he was praying under these circumstances is objectively unreasonable. And the very obvious unreasonableness of those actions indicates that the officer knew firing on Black would be unlawful. Knowing this—and choosing to fire anyway—is the definition of willfulness. Finally, Reverend Black’s reaction—clasping his hand to his eyes and collapsing on his knees—shows that he suffered bodily injury. Proving this element makes the crime a felony. In any previous administration, an incident like this, caught on video, would have prompted an immediate DOJ investigation.

October 23, 2025 – Oakland, California

In Oakland, on October 23, 2025, the Reverend Jorge Bautista attended an early morning vigil to protest an expected immigration enforcement surge in the Bay Area. As trucks carrying CBP agents drove past protestors toward a bridge connecting Oakland with the agents’ destination, a Coast Guard base, agents exited the trucks and approached the protestors, including Reverend Bautista. One agent trained a pepper ball launcher on Bautista from about five feet away. As Bautista said, “we’re here in peace,” the agent fired a pepper ball into Bautista’s face, leaving him coated in powder and bleeding from his chin. While video and photographs that capture the incident do not show all the circumstances that would be relevant to determining whether this use of force was reasonable, firing at such close range at the head of a pastor who, by his words and actions showed that he did not pose a threat, appears unreasonable; these facts would support an investigation.

June 7, 2025 – Paramount, California

On June 7, 2025, journalist Ryanne Mena was interviewing protestors near a Home Depot in Paramount, California, wearing press credentials, when federal agents exiting a nearby warehouse began firing rubber bullets at her and the protestors. They did so without first issuing a warning. Mena said relatively few protestors were present, and she did not see anyone threatening or antagonizing the agents. As she and a second journalist ran for cover, a rubber bullet struck her in the head; the other journalist was hit in the forehead with a tear gas canister. This incident, too, would be an appropriate subject for a Section 242 investigation.

Proving Section 242 violations beyond a reasonable doubt can be challenging in part because the law permits officers to use force—even lethal force—in certain circumstances. When officers willfully exceed the bounds of the law, however, the DOJ is authorized to prosecute. The DOJ’s prosecution of federal officers who have violated Section 242 involves, at its core, the enforcement of not just a criminal statute but the rule of law itself—as it ensures the officers entrusted to execute the law themselves act within its bounds.

Bringing civil rights prosecutions against law enforcement officers is never easy. Juries tend to be wary of harshly judging those who choose a job protecting the public at risk to their own safety. But DOJ has traditionally recognized the importance of holding the agents and officers who wear badges and carry guns responsible when they willfully violate the rights of those whom they serve. This practice underscores the idea that no one is above the law.

The video evidence and other evidence already in the public domain about these and other incidents provides ample cause to open civil rights investigations. Yet we have heard resounding silence from this DOJ.

Other Avenues for Relief are Challenging

Action from DOJ in response to excessive force by federal immigrant agents is vital also because alternative paths for pursuing accountability are challenging. Local prosecutors face significant legal hurdles in bringing charges against federal officials for violating state law: where federal agents’ actions are authorized by federal law and “necessary and proper” for fulfilling their federal duties, they may be immune from prosecution under the Supremacy Clause. Private litigants also face significant doctrinal challenges when suing federal officers, as the Supreme Court has both limited the availability of injunctive relief for ongoing violations and narrowed the circumstances under which suits for monetary damages may be brought against federal officials. Where litigants can sue, the robust protections provided by qualified immunity often mean the suit is dismissed before discovery—even if a court agrees that the federal officials violated the Constitution.

States, therefore, are pursuing creative methods to document perceived abuses, as Governor Pritzker has done in creating the Illinois Accountability Commission. This Commission aims to gather evidence of potentially unlawful conduct by federal agents, to support referrals to investigative agencies and recommendations for changes to existing laws to better protect state residents. Other states and cities have created online portals that residents can use to report misconduct by federal agents. Still others have announced they are investigating possible violations of state law by federal agents or that they stand ready to do so. Meanwhile, many state and local law enforcement leaders remain focused on improving both public safety and community trust, which go hand-in-hand. Their approaches include better engagement with communities, an emphasis on deescalation, and new guidelines for policing protest events. Where federal officers are not immune from state prosecution (because, for instance, their actions violate federal law) states can select the appropriate charge from an array of state statutes, including ones that, unlike Section 242, permit prosecution for criminal negligence and other lesser levels of intent than Section 242 requires.

The proposed rule would eliminate current (and past) language that states the use of public benefits by family members does not count against green-card applicants.
This regulation extensively detailed which prior public benefits use would count in a public-charge determination.
However, even before its implementation, news of the coming change caused immigrant families to disenroll from public benefits or never sign up.
Effects on Future Immigration The proposed rule’s lack of guidelines for applying a public-charge test could also significantly affect future immigration, depending on how adjudicators exercise their discretion.","The Trump administration is proposing to change how the federal government assesses who should be barred from getting a green card or immigrating to the United States because they are likely to become a “public charge.” This term has been in U.S. immigration law for more than a century and has generally meant someone who is mainly reliant on the government for basic needs.

In a proposed rule issued in November, the administration seeks to remove provisions it says “straight-jacket” officers making public-charge assessments. By rescinding all prior regulatory specificity about how public charge is defined—and 26 years of precedent governing which benefits use should be considered—the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) would give frontline officers vast discretion in applying the law.

The withdrawal of earlier federal guidance would mean that service providers could no longer provide any bright-line instruction to immigrant families about which public benefits are safe to access without harming future immigration options and which are not. The rule leaves open the possibility that even use of Head Start, free school lunch, care at Community Health Centers, or other programs could hurt future green-card applications.

If finalized as written, the administration’s sweeping moves could also jeopardize the use of public benefits by the U.S.-citizen children of immigrants. The proposed rule would eliminate current (and past) language that states the use of public benefits by family members does not count against green-card applicants.

The likely result will be that many immigrant families will be afraid to access any public benefits for which a household member is eligible, forgoing supports in times of need to preserve future immigration prospects. Noncitizens who are eligible for public benefits already utilize them at lower rates than the U.S. born. And most immigrants eligible for public benefits already have a green card or U.S. citizenship, and therefore would not face a future public-charge test. But given the complexities of benefits eligibility and immigration laws, hundreds of thousands of people in immigrant families—if not more—may nonetheless feel deterred from accessing needed supports.

As the proposed rule itself recognizes, this could lead to “worse health outcomes” for immigrants and communities, as well as “increased poverty, housing instability, reduced productivity, and lower educational attainment.” In doing so, the futures of millions of U.S.-citizen children may be hampered.

History of Public Charge

Since 1882, federal law has barred the immigration of people likely to become a public charge. Public-charge assessments apply to visa applicants abroad and green-card applicants within the United States. (Refugees, asylees, Cuban and Haitian entrants, and certain other humanitarian groups are exempt.)

U.S. law never formally defined the term public charge until 1999, when the Clinton administration issued a definition: Individuals who were “primarily dependent on the government for subsistence” with determinations of public charge required to rest on either receipt of cash assistance (such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families [TANF] or Supplemental Security Income [SSI]) or long-term institutionalization at government expense. That definition, put in place to counter the chilling effects that arose after mid-1990s changes to welfare law, remained until the first Trump term.

Changes During the First Trump Term

In 2019, DHS issued a regulation to substantially broaden the definition of public charge to include anyone who received certain public benefits for more than 12 months in a 36-month period. This regulation extensively detailed which prior public benefits use would count in a public-charge determination. Importantly, it also specified what would not be considered: use of benefits not explicitly listed in the rule, benefits use by applicants’ family members or that occurred before the final regulation, and the use of Medicaid by children or during pregnancy.

Litigation limited how long the new rule was in force. However, even before its implementation, news of the coming change caused immigrant families to disenroll from public benefits or never sign up. In December 2018, roughly one in seven adults in immigrant families said they or their relatives had avoided public benefits out of fear of immigration consequences. Even 9 percent of adults in U.S.-citizen families said their family had avoided benefits use. The impacts also extended to U.S.-citizen children. The Migration Policy Institute (MPI) found that public benefits use fell twice as fast between 2016 and 2019 for U.S.-citizen children who lived with noncitizens as for those who lived only with citizens—even though children’s benefits use had no bearing on public-charge tests.

A Brief Restoration

In 2021, the Biden administration restored the 1999 definition, codifying it in regulation in 2022.

The Trump administration now seeks to void that 2022 regulation, without issuing new guidelines. DHS says it will issue future instructions for adjudicators; that guidance will likely not be offered for public scrutiny before it takes force.

Chilling Effects Ahead

If clear guidelines are abolished, immigrant families may avoid using any public benefit for which they are eligible—not least because they and the service providers tasked with helping them could be left with no way to predict which usage by any family member could hurt a noncitizen’s future immigration prospects.

The chilling effects are likely to be far greater than those observed during the first Trump term, for several reasons. First, the elimination of all guidelines on which benefits will be considered leaves open the possibility that welfare-adjacent programs, including child-care subsidies, public health programs, or even use of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) could potentially block future immigration. Second, the rule opens the possibility that family members’ benefits use will count against immigrants. Noncitizen parents may therefore worry about enrolling their children in any government program. And third, the rule comes amid a range of other compounding policy changes.

The proposed rule follows recent congressional cuts to key benefits programs for refugees, asylees, humanitarian parolees, and other lawfully present immigrants, further complicating already confusing eligibility rules. At the same time, federal agencies are moving to classify a range of additional programs—such as Head Start, Community Health Centers, family planning, and adult education—as “federal public benefits.” These changes suggest use of these programs could potentially be considered in a public-charge test. Finally, ramped-up and highly visible immigration enforcement and efforts to share public-benefit application data with DHS already are chilling benefits use by immigrant families.

Because of the prevalence of mixed-status families, millions of benefits recipients—primarily U.S. citizens or green-card holders—live with relatives hoping to obtain permanent residence. For example, MPI estimates that 5.3 million U.S.-citizen children lived in mid-2023 with an unauthorized immigrant parent (only a fraction of whom received public benefits). If even a small share of people in mixed-status households withdrew from benefits, hundreds of thousands of children could lose access to vital economic supports.

Effects on Future Immigration

The proposed rule’s lack of guidelines for applying a public-charge test could also significantly affect future immigration, depending on how adjudicators exercise their discretion. Already, the State Department has instructed consular officers to consider visa applicants’ age and health, including obesity and mental health, in deciding if someone is likely to become a public charge.

The new proposed rule asserts that immigrants who cannot be self-sufficient or supported by family or private entities should not be granted permanent status in the country. But consular and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) officers are not experts in how health conditions or past benefits use predict future self-sufficiency. Research shows immigrants often use public benefits as a launching pad to future economic success. And a strong body of research shows that children who receive economic supports in childhood have better health, education, and employment outcomes in adulthood.

Further, decades of court and administrative decisions have established that time-limited benefits receipt, on its own, should not cast someone as likely to become a public charge, particularly if the person can work or has family support. But the proposed rule provides no assurance that DHS will train adjudicators on this case law.

Without clear guidance, rulings may vary widely from adjudicator to adjudicator. Individual biases could animate decisions, potentially reshaping the face of U.S. immigration. The recent DHS framing of officers as “homeland defenders” charged with protecting U.S. culture also raises serious questions about the environment shaping future decisions.

Intended Chilling Effects?

The proposed rule is likely to be finalized in early 2026. It will probably face litigation, but the courts may allow the rule to take effect even as legal challenges proceed.

If the final rule looks similar to the draft, the main impact may well be sharp reductions in the number of U.S. citizens and green-card holders in immigrant families who access a wide range of public benefits.

This could have serious implications for family and community well-being during times of need. Parents may forgo health-care services and child-care, housing, and food supports that help them achieve stable employment, secure safe housing, and reach self-sufficiency. Spells of family poverty without access to medical, nutrition, housing, and other supports can hamper children’s health, development, educational attainment, and future success. And the effects can extend into communities, affecting health, school environments, and even local economies.

The immigration consequences are less certain. With adjudicators’ unconstrained discretion, immigration decisions may be highly variable and unpredictable.

DHS acknowledges the proposed rule could harm the health and wellbeing of children and families. If the Trump administration wanted to reduce these harms, it could clarify that children’s benefits usage will not be used against parents, or that use of certain basic health, education, and housing programs would not be considered.

But the proposed rule’s acknowledgment of likely harmful impacts suggests that perhaps the chilling effects are, after all, part of the intended outcome.",https://www.migrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/commentary_photos/Short%20Read-Public%20Charge-Jan2026.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 12:12:53.640877

Before the video began, Mr. Trump acknowledged the tragic nature of the shooting.
“Well,” Mr. Trump said.
“I — the way I look at it … ” “It’s a terrible scene,” Mr. Trump said at the end of the video.","President Trump wanted to run the tape.

Just hours after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot a 37-year-old woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday, Mr. Trump told a group of New York Times reporters that the woman was at fault because she had tried to “run over” the officer.

We were in the Oval Office for an interview with the president, and the unfolding situation in Minneapolis was high on our list of questions. As soon as we started asking him about the incident, he said: “I want to see nobody get shot. I want to see nobody screaming and trying to run over policemen either.”

When we pressed Mr. Trump on his conclusion that the victim, Renee Nicole Good, tried to run over the agent, he asked an aide to pull up the video on a laptop in an effort to prove his point.

“That was a vicious situation that took place,” Mr. Trump said, apparently referring to what federal officials have said was an effort by Ms. Good to run down an ICE agent.

The exchange was a glimpse into Mr. Trump’s reflexive defense of what has become a sometimes violent federal crackdown on immigration, which in this case claimed the life of an American citizen who was protesting ICE’s presence in Minneapolis.

On Thursday, after our interview with the president, a Times analysis of footage from three camera angles showed the motorist was driving away from — not toward — a federal officer when he opened fire.

But on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump stuck to his position even as we pointed out the inconsistencies in his account and the lack of clarity in videos circulating on social media. We asked if, in his mind, firing into a vehicle like that was acceptable.

“She behaved horribly,” Mr. Trump said. “And then she ran him over. She didn’t try to run him over. She ran him over.”

We told the president that the early videos circulating online were unclear.

“I’ll play the tape for you right now,” Mr. Trump said.

Mr. Trump’s aide Natalie Harp brought a laptop over to the Resolute Desk to show us what he said would be evidence of the woman’s wrongdoing.

Before the video began, Mr. Trump acknowledged the tragic nature of the shooting. “With all of it being said, no, I don’t like that happening,” he said, before pivoting to his common refrain of criticizing illegal immigration.

As a slow-motion surveillance video of the shooting played on the laptop, we told him that this angle did not appear to show that an ICE officer had been run over.

“Well,” Mr. Trump said. “I — the way I look at it … ”

“It’s a terrible scene,” Mr. Trump said at the end of the video. “I think it’s horrible to watch. No, I hate to see it.”

But did this fatal shooting mean his ICE operation had gone too far? Mr. Trump sidestepped the question, instead blaming his predecessor’s immigration policies.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/08/multimedia/08dc-trump-minnesota-bwfl/08dc-trump-minnesota-bwfl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 11:57:20.916652

Since early December, agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection and Homeland Security Investigations – many of them masked and brandishing rifles – have grabbed people at hardware stores and gyms, or outside homes and schools around the cities. They have violently tackled undocumented immigrants as well as US citizens, including advocates and protesters.

By the time Macklin Good was shot on Wednesday – in broad daylight, as dozens of bystanders screamed in shock – local leaders and human rights advocates had been bracing for a catastrophe.

“Before this administration, I don’t think we’ve ever seen this kind of hyper-militarized enforcement, with surges of thousands of officers,” said Setareh Ghandehari, the advocacy director at Detention Watch Network, a non-profit that tracks deaths in ICE custody. Advocates like Ghandehari have warned that more deaths could come, and that shows of force make everyone in the country less safe.

“I don’t think we should be surprised that this has been happening.” she said. “And unfortunately I think there is definitely a chance of an incident like this happening again if the administration and ICE continue to be allowed to act with impunity and without any semblance of accountability.”

Just a few days into 2026, the mobilization in Minneapolis suggests the administration has no plans of easing indiscriminate immigration enforcement operations that have defined the president’s second term.

Since the beginning of the second Trump administration, immigration officers have been connected to 14 shootings, including at least four fatal shootings, according to data compiled by the Trace, a non-profit newsroom focused on gun violence in the US. In September, immigration officers shot Silverio Villegas González, an undocumented immigrant, during a vehicle stop on the outskirts of Chicago.

In Good’s case – as in Villegas González’s case and the cases of non-fatal officer shootings – the Department of Homeland Security claimed that Good “weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers”, a statement that appeared to be contradicted by eyewitness accounts and videos of the incident. On several occasions, judges have dismissed cases in which ICE agents accused people they shot of attempting to hurt officers with vehicles.

Shootings have not been the only cause of death amid immigration raids. In October, a 24-year-old Honduran man died while trying to flee ICE agents in Virginia. In July, a farmworker died after falling from a greenhouse roof during an ICE raid in California.

And 32 people died in ICE custody in 2025, making it the deadliest year for the agency since 2004.

“Over the past year, the Trump administration has granted ICE agents virtual impunity to visit terror and violence on immigrant communities across our country,” said Kica Matos, president of the National Immigration Law Center. “The violence has to stop, immediately.”

The administration has justified its massive – and ultimately deadly – show of force in the Twin Cities as necessary to root out criminals, a refrain it used in other operations last year. But a preliminary analysis from Minnesota Public Radio of who is being arrested in the raids show that most of those targeted have no criminal convictions. Overall, most of the immigrants arrested by ICE since the beginning of the second Trump term have no criminal records.

In Minneapolis, residents and organizers were bracing for more violence. Hours after Good’s death, about 3 miles (5km) from where she was shot on Wednesday, armed immigration officers descended on Minneapolis’s Roosevelt high school, tackled people, handcuffed two staff members and released chemical weapons on bystanders, school officials told MPR.

“They don’t care. They’re just animals,” a school official told the station. “I’ve never seen people behave like this.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf370ebe862185cba863add91e59906c19062a7a/617_0_4627_3701/master/4627.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=17e808b3bdc7e03cf8defe240b5352a8",N,,2026-01-08 11:57:33.775737

Regardless of liability theory, consent has, and will continue to serve, as the strongest defense to CIPA class action claims.","In a recent decision that could reshape the CIPA litigation landscape, Camplisson v. Adidas Am., Inc., 2025 WL 3228949 (S.D. Cal. Nov. 18, 2025), a California federal court rejected several recent decisions dismissing substantively identical CIPA pen register/trap and trace claims. The court held that allegations of Adidas installing tracking pixels on website visitors' browsers that recorded their personally identifiable information (PII) were sufficient, without more, to plausibly allege use of a pen register device and therefore to avoid dismissal at the pleading stage.

Following Camplisson, businesses are likely to see yet another substantial uptick in the already high volume of CIPA pre-suit demand letters and class action lawsuits, which have continued to plague website owners and operators for several years now. More than that, the decision highlights the significant uncertainty that persists with many of the core issues at the heart of CIPA disputes, while underscoring the need for companies to work proactively with privacy counsel.

Background of CIPA

Enacted in 1967 in response to concerns over eavesdropping and telephone surveillance, CIPA makes it illegal to intercept communications or aid and abet third parties in doing so. In addition, under Penal Code § 638.51 (CIPA § 638.51), CIPA prohibits the use of pen registers and trap and trace devices without a court order or user consent. The law provides for the recovery of statutory damages of $5,000 per violation, even in the absence of any actual injury or harm, as well as attorney's fees in certain instances.

Historically, pen registers and trap and trace devices were used by law enforcement while conducting telephone surveillance, with pen registers capturing the phone numbers of outgoing calls and trap and trace devices doing the same for incoming calls. CIPA defines pen register as ""a device or process that records or decodes dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information transmitted by an instrument or facility from which a wire or electronic communication is transmitted, but not the contents of a communication."" The critical distinction between pen registers and other devices is that the former is designed to capture information about a communication, but not the content of the communication itself.

Camplisson v. Adidas Am., Inc.

In Camplisson, website visitors brought a putative class action against Adidas, alleging it violated CIPA § 638.51 through its website's use of two ""tracking pixels,"" the TikTok Pixel and Microsoft Bing, installed on the visitors' web browsers without their consent. According to the plaintiffs, the trackers purportedly collected IP addresses, browser information, unique identifiers, and other PII and addressing information. The plaintiffs also alleged the trackers used so-called ""device fingerprinting,"" a process that associates information collected through the trackers with other PII to facilitate specific device activity tracking.

Adidas moved to dismiss, arguing (among other things) the trackers did not meet the statutory definition of a pen register, thus precluding the plaintiffs' CIPA § 638.51 claim as a matter of law, because:

The trackers only captured specific outgoing information, as opposed to all outgoing communications, from a given device; and

The information collected through fingerprinting was substantive, rather than mere dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling information.

The court rejected both arguments. Relying on CIPA's purportedly ""intentionally broad language,"" it found that limiting pen registers to a process that collects all information would ""take away from CIPA's purpose of protecting privacy, making it underinclusive."" Additionally, according to the court, ""most cases in this and other districts have also recognized that website-based trackers can plausibly constitute a pen register."" Turning to the dispute before it, the court held the plaintiffs' allegations that the trackers recorded their PII, including the information contained in an IP address, were sufficient to plausibly allege use of a pen register and, in turn, avoid dismissal at the pleading stage.

Adidas also argued that the plaintiffs' consent barred their CIPA claims as a matter of law. The court disagreed, finding the website did not:

Make Adidas's online terms and conditions sufficiently conspicuous, as website visitors were required to find the details of the terms and Adidas's privacy policy by scrolling down to the footer of its site; or

Offer a pop-up window or similar method for visitors to affirmatively demonstrate their assent to Adidas's online terms.

Accordingly, the court held the plaintiffs were not put on notice of the terms and privacy policy outlining Adidas's use of the trackers and, thus, did not consent to the use of pen registers on their web browsers.

Analysis & Takeaways

The seminal CIPA pen register/trap and trace decisions, which opened the floodgates to the current wave of class action filings, are Greenley v. Kochava, Inc., 684 F. Supp. 3d 1024 (S.D. Cal. 2023), and Moody v. C2 Educ. Sys., Inc., 742 F. Supp. 3d 1072 (C.D. Cal. 2024). In Greenley, the court latched onto CIPA's supposedly ""expansive"" and ""vague"" definition of pen register to reach the conclusion that software which identifies consumers, gathers data, and correlates that data through unique fingerprinting could constitute a pen register. Shortly thereafter, in Moody the court declined to ""foreclose the possibility that software may qualify as a pen register or trap and trace device under California law, at least at the motion to dismiss stage.""

The plaintiff's bar used these two decisions as a springboard to launch their newest campaign of class action filings for purported violations of CIPA § 638.51. In the early stages of these cases, defendants had considerable difficulty in achieving dismissals at the pleading stage. However, last year multiple courts issued defendant-favorable rulings dismissing CIPA § 638.51 class actions, including Price v. Headspace, Inc., 2025 WL 1237977 (Cal. Sup. Ct. Apr. 1, 2025), Kishnani v. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., 2025 WL 1745726 (N.D. Cal. June 24, 2025), Mitchener v. Talkspace Network LLC, 2025 WL 1822801 (C.D. Cal. June 27, 2025), and Mitchener v. CuriosityStream, Inc., 2025 WL 227413 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 6, 2025), all of which held the TikTok Pixel definitionally does not fall under the ambit of CIPA § 638.51. More importantly, these opinions called this particular CIPA liability theory into question altogether, indicating a potential shift in the trajectory of pen register/trap and trace disputes.

That sliver of hope may be short-lived if additional courts follow the reasoning of Camplisson, which squarely rejected Headspace, Royal Caribbean, Talkspace, and CuriosityStream. Importantly, Camplisson illustrates the significant uncertainty that persists as to the precise scope and contours of CIPA pen register/trap and trace claims. Looking ahead, courts will likely continue to issue conflicting decisions on CIPA's applicability and scope, with businesses remaining subject to substantial legal risk and liability exposure tied to the use of digital tracking tools for the foreseeable future.

What to Do Now: Strategic Compliance and Risk Mitigation Measures

While the CIPA legal landscape remains in flux, it is imperative that all companies that have a website work with experienced privacy counsel to evaluate their current practices and implement risk mitigation strategies as part of their comprehensive privacy compliance programs. Doing so ensures compliance with CIPA's statutory requirements and helps manage the considerable legal risk and associated potential liability arising from the high volume of privacy- and technology-related class action filings focused on cookies, pixels, and other digital tracking tools – which will only increase as time progresses.

As an initial roadmap, companies should prioritize the following action items.

Affirmative, Meaningful Consent. Regardless of liability theory, consent has, and will continue to serve, as the strongest defense to CIPA class action claims. Accordingly, effective, dependable methods and mechanisms must be in place for securing affirmative, meaningful consent from website visitors. Clickwraps, which require visitors to take a clear, affirmative action – such as clicking a button or ticking a box – after being presented with an online agreement or privacy disclosure to signify their assent, should be used, as courts regularly uphold their validity. Consent mechanisms should be tested prior to initial deployment to confirm no cookies or similar technologies ""drop"" or ""fire"" until consent has been affirmatively manifested.

Privacy Disclosures. Privacy policies, notices, and other external-facing disclosures must clearly and conspicuously disclose all tracking technologies in use on any digital property. Disclosures should also provide detailed descriptions of all other tools that may collect, use, or share PII, such as through session replay software or the deployment of video content. Online terms and similar agreements may need to include arbitration and class action waiver provisions. All disclosures must be accurate and reflect actual data practices.

Digital Audits. Regularly assess and evaluate all digital tracking tools and how they collect and process PII. In particular, closely evaluate whether PII is shared with third parties, as this has become an increasingly significant target of plaintiffs' attorneys and privacy regulators alike. At the same time, audit all tracking tools deployed by third parties to ensure they are compliant with applicable law and contractual obligations.

Vendor Agreements. Ensure that vendor agreements where PII is implicated by way of digital tracking tools contain language: (a) requiring vendor compliance with applicable law governing the use of digital tools and PII; (b) limiting vendor data use to what is necessary for performance under the agreement; (c) barring any vendor sharing or disclosure of PII for any reason without prior express consent; and (d) requiring vendor indemnification for any claims, losses, expenses, and fees (including attorney's fees) arising from any actual or alleged legal noncompliance or contractual breach relating to the handling of PII.

Demand Letter Response Playbooks. Be prepared with demand letter response playbooks containing documentation that conclusively establishes legal and regulatory compliance, as well as pre-scripted negotiation strategy guidance. Where feasible, consider maintaining digital audit analyses and reports that are generated by the same tools used by plaintiffs' attorneys.

The Final Word

In today's digital world, companies with even a small digital footprint face mounting legal risks and liability exposure stemming from the extremely common (and often unknown) use of cookies, pixels, and other digital tracking tools. Implementing strategic compliance and risk mitigation measures as part of comprehensive compliance programs can directly address and mitigate the threats posed by the high volume of CIPA and similar privacy class action filings, which will only continue to increase for the foreseeable future.

As we begin 2026, now is the perfect time to consult with experienced privacy counsel, who can review and audit current compliance practices and assist in remediating any gaps to minimize the risk of being targeted with CIPA or other wiretapping class action claims. Robust, comprehensive compliance measures, such as those discussed above, can also arm companies with formidable defenses in the event they find themselves on the receiving end of a tenuous CIPA demand letter or class action complaint.",https://www.bakerdonelson.com/images/_wbmanaged/screenshot2026-01-08124146_wbc_socialimage_167329.png,N,,2026-01-08 14:58:56.495061

The killing of Renee Nicole Good was at least the ninth time federal immigration officers have fired on people since last September; five people have died in mass deportation operations since President Trump retook the White House.
The Trump administration has announced plans to control sales of Venezuela’s oil “indefinitely,” as it demands Venezuela’s government cut ties with U.S. adversaries, including Cuba, China, Iran and Russia.
Their capture came as Vice President JD Vance reiterated that the Trump administration would have complete control of Venezuela’s oil reserves.
Meanwhile, Venezuela’s interior minister said 100 people were killed in the U.S. attack that removed President Maduro from power on Saturday.","Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused Good of “weaponizing her vehicle” to commit an “act of domestic terrorism.” And in a social media post, President Trump falsely claimed Good had “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense.” Trump went on to say that “it is hard to believe that he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital.” Video from the scene shows the ICE agent walking away after the shooting with no signs of injuries. Minnesota officials condemned those remarks.

Democratic Governor Tim Walz issued an order to prepare to mobilize the Minnesota National Guard, calling Good’s killing “preventable” and “unnecessary.” This is Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.

Mayor Jacob Frey: “They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defense. Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly: That is bullshit. This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed. … To ICE, get the fuck out of Minneapolis. We do not want you here.”

This comes after the Trump administration ordered a surge of 2,000 ICE agents to the Twin Cities this week, after President Trump called the region’s large Somali community “garbage” and accused state officials of failing to root out fraud in social services programs.

The killing of Renee Nicole Good was at least the ninth time federal immigration officers have fired on people since last September; five people have died in mass deportation operations since President Trump retook the White House. After headlines, we’ll go to Minneapolis for the latest.

The Trump administration has announced plans to control sales of Venezuela’s oil “indefinitely,” as it demands Venezuela’s government cut ties with U.S. adversaries, including Cuba, China, Iran and Russia. On Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the U.S. would continue to “dictate” policy to Venezuela’s interim leaders, after the abduction of President Nicolás Maduro in a bloody U.S. military raid on Caracas early Saturday morning.

Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt: “The president is fully deploying his 'peace through strength' foreign policy agenda, so we’re continuing to be in close coordination with the interim authorities. And their decisions are going to continue to be dictated by the United States of America.”

On Wednesday, U.S. forces seized two tankers linked to Venezuelan oil exports — one in the Caribbean; the other, a Russian-flagged tanker in the North Atlantic that the U.S. had pursued for weeks. In response, Russia accused the U.S. of violating maritime law, calling for the release of the ship’s crew. Their capture came as Vice President JD Vance reiterated that the Trump administration would have complete control of Venezuela’s oil reserves. In Caracas, interim President Delcy Rodríguez defended plans to cede control of Venezuela’s oil to the U.S.

Interim President Delcy Rodríguez: “Venezuela is open to energy relations where all parties benefit, where economic cooperation is very well determined in commercial contracts.”

On Wednesday, President Trump told The New York Times he expects the United States will be running Venezuela for years to come. Meanwhile, Venezuela’s interior minister said 100 people were killed in the U.S. attack that removed President Maduro from power on Saturday. We’ll have more on Venezuela later in the broadcast.

In Sudan, at least 13 people have been killed, including eight children, after a drone strike hit a house in the city of el-Obeid — that’s according to the Sudan Doctors’ Network. The group says that it was likely carried out by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group. Meanwhile, several Sudanese women recounted harrowing stories of rape by the RSF to Al Jazeera. A senior doctor revealed that 14 infants were raped. The U.N. describes the situation in Sudan as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, as the civil war between the Sudanese army and the RSF has been raging for nearly three years. More than 11 million people have been displaced, and over 150,000 people have been killed.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy already withheld $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn’t enforcing English proficiency requirements for truckers.

The state notified these drivers in the fall that they would lose their licenses after a federal audit found problems that included licenses for truckers and bus drivers that remained valid long after an immigrant’s visa expired. Some licenses were also given to citizens of Mexico and Canada who don’t qualify. More than one-quarter of the small sample of California licenses that investigators reviewed were unlawful.

But then last week California said it would delay those revocations until March after immigrant groups sued the state because of concerns that some groups were being unfairly targeted. Duffy said the state was supposed to revoke those licenses by Monday.

Key European allies are criticizing U.S. global leadership in the wake of tensions over Venezuela, Ukraine and Greenland.

German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who has a largely ceremonial role, warned of a major realignment in unusually strong remarks at an event in Berlin last night.

Steinmeier said there had been a “breakdown of values by our most important partner, the USA, which helped build this world order,” according to a translation by Reuters.

He added: “It is about preventing the world from turning into a den of robbers, where the most unscrupulous take whatever they want, where regions or entire countries are treated as the property of a few great powers.”

France’s President Emmanuel Macron also criticized U.S. leadership in separate remarks this morning, saying that events in recent days have confirmed “major global powers are seeking to divide the world among themselves.”

Macron told a gathering of ambassadors that the U.S. was “gradually turning away from some of its allies and giving up on established rules.”

Macron also criticized China, Russia and Iran, adding: “We are in a world where might is right, and perhaps Europe is the only forum now where we can reaffirm these values and rules so dear to us.”

Rep. Robin Kelly, D-Ill., announced yesterday that she will introduce articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for what Kelly calls “obstruction of justice, violation of public trust, and self-dealing.”

Any member of the House can introduce articles of impeachment against a Cabinet official. No action has to be taken on those articles. Republicans, who control the floor and committees, will not bring this impeachment resolution forward.

Kelly could try to introduce this impeachment under the privileges of the House, which would request a vote on the matter within two legislative days. In that scenario, Republicans can offer a “motion to table” or “motion to refer to committee,” to sideline the effort. Kelly does not specify in her press release that she will attempt this route.

Other Democrats have introduced impeachment resolutions of Trump and Cabinet officials this Congress that have gone nowhere:

Rep. Al Green, of Texas, has introduced articles of impeachment against Trump several times.

Rep. Shri Thanedar, of Michigan, introduced articles of impeachment against Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

Rep. Haley Stevens, of Michigan, introduced articles of impeachment against Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

Kelly is currently running for the Senate in Illinois.

The State Department said it had paused all U.S. assistance to Somalia’s federal government, citing reports that officials had destroyed a U.S.-funded World Food Program warehouse and “illegally seized” 76 metric tons of food aid meant for civilians in the East African country, one of the world’s poorest.

“The Trump Administration has a zero-tolerance policy for waste, theft, and diversion of life-saving assistance,” the department said yesterday in a post on X.

“Any resumption of assistance will be dependent upon the Somali Federal Government, taking accountability for its unacceptable actions and taking appropriate remedial steps,” it said.

Somali officials have not yet responded to the allegations. It is unclear how much assistance will be affected, as the Trump administration made drastic cuts to U.S. foreign aid last year.

The pause in assistance comes amid mounting White House attacks on Somali immigrants in the U.S., including over unsubstantiated claims of fraud at child care centers in Minnesota. The Trump administration has increased immigration raids in Minneapolis, home to the country’s largest Somali community, and Somalia is one of 19 countries whose nationals are barred from entering the U.S., as well as continuing their immigration applications.

Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., will announce this morning that he is not seeking re-election, a spokesperson for the congressman confirmed to NBC News.

The 86-year-old is among the longest-serving members of Congress, having held his seat since he won a special election in 1981. Hoyer plans to make his formal announcement when he speaks on the House floor at 10 a.m.

“I did not want to be one of those members who clearly stayed, outstayed his or her ability to do the job,” Hoyer told The Washington Post about his retirement plan.

Gov. Josh Shapiro, D-Pa., announced in a video this morning that he is running for re-election.

""We've gotten s--- done all across our commonwealth to make a real difference in people's lives,"" he said in a video posted on X, laying out his credentials for issues including job growth, championing public safety and cutting taxes.

Shapiro won his 2022 race for governor with 56.5% of the vote, while his Republican opponent Doug Mastriano garnered 41.7%. The swing state is often a bellwether for the direction of the country's politics.

Earlier this week, he announced that his campaign for governor ended last year with more than $30 million on hand.

The governor has often been floated as a potential 2028 presidential contender.

The Senate will vote this morning on whether to advance a resolution that would require congressional authorization before the military can engage in additional hostilities within or against Venezuela.

The resolution, which only needs a simple majority to advance, is the first congressional test of whether Republicans will publicly oppose Trump’s actions against Venezuela after the capture of Nicolás Maduro.

The vote would be to discharge the resolution to the full Senate. It was introduced by Sens. Tim Kaine, D-Va., Rand Paul, R-Ky., Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y, and Adam Schiff, D-Calif.

“This is not the surgical execution of an arrest warrant, it was much bigger than that before last Saturday, and it’s going to be much bigger than that from now for the next few years,” Kaine told reporters yesterday. “So, this is something that shouldn’t happen without Congress.”

Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, R-Wyo., released a statement opposing the resolution, calling it “the wrong message to send to hardened drug traffickers and to dictators.”

“Let’s be clear about what that resolution does and what it does not do,” Barrasso said in a statement. “It does not reassert Congress’s powers. It does not make America stronger. It makes America weaker and less safe. It would weaken the President’s legitimate, constitutional authority.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/250107-trump-jan-8-liveblog-lr-782615.jpg",N,,2026-01-08 09:57:54.701276

Immigration agents briefly surged into the state last month, sometimes clashing with residents.
Plans for the surge continued after Mr. Walz announced on Monday that he was dropping his campaign for a third term as governor.","After a federal immigration agent fatally shot a woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday, Mayor Jacob Frey called the U.S. government’s account of what happened “bullshit.” State legislators chimed in, lamenting a “hostile federal government.” And Gov. Tim Walz derided what he called a federal “propaganda machine,” saying that the shooting was both “totally predictable” and “totally avoidable.”

The outpouring of anger from the Democrats who govern Minnesota marked a boiling-over point in a rhetorical fight with the Trump administration that had been building for weeks.

The next steps in that dispute seemed uncertain.

Federal officials, who vowed to continue a surge of immigration enforcement work in the Minneapolis area despite protests, defended the shooting on Wednesday as necessary and lawful.

“This is the direct consequence of constant attacks and demonization of our officers by sanctuary politicians who fuel and encourage rampant assaults on our law enforcement,” said Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security.

Mr. Frey and Mr. Walz both warned demonstrators to stay peaceful, stating their belief that the federal government was looking for a pretext to deploy the military on Minnesota’s streets.

“Do not take the bait,” Mr. Walz said. “Do not allow them to deploy federal troops into here. Do not allow them to invoke the Insurrection Act. Do not allow them to declare martial law.”

Bad blood between Mr. Walz and President Trump is nothing new. Mr. Trump has long criticized the governor’s handling of the riots that followed the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, and the pair exchanged campaign-trail insults in 2024 when Mr. Walz was the Democratic nominee for vice president. When a gunman killed a Democratic Minnesota state legislator and her husband last year, Mr. Trump said he had no plans to call Mr. Walz, whom he described as “whacked out.” Mr. Walz, for his part, criticized immigration agents last year as “Donald Trump’s modern-day Gestapo.”

But that mutual distaste morphed into a far more tangible clash in recent weeks, as the president and his allies portrayed Minnesota as a failure of liberal governance, citing a fraud scheme that resulted in hundreds of millions, even billions, of dollars being pilfered from social service programs. The president began describing Minnesota’s large Somali diaspora, whose members make up a majority of the fraud defendants, in especially derisive terms. Immigration agents briefly surged into the state last month, sometimes clashing with residents.

All of it was prelude to this week, when the federal government announced the deployment of around 2,000 agents to the Minneapolis area in what it said was its “largest operation to date.” The mobilization, they said, was necessary to crack down on fraud and to root out illegal immigrants. Plans for the surge continued after Mr. Walz announced on Monday that he was dropping his campaign for a third term as governor.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/07/multimedia/07minn-shooting-war-of-words-cov-cfvh/07minn-shooting-war-of-words-cov-cfvh-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 09:57:58.557605

ICE agent shoots and kills woman during Minneapolis immigration crackdown

An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a Minneapolis motorist on Wednesday during the Trump administration's latest immigration crackdown on a major American city — a shooting that federal officials claimed was an act of self-defense but that the city's mayor described as ""reckless"" and unnecessary.

The woman was shot in a residential neighborhood south of downtown Minneapolis, just a few blocks from some of the oldest immigrant markets and about a mile from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020. Her killing quickly drew a crowd of angry protesters.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, during a visit to Texas, described the incident as an “act of domestic terrorism” carried out against ICE officers by a woman who “attempted to run them over and rammed them with her vehicle. An officer of ours acted quickly and defensively, shot, to protect himself and the people around him.”

But Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey blasted that characterization as “garbage” and criticized the federal deployment of more than 2,000 officers to the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul as part of the immigration crackdown.

“What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,” Frey said, calling on the immigration agents to leave. “They’re ripping families apart. They’re sowing chaos on our streets, and in this case, quite literally killing people.”

“They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defense. Having seen the video myself, I wanna tell everybody directly, that is bullshit,” the mayor said.

Videos taken by bystanders with different vantage points and posted to social media show an officer approaching an SUV stopped across the middle of the road, demanding the driver open the door and grabbing the handle. The SUV begins to pull forward and a different ICE officer standing in front of the vehicle pulls his weapon and immediately fires at least two shots into the SUV at close range, jumping back as the vehicle moves toward him.

It was not clear from the videos if the vehicle made contact with the officer. The SUV then sped into two cars parked on a curb nearby before crashing to a stop. Witnesses screamed obscenities, expressing shock at what they’d seen.

The shooting marks a dramatic escalation of the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations in major cities under the Trump administration. The death of the Minneapolis woman, whose name wasn't immediately released, was at least the fifth linked to immigration crackdowns.

The Twin Cities have been on edge since DHS announced Tuesday that it had launched the operation, which is at least partly tied to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents. During her Texas visit, Noem confirmed that DHS had deployed more than 2,000 officers to the area and said they had already made “hundreds and hundreds” of arrests.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara briefly described the shooting to reporters but, unlike federal officials, gave no indication that the 37-year-old driver was trying to harm anyone. He said she had been shot in the head.

“This woman was in her vehicle and was blocking the roadway on Portland Avenue. ... At some point a federal law enforcement officer approached her on foot and the vehicle began to drive off,"" the chief said. ""At least two shots were fired. The vehicle then crashed on the side of the roadway.”

DeSantis announces special legislative session on redistricting

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced during a press conference Wednesday that he is calling for a special legislative session to tackle redistricting.

“Today, I announced that I will be convening a Special Session of the Legislature focused on redistricting to ensure that Florida’s congressional maps accurately reflect the population of our state. Every Florida resident deserves to be represented fairly and constitutionally,” DeSantis posted on X and Facebook.

The governor said that the planned special session would begin after the regular legislative session. That would, in DeSantis’ opinion, free up lawmakers to “focus on the pressing issues facing Floridians.”

The Florida Legislature took its first official step in early December toward potentially redrawing the state’s congressional districts as lawmakers convened a new House committee tasked with exploring possible changes.

At least six other states are redrawing maps, or at least attempting to, ahead of this year’s midterm election. Florida’s redistricting process is somewhat unique, however, because of its 2010 “Fair Districts” constitutional amendment, which prohibits maps drawn to favor political parties or incumbents.

“Florida voters approved the Fair District Amendments in 2010 because we wanted to rid our system of this type of partisan gerrymandering and rigging for political gain,” said Genesis Robinson of the voting rights group Equal Ground.

Over the summer, President Donald Trump urged Republican-led states to redraw their congressional maps to expand the GOP majority in Congress, alleging Democratic leaders in other states have gerrymandered maps of their own. DeSantis reaffirmed his administration’s intent to follow along, noting the state will likely pursue changes if and when the U.S. Supreme Court rethinks federal redistricting rules.

“We’re going to do it,” DeSantis said. “And part of it is we’re going to be forced to do it, I think, because the Supreme Court’s VRA decision is going to impact the current map. So just no matter what else happens, that is going to have to be addressed.”

The governor’s plan, though, will require House and Senate cooperation.

“Three people have to turn the keys at the same time in order to get new maps,” said Jonathan Webber of the Southern Poverty Law Center. “And right now, it does not seem like all three people are aligned. And maybe that’s a good thing. Maybe it’s a bad thing. But overall, it’s a bad thing for the people of Florida that there is not clear leadership from their leaders.”

Thus far, the Senate has taken no action on the issue. In a memo, Senate President Ben Albritton said work on redistricting may launch in the new year.

“The Governor has expressed a desire to address this issue next spring,” Albritton said in a statement. “As such, there is no ongoing work regarding potential mid-decade redistricting taking place in the Senate at this time.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/ice-shooting-protesters_AP_Cropped,N,,2026-01-08 10:59:32.076010

Even so, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem insists the officer opened fire in self-defence.

For nearly a year, migrant rights advocates and neighborhood activists across the Twin Cities have been preparing to mobilize in the event of an immigration enforcement surge.","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a Minneapolis driver on Wednesday during the Trump administration’s latest immigration crackdown on a major American city — a shooting that federal officials said was an act of self-defense but that the mayor described as reckless and unnecessary.

The 37-year-old woman was shot in the head in front of a family member in a snowy residential neighborhood south of downtown Minneapolis, just a few blocks from some of the oldest immigrant markets and about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020.

Her killing after 9:30 a.m. was recorded on video by witnesses, and the shooting quickly drew a large crowd of angry protesters. By evening, hundreds were there for a vigil to mourn her death and urge the public to resist immigration enforcers.

The woman, Renee Nicole Macklin Good, had a 6-year old child, her mother told the Minnesota Star Tribune. Macklin Good described herself on social media as a “poet and writer and wife and mom” who was from Colorado.

Videos taken by bystanders with different vantage points and posted to social media show an officer approaching an SUV stopped across the middle of the road, demanding the driver open the door and grabbing the handle. The Honda Pilot begins to pull forward and a different ICE officer standing in front of the vehicle pulls his weapon and immediately fires at least two shots into the vehicle at close range, jumping back as the vehicle moves toward him.

It is not clear in the videos if the vehicle makes contact with the officer and there is no indication of whether or not the woman had interactions with ICE officers before the videos started. After the shooting, the SUV speeds into two cars parked on a curb nearby before crashing to a stop.

In another video taken at the scene, a woman, who described Macklin Good as her spouse, is seen crying near the vehicle. The woman, who was not identified, said the couple had only recently arrived in Minnesota and that they had a child.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem described the incident as an “act of domestic terrorism” carried out against ICE officers by a woman who “attempted to run them over and rammed them with her vehicle. An officer of ours acted quickly and defensively, shot, to protect himself and the people around him.”

In a social media post, President Donald Trump made similar accusations against the woman and defended ICE’s work.

Local officials dispute the narrative

Noem claimed the woman was part of a “mob of agitators” and said the officer followed his training. She said the veteran officer who fired his gun had been rammed and dragged by an anti-ICE motorist in June.

“Any loss of life is a tragedy, and I think all of us can agree that in this situation, it was preventable,” Noem said, adding that the FBI would investigate.

But Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey blasted Noem’s version of what happened as “garbage” and criticized the federal deployment of more than 2,000 officers to the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul as part of the immigration crackdown.

“What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,” Frey said, calling on the immigration agents to leave. “They’re ripping families apart. They’re sowing chaos on our streets, and in this case, quite literally killing people.”

“They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defense. Having seen the video myself, I wanna tell everybody directly, that is bullshit,” the mayor said.

Shooting is fifth linked to crackdowns

The shooting marked a dramatic escalation of the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations in major cities under the Trump administration. The death of the woman in Minneapolis was at least the fifth linked to immigration crackdowns.

The Twin Cities have been on edge since DHS announced Tuesday that it had launched the operation, which is at least partly tied to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents. Noem said they had already made “hundreds and hundreds” of arrests.

A large throng of protesters gathered at the scene after the shooting, where they vented their anger at the local and federal officers who were there, including Gregory Bovino, a senior U.S. Customs and Border Patrol official who has been the face of crackdowns in Los Angeles, Chicago and elsewhere.

“She was driving away and they killed her,” said Lynette Reini-Grandell, a local resident who was among those who filmed the shooting.

In a scene that hearkened back to the Los Angeles and Chicago crackdowns, bystanders heckled the officers, chanting “ICE out of Minnesota” and blew whistles that have become ubiquitous during the operations.

Governor calls for calm

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he’s prepared to deploy the National Guard if necessary. He described the killing as “predictable” and “avoidable.” He also said like many, he was outraged by the shooting, but he called on people to keep protests peaceful.

“They want a show. We can’t give it to them. We cannot,” the governor said.

Minneapolis Public Schools canceled school, sports and activities for Thursday and Friday, saying in a statement that the decision was “due to safety concerns related to today’s incidents around the city.”

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara briefly described the shooting to reporters but, unlike federal officials, gave no indication that the driver was trying to harm anyone.

There were calls on social media to prosecute the officer who shot the driver. Commissioner Bob Jacobson of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety said state authorities would investigate the shooting with federal authorities.

“Keep in mind that this is an investigation that is also in its infancy. So any speculation about what has happened would be just that,” Jacobson told reporters.

The shooting happened in the district of Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, who called it “state violence,” not law enforcement.

For nearly a year, migrant rights advocates and neighborhood activists across the Twin Cities have been preparing to mobilize in the event of an immigration enforcement surge. From houses of worship to mobile home parks, they have set up very active online networks, scanned license plates for possible federal vehicles and bought whistles and other noisemaking devices to alert neighborhoods of any enforcement presence.

Local and federal officials were immediately divided on how the shooting unfolded. President Trump and other federal officials asserted that the agent acted “in self-defense,” while Minnesota officials described those accounts as “propaganda” and “garbage.”

On Wednesday night, thousands of people gathered to protest at a vigil as the shooting reignited the debate on the deployment of federal agents and troops in cities across the country. Local and state leaders implored the administration to withdraw federal agents from Minnesota.

Here’s what we know:

What happened in the encounter?

In videos posted on social media and verified by The New York Times, a maroon Honda Pilot is shown partly blocking one lane of a snowy residential street. The driver of the S.U.V. rolls forward slightly, then stops and waves to signal that approaching vehicles should drive past.

The vehicle is shifted from reverse into drive and begins to move ahead. The agent at the front of the vehicle, standing near the driver’s side headlight, pulls out a gun and fires at the driver, continuing to shoot as the vehicle moves past him.

The Honda accelerates and then crashes. The agent who fired approaches the vehicle, then walks away and tells other agents to call 911.

One witness who spoke with The Times described seeing an ICE agent trying to rip open the Honda’s door, while hearing another agent in front of the vehicle shouting “Stop!” before quickly firing.

Who is the victim?

The authorities identified the driver as Renee Nicole Good, 37. Ms. Good, a U.S. citizen, lived in Minneapolis with her partner, her mother said in an interview with The Minnesota Star Tribune.

Ms. Good had a 6-year-old child and was “loving, forgiving and affectionate,” her mother, Donna Ganger, told The Star Tribune.

The Minneapolis police chief, Brian O’Hara, said in a news conference that there was “nothing to indicate that this woman was the target of any law enforcement investigation.”

How have officials responded?

Officials clashed over the details of the shooting, with local officials describing it as avoidable and federal officials defending the use of force.

In a post on social media, Mr. Trump said he believed the agent had shot the driver in self-defense and falsely claimed the woman “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over” the officer.

Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said at a news conference that the woman was “stalking” officers, and that the agent who killed her “used his training to save his life and those of his colleagues.”

Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis called federal accounts of the shooting “bullshit.” Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota urged residents to protest peacefully and said on social media, “Don’t believe this propaganda machine.”

Why have federal agents deployed in Minnesota?

The Trump administration began an immigration crackdown in Minnesota last month, deploying scores of federal agents to the state. Federal immigration officers on Tuesday described their presence in Minnesota as the “largest operation to date.”

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement effort in the state is part of a broader deportation push that has targeted cities across the country since the start of Mr. Trump’s second term.

Immigration efforts in Minnesota have targeted undocumented immigrants, like in other cities, but singled out Somalis. The state has roughly 80,000 people of Somali ancestry, but the vast majority are American citizens or legal permanent residents.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/07/multimedia/07nat-minn-ice-shooting-wwk-2-vmqp/07nat-minn-ice-shooting-wwk-2-vmqp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 12:59:05.515530

Why it matters: Their anger, after an ICE officer shot and killed a 37-year-old woman today in Minneapolis, sets them on a collision course with party leaders.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said earlier this week that a shutdown was not on the table.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, asked if the appropriations process should be used to constrain ICE, told us: ""We're focused right now on … advancing the Affordable Care Act tax credits.""

But progressive lawmakers see the end-of-January funding cliff as a leverage point to exploit, as they fume about the Department of Homeland Security under Secretary Kristi Noem.

""Democrats cannot vote for a DHS budget that doesn't restrain the growing lawlessness of this agency,"" Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said on X following the shooting.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) said: ""We can't just keep authorizing money for these illegal killers. That's what they are, this rogue force.""

""Statements and letters are not enough, and the appropriations process and the CR expiring Jan. 31 is our opportunity,"" said Rep. Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.).

Between the lines: Getting both sides to agree on funding for a department as divisive as DHS was always going to prove challenging.

Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) told us today: ""I'm having a hard time seeing how we're gonna come to agreement on it.""

""We need to arrest that ICE agent for a excessive use of power,"" Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) told us. ""And we should be opposing the hundreds of billions of dollars going to a lawless agency.""

The other side: Among the Republicans defending ICE after the shooting are several members of leadership, including House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) and House Republican conference chair Lisa McClain (R-Mich.).

""Our brave ICE agents put their lives on the line every day to protect our communities from dangerous criminals. May God bless and protect them in their efforts,"" Emmer said in a statement.

DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said: ""An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots.""

President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order suspending U.S. support for 66 organizations, agencies, and commissions, following his administration's review of participation in and funding for all international organizations, including those affiliated with the United Nations, according to a White House release.

WATCH: White House pushes to dismantle leading climate and weather research center

Most of the targets are U.N.-related agencies, commissions and advisory panels that focus on climate, labor, migration and other issues the Trump administration has categorized as catering to diversity and ""woke"" initiatives. Other non-U.N. organizations on the list include the Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation, the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance and Global Counterterrorism Forum.

""The Trump Administration has found these institutions to be redundant in their scope, mismanaged, unnecessary, wasteful, poorly run, captured by the interests of actors advancing their own agendas contrary to our own, or a threat to our nation's sovereignty, freedoms, and general prosperity,"" the State Department said in a statement.

Trump's decision to withdraw from organizations that foster cooperation among nations to address global challenges comes as his administration has launched military efforts or issued threats that have rattled allies and adversaries alike, including capturing autocratic Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and indicating an intention to take over Greenland.

This is the latest U.S. withdrawal from global agencies

The administration previously suspended support from agencies like the World Health Organization, the U.N. for Palestinian refugees known as UNRWA, the U.N. Human Rights Council and the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO as it has taken a larger, a-la-carte approach to paying its dues to the world body, picking which operations and agencies they believe align with Trump's agenda and those which no longer serve U.S. interests.

WATCH: The potential impacts of Trump's decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization

""I think what we're seeing is the crystallization of the U.S. approach to multilateralism, which is 'my way or the highway,'"" said Daniel Forti, head of U.N. affairs at the International Crisis Group. ""It's a very clear vision of wanting international cooperation on Washington's own terms.""

It has marked a major shift from how previous administrations — both Republican and Democratic — have dealt with the U.N., and it has forced the world body, already undergoing its own internal reckoning, to respond with a series of staffing and program cuts.

Many independent nongovernmental agencies — some that work with the United Nations — have cited many project closures because of the U.S. administration's decision last year to slash foreign assistance through the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.

Despite the massive shift, the U.S. officials, including Trump himself, say they have seen the potential of the U.N. and want to instead focus taxpayer money on expanding American influence in many of the standard-setting U.N. initiatives where there is competition with China, like the International Telecommunications Union, the International Maritime Organization and the International Labor Organization.

The global organizations from which the U.S. is departing

The withdrawal from the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, or UNFCCC, is the latest effort by Trump and his allies to distance the U.S. from international organizations focused on climate and addressing climate change.

UNFCC, the 1992 agreement between 198 countries to financially support climate change activities in developing countries, is the underlying treaty for the landmark Paris climate agreement. Trump — who calls climate change a hoax — withdrew from that agreement soon after reclaiming the White House.

Gina McCarthy, former White House National Climate Adviser, called the move ""shortsighted, embarrassing, and a foolish decision.""

""As the only country in the world not a part of the UNFCCC treaty, the Trump administration is throwing away decades of U.S. climate change leadership and global collaboration,"" McCarthy, who co-chairs America Is All In, a coalition of climate-concerned U.S. states and cities, said in a statement. ""This Administration is forfeiting our country's ability to influence trillions of dollars in investments, policies, and decisions that would have advanced our economy and protected us from costly disasters wreaking havoc on our country.""

Mainstream scientists say climate change is behind increasing instances of deadly and costly extreme weather, including flooding, droughts, wildfires, intense rainfall events and dangerous heat.

The U.S. withdrawal could hinder global efforts to curb greenhouse gases because it ""gives other nations the excuse to delay their own actions and commitments,"" said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tracks countries' carbon dioxide emissions.

It will also be difficult to achieve meaningful progress on climate change without cooperation from the U.S., one of the world's largest emitters and economies, experts said.

The U.N.'s population agency, which provides sexual and reproductive health across the world, has long been a lightning rod for Republican opposition and Trump himself cut funding for the agency during his first term in office. He and other GOP officials have accused the agency of participating in ""coercive abortion practices"" in countries like China.

When President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, he restored funding for the agency. A State Department review conducted the following year found no evidence to support GOP claims.

Other organizations and agencies that the U.S. will quit include the Carbon Free Energy Compact, the United Nations University, the International Cotton Advisory Committee, the International Tropical Timber Organization, the Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation, the Pan-American Institute for Geography and History, the International Federation of Arts Councils and Culture Agencies and the International Lead and Zinc Study Group.

The State Department said additional reviews are ongoing.

Congressional forecasters have lowered their projection of population growth over the next decade by 7 million people, in response to the Trump administration's immigration crackdown as well as falling birth rates.

The U.S. population is now projected to grow from 349 million this year to 357 million in 2035, according to a forecast released Wednesday by the Congressional Budget Office.

That's slower growth than CBO was predicting a year ago. The biggest reason for the downshift is the administration's aggressive effort to cut down on illegal immigration. The U.S. also admitted fewer foreign students in 2025, although the number of authorized green card holders is expected to increase over the next decade.

In addition to slowing immigration, people in the U.S. are having fewer children, which is also putting the brakes on population growth. By 2030, the CBO estimates there will be fewer babies born in the U.S. each year than there are deaths. Absent immigration, the population would begin to shrink at that point.

Immigration also helps to boost birth rates, since foreign-born women have more children, on average, than women born in the U.S.

The demographic outlook helps to shape CBO's annual economic forecast, which will be released next month.

Analysts caution that the long-run forecasts of births, deaths and immigration are uncertain and small changes in any of those factors could significantly change the population over time.

Officials say the woman, a mother of three and a U.S. citizen born in Colorado, was inside her car when she was shot. The confrontation was captured on video, fueling public outcry and leading several city and state leaders to call for ICE to leave Minneapolis.

While Minneapolis deals with its own conflict involving federal immigration authorities, Boston is currently in the middle of a separate legal battle with ICE.

The federal government and the City of Boston are clashing in court over the city’s sanctuary policy — specifically, the Boston Trust Act and whether it interferes with federal immigration enforcement.

In a recent court filing, federal officials allege that Boston’s policy causes local police to “categorically flout” immigration enforcement officers, allowing individuals to “evade ICE apprehension.”

The Boston Trust Act, last amended in 2019, allows Boston police to prioritize criminal law enforcement while leaving civil immigration matters to federal authorities.

The city has argued in court that the policy has contributed to making Boston the safest major city in the country and has asked for the lawsuit to be dismissed.

This case is one of several lawsuits the federal government has filed challenging sanctuary city policies across the U.S.

State and local officials demanded ICE leave the state after 37-year-old Renee Nicole Macklin Good was shot in the head. But Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said agents are not going anywhere.

The Department of Homeland Security has deployed more than 2,000 officers to the area in what it says is its largest immigration enforcement operation ever. Noem said more than 1,500 people have been arrested.

Macklin Good's killing Wednesday morning in a residential neighborhood south of downtown was recorded on video by witnesses, and by the evening hundreds of people came out for a vigil to mourn her and urge the public to resist immigration enforcement. Some then chanted as they marched through the city, but there was no violence.

“I would love for ICE to leave our city and for more community members to come to see it happens,” said Sander Kolodziej, a painter who came to the vigil to support the community.

The videos of the shooting show an officer approaching an SUV stopped across the middle of the road, demanding the driver open the door and grabbing the handle. The Honda Pilot begins to pull forward, and a different ICE officer standing in front of it pulls his weapon and immediately fires at least two shots at close range, jumping back as the vehicle moves toward him.

It is not clear from the videos if the vehicle makes contact with the officer, and there is no indication of whether the woman had interactions with ICE agents earlier. After the shooting the SUV speeds into two cars parked on a curb before crashing to a stop.

In another recording made afterward, a woman who identifies Macklin Good as her spouse is seen crying near the vehicle. The woman, who is not identified, says the couple recently arrived in Minnesota and they had a child.

Noem called the incident an “act of domestic terrorism” against ICE officers, saying the driver “attempted to run them over and rammed them with her vehicle. An officer of ours acted quickly and defensively, shot, to protect himself and the people around him.”

President Donald Trump made similar accusations on social media and defended ICE’s work.

Noem alleged that the woman was part of a “mob of agitators” and said the officer followed his training. She said the FBI would investigate.

But Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called Noem’s version of events “garbage.”

“They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defense,” Frey said. “Having seen the video myself, I wanna tell everybody directly, that is bullshit.”

He also criticized the federal deployment and said the agents should leave.

The shooting marked a dramatic escalation of the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations in major cities under the Trump administration. Wednesday's is at least the fifth death linked to the crackdowns.

The Twin Cities have been on edge since DHS announced the operation’s launch Tuesday, at least partly tied to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

A crowd of protesters gathered at the scene after the shooting to vent their anger at local and federal officers.

In a scene that hearkened back to crackdowns in Los Angeles and Chicago, people chanted “ICE out of Minnesota” and blew whistles that have become ubiquitous during the operations.

Gov. Tim Walz said he was prepared to deploy the National Guard if necessary. He expressed outrage over the shooting but called on people to keep protests peaceful.

“They want a show,” Walz said. “We can’t give it to them.”

There were calls on social media to prosecute the officer who shot Macklin Good.

Commissioner Bob Jacobson of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety said state authorities would investigate the shooting with federal authorities.

Several of those laws, especially one taking over the Metro Nashville Airport Authority, have been held up in court for years.

The fight dates back to 2023, when Republicans in the Tennessee General Assembly passed several bills aimed at stripping power from Metro, following the Metro Council’s refusal to support a bid for the Republican National Convention. Several of those laws, especially one taking over the Metro Nashville Airport Authority, have been held up in court for years.

Metro sued the state over the law restricting the council’s size, and in 2024 a three-judge trial court panel ruled that the law breached the state constitution’s Home Rule Amendment.

“This bill was full of extraordinary provisions that were a gross overreach of their constitutional authority,” Dietz said.

But last year, an appellate court panel reversed that decision in a split ruling that said the law did not violate the Home Rule Amendment because it “clearly applies to all counties that have formed or will form a consolidated metropolitan government.” Nashville’s is one of just three metropolitan governments in the state, and it’s the only one with a legislative body made up of more than 20 members.

Judge Kenny Armstrong dissented from the appellate panel decision, pointing out that the state constitution explicitly exempts metropolitan governments from a 25-member cap on the number of seats a local government body can have.

The Tennessee Supreme Court granted Metro’s request for an expedited hearing on the case.

Dietz told the council’s Charter Revision Committee on Wednesday that Metro will file its final brief in the case by Jan. 16, and Supreme Court hearings on both the council and the airport authority cases are expected on Feb. 12. He said the legal department is working on its oral argument, and that there is no specific timeframe for a potential decision to be handed down.

Metro will argue next month that the law violates the Home Rule Amendment and the specific constitutional provision exempting metropolitan governments from a cap on legislative body size. Dietz said Metro would also argue that the entire law is moot because the implementation deadlines in the case passed nearly three years ago.

The Metro Planning Department was already working on new maps reflecting a smaller Metro Council in 2023 before an injunction put the law on hold. That work could pick up speed in the coming months if the council is forced to shrink itself ahead of 2027 Metro elections.

“We think we’re going to win, but if we don’t win we have to be prepared for having an election in 2027 with a vastly different landscape,” Dietz said.

Nashville voters soundly rejected a 2015 charter amendment proposal that would have reduced the Metro Council from 40 members to 27.

“I don’t expect us to lose, but I also think we need to engage the public as quickly as we can,” Councilmember Emily Benedict said.

During legislative deliberation, Sen. Mark Pody (R-Lebanon) was the only Republican senator to vote against the bill. He is the only Republican to represent any part of Nashville in the legislature.

“I hate where the state is reaching down and telling local governments what to do,” he said.

House Majority Leader William Lamberth was a main champion of the bill, alternating between criticizing Nashville governance and claiming that the legislation was about more than just Nashville.

“This isn’t just about Nashville,” Lamberth said. “It’s about every single city in this state not being able to expand and make the mistake Nashville made 50 years ago to have 40 members.”

Sumner County, Lamberth’s home, has a county commission made up of 24 members, plus nearly 50 more councilmembers and commissioners in the county’s municipalities.",https://i0.wp.com/nashvillebanner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Metro-Council-Safety-committee-11-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1920&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2026-01-08 07:56:58.917334

Legal battles about those and myriad other Florida issues remain unresolved heading into 2026. Here are 10 big legal issues to watch in the coming year:

ALLIGATOR ALCATRAZ: That immigrant-detention center in the Everglades has spawned a series of court battles since Florida opened the facility this summer. For example, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is scheduled to hear arguments in April in a case that alleges violations of a federal environmental law. Other cases involve issues such as detainees’ access to attorneys and whether the state has withheld public records.

BOOK FIGHTS: Publishing companies, authors and parents are challenging state and local education officials in federal lawsuits after books were removed from school libraries because of alleged improper content. For instance, a case at the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals challenges a 2023 state law that led to books being removed.

GUNS: Nearly eight years after the measure passed following the mass shooting at Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the U.S. Supreme Court is deciding whether to take up the National Rifle Association’s challenge to a law that prevents people under age 21 from buying rifles and other long guns. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier has taken the unusual step of refusing to defend the law.

IMMIGRATION: A panel of the Court of Appeals heard arguments in October about a law that created state crimes for undocumented immigrants who enter or re-enter Florida. The state appealed after a U.S. district judge issued a preliminary injunction, ruling the 2025 law was likely preempted by federal immigration authority. It remains unclear when the appellate panel will issue a decision.

MARIJUANA: After falling short in 2024 of passing a constitutional amendment to allow recreational marijuana, the political committee Smart & Safe Florida wants to take the issue back to voters in 2026. But first, it needs to submit enough signatures and get Florida Supreme Court approval of the proposed ballot wording. The court review could turn into a fight, as Gov. Ron DeSantis and Attorney General James Uthmeier oppose allowing recreational marijuana.

SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS: A U.S. district judge in 2026 is expected to rule on the constitutionality of a 2021 Florida law that placed restrictions on social-media platforms, such as preventing the sites from banning political candidates. Tech industry groups challenged the law, which passed after Facebook and Twitter, now known as X, blocked President Donald Trump from their platforms after Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

SOCIAL MEDIA RESTRICTIONS: Saying social media was harming children’s mental health, Florida lawmakers in 2024 passed a measure to prevent children under age 14 from opening accounts on certain platforms. Parents would have to give consent for 14- and 15-yearolds to have accounts on the platforms. Industry groups filed a First Amendment challenge and were backed by a district judge. The issue is pending at the Court of Appeals.

TRANSGENDER ISSUES: Gov. Ron DeSantis’ administration and lawmakers in recent years have approved a series of measures aimed at transgender people, sparking legal battles. For example, the Court of Appeals is weighing the constitutionality of a state law and regulations that restrict treatments for people with gender dysphoria. It also is considering a challenge to a ban on Medicaid coverage for hormone therapy and puberty blockers.

UTILITY RATES: The state’s Office of Public Counsel and two consumer groups have gone to the Florida Supreme Court to challenge a decision by utility regulators to approve Tampa Electric Co. base-rate increases that began to take effect in 2025. Meanwhile, the Office of Public Counsel and consumer groups have indicated they likely will also challenge a November decision by regulators to approve a Florida Power & Light base-rate settlement.",http://www.aroundosceola.com/sites/aroundosceola.com/files/2026-01/Legislative-update.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 07:57:17.747495

“I’ll play the tape for you right now,” Mr. Trump said.
Before the video began, Mr. Trump acknowledged the tragic nature of the shooting.
“Well,” Mr. Trump said.
“I — the way I look at it … ” “It’s a terrible scene,” Mr. Trump said at the end of the video.","President Trump wanted to run the tape.

Just hours after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot a 37-year-old woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday, Mr. Trump told a group of New York Times reporters that the woman was at fault because she had tried to “run over” the officer.

We were in the Oval Office for an interview with the president, and the unfolding situation in Minneapolis was high on our list of questions. As soon as we started asking him about the incident, he said: “I want to see nobody get shot. I want to see nobody screaming and trying to run over policemen either.”

When we pressed Mr. Trump on his conclusion that the victim, Renee Nicole Good, tried to run over the agent, he asked an aide to pull up the video on a laptop in an effort to prove his point.

“That was a vicious situation that took place,” Mr. Trump said, apparently referring to what federal officials have said was an effort by Ms. Good to run down an ICE agent.

The exchange was a glimpse into Mr. Trump’s reflexive defense of what has become a sometimes violent federal crackdown on immigration, which in this case claimed the life of an American citizen who was protesting ICE’s presence in Minneapolis.

Speaking at a news conference in Minneapolis, Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said that the woman was “stalking” officers, and that the agent who killed her “used his training to save his own life and that of his colleagues.”

But details were in dispute. State and local officials described federal accounts of the shooting with terms like “propaganda” and “garbage.”

Mr. Trump stuck to his position even as we pointed out the inconsistencies and the lack of clarity in videos circulating in social media. We asked if, in his mind, firing into a vehicle like that is acceptable.

“She behaved horribly,” Mr. Trump said. “And then she ran him over. She didn’t try to run him over. She ran him over.”

We told the president the videos on social media were unclear.

“I’ll play the tape for you right now,” Mr. Trump said.

Mr. Trump’s aide Natalie Harp brought a laptop over to the Resolute Desk to show us what he said would be evidence of the woman’s wrongdoing.

Before the video began, Mr. Trump acknowledged the tragic nature of the shooting. “With all of it being said, no, I don’t like that happening,” he said, before pivoting to his common refrain of criticizing illegal immigration.

As a slow-motion surveillance video of the shooting played on the laptop, we told him that this angle did not appear to show an ICE officer had been run over.

“Well,” Mr. Trump said. “I — the way I look at it … ”

“It’s a terrible scene,” Mr. Trump said at the end of the video. “I think it’s horrible to watch. No, I hate to see it.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/08/multimedia/08dc-trump-minnesota-bwfl/08dc-trump-minnesota-bwfl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 10:59:39.562828

FEMA terminated dozens of CORE staff late last year, though the agency has said that was a routine part of the agency’s operations.
President Trump and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem have repeatedly voiced frustration with FEMA and floated the idea of eliminating it entirely, arguing states should handle their own disaster recovery efforts.
Thompson said FEMA’s workforce should not consider that built up workforce expendable.
“These are the professionals responsible for disaster response, recovery, and preparedness to support Americans when they are at their most vulnerable,” he said.","The Federal Emergency Management Agency should not take any steps to further slash its workforce, the top House Democrat with oversight over the agency said, following reports that the Trump administration is looking to institute reductions.

Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., the ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee, called any plans to significantly cut FEMA’s staffing levels ""irresponsible"" and leave the agency incapable of handling upcoming hurricane seasons. His comments followed reporting from several outlets that FEMA has put together plans to eliminate more than 40% of its Cadre of On-Call Response and Recovery (CORE) staff, who make up the bulk of FEMA’s workforce.

FEMA terminated dozens of CORE staff late last year, though the agency has said that was a routine part of the agency’s operations. CORE employees, who quickly deploy after disaster strikes, are hired on two-to-four year terms that can be extended based on the availability of work.

The plans, which were preliminary and not directing any specific action, were first reported by The Washington Post. President Trump and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem have repeatedly voiced frustration with FEMA and floated the idea of eliminating it entirely, arguing states should handle their own disaster recovery efforts. For now, Trump has appointed a panel to review the agency’s mission and recommend changes to its structure.

The panel has yet to release its findings and last month canceled a meeting at which it was scheduled to vote on its final report. Noem has taken an unusually direct role in determining which CORE employees can have their contracts renewed, The Post found.

Thompson noted FEMA has already lost 2,000 of its full-time, permanent workforce due to “mismanagement and disastrous policies” and said further would undermine the agency.

“Even considering cuts of this scale is more evidence of the Trump administration’s reckless and dangerous behavior and sends a clear message that the administration is willing to gamble with Americans’ lives and violate federal law that Congress passed to ensure readiness for disasters,” Thompson said.

Trump has yet to nominate a permanent administrator for FEMA, which is currently operating under its third acting head since the president took office. As of June, half of the agency’s Senior Executive Service roles were vacant. The Government Accountability Office recently found FEMA began the 2025 hurricane season with only 12% of its incident management workforce available, a five-year low. Agency officials said they have to scramble to reassign employees when a disaster strikes, taking staff away from ongoing recovery efforts elsewhere.

Former FEMA officials have warned that the staffing cuts, particularly in the leadership ranks, would lead to lost capacity and institutional knowledge.

FEMA for years struggled with ​​insufficient staffing, which was exacerbated by the ever-growing demands of a more intense and frequent disaster season. That continued into the Biden administration as the COVID-19 response and a lack of downtime between deployments led to burnout within the workforce. Toward the end of his presidency, however, FEMA reported making headway in its recruiting efforts—in part due to a legislative reform that made it easier for part-time responders to come and go from the agency—and officials stressed they had the personnel necessary for multiple concurrent crises.

Thompson said FEMA’s workforce should not consider that built up workforce expendable.

“These are the professionals responsible for disaster response, recovery, and preparedness to support Americans when they are at their most vulnerable,” he said. “The Trump administration’s continued efforts to weaken FEMA through drastic staffing reductions undermines public safety and the resilience of the entire country.”

FEMA has stressed the leaked plans do not amount to a mandate to institute cuts and was merely a tool to weigh its options.",https://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/cd/2026/01/07/010725_Getty_GovExec_FEMAcuts/open-graph.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 09:58:02.166776

We must be firm in our values and choose representation, due process and dignity for every New Yorker.","Over the past 11 months, we’ve witnessed our federal government commit alarming human rights violations and systematically dismantle due process protections within our immigration system. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement immigration raids have targeted New Yorkers in their homes, in their workplaces, in courthouses and even in their schools and places of worship.

These attacks tear entire communities apart, threaten family unity, undermine our core values and harm our economy. As we confront this injustice, we must defend due process and our democratic values by ensuring that anyone facing deportation has legal representation to help them understand their rights in a complex immigration system.

For immigrant New Yorkers facing deportation, having an attorney can mean the difference between being at home with loved ones, contributing at work and thriving in their neighborhoods, or languishing in inhumane conditions in detention and facing permanent separation from their families and communities. These risks are not isolated or rare. Over the past six months, ICE has increasingly detained people who were simply attending immigration court for required appointments or hearings. Attorneys provide critical protection in this hostile environment, helping clients not only to prove their case so that they can remain in the country but also to safely navigate a system that now punishes compliance with the law.

Albany must meet this moment by taking three clear steps to defend due process and our immigrant neighbors.

Invest $175 million in immigration legal defense and social services: Strengthen and expand emergency deportation defense, sustain existing programs, retain experienced staff and invest in long-term infrastructure to ensure that the legal services field remains ready to respond to a changing immigration landscape and provide high-quality services statewide.

Pass the Access to Representation Act (ARA, A270/S141): Establish a right to counsel in immigration court for anyone who can’t afford a lawyer. This would ensure fairer proceedings, as representation significantly increases the likelihood of being granted relief and allows longstanding community members to remain in the country and with their loved ones.

Pass the Building Up Immigrant Legal Defense Act (BUILD Act, A2689/S4538): Invest in the infrastructure needed to make this right a reality. This bill focuses on workforce development to recruit, train and retain immigration attorneys. It also expands services to rural and suburban areas and integrates comprehensive support from social workers and community-based organizations to coordinate client support.

Unleashing an agenda of mass detention and deportations is a devastating and cruel choice by the federal government. New York state must now choose whether we will stand aside and watch or take action by funding the protection our neighbors need to fight back.

Immigrant New Yorkers power this state’s economy and strengthen our communities. New York cannot thrive without them, and we cannot allow them to stand alone. We must be firm in our values and choose representation, due process and dignity for every New Yorker. Just as New York led the nation in establishing a public defender program, we must lead again.",https://cdn.cityandstateny.com/media/img/cd/2026/01/08/GettyImages_2241446569/open-graph.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 11:57:48.512081

That leaves only a handful of resources available to track ICE flights.
The deportation flights are organized by two aeronautical service companies that have contracts with Harry Reid, Bertaki said.
Avelo ranked third last year for its number of deportation flights, operating more than 1,700 of the flights through November 2025.","Avelo Airlines will end its contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and stop deportation flights by Jan. 27, spokesperson Courtney Goff told The Nevada Independent Tuesday.

The budget, Houston-based airline operated the majority of the 124 ICE-chartered flights that stopped at Las Vegas’ Harry Reid International Airport in 2025, according to new data shared exclusively with The Indy by the immigrant- and refugee-focused nonprofit Human Rights First. That’s more than double the 60 ICE-chartered flights that passed through Las Vegas in 2024.

Of last year’s flights, 74, or nearly 3 of 5, were operated by Avelo, which ceased commercial operations in Las Vegas in August.

Goff said Avelo’s ICE contract “provided short-term benefits but ultimately did not deliver enough consistent and predictable revenue to overcome its operational complexity and costs.”

It is unclear why deportation flights stop in Nevada and if the planes pick up detainees held in detention centers in the state. ICE discloses little information about the flights’ passengers or paths, multiple immigration experts told The Indy.

ICE representatives did not respond to requests for comment from The Indy.

Federal immigration authorities use the flights to transfer detainees between detention centers and major deportation facilities and to deport detainees.

Some detainees are placed on multiple domestic flights before being sent to deportation facilities in a process Human Rights First refers to as the domestic “shuffle.”

The Obama and Biden administrations also shuffled detainees around the country, but the pace of such flights has increased dramatically under the Trump administration. The ICE Flight Monitor counted more than 7,300 domestic shuffle flights between Jan. 20 and Nov. 30, 2025, a 114 percent increase compared with the number of shuffle flights during the same period in 2024.

The Los Angeles Times reported in September 2025 that detainees were being transferred at much higher rates under the second Trump administration than under Biden, with twice as many detainees being transferred at least four times compared with in 2024.

How deportation flights work

Deportation flights are notoriously difficult to track and have grown even more opaque under the second Trump administration, said Savi Arvey, director of research and analysis at Human Rights First.

The nonprofit tracks the flights through its ICE Flight Monitor using publicly available aviation data, according to its website.

Arvey told The Indy that while the Biden administration also kept data on deportation flights secret, it was generally more forthcoming when detainees were removed to foreign countries.

ICE contracts its air operations through the company CSI Aviation, which in turn subcontracts operations to 10 airline carriers. Although federal immigration agents are usually onboard, flights are primarily staffed by the airlines’ civilian crews.

At least some of the airlines with ICE contracts, including Avelo, have removed their logos from aircraft used to transport detainees, leaving only tail numbers as identification. The airlines have also utilized a federal aviation law that allows them to block certain planes from appearing on flight tracking websites.

That leaves only a handful of resources available to track ICE flights. Human Rights First’s flight monitor relies on a “very complex process that took us a long time to learn,” said Arvey.

Beyond the lack of public transparency over flight patterns, immigration experts told The Indy that detainees often have no idea where they are going and whether they are being sent to another domestic facility or being permanently deported.

“This can make people terrified,” said Michael Kagan, a UNLV professor who directs the university’s immigration law clinic. “ICE moves people with no warning. Lawyers aren’t told. Family isn’t told. … They’ll even sometimes reverse the move and bring people back to the first detention center with no explanation.”

Kagan also said ICE fails to regularly update its detainee locator.

Relocations make it harder for detainees to secure adequate legal representation, Kagan said. Sometimes detainees are transferred out of state before lawyers can complete their intake requirements, he said, and some states have residency requirements for legal filings that make it impossible for detainees to secure consistent representation.

“It’s definitely not what you would do if you wanted fair procedures and to make sure the law is applied correctly,” he said.

Lucas Guttentag, a professor at Stanford Law School who tracks federal immigration policy, told The Indy he believes the increase in domestic transfers is part of “the public spectacle and private terror of the Trump administration’s actions.”

The purpose of domestic shuffles, he argued, “is to frighten people about enforcement actions.”

Last year, both ProPublica and The American Prospect reported on allegations by multiple flight attendants of inadequate security and safety measures on ICE-chartered flights, including federal agents forcing detainees to remain handcuffed while in the air and failing to check detainees’ luggage before takeoff.

Airports also have little information about or control over deportation flights.

Harry Reid International Airport spokesperson Monika Bertaki told The Indy that they do not receive advance notice of ICE-chartered flights and do not receive information on passengers onboard. “Armed federal agents that are on airport property” do trigger additional security measures, she said.

The deportation flights are organized by two aeronautical service companies that have contracts with Harry Reid, Bertaki said. Neither of those companies responded to The Indy’s requests for comment.

Of ICE’s partner airlines, Avelo is sole commercial operation

In May 2025, Avelo announced it had agreed to operate deportation flights, becoming the first — and so far only — commercial airline to sign an ICE contract. The agency’s other contracts are with charter airlines.

Avelo ranked third last year for its number of deportation flights, operating more than 1,700 of the flights through November 2025. Avelo-owned planes made their first immigration-related stops in Las Vegas in May 2025.

For a number of months last year, it was the only ICE-contracted airline that made stops in Las Vegas.

The Avelo-ICE contract was criticized by Democrats nationwide, some of whom introduced legislation aiming to cut Avelo’s public funding. Critics also organized protests in or near airports to lobby against the Avelo contract and signed online pledges to boycott the company.

But Goff, the Avelo spokesperson, denied such actions were part of Avelo’s decision.

“We did not see an impact in regard to customers choosing to fly,” Goff wrote. “It was a commercial decision.”

""Let the investigation play out and hold people accountable based on the investigation.""","President Trump's border czar Tom Homan accused members of Congress of inciting violence against ICE after an officer with the law enforcement agency fatally shot a woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday.

In an interview with ""CBS Evening News"" anchor Tony Dokoupil on Wednesday, Homan watched a video of the deadly incident but declined to comment on what he saw.

Homan responded: ""I'm not going to make a judgment call on one video when there's a hundred videos out there.""

Instead, he claimed that members of Congress have called the incident ""murder,"" which he said will only incite ""more violence, more threats and hopefully not more bloodshed"" against ICE employees.

Homan did not name any lawmakers, though a handful of House Democrats referred to the killing as a murder in social media posts throughout the day. Most lawmakers who condemned the incident did not call it a murder in their public statements.

""I'm not going to comment on an ongoing investigation,"" Homan said, before pivoting to chastise those who have criticized ICE. ""The comments about murder [are] going to incite … more violence, more threats and hopefully not more bloodshed.""

""It'd be unprofessional to comment on what I think happened in that situation,"" Homan said. ""Let the investigation play out and hold people accountable based on the investigation.""

The Department of Homeland Security quickly labeled the incident as ""an act of domestic terrorism"" and claimed a ""violent rioter"" had ""weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them.""

Witnesses and videos dispute the agency's narrative.

In recent days, the Trump administration began a massive deployment of Department of Homeland Security agents to the Twin Cities area as part of an expanded immigration crackdown.

When asked by CBS News if he has ever seen an example of excessive force, Homan blamed public anger toward the agency on ""false media reporting"" and ""hateful rhetoric"" pushed by some public officials. Homan added that through his reviews, he has not seen any ICE officers ""act inappropriately.""",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/08/4deefb4b-f458-4070-ac7d-f6351e7a74e4/thumbnail/1200x630/9314197d10cdf17371dec82dad8a3250/cbsn-fusion-border-czar-tom-homan-denies-ice-agents-deployed-under-trump-have-used-excessive-force-thumbnail.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 09:58:05.316454

The woman shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent during a federal operation in the US state of Minnesota has been identified as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good.

Good was fatally shot on Wednesday, Jan. 7, just blocks from her home, where she lived with her partner and three children, according to media reports.

Speaking to the Minnesota Star Tribune, Good’s mother, Donna Ganger, said that family members were notified of her death late Wednesday morning.

“That’s so stupid,” Ganger said after learning details of the shooting, adding: “She was probably terrified.”

Ganger said that her daughter was not involved in any protest directed at ICE agents, adding: “Renee was one of the kindest people I’ve ever known.”

""She was extremely compassionate. She’s taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.”

An Instagram account appearing to belong to Good describes her as a poet, writer, wife and mother living in Minneapolis. She previously studied creative writing at Old Dominion University in Virginia, where she won the school’s undergraduate poetry prize in 2020.

University President Brian O. Hemphill, in a statement, said Good graduated from the school in 2020 with an English degree, calling her killing ""yet another clear example that fear and violence have sadly become commonplace in our nation.""

""May Renee’s life be a reminder of what unites us: freedom, love, and peace,"" Hemphill said, adding: ""My hope is for compassion, healing, and reflection at a time that is becoming one of the darkest and most uncertain periods in our nation’s history.”

Good was previously married to Timmy Ray Macklin Jr., who died in 2023, according to the Tribune. His father, Timmy Ray Macklin Sr., said the couple shared a 6-year-old child. “There’s nobody else in his life,” Macklin said. “I’ll drive. I’ll fly. To come and get my grandchild.”

Hundreds gathered Wednesday evening for a vigil near Good’s home, chanting her name as they walked through the neighborhood. Speakers described her as a peaceful neighbor who acted out of care for others.

Neighbors described Good as warm and attentive, often outside with her young son. “It’s a beautiful family,” Mary Radford, who lived next door, told the newspaper. “We’re gonna miss seeing them -- forever.”

Good’s shooting

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) claimed that Good, 37, attempted to hit officers with her vehicle, prompting an agent to fire in what officials described as an act of ""self-defense.""

Local officials disputed that account, with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey saying he reviewed video footage of the shooting and rejected claims that it was justified, calling it a reckless use of force. He demanded that the federal immigration agents leave the city.

Releasing a joint statement on the incident, the Minneapolis City Council said Good was a resident whose “life was taken today at the hands of the federal government.”

“Anyone who kills someone in our city deserves to be arrested, investigated, and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” said the council, demanding ICE “immediately leave our city so we can get rid of their chaos and violence that ended the life of one of our neighbors today.”

Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin wrote on the US social media company X that ICE officers were conducting targeted operations when ""rioters"" began blocking them and ""one of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle.""

An ICE officer ""used his training and saved his own life and that of his fellow officers,"" she said, adding that officers injured in the incident were expected to make full recoveries.

But Gov. Tim Walz echoed the mayor's view, calling the Department of Homeland Security's account of the incident the product of ""propaganda.""

""The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice,"" he wrote on X.

Frey said he was aware of the shooting, while accusing federal immigration enforcement agents of causing ""chaos"" in Minneapolis.

""We're demanding ICE to leave the city immediately. We stand rock solid with our immigrant and refugee communities,"" Frey wrote on X.",https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2026/01/08/thumbs_b_c_af7ab2dfdc4cb72c99446c4e402c8299.jpg?v=123203,N,,2026-01-08 06:57:02.525879

“I want to warn viewers that this video is hard to watch,” CNN anchor Jake Tapper said.","Cable news networks sprung into action on Wednesday to cover the breaking news of a woman killed by a federal immigration agent in Minneapolis, rushing correspondents to the scene and bringing on former government officials and legal analysts to offer commentary.

The three main cable networks’ on-screen graphics framed the incident slightly differently. Fox News referred to it as a “Deadly ICE-involved Shooting”, while CNN said more plainly: “ICE Officer Kills Woman in Minneapolis.”

The progressive network MS NOW – formerly MSNBC – also characterized the incident in part as “Agent Kills Woman” in an on-screen graphic.

Both CNN and Fox News brought on former officials from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to provide analysis based on their government experience, though their conclusions differed.

John Sandweg, who served as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) during the Obama administration, questioned whether the federal agents had been properly trained and vetted.

“My immediate concern is this: to what extent has this rushing of hiring of people – this shortcutting on our trainin g – to what extent might that have informed what happened here,” he said on CNN.

Chad Wolf, the former acting United States secretary of homeland security, appeared on Fox News and criticized Minneapolis’s mayor, Jacob Frey, for his comments during a press conference, when he told ICE to “get the fuck out of” the city.

“The mayor’s comments were probably some of the most unintelligible, unhinged comments I think I’ve heard in quite some time,” Wolf said, accusing Frey of having unfairly blamed the federal agents while laying “no blame at all on the individuals that are impeding law enforcement”.

“If you get in their way, and you don’t take their commands, well then that’s against the law,” Wolf added.

Paul Mauro, a Fox News contributor and former inspector in the New York City police department, also seemed to put blame on the protesters, saying many “really want confrontation” and document ICE actions using cellphone video “to get social media clicks”.

Fox News host Laura Ingraham said the incident is “the legacy of the normalization of violence and disrespect toward law enforcement that was legitimized and in many ways celebrated – mostly by the Democrats, far-left agitators, for years”.

But network personalities and guests were not unified in their perspective on the incident.

Jessica Tarlov, a prominent left-leaning voice on Fox News, shared a video of the shooting on X and called it “horrific”. “A full investigation is needed ASAP. Sure looks like ICE just killed that woman,” she said.

On MS NOW, former chief of the US Capitol police Tom Manger also criticized the remarks by Frey, the Minneapolis mayor. “When elected officials get out in front of an investigation and give you their conclusions, I don’t know how helpful that is,” he said.

While video spread quickly across social media, CNN said it would need to verify it before being able to show it. “I want to warn viewers that this video is hard to watch,” CNN anchor Jake Tapper said.

On MS NOW, Nicolle Wallace aired one of the most widely shared videos, cautioning viewers that it is “really disturbing” but said it was “really important” for people to see.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b4e480bb47cc4a6d20757cb0ddf1348365ca86a/123_0_1200_960/master/1200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=642ae420990152698a60273bfe1abaed",N,,2026-01-08 06:57:06.119853

In September, an immigration agent shot and killed 38-year-old Silverio Villegas González in Franklin Park, Illinois during the feds’ enforcement surge in Chicago and its surrounding suburbs. Unraveled Press were the first to report that the initial narrative of events from the Department of Homeland Security was quickly disproven by videos captured by witnesses.

Bovino and his team of federal agents have carried out immigration enforcement actions in Los Angeles, and in his home state of North Carolina — with Charlotte being the city specifically targeted by agents. More federal operations have taken place in Louisiana and in Minnesota.

1:35 p.m.

WARNING — Graphic video and details from the scene.

Phil Lewis, deputy editor at the Huffington Post, shared witness video of the incident on social media. He said the witness originally shared the video with the Minnesota Reformer.

The video begins with agents getting out of a pickup truck and walking over to a Honda SUV. Multiple agents surround the SUV. As one masked agent tries to open the driver’s side door of the SUV, the driver of the SUV backs up. A woman’s voice behind the video camera can be heard screaming “no.”

Another agent appears from the front of the SUV, reaching for his waistband. As the driver of the SUV pulls forward, the agent points his gun at the driver and fires multiple shots. The woman’s voice behind the camera can be heard screaming, “oh my f-cking God!”

The SUV veers off, crashing into parked cars on the street. The woman behind the camera screams, “what the f-ck did you do?!”

Agents rush over to the crashed SUV. Witnesses also walk towards the SUV with their cellphone cameras in hand. The video shows some graphic images of the scene before agents begin to cordon off the area.

2:50 p.m.

“I want Minnesotans to hear this from me. The desire to get out of the protest and to speak up to this administration [about] how wrong this is, that is a patriotic duty,” Walz told reporters, adding that civil unrest must be done peacefully.

Walz said the Minnesota National Guard is on standby.

“They’re there to protect you and protect your constitutional rights. These are our neighbors. They don’t wear masks,” Walz said about the Minnesota National Guard. He said the guard members are not bussed in from somewhere else.

He added that the National Guard would protect people and protect in the event that disruptors want to be destructive, as Minneapolis experienced during the civil unrest following the police murder of George Floyd in 2020.

2:55 p.m.

Walz told reporters if he activates the Minnesota National Guard, he would do so under an executive order, “and then they will be put in state duty status.”

Walz told Minnesotans do not give the Trump administration a reason to invoke the Insurrection Act and send in federal troops into Minneapolis. He asked rhetorically, “is this the McCarthy moment?”

“We have a chaotic situation caused by the largest deployment in American history of federal agents into a community with no communication to locals. We had a chaotic situation where an individual is in their car, shot and killed,” Walz said.

He continued, “I want to be very cautious here, because Donald Trump will make this about me. He will make this about politics. This is about public safety, and this about normalcy.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey pushed back on DHS’s narrative in a press conference Wednesday afternoon, saying, “they are already trying to spin this as an action of self defense,” referring to ICE. “Having seen the video of myself, I want to tell everybody directly that is b---s---.”

Witnesses described seeing the woman in the vehicle trying to flee officers when she was shot, disputing the notion that she was attempting to run officers over. Police described the deceased as a “middle-aged white woman” who did not appear to be the target of any law enforcement investigation or activity.

Immigration enforcement officers were conducting targeted operations in Minneapolis when the shooting happened, but it’s unclear what operation ICE was conducting in that particular neighborhood.

U.S. & World

Several video clips of the incident emerged on social media.

In one video, a gray pick-up truck is seen pulling up to a burgundy SUV stopped perpendicular to the truck as someone shouts “get the f— out of our neighborhood.” Agents get out of the truck, and one walks up to the SUV and yanks on the driver’s door handle, ordering the driver to get out. The vehicle reverses.

Another agent is standing near the front of the SUV as it pulls forward. The agent appears to draw his firearm and as the SUV drives forward in his direction he moves backward, shooting into the SUV as it drives off, the video shows.

In another video showing a different angle of the scene, the agent appears to be knocked back as the SUV drives forward before crashing into a parked car and hitting a light pole. President Donald Trump attached the video clip showing this angle to a post on Truth Social, saying the woman driving was “very disorderly, obstructing and resisting,” and that it was hard to believe the agent survived the incident.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said at a press conference Wednesday evening that the ICE agent was ""hit by the vehicle"" driven by the woman who was shot. He went to the hospital and was released, she said.

Noem said the officer, whom officials have not yet identified, had been attacked before while on the job.

“The very same officer who was attacked today had previously been dragged by an anti-ICE rioter who had rammed him with a car and dragged him back in June. He sustained injuries at that time as well,” she said.

Noem said at a press conference earlier in the day that the agents’ vehicles got stuck in the snow and they were trying to push them out when the woman “attacked them.”

“It was an act of domestic terrorism,” she said, without providing further evidence.

At the mayor's news conference, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara expressed concern about the tactics used by ICE agents.

“I do not know the exact circumstances of the shooting, but I would tell you, in any professional law enforcement agency in the country ... it’s obviously very concerning whenever there’s a shooting into a vehicle of someone who’s not armed,” he said, noting that at times it could be justified, but that “most law enforcement agencies in the country have trained very intensely to try and minimize the risk” of using deadly force.

Aidan Perzana, 31, said he witnessed the incident and it didn’t look like the woman was trying to run over an agent.

“I heard that Noem is trying to say they were trying to run down an officer. There was plenty of space between the officers at that point for the vehicle to make it through,” he told NBC News, adding that it looked like the driver was trying to flee.

Emily Heller, 39, wasn’t even dressed when she heard whistles alerting the neighborhood that ICE agents were in the area this morning. When she walked out to her porch she said she saw six or seven ICE vehicles and a person who had parked perpendicular to traffic.

Heller said she saw agents exit their cars and tell the driver to leave, to “get out of here.”

“And then they went up to her car and started trying to open her door, and that’s when I’m sure she got spooked and tried to flee,” Heller said. “So she reversed a little bit and then angled her wheels so she could drive away. And as she was trying to move forward, one of the ICE agents stepped in front of her vehicle and reached across the hood and fired his weapon about three or four times and shot her in the face.”

Aidan’s wife Grace Perzana, 32, said the family has lived in the neighborhood two and a half years and “we love it.”

“We are really happy here. We have a giant shark statue in our front yard and our neighbor has a giant T-Rex statue,” she said. “There is a lot of community art, a lot of people having barbecues with music in their backyards.”

Residents and locals gathered in the street after the shooting, chanting and throwing snowballs in the direction of federal agents, KARE reported. Law enforcement deployed pepper spray and tear gas.

DHS stepping up immigration enforcement

Trump has unleashed immigration agents in cities across America, who have been employing increasingly aggressive tactics. The push has ramped up tensions with local officials in some cities and communities that are increasingly protesting the efforts.

In September, in the Chicago area, an ICE agent fatally shot a man during a traffic stop. His family called for justice and local police said the FBI had been investigating the death.

Since arriving in Minneapolis in early December, ICE officers and agents have arrested roughly 1,400 people, McLaughlin previously said. That is a significant increase from the roughly 300 arrested by Dec. 12.

DHS this week sent hundreds more officers and agents to bolster immigration enforcement in Minneapolis, with the agency posting on social media that it is waging “the largest DHS operation ever” in Minnesota.

The immigration enforcement operation will add up to 2,100 officers, according to two senior DHS officials. The administration began swelling the numbers Sunday and planned to continue adding forces Wednesday, the officials said. That total includes 1,500 enforcement and removal officers and 600 Homeland Security Investigations agents.

During a press conference Wednesday afternoon following the shooting, mayor Frey told ICE agents to ""get the f--- out of Minneapolis.""

The rush of more enforcement follows the posting of a video by a conservative content creator the day after Christmas that alleged Somali-run day care centers in Minneapolis were defrauding American taxpayers by taking federal grant money and not providing any services to children.

The FBI surged investigators in the city to look into the allegations soon after the video was posted, HSI has been door-knocking on Somali businesses since last week and the state of Minnesota concluded from its on-site checks of 10 Somali day care centers targeted in the video that they were operating normally, with children at every site except one, which was not yet open to investigators when they arrived to investigate.

Grace Perzana said she did not believe there were many people of Somali descent on the street where Wednesday’s shooting happened, but said she does have many “Latinx” neighbors.",https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2026/01/MINN-SHOOTING-ICE.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2026-01-08 02:57:24.590002

MINNEAPOLIS (OSV News) ─ Archbishop Bernard A. Hebda is continuing his call for prayers after police said a woman was pronounced dead following a shooting involving a federal agent in Minneapolis Jan. 7.

""Following this morning's deadly shooting in Minneapolis, I reiterate my plea for all people of good will to join me in prayer for the person who was killed, for their loved ones, and for our community,"" Archbishop Hebda, head of the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis, said in a statement following the incident, referring back to his request for prayers on Dec. 23 as immigration enforcement efforts in the Twin Cities drew concerns from some about attending Christmas Masses.

The incident Jan. 7 occurred in the area of 34th Street and Portland Avenue, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara.

The woman shot by an officer with Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been identified by Minnesota media as Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother and poet originally from Colorado.

During a news conference, O'Hara said police responded to the area after receiving a report of a federal law enforcement officer being involved in a deadly force incident, ""meaning shots had been fired.""

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security indicated on social media that ""ICE officers in Minneapolis were conducting targeted operations"" Jan. 7.

Upon arrival, O'Hara said officers found a woman who had suffered a gunshot wound to the head. O'Hara said CPR and other life-saving measures were administered and the woman was transported to Hennepin County Medical Center where she was pronounced dead.

O'Hara said a preliminary investigation into the incident indicated the woman ""was in her vehicle and was blocking the roadway on Portland Avenue, midway between 33rd Street and 34th Street in the city.

""At some point, a federal law enforcement officer approached her, on foot, and the vehicle began to drive off. At least two shots were fired. The vehicle then crashed on the side of the roadway,"" O'Hara said.

O'Hara said the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension are among the agencies investigating the incident.

""This has been a very difficult time for everyone in the city and this is obviously a very, very tragic situation where a woman has lost her life,"" O'Hara said.

""We've dreaded this moment since the early stages of this ICE presence in Minneapolis,"" Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said during his remarks at the news conference.

""We ask that the community continue to call for peace,"" O'Hara said. Frey agreed. ""Let's unite around hope and love and peace and getting justice, that's what we need to be doing right now,"" Frey said.

Archbishop Hebda in his statement appealed for all people ""to lower the temperature of rhetoric, stop fear-filled speculation and start seeing all people as created in the image and likeness of God.""

He said, ""That is as true for our immigrant sisters and brothers as it is for our elected officials and those who are responsible for enforcing our laws.""

Archbishop Hebda also said he wanted to ""echo today the repeated call of the U.S. Catholic bishops that we come together as a nation and pass meaningful immigration reform that does justice to all parties.""

He indicated that the issue is becoming ""more divisive and violent"" the longer the country refuses to grapple with it.

""It is only by working together -- with God's help -- that we will have peace in our communities, state and world,"" he said.",https://img.hghlnd.com/imgix/https://detroitcatholic.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/_1200x630_crop_center-center_none/1152844/20260107T1647-MPLS-ICE-DEADLY-SHOOTING-1810807.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 01:56:27.558299

Hulac,,,,,https://www.njspotlightnews.org/2026/01/in-first-year-trump-targeted-nj-will-he-be-constrained/,"Nobody,” Trump said Tuesday, days after ordering a military raid to seize Venezuelan president Nicholás Maduro.
Once he became America’s 47th president, in January 2025, Trump governed with a bare-knuckled approach, in particular on immigration and defense policy.
He subverted the checks and balances built into the U.S. system of government, notably by installing loyalist Alina Habba without seeking her confirmation before the Senate.
“There’s obviously an endless litany in the ways people’ve been impacted by [Trump],” Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-5th) said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News.
Asked this week about Republicans’ chances in the mid-term elections, Trump talked up his immigration policies.","WASHINGTON – The margin for error for Republicans in Congress was slim before the unexpected death Tuesday of Doug LaMalfa, a conservative rice farmer from northern California: 220 to 213.

Along with the resignation Monday of Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former supporter of President Trump who held a Georgia seat, LaMalfa’s death means House Republicans can lose two votes on a given bill and still pass it. “It’s not a big majority,” Trump said when asked about LaMalfa’s death. “But it’s a unified majority, and it’s people that know what it takes to make America great again.”

There are four vacancies in the House, including the former seat of Mikie Sherrill, New Jersey’s governor elect.

Facing a challenging mid-term election period this November – the president’s party on average loses 28 seats in the House of Representatives – Trump and Republicans in Congress, who hold control of both the House and Senate, show no signs of breaking from the swaggering governance style they embodied in 2025, both state-side and abroad.

“Nobody can take us. Nobody,” Trump said Tuesday, days after ordering a military raid to seize Venezuelan president Nicholás Maduro.

Once he became America’s 47th president, in January 2025, Trump governed with a bare-knuckled approach, in particular on immigration and defense policy.

Backed with an immense public following, the commander in chief trained his ire against Democratic-leaning states, like New Jersey, where his administration canceled offshore wind projects, targeted climate grants, threatened transit projects and moved to jail Democratic officials. In the fall, after a group of lawmakers urged U.S. troops to disobey unlawful commands, Trump called their actions “seditious behavior, punishable by death.”

Domestically, Trump and his political allies punished critics, including Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-10th), the target of a federal prosecution in Newark, and a New York senator over the Gateway train-and-tunnel project. He subverted the checks and balances built into the U.S. system of government, notably by installing loyalist Alina Habba without seeking her confirmation before the Senate. He refused to rule out a third term in the White House, something the U.S. Constitution bans. He and budget officials repeatedly broke the law, according to non-partisan watchdog groups, including by cancelling public-health grants. And he has surrounded himself with the trappings of a king: a military parade in the summer on his birthday, the bulldozing of the White House’s East Wing for a ballroom in his name and banners of his face on federal buildings.

“It’s just been so chaotic,” McIver said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News. “I never thought a bunch of grown people would not be able to work together for the betterment of the millions of people we serve.”

Workers in December hammered new letters, adding Trump’s name, into the facade of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts in Washington – an act that drew legal challenges in federal court.

Though Trump campaigned in 2024 as a populist promising to lower costs for the average American, his signature bill Congress passed into law will benefit the rich and hurt the poor, according to economic analysts.

“This is a reverse Robin Hood,” Peter Chen, senior policy analyst at the think tank New Jersey Policy Perspective, said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News. “It is taking money from people who need it the most and giving it to people who need it the least.”

The wealthiest 10% of households will get an average of $13,600 in benefits annually because of the new law, while those in the lowest 10% of the economic system will lose roughly $1,200 each year.

At the same time, that law will remove about 400,000 people in New Jersey from the U.S.’s largest anti-hunger system, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which provides benefits of $6 a day on average.

Historically, states have not paid the costs to implement SNAP – something the new law changed. And New Jersey is in a small category of states that may be required to pay extra, under language Republicans included during the marathon summer negotiations on the bill.

State legislators in Trenton and Sherrill, a former Democratic House member and the incoming governor, are bracing for the impact the cuts to SNAP and Medicaid, the federal health insurance system for the low-income and disabled, will deliver to the New Jersey state budget.

The state’s Department of Human Services estimates as many as 350,000 people in New Jersey could lose insurance directly due the law, and that, depending on how federal medical taxes are implemented, state hospitals could lose $2.8 billion.

“I think it’s probably fair to say this is the most significant federal legislation affecting Medicaid since the Affordable Care Act was enacted in 2010,” Greg Woods, assistant commissioner at the department, said after passage.

When they wrote the law, Republicans in Congress front-loaded tax breaks for people and held off cuts to these food and health programs, a strategy that may shield their party at the ballot box in November.

“The mindset was just to get people really used to it, to get the states used to having to be more efficient and for the system to work better,” said Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-2nd).

On the environment, Trump and his fellow Republicans in Washington have rescinded or watered down much of the Biden administration’s environmental legacy.

Beyond phasing out tax credits for renewable energy, such as a popular incentive for rooftop solar power, the Trump administration moved to eliminate the legal justification that allows the U.S. to regulate greenhouse gases altogether.

While Congress made sweeping changes to the economy through the Republican tax law, the Trump administration made policy changes that will touch the lives of regular people. It ended a federal program that allowed people to file their taxes for free. It undid a rule that would have limited overdraft banking fees to $5. And it threatened the future of the Gateway project, a lifeline for passenger and freight rail in the Northeast.

“The first thing that comes to mind is Trump’s decision with respect to the Gateway tunnel,” Rep. Nellie Pou (D-9th), reflecting Trump’s second term so far, said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News. “That’s a huge, monumental problem for us.”

During his first term, Trump threatened to launch a barrage of tariffs – taxes on imported goods, passed on to the public. But his economic advisors generally talked him out of it. That was not the case in 2025.

Last year, in an effort to take back wealth “stolen” from the U.S., Trump, who as president can unilaterally impose or end tariffs, issued a barrage of tariffs on countries worldwide that cost the average U.S. household $1,200, according to research Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee, an arm of Congress, released last year.

“There’s obviously an endless litany in the ways people’ve been impacted by [Trump],” Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-5th) said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News. The tariffs and rising health care costs, after Congress declined to extend subsidies for the 2010 health law known as Obamacare, dominated last year, Gottheimer said.

“There’s nothing that hasn’t been impacted by that,” he said of Trump’s tariff agenda.

Premiums for New Jersey patients covered in the 2010 law will rise an average of 15.9% this year, from 2025 prices, according to state officials. Members of Congress are trying to find a way to extend the subsidies for the health law, a path to passage is hazy.

Perhaps the most striking changes with Trump back in Washington for New Jersey, where about 25% percent of residents were born in another country, came on immigration policy.

The administration moved hundreds of thousands of people through the federal immigration detention system last year and shows no signs of stopping.

The White House is eyeing Roxbury Township in Morris County for a possible new detention center, in addition to the use of a military base in South Jersey to hold then deport immigrants.

Asked this week about Republicans’ chances in the mid-term elections, Trump talked up his immigration policies. “We can’t let them forget that we did such a great job on the border.”",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2024/11/donald-trump-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 00:56:58.255308

""The residents putting their personal safety on the line to observe ICE agents and their activities are keeping us safe.","The city of Minneapolis had been preparing for a surge of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents as Donald Trump's blitz on Democratic strongholds rolled out across the country.

Operation Metro Surge began in the city in December, but escalated a few days ago with an influx of federal agents to Minneapolis neighbourhoods.

Like in Los Angeles and Washington DC, ordinary citizens and local organisers have formed networks of those who want ICE gone and who are wiling to help.

They patrol the streets too, warning neighbourhoods of incoming ICE raids, documenting what happens and sometimes offering legal advice to those targeted.

Now, a US citizen has been fatally shot by an ICE agent, and according to a local council member and the area's congressional representative, that person was one of the legal observers, who usually operate in a volunteer capacity.

Renee Nicole Good, 37, has been identified as the victim.

Local councillor and an organiser of these civilian resistance networks Jason Chavez said Ms Good was ""out in our community because of the care and love"" for immigrant neighbours.

""We have a variety of community responders on the ground watching ICE agents, helping families with rent, food, watching our neighbourhoods, making sure that we can keep our neighbourhoods safe and make sure that immigration enforcement isn't splitting our families apart,"" he told local media.

""Making sure that they can alert and blow a whistle whenever ICE is near so their neighbours know what is happening.""

Minneapolis is a sanctuary city, which means the local authorities do little to enforce federal immigration laws. Los Angeles, New York and Chicago are also sanctuary cities.

Local media is reporting that for nearly a year, migrant rights and neighbourhood advocates and activists across the Twin Cities, as Minneapolis and the neighbouring St Paul are known, have been preparing to mobilise in the event of an immigration enforcement surge.

From places of worship to caravan parks, these organisers have set up very active online networks.

They reportedly scan licence plates to identify possible federal vehicles, and hand out whistles to sound a warning of any enforcement presence.

They are connected in chat groups, have code names and two-way radios and use their own cars. Some have legal training, others volunteer their time, effort and smartphones to document what they see in case it might be of legal significance down the line.

In blue cities, when federal agents sent by Donald Trump's administration are on the streets, there will very likely be someone from one of these networks around the corner, too.

In August, the ABC spent an evening inside one of these networks in operation in and around Washington DC as National Guard troops and federal agents patrolled the city.

'We are trying to get there as quickly as possible'

With her car and her phone, Anna, who asked for her real name not to be used, was dedicating several weeknights to patrol the streets of Washington DC, just as National Troops and several federal agencies were.

She worked as a full-time teacher outside the nation's capital during the day, then made her way into the city come nightfall.

""Sometimes maybe 2 hours will go by and nothing will happen and we're just sitting around and we're watching and we're waiting and then sometimes we will realise 40, 50 … police officers are being called to the scene of a simple fight,"" she told the ABC in August when Washington DC was the focus of Donald Trump's crackdown.

""And we're wondering why so many cops are being called to one area.

""So we're basically just trying to go around and get footage and ask questions about everything that's happening because it all feels very performative.

""It feels that this is all supposed to be a big display of a show of force even for things that normally would be a much smaller situation or offence, so we're just trying to get that on film and ask questions and do our due diligence.""

In August, the ABC witnessed Anna and others as they received tip-offs about where law enforcement was suspected to be active that night. In a convoy, they'd travel to that location and start filming.

She said, ""details and context are incredibly important"".

""We need to be vigilant about what the story actually is. We are trying to get there as quickly as possible to see exactly what happened,"" she said.

""It's a community and we're all giving pieces of detail, that are all part of the big puzzle that's being put together that makes it more informative for the entire public. We're all trying to piece the picture together,"" she said.

""We're all trying to help and make it so we know what's going on in our city and our communities.""

In Minneapolis, there are competing narratives about what happened in the lead-up to the death of Ms Good.

Donald Trump claims the victim was a ""professional agitator"". Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a post on X that the ICE officer began firing after a ""violent rioter"".

Some of the other claims coming from federal authorities include that the victim tried to run over ICE agents and that the officers acted defensively.

But with so many people present at the scene of the enforcement activity, there are several videos of the incident taken from multiple angles that will allow the world and any potential investigators to see and judge the shooting for themselves.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has been scathing, saying: ""They're already trying to spin this as an action of self-defence… having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly — that is bullshit.""

The fatal shooting happened just blocks from where an officer of the Minneapolis Police Department murdered black man George Floyd in May 2020.

Observing ICE actions 'not a crime'

Local councillor Chavez had been putting a call-out on his Facebook page for several days ahead of the shooting, asking community members to join the observer networks.

Since the shooting, he has posted several times saying: ""Observing the federal government's actions at 34th and Portland is not a crime, and even if it were, it would not be punishable by death.""

""The deceased should be with us today, but because these masked agents believe they are above the law, [the victim was] murdered for exercising their rights.

""The residents putting their personal safety on the line to observe ICE agents and their activities are keeping us safe. They're documenting the government's criminal activities, driving our friends and family to work or school, and they're providing mutual aid.""

Democratic congressional representative for Minnesota Ilhan Omar said: ""For weeks, ICE's so-called 'Operation Metro Surge' has spread fear, chaos and violence across our state.""

""ICE's actions today were unconscionable and reprehensible. I am beyond outraged that their reckless, callous actions led to the killing of a legal observer in Minneapolis,"" she said.

Just two days ago, the White House issued an update on Operation Metro Surge, saying: ""The streets of Minneapolis are safer today thanks to the hard work of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and their federal partners.""",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/0a9d2f5dd9984dd543467764df7d1e39?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=1774&cropW=3153&xPos=0&yPos=164&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2026-01-08 02:57:28.714657

People protest as law enforcement officers attend to the scene of the shooting involving federal law enforcement agents, Wednesday, Jan. 7, 2026, in Minneapolis.
The shooting marks a dramatic escalation of the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations in major American cities under the Trump administration.
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said Wednesday that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer who shot and killed a motorist acted recklessly.","Court records show that Renee Nicole Macklin Good had previously been married to a man named Timmy Ray Macklin, who died in 2023 at age 36.

The man’s father, Timmy Ray Macklin Sr., told the Minnesota Star Tribune that his son and Macklin Good had a child together who is now 6 years old.

“There’s nobody else in his life,” Macklin Sr. told the paper.

Donna Ganger, the deceased woman’s mother, told the newspaper that the family was notified of the death late Wednesday morning.

“That’s so stupid” that she was killed, Ganger told the newspaper. “She was probably terrified.”

Asked about protesters challenging ICE officers, Ganger said her daughter was “not part of anything like that at all.”

A hospital record obtained by The Associated Press identified the woman as 37-year-old Renae Macklin-Good, though business records spelled her name as Renee Nicole Macklin Good.

In social media accounts, Macklin Good said she was a “Poet and writer and wife and mom” originally from Colorado but “experiencing Minnesota.” A profile picture shows her smiling and holding a young child against her cheek.

In a video from the scene of the shooting posted to social media, a distraught woman is seen sitting near the vehicle crying, describing Macklin Good as her spouse and that they had a 6-year-old child.

“That’s my wife, I don’t know what to do!” wailed the woman, who wasn’t identified.

“Our officer followed his training, did exactly what he’s been taught to do in that situation,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said at a news conference in Minneapolis Wednesday evening.

“Our officer followed his training, did exactly what he’s been taught to do in that situation,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said at a news conference in Minneapolis Wednesday evening.

Noem alleged that the woman who was killed was trying to block officers with her vehicle, had been harassing them through the day and “attempted to run a law enforcement officer over” before she was shot.

“We’ll let the FBI continue the investigation to get it resolved,” she said, adding that the officer was hit by the vehicle, taken to a hospital and released.

Noem added that immigration enforcement has made over 1,500 arrests in Minnesota in recent weeks.

Black Visions, a Black Lives Matter-affiliated group in Minneapolis, said the killing was “the outcome of escalating state violence fueled by raids, fear, and the criminalization of immigrant life.”

“Our communities have been sounding the alarm, and today that violence turned deadly,” reads a statement posted to a Facebook account for the group, which was involved in organizing protests after the police murder of George Floyd in 2020.

“We will not normalize this violence,” it continued. “Our greatest resistance has always been our love and care for one another. They cannot defeat us.”

The Rev. Ingrid Rasmussen, a pastor of nearby Holy Trinity Lutheran Church, said she and other clergy, wearing their stoles and collars, are there “to be in community with a neighborhood that’s hurting and a city that feels under siege.”

Rasmussen, who had opened her church to the community during the protests and rioting after the killing of George Floyd, said she hoped violence wouldn’t happen again, but blamed federal law enforcement activities like Wednesday’s shooting for inciting it.

“We are all gathered around our own grief,” she said.

Lynette Reini-Grandell, 65, had already heard that ICE agents were in her neighborhood when she saw the chaotic scene, one car askew in a lane and ICE vehicles backed up behind it.

She said she tried to figure out what was going on when several gunshots rang out and the car that was askew crashed to a stop.

“She was driving away and they killed her,” said Reini-Grandell of the motorist.

Reini-Grandell said she started recording ICE officers approach the woman’s vehicle and kept a close watch as law enforcement told bystanders to stand back.

“I didn’t want to get shot or chemical sprayed,” she said. “I was much calmer when it was happening than I am now.”

The Department of Justice says in its Justice Manual that firearms should not be used simply to disable a moving vehicle.

The policy allows deadly force only in limited circumstances, such as when someone in the vehicle is threatening another person with deadly force, or when the vehicle itself is being used in a way that poses an imminent risk and no reasonable alternative exists, including moving out of the vehicle’s path.

Police training experts have told The Associated Press that officers are generally taught not to step in front of moving vehicles to try to block them.

Training also emphasizes weighing the totality of the situation, including whether the person involved poses an immediate danger and whether the underlying allegation involves violence.

Many department policies specifically bar firing at vehicles just to stop a fleeing suspect.

Some policing experts say the rules need flexibility, pointing to cases in which people have used vehicles as weapons, including attacks in recent years where cars were driven into crowds.

The debate has been sharpened by high-profile cases, including a 2023 shooting in Ohio in which an officer fired through a windshield in a grocery store parking lot while investigating a shoplifting allegation, killing the pregnant motorist. The officer was later charged and acquitted.

For decades, police departments across the U.S. have limited when officers are allowed to fire at moving vehicles, citing the danger to bystanders and the risk that a driver who is shot will lose control.

The New York Police Department was among the first major agencies to adopt those limits. The department barred officers from firing at or from moving vehicles after a 1972 shooting killed a 10-year-old passenger in a stolen car and sparked protests.

Researchers in the late 1970s and early 1980s later found that the policy, along with other use-of-force restrictions, helped reduce bystanders being struck by police gunfire and led to fewer deaths in police shootings.

Over the years, many law enforcement agencies followed New York’s lead. Policing organizations such as the Police Executive Research Forum and the International Association of Chiefs of Police have recommended similar limits, warning that shooting at vehicles creates serious risks from stray gunfire or from a vehicle crashing if the driver is hit.

Chief Brian O’Hara briefly described the shooting to reporters. Unlike federal officials, O’Hara didn’t say the driver was trying to harm anyone. He said she had been shot in the head.

“This woman was in her vehicle and was blocking the roadway on Portland Avenue. ... At some point a federal law enforcement officer approached her on foot and the vehicle began to drive off,” the chief said.

“At least two shots were fired. The vehicle then crashed on the side of the roadway.”

The governor said he’s prepared to deploy the National Guard if necessary. He also said that like many, he is outraged about the killing, which he described as “predictable” and “avoidable.” But he called for calm.

“They want a show. We can’t give it to them. We cannot,” the governor said during a news conference.

“If you protest and express your First Amendment rights, please do so peacefully, as you always do. We can’t give them what they want.”

The president, in a social media post, said he’d viewed video footage of the incident and criticized the woman who was shot as acting “very disorderly, obstructing and resisting” and “then violently, willfully, and viciously” running over the ICE officer.

The president also described another woman seen screaming in the footage of the incident he viewed as “obviously, a professional agitator.”

“Based on the attached clip, it is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital,” Trump said of the ICE officer.

“The situation is being studied, in its entirety, but the reason these incidents are happening is because the Radical Left is threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis. They are just trying to do the job of MAKING AMERICA SAFE.”

In October, a Chicago woman was shot five times by a Border Patrol agent in a similar incident involving a vehicle, though she survived.

Almost immediately, Homeland Security officials issued a statement labeling Marimar Martinez, a 30-year-old teaching assistant at a Montessori school, as a “domestic terrorist” who had “ambushed” and “rammed” agents with her vehicle.

She was charged in federal court with assaulting a federal officer, a felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison.

But federal prosecutors were later forced to dismiss the case against Martinez before trial after security camera video and body cam footage emerged that her defense lawyers said undermined the official narrative.

The videos showed a Border Patrol agent steering his vehicle into Martinez’s truck, rather than the other way around, her attorney said.

Text messages showed the federal agent bragging about his marksmanship after the shooting.

“I fired 5 rounds and she had 7 holes,” read a text message that the agent, Charles Exum, sent to colleagues. “Put that in your book boys.” Twenty-four hours after the shooting, Exum texted, “Cool, I’m up for another round.”

“I’ve seen the video. Don’t believe this propaganda machine,” Walz wrote on X, responding to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s post alleging that a woman had “weaponized her vehicle” before she was shot and killed by an ICE officer.

The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice,” wrote the governor.

Major protests and rioting erupted in 2020 after Floyd’s death, damaging many businesses that have struggled to recover.

Public safety in the area has long been under scrutiny as well — most recently in November, when a Minneapolis city council member, Jamal Osman, parked just a couple of blocks away from the area, was robbed and his vehicle stolen by suspects he was told had carjacked another person earlier that evening.

Secretary Kristi Noem, during a visit to Texas, says it was carried out against ICE officers by a woman who “attempted to run them over and rammed them with her vehicle. An officer of ours acted quickly and defensively, shot, to protect himself and the people around him.”

But Mayor Frey blasted that characterization as well as the federal deployment in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul.

“They are not here to cause safety in this city. What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,” Frey said.

The location is just a few blocks from some of the oldest immigrant markets in the area and a mile from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020.

During a news conference in Texas on Wednesday, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed that the agency had deployed more than 2,000 officers to the Twin Cities and already made “hundreds and hundreds” of arrests.

The crowd vented its anger at the local and federal officers who were there, including Gregory Bovino, a senior U.S. Customs and Border Patrol official who has been the face of crackdowns in Los Angeles, Chicago and elsewhere.

In a scene that harkened back to the Los Angeles and Chicago immigration crackdowns, bystanders heckled the officers and blew whistles that have become ubiquitous during the operations.

“Shame! Shame! Shame!” and “ICE out of Minnesota!” they loudly chanted from behind the police tape.

That’s according to a statement from department spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin.

The shooting marks a dramatic escalation of the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations in major American cities under the Trump administration. It’s at least the fifth person killed in a handful of states since 2024.

The twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul have been on edge since DHS announced Tuesday that it had launched the operation, with more than 2,000 agents and officers expected to participate in the crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

A federal officer shot and killed a Minneapolis motorist when she allegedly tried to run over law enforcement officers during an immigration crackdown in the city, authorities said Wednesday.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said Wednesday that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer who shot and killed a motorist acted recklessly. Fry rejected federal officials’ claims that the officer had acted in self-defense.

During a news conference hours after the ICE officer shot the woman, whose name hasn’t been released, an angry Frey blasted the federal immigration crackdown on the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul.

The 37-year-old woman was shot in front of a family member during a traffic stop in a snowy residential neighbourhood south of downtown Minneapolis, just a few blocks from some of the city’s oldest immigrant markets and about a mile (1.6 kilometres) from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020. Her death quickly drew a crowd of hundreds of angry protesters.

“They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defence. Having seen the video myself, I wanna tell everybody directly, that is bullshit,” the mayor added.

Videos taken by bystanders from different vantage points and posted to social media show an officer approaching an SUV stopped across the middle of the road, demanding the driver open the door and grabbing the handle. The Honda Pilot begins to pull forward and a different ICE officer standing in front of the vehicle pulls his weapon and immediately fires at least two shots into the vehicle at close range, jumping back as the SUV moves towards him.

It was not clear from the videos whether the vehicle made contact with the officer. The SUV then sped into two cars parked at the kerb nearby before crashing to a stop. Witnesses screamed obscenities, expressing shock at what they had seen.

After the shooting, emergency medical technicians attempted to administer aid to the woman.

“Keep in mind that this is an investigation that is also in its infancy,” Jacobson said. “Any speculation about what has happened would be just that.”

The shooting occurred in the district of Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar, who described it as “state violence”, not law enforcement.

For nearly a year, migrant rights advocates and neighbourhood activists across the Twin Cities have been preparing to mobilise in the event of an immigration enforcement surge. From houses of worship to mobile home parks, they have built extensive online networks, scanned licence plates for suspected federal vehicles, and stocked whistles and other noisemaking devices to alert communities to any enforcement presence.

The backstory:

An ICE agent fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis on Wednesday morning.

Federal officials are claiming the agent acted in self-defense, but Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey is calling ""bullshit"" on that claim.The shooting happened around 9:30 a.m. in the area of East 34th Street and Portland Avenue. The woman died at the hospital.

Witnesses told FOX 9, a woman got into a red vehicle and there was one ICE agent on either side of the vehicle trying to get in, and a third ICE agent came and tried to yank on the driver's side door.

One of the agents on the driver's side door then backed away, and then opened fire, shooting three times through the driver's side window, witnesses said.

One witness claimed that the vehicle wasn't moving toward the agents. However, federal officials said ICE officers were ""conducting targeted operations"" when ""rioters"" blocked officers. One of the ""rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them.""

Officials said an ICE officer who was ""fearing for his life"" fired ""defensive shots"" to save himself and his officers, killing the woman.

A video of the shooting shows a red Honda Pilot blocking the roadway as an ICE squad approaches. When agents approach the vehicle, the Pilot attempts to drive away, moving towards an agent. When that happens, the agent fires three shots at the driver. Police say the driver was struck in the head.

Other non-U.N. organizations on the list include the Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation, the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance and Global Counterterrorism Forum.

""The Trump Administration has found these institutions to be redundant in their scope, mismanaged, unnecessary, wasteful, poorly run, captured by the interests of actors advancing their own agendas contrary to our own, or a threat to our nation's sovereignty, freedoms, and general prosperity,"" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement.

Trump's decision to withdraw from organizations that foster cooperation among nations to address global challenges comes as his administration has launched military efforts or issued threats that have rattled allies and adversaries alike, including capturing autocratic Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and indicating an intention to take over Greenland.

U.S. builds on pattern of exiting global agencies

The administration previously suspended support from agencies like the World Health Organization, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees known as UNRWA, the U.N. Human Rights Council and the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO. It has taken a larger, a-la-carte approach to paying its dues to the world body, picking which operations and agencies it believes align with Trump's agenda and those that no longer serve U.S. interests.

""I think what we're seeing is the crystallization of the U.S. approach to multilateralism, which is 'my way or the highway,'"" said Daniel Forti, head of U.N. affairs at the International Crisis Group. ""It's a very clear vision of wanting international cooperation on Washington's own terms.""

It has marked a major shift from how previous administrations — both Republican and Democratic — have dealt with the U.N., and it has forced the world body, already undergoing its own internal reckoning, to respond with a series of staffing and program cuts.

Many independent nongovernmental agencies — some that work with the United Nations — have cited many project closures because of the U.S. administration's decision last year to slash foreign assistance through the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.

Despite the massive shift, the U.S. officials, including Trump himself, say they have seen the potential of the U.N. and want to instead focus taxpayer money on expanding American influence in many of the standard-setting U.N. initiatives where there is competition with China, like the International Telecommunications Union, the International Maritime Organization and the International Labor Organization.

The latest global organizations the U.S. is departing

The withdrawal from the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, or UNFCCC, is the latest effort by Trump and his allies to distance the U.S. from international organizations focused on climate and addressing climate change.

UNFCC, the 1992 agreement between 198 countries to financially support climate change activities in developing countries, is the underlying treaty for the landmark Paris climate agreement. Trump — who calls climate change a hoax — withdrew from that agreement soon after reclaiming the White House.

Gina McCarthy, former White House National Climate Adviser, said being the only country in the world not part of the treaty is ""shortsighted, embarrassing, and a foolish decision.""

""This Administration is forfeiting our country's ability to influence trillions of dollars in investments, policies, and decisions that would have advanced our economy and protected us from costly disasters wreaking havoc on our country,"" McCarthy, who co-chairs America Is All In, a coalition of climate-concerned U.S. states and cities, said in a statement.

Mainstream scientists say climate change is behind increasing instances of deadly and costly extreme weather, including flooding, droughts, wildfires, intense rainfall events and dangerous heat.

The U.S. withdrawal could hinder global efforts to curb greenhouse gases because it ""gives other nations the excuse to delay their own actions and commitments,"" said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tracks countries' carbon dioxide emissions.

It will also be difficult to achieve meaningful progress on climate change without cooperation from the U.S., one of the world's largest emitters and economies, experts said.

The U.N. Population Fund, the agency providing sexual and reproductive health worldwide, has long been a lightning rod for Republican opposition, and Trump cut funding for it during his first term. He and other GOP officials have accused the agency of participating in ""coercive abortion practices"" in countries like China.

When President Biden took office in January 2021, he restored funding for the agency. A State Department review conducted the following year found no evidence to support GOP claims.

Other organizations and agencies that the U.S. will quit include the Carbon Free Energy Compact, the United Nations University, the International Cotton Advisory Committee, the International Tropical Timber Organization, the Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation, the Pan-American Institute for Geography and History, the International Federation of Arts Councils and Culture Agencies and the International Lead and Zinc Study Group.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5694x3201+0+512/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5d%2F29%2Fe58fcb064f8eb472315e6c4d4421%2Fap25343442464463.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 00:57:02.011108

Minneapolis mayor blasts federal immigration enforcement Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said Wednesday that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer who shot and killed a motorist acted recklessly.
During a news conference hours after the ICE officer shot the woman, an angry Frey blasted the federal immigration crackdown on the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul.","An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a Minneapolis motorist on Wednesday during the Trump administration’s latest immigration crackdown in a major U.S. city — a shooting that federal officials claimed was an act of self-defense but that the city’s mayor described as “reckless” and unnecessary.

Videos taken by bystanders with different vantage points and posted to social media show an officer approaching an SUV stopped across the middle of the road, demanding the driver open the door and grabbing the handle. The SUV begins to pull forward and a different ICE officer standing in front of the vehicle pulls his weapon and immediately fires at least two shots into the SUV at close range, jumping back as the vehicle moves toward him. It was not clear from the videos if the vehicle made contact with the officer. The SUV then sped into two cars parked on a curb nearby before crashing to a stop.

The shooting marks a dramatic escalation of a series of immigration enforcement operations in major U.S. cities under the Trump administration. The killing was at least the fifth linked to immigration crackdowns in a handful of states since 2024.

What federal policy says about shooting at vehicles

The Department of Justice says in its Justice Manual that firearms should not be used simply to disable a moving vehicle.

The policy allows deadly force only in limited circumstances, such as when someone in the vehicle is threatening another person with deadly force, or when the vehicle itself is being used in a way that poses an imminent risk and no reasonable alternative exists, including moving out of the vehicle’s path.

Police training experts have told The Associated Press that officers are generally taught not to step in front of moving vehicles to try to block them.

Related: DHS deploys 2,000 federal agents to Minneapolis area to carry out ‘largest immigration operation ever’

Training also emphasizes weighing the totality of the situation, including whether the person involved poses an immediate danger and whether the underlying allegation involves violence.

Many department policies specifically bar firing at vehicles just to stop a fleeing suspect.

Some policing experts say the rules need flexibility, pointing to cases in which people have used vehicles as weapons, including attacks in recent years where cars were driven into crowds.

The debate has been sharpened by high-profile cases, including a 2023 shooting in Ohio in which an officer fired through a windshield in a grocery store parking lot while investigating a shoplifting allegation, killing the pregnant motorist. The officer was later charged and acquitted.

Why many police agencies limit shooting at moving vehicles

For decades, police departments across the U.S. have limited when officers are allowed to fire at moving vehicles, citing the danger to bystanders and the risk that a driver who is shot will lose control.

The New York Police Department was among the first major agencies to adopt those limits. The department barred officers from firing at or from moving vehicles after a 1972 shooting killed a 10-year-old passenger in a stolen car and sparked protests.

Researchers in the late 1970s and early 1980s later found that the policy, along with other use-of-force restrictions, helped reduce bystanders being struck by police gunfire and led to fewer deaths in police shootings.

Over the years, many law enforcement agencies followed New York’s lead. Policing organizations such as the Police Executive Research Forum and the International Association of Chiefs of Police have recommended similar limits, warning that shooting at vehicles creates serious risks from stray gunfire or from a vehicle crashing if the driver is hit.

Minneapolis Police chief gives no indication that the driver was trying to harm anyone

Chief Brian O’Hara briefly described the shooting to reporters. Unlike federal officials, O’Hara didn’t say the driver was trying to harm anyone. He said she had been shot in the head.

“This woman was in her vehicle and was blocking the roadway on Portland Avenue. … At some point a federal law enforcement officer approached her on foot and the vehicle began to drive off,” the chief said.

“At least two shots were fired. The vehicle then crashed on the side of the roadway.”

Walz calls on protesters to remain peaceful

The governor said he’s prepared to deploy the National Guard if necessary. He also said that like many, he is outraged about the killing, which he described as “predictable” and “avoidable.” But he called for calm.

“They want a show. We can’t give it to them. We cannot,” the governor said during a news conference.

“If you protest and express your First Amendment rights, please do so peacefully, as you always do. We can’t give them what they want.”

Trump says the ICE officer who fatally shot the motorist appears to have been acting in self-defense

The president, in a social media post, said he’d viewed video footage of the incident and criticized the woman who was shot as acting “very disorderly, obstructing and resisting” and “then violently, willfully, and viciously” running over the ICE officer.

The president also described another woman seen screaming in the footage of the incident he viewed as “obviously, a professional agitator.”

“Based on the attached clip, it is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital,” Trump said of the ICE officer.

“The situation is being studied, in its entirety, but the reason these incidents are happening is because the Radical Left is threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis. They are just trying to do the job of MAKING AMERICA SAFE.”

A vigil is planned for the woman killed

An immigrant rights group says on Facebook that it will hold a vigil for the woman who was shot.

“We witnessed an atrocious attack on our community today,” read the post from the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee. “Community members were taken from us and an observer was shot dead. ICE OUT OF MINNESOTA NOW.”

Why is the Minneapolis area the target of what immigration enforcement describes as its largest operation?

Minnesota initially grabbed President Donald Trump’s and Republicans’ attention over a series of fraud cases where many of the defendants had roots in Somalia. Prosecutors say that billions of dollars were stolen from federally funded health care benefits and a COVID-19 program in recent years.

Minnesota has the largest Somali population in the U.S., a group Trump called “garbage” in December and said he didn’t want them in the country.

The president has also criticized Democratic Gov. Walz for failing to catch the alleged crimes.

Late last month, a right-wing influencer posted a video claiming that a day care center in Minneapolis run by Somali residents had taken over $100 million in fraud. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel then posted on social media about increased operations in the city partly targeting, as Patel put it, “large-scale fraud schemes.”

On Tuesday, DHS said it planned to deploy 2,000 federal agents and officers to the Minneapolis area.

Chicago experienced a similar incident during immigration crackdown

In October, a Chicago woman was shot five times by a Border Patrol agent in a similar incident involving a vehicle, though she survived.

Almost immediately, Homeland Security officials issued a statement labeling Marimar Martinez, a 30-year-old teaching assistant at a Montessori school, as a “domestic terrorist” who had “ambushed” and “rammed” agents with her vehicle.

She was charged in federal court with assaulting a federal officer, a felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison. But federal prosecutors were later forced to dismiss the case against Martinez before trial after security camera video and bodycam footage emerged that her defense lawyers said undermined the official narrative.

The videos showed a Border Patrol agent steering his vehicle into Martinez’s truck, rather than the other way around, her attorney said.

Gov. Tim Walz calls Homeland Security’s claims in the Minnesota shooting ‘propaganda’

“I’ve seen the video. Don’t believe this propaganda machine,” Walz wrote on X, responding to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s post alleging that a woman had “weaponized her vehicle” before she was shot and killed by an ICE officer.

The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice,” wrote the governor.

County attorney’s office says investigation must play out before any decision made on charges

Daniel Borgertpoepping, a spokesperson for the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office, says that “We have jurisdiction to bring charges, as do the feds.

“It’s a little bit of a complicated interplay but the bottom line is yes, we have jurisdiction to bring criminal charges.”

Homeland Security secretary describes the incident as an ‘act of domestic terrorism’

Secretary Kristi Noem, during a visit to Texas, says it was carried out against ICE officers by a woman who “attempted to run them over and rammed them with her vehicle. An officer of ours acted quickly and defensively, shot, to protect himself and the people around him.”

But Mayor Frey blasted that characterization as well as the federal deployment in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul.

“They are not here to cause safety in this city. What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,” Frey said.

Shooting occurred in modest neighborhood not far from where George Floyd was killed

The location is just a few blocks from some of the oldest immigrant markets in the area and a mile from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020.

During a news conference in Texas on Wednesday, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed that the agency had deployed more than 2,000 officers to the Twin Cities and already made “hundreds and hundreds” of arrests.

Frey demands ICE leave Minneapolis

The mayor says in a social media post that immigration agents are “causing chaos in our city.”

“We are demanding ICE leave the city and state immediately. We stand rock solid with our immigrant and refugee communities,” Frey said.

A large throng of protesters gather at the scene after the shooting

The crowd vented its anger at the local and federal officers who were there, including Gregory Bovino, a senior U.S. Customs and Border Patrol official who has been the face of crackdowns in Los Angeles, Chicago and elsewhere.

In a scene that harkened back to the Los Angeles and Chicago immigration crackdowns, bystanders heckled the officers and blew whistles that have become ubiquitous during the operations.

“Shame! Shame! Shame!” and “ICE out of Minnesota!” they loudly chanted from behind the police tape.

Department of Homeland Security says an ICE officer shot the woman in a residential neighborhood

That’s according to a statement from department spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin.

The shooting marks a dramatic escalation of the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations in major American cities under the Trump administration. It’s at least the fifth person killed in a handful of states since 2024.

The twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul have been on edge since DHS announced Tuesday that it had launched the operation, with more than 2,000 agents and officers expected to participate in the crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a Minneapolis driver on Wednesday during the Trump administration's latest immigration crackdown on a major American city — a shooting that federal officials said was an act of self-defense but that the mayor described as reckless and unnecessary.

According to sister station KMBC, Minneapolis City Council members identified the victim as Renee Nicole Good, describing her as a “member of our community.”

Donna Ganger, her mother, also identified her to local media in Minneapolis. Good had a 6-year old child, her mother told the Minnesota Star Tribune. Good described herself on social media as a “poet and writer and wife and mom” who was from Colorado.

The 37-year-old woman was shot in front of a family member during a traffic stop in a snowy residential neighborhood south of downtown Minneapolis, just a few blocks from some of the oldest immigrant markets and about a mile from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020.

It’s not clear where Good resided at the time of the shooting, but court records in Jackson County, Missouri, show that her name was connected to an address in Kansas City in 2023. The vehicle involved in the incident was also registered in Kansas City, Missouri, according to KMBC, which confirmed this through vehicle records from a federally recognized source.

It is not clear in the videos if the vehicle makes contact with the officer and there is no indication of whether or not the woman had interactions with ICE officers before the videos started. After the shooting, the SUV speeds into two cars parked on a curb nearby before crashing to a stop.

In another video taken at the scene, a woman, who described Macklin Good as her spouse, is seen crying near the vehicle. The woman, who was not identified, said the couple had only recently arrived in Minnesota and that they had a child.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem described the incident as an “act of domestic terrorism” carried out against ICE officers by a woman who “attempted to run them over and rammed them with her vehicle. An officer of ours acted quickly and defensively, shot, to protect himself and the people around him.”

In a social media post, President Donald Trump made similar accusations against the woman and defended ICE’s work.

Local officials dispute the narrative

Noem claimed the woman was part of a “mob of agitators” and said the officer followed his training. She said the veteran officer who fired his gun had been rammed and dragged by an anti-ICE motorist in June.

“Any loss of life is a tragedy, and I think all of us can agree that in this situation, it was preventable,” Noem said, adding that the FBI would investigate.

But Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey blasted Noem's version of what happened as “garbage” and criticized the federal deployment of more than 2,000 officers to the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul as part of the immigration crackdown.

“What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,” Frey said, calling on the immigration agents to leave. “They’re ripping families apart. They’re sowing chaos on our streets, and in this case, quite literally killing people.”

“They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defense. Having seen the video myself, I wanna tell everybody directly, that is (expletive),” the mayor said.

The shooting happened in the district of Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, who called it “state violence,” not law enforcement.

For nearly a year, migrant rights advocates and neighborhood activists across the Twin Cities have been preparing to mobilize in the event of an immigration enforcement surge. From houses of worship to mobile home parks, they have set up very active online networks, scanned license plates for possible federal vehicles and bought whistles and other noisemaking devices to alert neighborhoods of any enforcement presence.

Shortly after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday, city leaders began looking into whether the officer had violated state criminal law.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said, “We collectively are going to do everything possible to get to the bottom of this, to get justice, and to make sure that there is an investigation that is conducted in full.” Police Chief Brian O’Hara followed up by saying that the state’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is “investigat[ing] whether any state laws within the state of Minnesota have been violated.”

If they conclude that state law has been violated, the question is: What next? Contrary to recent assertions from some federal officials, states can prosecute federal officers for violating state criminal laws, and there is precedent for that.

Although federal officers do have immunity in some circumstances, that protection applies only if their actions were authorized under federal law and “necessary and proper” in fulfilling federal duties. When federal officers violate federal law or act unreasonably when carrying out their duties, they can face state charges.

States have a long history of prosecuting federal officials for allegedly using excessive force on the job. And when federal courts agree that the force may not have been legally justified, they have allowed the state prosecution to proceed.

In a high-profile incident from the 1990s, for example, an FBI sniper shot and accidentally killed an unarmed woman while carrying out a siege of a cabin near Ruby Ridge, Idaho. U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno decided not to pursue charges, but a county prosecutor in the state did, charging the sniper with involuntary manslaughter. The federal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the state prosecution to proceed, concluding that there were “material questions of fact” about whether the sniper’s use of deadly force was reasonable. If it wasn’t, the court explained, he would not be immune from state prosecution. (The charges were later dropped after the prosecutor who brought the case left office.)

Similarly, in 1906, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a state prosecution to go ahead against two federal soldiers who had shot and killed a man they believed was stealing from federal property. As with the Idaho case, key facts were in dispute. The court concluded that if the man had stopped and surrendered, as multiple witnesses attested, “it could not reasonably be claimed that the fatal shot was fired in the performance of a duty imposed by the Federal law,” and the soldiers could be held liable.

There are also a host of cases from the early-1900s prohibition era in which states charged federal officers with murder, attempted murder, or other crimes when they used lethal force to carry out prohibition-related arrests or seize distillery equipment. Again, when federal courts concluded that the federal officers’ use of force appeared unreasonable—such as by shooting into cars that officers believed were transporting alcohol—the courts allowed the state prosecutions to proceed.

To be sure, there are also plenty of cases in which federal courts have instead dismissed state prosecutions on the grounds that the federal officers were properly discharging their federal duties. For example, the foundational Supreme Court case on this type of immunity dismissed a state murder prosecution of a U.S. marshal who had justifiably killed an attacker while protecting a Supreme Court justice. But when an officer’s actions are not authorized by federal law or are not “necessary and proper” to fulfill federal duties—such as when an officer uses unreasonable force—state prosecutions can and do go ahead.

If state or local prosecutors in Minnesota were to charge a federal officer with a state crime, that case would play out differently from a typical state criminal prosecution.

Most significantly, it would likely take place in federal court rather than state court. A federal statute allows federal officers to move state criminal cases from state to federal court if they have a defense rooted in federal law. Any federal officer charged with a state-law crime for actions committed on the job will almost certainly try to claim federal immunity from state prosecution. That defense will typically suffice to get the case into federal court, even if the immunity claim ultimately fails.

But the move to federal court doesn’t mean that federal players would take over the entire process. The state or local prosecutor would still prosecute the case in federal court. And the criminal charges would still be for state-law crimes. Importantly, this means that if an officer were convicted, the president could not pardon them. The president can pardon individuals only for federal crimes, not state crimes.

Additionally, if state or local prosecutors do bring charges, the pretrial litigation over immunity could well be lengthy. In the Idaho case discussed above, for example, the incidents took place in 1992, and it wasn’t until 2001 that the 9th Circuit ultimately ruled that the case could go ahead. The various lower-court proceedings and appeals took considerable time.

Despite these procedural complexities, the bottom line is that federal officers are not categorically immune from state prosecution for actions carried out while on duty. And states have long demonstrated that they are willing to bring such charges when it comes to excessive use of force.",https://compote.slate.com/images/76841c9c-ad18-43a1-b1dd-eb8080548632.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560,N,,2026-01-08 00:57:05.386285

By asserting the absolute litigation privilege where appropriate, litigants can avoid unnecessary and costly litigation.","In American Backflow & Fire Prevention, Inc. v. Hincks et al, 2025 IL App (1st) 250023, the Illinois Appellate Court, Second District, affirmed the dismissal of claims arising from allegedly defamatory statements made to the American Society of Sanitary Engineering (ASSE), the National Institute for Certification in Engineering Technologies (NICET), and the Illinois State Fire Marshal. The Appellate Court held that the statements were protected by Illinois’s absolute litigation privilege and reaffirmed that this privilege applies broadly to communications made before, during, or after judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings and specifically applies to complaints made to certification bodies, such as the ASSE and the NICET.

Background & Procedural Posture

The plaintiffs – a fire protection company and its owner – sued union representatives, a former employee, and counsel, alleging a coordinated campaign to interfere with their business and damage their reputation through complaints to the ASSE, NICET, and the Illinois State Fire Marshal. These complaints challenged whether plaintiffs and their employees had sufficient field experience for ASSE and NICET credentials and alleged that plaintiffs had fraudulently documented their work experience.

Plaintiffs asserted an array of claims—tortious interference with economic advantage, tortious interference with contract, defamation, defamation per se, violations of the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act (815 ILCS 510/1 et seq), and civil conspiracy—seeking nearly $934,000 in damages. Defendants moved to dismiss under 735 ILCS 5/2‑619(a)(9), invoking the absolute litigation privilege. The circuit court (Lake County) dismissed plaintiffs’ Complaint in its entirety, and the Second District affirmed.

The Court’s Analysis

The court’s analysis centered on Illinois’s expansive application of the absolute litigation privilege. The court reaffirmed that the privilege applies broadly to communications made before, during, or after judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings, and even to statements by non-parties, so long as they are pertinent to the matter at hand. Motive is irrelevant, and any doubts about pertinency are resolved in favor of applying the privilege.

To determine whether ASSE and NICET qualified as quasi-judicial bodies, the court applied the six-factor test from Kalish v. Illinois Education Ass’n, 157 Ill. App. 3d 969, 971–72 (1987). The test considers whether the entity has the power to: (1) exercise judgment and discretion; (2) ascertain facts and decide; (3) make binding orders; (4) affect personal or property rights; (5) examine witnesses, compel their attendance, and conduct hearings; and (6) enforce decisions or impose penalties.

The court found that ASSE and NICET satisfied at least five of these factors. Both organizations investigate complaints, exercise discretion in determining whether to revoke certifications, conduct hearings with rights to counsel and witnesses, issue binding decisions on certification status, and impose penalties by revoking credentials. Although they lack subpoena power, the presence of these other powers was sufficient for the court to conclude that ASSE and NICET function as quasi-judicial bodies, triggering the absolute litigation privilege for statements made in connection with their proceedings.

The court further concluded that defendants’ statements were related to the quasi-judicial proceedings they were submitted through each entity’s formal complaint process and specifically questioned plaintiffs’ qualifications for the ASSE and NICET certifications. Even though defendants were not parties to the proceeding, their statements concerned the same subject matter and were necessary to initiate the quasi-judicial proceeding and therefore met the pertinency requirement and are thus protected by the absolute litigation privilege.

The court also found two alternative bases to support the application of the absolute litigation privilege: the statements were made in anticipation of enforcement actions under the Fire Sprinkler Contractor Licensing Act and were related to ongoing NLRB proceedings.

Finally, the court held that, while the plaintiffs brought claims other than defamation, the absolute litigation privilege extended to all claims because they arose from the same allegedly defamatory statements and were merely attempts to recast their defamation claims to avoid the protection afforded by the privilege.

Key Takeaways

This decision reinforces Illinois’s expansive view of the absolute litigation privilege and further clarifies that it can apply to communications with private certification or licensing bodies, even when the speaker is not a party to the proceeding.

Within hours of a Minnesota protester being fatally shot after allegedly attempting to run over ICE agents, a familiar network of far-left protesters for causes ranging from communism to climate change mobilized across the country.

The deceased, identified as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good by the Minneapolis City Council on Wednesday afternoon, was killed at the wheel of her SUV just after 11 a.m. ET.

Federal authorities said she had tried to run over ICE agents who were part of a 2,000-strong team sent to the Twin Cities to round up and deport illegal immigrant criminals.

""This appears to be an attempt to kill or to cause bodily harm to agents, an act of domestic terrorism,"" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said during a news conference late Wednesday in Minneapolis. ""The ICE officer, fearing for his life and the other officers around him and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots. He used his training to save his own life and that of his colleagues.""

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said Good was shot in the head, and later pronounced dead at Hennepin County Medical Center.

""I have just viewed the [video] clip of the event which took place in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is a horrible thing to watch,"" President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""The woman screaming was, obviously, a professional agitator, and the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self-defense.""

Almost immediately, various groups with causes as diverse as socialism, communism, climate change, Palestinian rights and the Democratic Party launched what seemed to be coordinated protests online and in American streets, using similar language.

The effort by left-wing groups with no obvious shared cause echoed protests over the weekend, when many of the same groups sprang into action in the hours following the U.S. capture of Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro.

""It's the same network of people that have thousands of Americans blocking the streets, waving communist and terrorist flags and attacking law enforcement and innocents,"" said Brandy Shufutinsky, director of the Education and National Security Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. ""They are stoking the grievance industry that they built.""

While authorities said an investigation was underway, the protest groups were quick to brand the killing a murder. A sentiment analysis of relevant social media posts by left-wing groups showed the graphic and emotional language used in the posts was designed to provoke moral outrage and mobilize people to take to the streets. For example, posts told people to ""get in the streets now,"" ""hit the streets"" and ""get to the White House ASAP.""

""EMERGENCY ALERT. THIS IS AN ALL HANDS ON DECK MOMENT!"" wrote 50551 on Instagram at 11:50 a.m.

The UNFCCC treaty forms the bedrock of international cooperation to deal with the climate crisis and has been agreed to by every country in the world since its inception 34 years ago.
“This is a shortsighted, embarrassing and foolish decision,” said Gina McCarthy, who was a top climate adviser to Joe Biden’s White House.
“As the only country in the world not a part of the UNFCCC treaty, the Trump administration is throwing away decades of US climate change leadership and global collaboration.
The climate crisis is, in fact, a matter of scientific consensus and is already taking a measurable and growing toll upon economies and people’s lives.","Donald Trump has sparked outrage by announcing the US will exit the foundational international agreement to address the climate crisis, cementing the US’s utter isolation from the global effort to confront dangerously escalating temperatures.

In a presidential memorandum issued on Wednesday, Trump withdrew from the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), along with 65 other organizations, agencies and commissions, calling them “contrary to the interests of the United States”.

The UNFCCC treaty forms the bedrock of international cooperation to deal with the climate crisis and has been agreed to by every country in the world since its inception 34 years ago. The US Senate ratified the treaty in October 1992.

Trump has, however, routinely ridiculed climate science as a “scam” and a “hoax” and has actively hobbled clean energy projects and other climate policies as president, attempting to force the US and other countries to stay wedded to the fossil fuels that are driving disastrous heatwaves, storms, droughts and conflicts that imperils billions of people around the world.

“This is a shortsighted, embarrassing and foolish decision,” said Gina McCarthy, who was a top climate adviser to Joe Biden’s White House.

“As the only country in the world not a part of the UNFCCC treaty, the Trump administration is throwing away decades of US climate change leadership and global collaboration. This administration is forfeiting our country’s ability to influence trillions of dollars in investments, policies and decisions that would have advanced our economy and protected us from costly disasters wreaking havoc on our country.”

Manish Bapna, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said Trump’s decision to exit the UNFCCC is an “unforced error” and “self-defeating” as it will further hamper the US’s ability to compete with China, which is increasingly dominant in the world’s burgeoning clean energy technology industries.

“While the Trump administration is abdicating the United States of America’s global leadership, the rest of the world is continuing to shift to cleaner power sources and take climate action,” Bapna said.

“The Trump administration is ceding the trillions of dollars in investment that the clean energy transition brings to nations willing to follow the science and embrace the cleanest, cheapest sources of energy.”

Underscoring the administration’s hostility to any measure to deal with a climate that is now hotter than at any point in human civilization, the White House memo also states that the US will pull out from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the UN’s top climate science body, as well as an assortment of other international environmental organizations, including the International Renewable Energy Association, the International Solar Alliance and the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Last year, Trump said the US would exit the Paris climate deal, in which countries agreed to limit dangerous global heating, while the administration also declined to send a delegation to UN climate talks in Brazil.

As the UNFCCC treaty was ratified by the Senate, it is unclear whether Trump can unilaterally scrap it, or whether a future president will be able to rejoin the framework without a further Senate vote. “Letting this lawless move stand could shut the US out of climate diplomacy forever,” said Jean Su, energy justice director at the Center for Biological Diversity.

Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, said in a statement that the agreements jettisoned by the administration on Wednesday are “often dominated by progressive ideology and detached from national interests”.

The climate crisis is, in fact, a matter of scientific consensus and is already taking a measurable and growing toll upon economies and people’s lives. In the US, record numbers of major extreme weather disasters are forcing insurers to flee states, undermining the country’s property market. Scientists have warned that global temperatures are set to breach previously agreed thresholds, which will trigger further worsened calamities.

“On the one-year anniversary of the wildfires that stole dozens of lives, thousands of homes and the sense of safety for millions as it reduced Los Angeles communities to ash, Trump is making it clear he has no interest in protecting Americans from the rapidly increasing impacts on our health and safety of the worsening climate crisis,” said Loren Blackford, executive director of the Sierra Club. “This is not leadership. It is cowardice.”

Al Gore, the former US vice-president and climate activist, told the Guardian: “The Trump Administration has been turning its back on the climate crisis since day one, removing the United States from the Paris Agreement, dismantling America’s scientific infrastructure, curbing access to greenhouse gas emissions data, and ending essential investments in the clean energy transition.”

“They’ve done this at the behest of the oil industry, so that billionaires can rake in even more money while polluting our planet and endangering people in America and around the world,” Gore said.

Other organizations and agencies that the US will quit include the Carbon Free Energy Compact, the United Nations University, the International Cotton Advisory Committee, the International Tropical Timber Organization, the Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation, the Pan-American Institute for Geography and History, the International Federation of Arts Councils and Culture Agencies and the International Lead and Zinc Study Group.

Tennessee and federal authorities have given conflicting narratives of what happened the morning of Jan. 7.

Before the shooting, the woman, who has not yet been identified, was reportedly observing immigration enforcement activities as agents surged into the city in what the federal government described as the ""largest immigration operation ever.""

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey disputed those claims at a news conference, saying videos show the woman driving away from federal agents, not toward them. Minneapolis authorities have said the woman was in her vehicle blocking the road when a federal officer approached her on foot. When she began to drive off, at least two shots were fired and the vehicle crashed on the side of the road.

U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, of Minnesota, described the woman as a ""legal observer,"" and U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn. said the woman was a U.S. citizen.

The Minneapolis City Council identified the 37-year-old woman shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer on Wednesday as Renee Nicole Good.

""Renee was a resident of our city who was out caring for her neighbors this morning and her life was taken today at the hands of the federal government,"" the city council said in a statement. NPR member station MPR News has reached out to a family member of the woman.

A post on an Instagram account that appears to belong to Good states she was a “poet and writer and wife and mom and s***** guitar strummer from Colorado; experiencing Minneapolis, MN,” according to the Minnesota Star Tribune.

The shooting occurred on a residential street in south Minneapolis — less than a mile from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020. ICE agents were conducting targeted immigration enforcement operations at the time, according to Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin.

“Renee was brutally killed in her vehicle by an ICE agent, leaving behind a child. Her killing is inexcusable and the direct result of an agency that, under Donald Trump, has become an unrestrained paramilitary force: increasingly aggressive, hostile, unaccountable and detached from basic standards of public safety,” Colorado Democratic Party Chair Shad Murib said in a statement. “No federal agency should be allowed to operate above the law, and no federal agent should be able to patrol our streets with masks and zero accountability for introducing violence and heartbreak to our neighborhoods.”

Federal and local officials dispute the circumstances that led to the shooting.

NPR has reviewed multiple videos of the shooting taken from different vantage points and posted to social media. The footage shows multiple officers near an SUV stopped in the middle of the road. One officer demands the driver exit the vehicle and grabs the car handle. The SUV reverses, then begins to drive forward, which is when a different officer near the front of the car pulls his weapon and fires into the vehicle. Three gunshots are heard as the firing officer backs away from the SUV. Moments later, the vehicle crashes.

The incident has further inflamed tensions between the Trump administration and Minneapolis, which has been the target of a large-scale immigration crackdown. Local officials said they expect protests to follow and urged residents to remain peaceful.

At a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he was prepared to mobilize the state National Guard if necessary.

""They want a show. We can't give it to them,"" he said. ""We can't give them what they want.""

Federal and local officials clash over the shooting

In a statement, DHS spokesperson McLaughlin asserted that the motorist ""weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them."" She added that the ICE officer who pulled the trigger was ""fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public.""

An eyewitness told MPR News that ICE agents gave conflicting orders to a driver in south Minneapolis on Wednesday, with one agent ordering her to drive away from the scene where an ICE vehicle was stuck in a snowbank while another yelled for her to get out of her car as he reached for the door handle.

The scene ended with an agent shooting into the car, killing the woman.

Caitlin Callenson said she was walking down Portland Avenue with her partner when she saw what she assumed were Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

“They tried to zoom their car out of the snowbank but were just stuck,” she said.

She said other ICE vehicles showed up, leading neighbors to believe it might be an ICE enforcement action. People showed up, and some began blowing whistles.

“People in our neighborhood have been terrorized by ICE for six weeks. We want our neighbors safe, and so when we see a group of ICE vehicles, people in the community are showing up and saying, ‘This is not OK,’” she said.

Upon reviewing a video of the incident, President Trump said he also believes the shooting was an act of self-defense.

""The woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

But local leaders have raised concerns about the Trump administration's account of the shooting.

At a fiery press conference, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey accused ICE of ""trying to spin this as an action of self-defense. Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody that is bull***. ""

""This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed,"" he added.

The mayor called on ICE agents to leave the city, asserting that federal immigration authorities were ripping families apart and sowing chaos on Minneapolis streets.

Gov. Walz wrote on X that he has seen video of the shooting and told the public: ""Don't believe this propaganda machine.""

""The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice,"" he added.

Minneapolis police chief says he's 'very concerned' about use of deadly force

At a press conference, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said local police arrived at the scene to find a woman with a gunshot wound to the head. They performed life-saving measures at the scene, including CPR. The woman was transported to Hennepin County Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead, he added.

Preliminary information, according to O'Hara, indicated that the woman was in her vehicle and blocking the road on Portland Avenue between 33rd and 34th St.

""At some point, a federal law enforcement approached her on foot, and the vehicle began to drive off. At least two shots were fired,"" he said, adding that the car then crashed on the side of the roadway.

O'Hara said he was ""very concerned"" with the tactics used by federal immigration agents. He noted that the use of deadly force is justified at times, but that most law enforcement agencies in the U.S. are trained to minimize the risks and the need for deadly force.

""In any professional law enforcement agency in the country, I think they would tell you it's obviously very concerning whenever there's a shooting into a vehicle of someone who's not armed,"" he said.

The shooting is being investigated by the FBI and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. They will investigate the use of deadly force.

Today’s fatal shooting of a 37-year-old woman by an ICE officer has increased tensions in Minneapolis after weeks of strain from immigration enforcement, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said.","A woman with blood covering her face sat in the yard of Minneapolis resident Tyrice Jones’ home following the fatal ICE shooting of a woman this morning, Jones said, and was heard shouting, “You guys just killed my wife!”

Jones, 35, was in an upstairs apartment when he heard gunshots and a crash, prompting him to come outside and see the SUV driven by Renee Nicole Good had smashed into a streetlight directly in front of his building, he said.

He told the woman to call “her people,” to which she replied, “We have nobody out here. We’re from out of town,” said Jones, who said no one offered the woman medical aid. The woman later gave her black lab to a bystander and people in a group chat were attempting to find her so they could return her dog, he added.

The resident of Portland Avenue then captured video showing the immediate aftermath of the ICE-involved shooting, including agents at the driver’s seat assessing the situation and bystanders berating the agents for shooting the driver.

Jones said agents took the woman driver’s body out of the crashed car and set her on the ground, after which he saw four or five people carry her body by the arms and legs to the end of the block and set her on the ground until an ambulance arrived.

The scene where Renee Nicole Good was shot by an ICE agent is “very calm” now, a stark contrast to the moments of anger directed at police officers earlier, CNN law enforcement correspondent Whitney Wild said.

“It is completely quiet because this is steps from where this woman lost her life,” said Wild, reporting on the ground, describing it as a “moment of real reverence.”

She pointed to a growing memorial site with hundreds of candles and bouquets of flowers dedicated to the 37-year-old woman.

“All these people here are taking a moment to look at this vigil, reflect on her life, reflect on what this moment means,” she said. “This is just so striking. This is right where she spent her last moments.”

It’s a departure from earlier when an angry crowd confronted Minneapolis police officers, yelling and throwing snowballs at them, she said.

“It was a really striking moment … because Minneapolis police were taking that heat from the public for something that they were not involved in. And yet the public felt like they were where they were going to direct their anger,” she said.

Out of an abundance of caution to quell any potential unruly crowds overnight, Minneapolis police have requested mutual aid resources from the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Department as well as state police to be available in the area, a law enforcement source tells CNN.

The Minneapolis Police Department has also canceled days off for officers and recalled all sworn law enforcement officers to be available for assignment if needed. The source noted there is no indication violence will occur, but law enforcement resources are being staged out of an abundance of caution.

Speaking with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins Wednesday night, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara confirmed his department will be at an elevated state of readiness throughout the night with additional resources on standby.

A witness to the fatal ICE shooting of a woman in a vehicle said she did not appear to be driving aggressively, calling the incident “an unnecessary use of force in a reaction to imagined danger.”

Trevor Heitkamp disputed the Department of Homeland Security’s claims the agent fired his weapon in self-defense, aligning with state and local officials. The Minneapolis resident was in front of his house when he started to hear the incident unfold down the street, prompting him to record a video.

As he got closer, Heitkamp said a red SUV was turned “mostly sideways in the road” to obstruct ICE agents, who shouted at the driver to move the car, he told CNN. “The car backed up slowly and proceeded to pull forward pretty slowly,” while witnesses shouted in protest, he said.

That vehicle then crashed into a nearby car when the ICE agent put his weapon back into its holster, Heitkamp said. The agents on scene were shouting, “No pulse!” when a man who identified himself as a physician told the officers to let him administer emergency medical care, he added.

The agents rejected his offers, telling the doctor to “back up,” Heitkamp said, at least two or three minutes before emergency medical services arrived on the scene.

Emily Heller was making breakfast in her Minneapolis home when she first noticed ICE agents quarrelling with protesters on her street.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were yelling at a woman driving an SUV, Heller told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Wednesday.

An ICE agent then tried to open her car door as another stood nearby. “She reversed a little bit,” Heller said, and then turned her wheels to begin pulling away.

“An ICE agent stepped in front of her vehicle and said, ‘Stop!’ and then — I mean, she was already moving — and then, point blank, shot her through her windshield in the face,” Heller said.

Heller, 39, said a neighbor who is a physician told agents he would like to administer CPR, but the agents didn’t allow him help, saying an emergency responder was en route.

“It was at least 15 minutes before the ambulance arrived,” Heller said.

Because the street was clogged with ICE vehicles, emergency crews were forced to abandon their ambulance and approach the victim on foot with no stretcher, Heller said.

“They were with her for a few minutes and then they carried her limp body away — by her limbs, not even on a stretcher,” Heller said.

“My life is forever changed from having witnessed this,” said Heller, who told CNN the narrative that the ICE agent acted in self defense is false.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended the agent’s actions, saying the woman had attempted to run the agent over in an act of “domestic terrorism.”

This morning, Ugene Bentley watched from his front window as a confrontation between ICE agents and a woman turned deadly, killing 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good.

Bentley said he saw an SUV blocking both lanes of traffic, and heard the driver blowing a whistle and yelling out an open window of her vehicle to let people know that ICE agents were nearby.

Bentley said an agent took a video of the front and rear of the car.

“I’m thinking at that time that they can follow up,” he said, noting that he assumed they recorded her license plate.

He said a truck then pulled up and more ICE agents got out, and as one tried to open an SUV door, another walked in front of the vehicle and fired the shots after Good pulled forward.

Bentley said he felt the lethal use of force was unwarranted.

“I’m not the judge on what’s legal and what’s not legal, but that right there was not called for,” he said.

People need to be paying attention to what’s happening in Minneapolis as the moment is testing “the endurance of our republic,” Mayor Jacob Frey told CNN’s Anderson Cooper.

“The notion that this is domestic terrorism on the form of the victim is positively ridiculous. The way that ICE is behaving is reckless,” he said, repeating a previous statement that both the characterization of the incident and ICE’s behavior is “bullshit.”

What is important now, Frey said, is for Minneapolis residents to stand up and peacefully protest.

“This federal government wants to have an excuse to militarize Minneapolis and bring additional occupation to our city,” he said. “We won’t let them. We are going to do the right thing, we are going to be filled with hope, we are going to get justice, and we are going to make sure that we are doing right, not just by Minneapolis, but we’re going to be an example for other cities throughout the country to follow.”

The woman who was fatally shot by an ICE agent today should be alive, Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan said.

“Renee Nicole Good should be alive,” she told CNN’s Erin Burnett. “She was killed by an ICE agent, and the video footage that we have seen with our own eyes was a very different story from what we’re hearing from Kristi Noem and Donald Trump.”

Good was a mother of a 6-year-old, and even had stuffed animals in her car at the time of the shooting that belonged to her child, Flanagan said.

“This is outrageous. And we all should be incredibly upset by what we witnessed today,” she said, adding that she is calling for justice and transparency in this investigation.

Today’s fatal shooting of a 37-year-old woman by an ICE officer has increased tensions in Minneapolis after weeks of strain from immigration enforcement, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said.

“I have been worried – not that federal law enforcement activity was happening, but how that enforcement was taking place in the city,” O’Hara told CNN’s Erin Burnett. “And I have specifically said I’ve been worried we would have a tragedy in our community.”

He noted that his department, and many police departments around the country, have been trained “with a very, very strong emphasis on de-escalation” to try and prevent officers or civilians from being injured.

O’Hara said he is not aware of the injured ICE officer’s identity. He said when he asked about any other injuries at today’s shooting scene, he was told “only the woman” was hurt, although it’s not immediately clear which agency he got that information from.

Footage of Wednesday’s shooting in Minneapolis appears to show the wheels of the vehicle driven by the victim were turned away from officers, according to CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller, despite early claims by federal officials that the victim had weaponized her SUV against ICE agents.

Many major cities’ police departments follow the doctrine that shooting at a moving vehicle is not tactically sound. A 2023 study by the Police Executive Research Forum, an influential law enforcement think tank, recommended agencies’ policies “should prohibit shooting at or from a moving vehicle,” unless the driver of the vehicle is using it as a “weapon of mass destruction” in a situation like a ramming attack or car bombing.

Still, whether federal officials will deem the shooting justified is a “challenging question,” Miller said, because it will likely turn on the officer’s mindset.

“You’re seeing the car move forward, you see your partner who may be dragged by the car, you’re seeing that the car may hit you,” he said. “And in that tunnel vision, sometimes you make decisions absent the big picture.”

“It still begs the tactical question – and this is not a new question – which is, if you’re facing a moving vehicle and it’s a threat to you because you’re in the way, get out of the way,” Miller said.

“That’s not a suggestion on my part,” he added. “That has been the policy adopted by the New York City Police Department when I was there, by the Los Angeles Police Department when I was there, by the FBI and federal agencies.”

The ICE agent who fatally shot a woman on Wednesday morning in Minneapolis “feared for his life and the other officers around him,” said Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

The incident unfolded at 10:25 a.m. CT as US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were conducting operations in the city, Noem said. One of their vehicles became “stuck and ensnared in the snow,” she said. As officers were attempting to push the vehicle out of the snow, Noem said a “mob of agitators that were harassing them all day” blocked them in and attempted to impede their efforts.

One of those vehicles, Noem said, was being driven by the victim, who the secretary accused of “stalking and impeding” officers’ work throughout the day. ICE agents ordered the woman to get out of the car, but she refused, Noem said, and then proceeded to “weaponize her vehicle” in an attempt to run over the officer.

That federal agent “used his training to save his own life and that of his colleagues,” Noem said, before he was treated and released from a local hospital.

State and local officials have disputed claims that the shooting was done in self-defense.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem disputed Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s claim that he does not know when there will be ICE operations in the state.

“That’s simply not true,” she said at a news conference today, responding to a question about Walz saying that he is not given prior notice to actions.

Noem said she would provide the governor with that information, adding that “we would love to coordinate with him.”

The secretary also accused Walz and local police of not cooperating with federal immigration efforts, adding that his administration does not give DHS “access to any information on criminals.”

She also claimed Walz has “individuals and criminals in his jurisdiction that he won’t turn over.”

Noem said she discussed the fatal shooting with Walz, but stressed they have “two very different viewpoints.”

Noem said she told Walz immigration laws need to be enforced, and she encouraged the governor “to work with us,” adding the federal agencies conducting immigration efforts in the state “have never had a cooperative arrangement” with the state or Minneapolis police officers under the discretion of Mayor Jacob Frey.

“If you talk to any of these federal law enforcement officers, they’ll say that when they call for backup in a situation that it’s hit and miss,” said Noem. She continued to say the officers were “grateful” for the city’s police chief and local officers helping to secure the scene today after the fatal shooting to ensure “nobody was harmed and that the FBI could do their work.”

Throngs of Minnesota residents and activists are holding a vigil around a makeshift shrine of flowers and candles on a patch of snow near where 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good was fatally shot by an ICE officer hours earlier.

“Say it once. Say it twice. We will not put up with ICE,” they chanted. Some carried signs with messages such as “Killer ICE off our streets.”

Speakers said the actions of the federal officers are unacceptable and a direct result of a what they called militarized state with no accountability. They called for charges against the ICE officer who fatally shot the woman in her vehicle, noting that she had been there to observe the actions of federal officers.

“We are not afraid of Donald Trump and we are not afraid to say f— ICE,” one speaker said.

At one point, they chanted the name of victim.

Yards from the scene of today’s shooting – and just blocks from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020 – residents filled the streets during a peaceful yet loud candlelight vigil, paying their respects and leaving flowers on a still-bloodied patch of snow where Good died.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/10408395221424057092368003293201021-00000005.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-07 21:57:38.980289

“For months, I – along with many of my fellow elected officials, law enforcement agencies and community members – have warned of the dangers of the Trump Administration’s chaotic, reckless and unnecessary ICE operations in our cities.

Today, our worst fears became reality when an ICE agent shot and killed a woman in South Minneapolis. This is beyond unacceptable. It’s unconscionable and sickening.

President Trump and his Administration will try to justify their meddling in Minnesota – they will continue to lie and say it’s about keeping folks safe – but Minnesotans know this isn’t true. It’s a flat-out lie. Today, the President’s political stunt got a woman killed.

Trump’s actions have never been about keeping people safe. They have never been about catching criminals. They have always been about weaponizing our immigration system and using immigrant communities as political pawns.

President Trump, Secretary Noem, hear me loud and clear: ICE must leave Minnesota – NOW.

We are a nation of immigrants. Immigrants are essential members of our communities. Immigrants make up the fabric of our state – and they make us stronger.

To my fellow Minnesotans, stay peaceful. Take care of one another and know that I am fighting this reckless Administration at every turn. We won’t back down.”

The shooting happened, according to Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin, when “violent rioters” tried to get involved in a Minneapolis ICE operation.
In recent weeks, the Trump administration has targeted Minnesota over a fraud scandal in the state.
Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, who is from Minnesota, also went after the Trump administration for its characterization of the incident.

“My office is monitoring reports of an ICE-involved shooting in Minneapolis today. Reports are still coming in, but [it] has been reported that a woman was killed. My heart goes out to her and her family. And anyone hurt or killed in this act of violence,” Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison (D) wrote Wednesday in a post on the social platform X.

The shooting happened, according to Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin, when “violent rioters” tried to get involved in a Minneapolis ICE operation.

“While there’s a lot we don’t know at this time, let me be clear about one thing: Donald Trump’s decision to send thousands of armed ICE agents to Minnesota is causing serious harm and spreading terror throughout our communities. His reckless decision to escalate the aggression and number of immigration agents is a causal factor,” Ellison said.

President Trump, in a post to Truth Social on Wednesday afternoon, said he had “just viewed the clip of the event which took place in Minneapolis, Minnesota.”

“It is a horrible thing to watch. The woman screaming was, obviously, a professional agitator, and the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense,” he added.

Rep. Yassamin Ansari (D-Ariz.), in a post on X, put the blame on federal authorities for the woman’s death.

“ICE just killed a U.S. citizen—allegedly blocking her from medical care and letting her die,” the Arizona Democrat said. “This is horrifying. ICE is a rogue agency incapable of reform. Minneapolis Mayor Frey is calling for ICE to vacate the city and I echo that call.”

Democratic Mayor Jacob Frey used explicit language while arguing that the Trump administration’s framing of the events of the shooting were wrong. The mayor also said he had viewed a video of the incident.

In recent weeks, the Trump administration has targeted Minnesota over a fraud scandal in the state. Federal authorities this week launched an expansive immigration operation there in the wake of right-wing ire zeroing in on the Midwestern state.

Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, who is from Minnesota, also went after the Trump administration for its characterization of the incident.

“A woman in Minnesota was shot and killed by ICE today. We all saw the video, and the Trump administration is lying about it,” Martin said on X.

“The federal government under Donald Trump’s command is not protecting the peace. Trump has provoked chaos and violence in our towns and cities as part of his sick political theater. ICE has to leave Minnesota now,” he added.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) said in an X post that “this is not the first time Trump’s ICE has shot at civilians.”

“We need ICE out of our cities and communities,” the Evergreen State Democrat added.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/AP26007639250904-e1767817956215.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-07 22:57:00.442012

That group had become a particular focus for Mr. Trump, who has railed against a federal fraud scheme that has implicated a pocket of Somali Americans in Minnesota.

Federal authorities said this week they would increase their presence in the Minneapolis region, with about 2,000 federal agents from the Department of Homeland Security expected to participate.

“If you’re a criminal illegal alien and/or you are engaged in fraud, expect a visit from ICE,” the agency said Tuesday in a post on X.

The original immigration enforcement operation, which began in early December, focused on Somalis with final deportation orders. That group had become a particular focus for Mr. Trump, who has railed against a federal fraud scheme that has implicated a pocket of Somali Americans in Minnesota.

More than 90 people have been charged with felonies in the federal fraud cases, which center on what prosecutors say was a misuse of funds allocated for the state’s social safety net programs. Dozens have been convicted. Most of the people prosecuted are of Somali origin. They have been accused of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars by billing the government for services, like child care and health care, that went undelivered.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/07/multimedia/07minn-shooting-feds-justification1-phmq/07minn-shooting-feds-justification1-phmq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 19:58:02.824763

In response to the claims DOL and WSP are violating the Keep Washington Working Act, they denied they were.","SEATTLE — Luis remembers the morning clearly.

It was just after 6:30 a.m. when his father left their home in Renton and was near The Landing, heading to work. Minutes later, immigration agents surrounded the car.

“He pulls over, rolls the window down, and they put their arms in there, reach out, open the door and take his keys and take him in and put him in one of the SUV vans,” Luis said.

Since that day, he and his sister, Izzy, have kept asking the same question:

How did immigration agents know who their father was, and where he’d be?

“It doesn't seem like a regular pull over,” Luis said. “Because they did say his name… seems more of a — they were watching routine.”

A new report from the University of Washington Center for Human Rights says it now has the answer.

A new pathway into Washington driver data

The report traces how immigration agents located Nelson Eduardo Picazo Sanchez, and links his case to a broader pattern.

Last July, KING 5 Investigators revealed that the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) had been sharing driver information with immigration enforcement, in violation of state law. The Keep Washington Working Act prohibits state agencies from assisting federal immigration enforcement efforts. After public backlash, state leaders said they shut down that access to ICE.

But researchers say federal immigration authorities continued getting Washington driver data through a different channel.

“Personally, I think that's very disappointing,” said Angelina Godoy, director of the UW Center for Human Rights and primary author of the report. “This isn’t the first time, not the second time, not even the third time that they’ve been caught not doing what they said.”

According to the report, agents used a Washington State Patrol system called ACCESS — a messaging “switchboard” that connects to a national law-enforcement network known as Nlets.

Through ACCESS and Nlets, officers can enter a license plate number and receive driver and vehicle information from DOL within seconds.

License plates, profiling concerns, and fast arrests

Godoy said the center reviewed multiple cases where agents appeared to stake out locations, run plates, and then make arrests shortly afterward.

“A significant percentage of the arrests we corroborated happened near places like Home Depot, Lowe’s, or Latino markets,” Godoy said. “It enables racial profiling when you go where you think a certain ethnicity congregates and then run the plates of everyone you see.”

In Sanchez’s case, Godoy said Washington State Patrol records show Customs and Border Protection (CBP) requested information tied to his license plate through ACCESS. DOL then sent back data associated with the vehicle and driver.

Sanchez was arrested on Nov. 4.

UW researchers identified at least seven other cases where immigration arrests happened after agents used ACCESS, sometimes within minutes of the search.

“In many of these cases, they run the name in Nlets or their own databases, see an immigration record and then they pull the person over,” Godoy said.

State law says agencies should not help enforce civil immigration cases

Washington’s Keep Washington Working Act bars state agencies from using their resources to help enforce civil immigration law.

The report argues that, in practice, that’s still happening when immigration agents use ACCESS to obtain driver data tied to Washington residents.

After the report's draft release, Godoy said her team reached out to the Washington State Patrol. When the state patrol found out the data was getting accessed through their system, they said they cut it off to ICE mid-November.

But experts at the UW say there are ways around that—there's other federal agencies like border patrol that could still be using this to track people down.

“If they're working shoulder to shoulder with CBP, and one agency loses access while the one next to them still has it, it doesn't do anything to stop the operation,” she said.

For one family, the findings feel personal

For Luis and Izzy, the policy debate isn’t abstract.

Their father was simply on his way to work. Somewhere, they believe, someone ran his license plate and agents already knew his name before he rolled down the window.

“It wasn’t me finding that out — it was little me,” Izzy said, fighting back tears as she recalled the day of her father's arrest. “I’ve always been a daddy’s girl. It felt like me as a little girl, getting my dad ripped away from me.”

DOL and WSP respond

State officials say the University of Washington’s findings leave out key context. In a joint statement issued Wednesday afternoon, the Department of Licensing and Washington State Patrol argued Washington has already taken aggressive steps to block immigration agencies from driver data, and disputed suggestions the state is violating the Keep Washington Working Act. T

hey say ICE’s access was shut off in November and that the systems involved are also used for legitimate criminal investigations.

“Since shutting off ICE access … thousands of attempted queries from ICE have been denied,"" the joint statement added in part.

In response to the claims DOL and WSP are violating the Keep Washington Working Act, they denied they were.

“The Keep Washington Working Act does not prohibit information-sharing for criminal law-enforcement purposes,” the statement reads.

As for not shutting off CBP's access to ACCESS/Nlets, state officials said, ""Washington state is taking a close look at all our options to protect our residents. This is an ongoing effort. We are reviewing CBP’s use of Nlets, what actions other states have taken, and are looking at all options to protect Washingtonians while also protecting public safety.""

In the last four months alone, immigration officers have fired on at least nine people in five states and Washington, D.C. All of the individuals targeted in those shootings were, like the woman killed on Wednesday, fired on while in their vehicles. In each case, officials have claimed that the agents fired in self-defense, fearing they would be struck by the vehicle.

At least one other person died as a result of those shootings.

In September, immigration officers pulled over a man driving a Subaru on a busy street outside of Chicago. The man, a Mexican immigrant named Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, was shot and killed less than a minute later. Homeland security officials said that Mr. Villegas-Gonzalez had hit and dragged one of the officers with his car and that the officer who shot him was acting in self-defense. But a Times analysis of video calls into question key aspects of the government’s account.

The following month, a Mexican man living in Los Angeles was shot during a traffic stop where the man was targeted for immigration enforcement. Federal officials said the man, Carlitos Ricardo Parias, had tried to ram officers as he fled the scene, and homeland security officers fired shots, hitting the man in the elbow. A federal marshal was struck in the hand by a ricocheted bullet.

Days later, an American citizen was shot in the shoulder by an immigration agent near a bus stop in a suburb east of Los Angeles. Lawyers for the man, Carlos Jimenez, said he had asked federal agents to move away from the area, where schoolchildren would soon be gathering. Mr. Jimenez’s lawyers said he was later shot as he was driving away. But federal prosecutors accused him of pulling forward and accelerating toward an officer.

Since last January, federal immigration agents have deployed across the country as part of President Trump’s deportation blitz, often in fast-moving enforcement operations targeting individual cities including Los Angeles, Chicago, New Orleans and Portland. Those sweeps have spurred protests that at times turned hostile, with protesters throwing objects at law enforcement and officers responding by firing non-lethal munitions.

In the 12 months through September 2024, ICE’s internal firearms and use of force committee investigated three incidents in which an officer used a firearm, according to ICE’s annual report, and in the year before that, there were five incidents in which an ICE officer used a firearm. It was not known on Wednesday what those investigations concluded.

ICE and the Homeland Security Department’s policy on the use of force says that officers are authorized to use deadly force only if the officer “has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.” The policy further states that officers should “avoid intentionally and unreasonably placing themselves in positions in which they have no alternative to using deadly force.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/07/multimedia/07minn-shooting-ice-elsewhere-top-khlq/07minn-shooting-ice-elsewhere-top-khlq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 21:57:53.889166

The woman was shot during a traffic stop in a residential neighborhood south of downtown Minneapolis, just a few blocks from some of the oldest immigrant markets and about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020. Her killing quickly drew a crowd of hundreds of angry protesters.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said at a news conference in Minneapolis Wednesday evening that any death is a ""tragedy,"" but that the ICE shooting was justified.

""Our officer followed his training, did exactly what he's been taught to do in that situation,"" Noem said.

Noem alleged that the woman who was killed was trying to block officers with her vehicle, had been harassing them through the day and ""attempted to run a law enforcement officer over"" before she was shot.

""We'll let the FBI continue the investigation to get it resolved,"" she said, adding that the officer was hit by the vehicle, taken to a hospital and released.

Noem added that immigration enforcement has made over 1,500 arrests in Minnesota in recent weeks.

Earlier Wednesday while visiting Texas, Noem described the incident as an ""act of domestic terrorism"" carried out against ICE officers.

But Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey blasted that characterization as ""garbage"" and criticized the federal deployment of more than 2,000 officers to the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul as part of the immigration crackdown.

""They are not here to cause safety in this city. What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,"" Frey said.

Minneapolis Police chief gives no indication that the driver was trying to harm anyone

Chief Brian O'Hara briefly described the shooting to reporters. Unlike federal officials, O'Hara didn't say the driver was trying to harm anyone. He said she had been shot in the head.

""This woman was in her vehicle and was blocking the roadway on Portland Avenue. ... At some point a federal law enforcement officer approached her on foot and the vehicle began to drive off,"" the chief said.

""At least two shots were fired. The vehicle then crashed on the side of the roadway.""

Minnesota official says state will investigate the shooting with federal authorities

That's according to Commissioner Bob Jacobson of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety.

""Keep in mind that this is an investigation that is also in its infancy. So any speculation about what has happened would be just that,"" Jacobson told reporters.

The shooting happened in the district of Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, who called it ""state violence,"" not law enforcement.

City says 37-year-old shooting victim died at hospital

In a statement, the city of Minneapolis says police officers ""responded to the reports of shots fired and found a woman with life-threatening gunshot wounds to the head.

""Minneapolis firefighters then removed the 37-year-old victim from the vehicle and immediately began lifesaving measures until paramedics could respond.

During a news conference today, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara urged citizens to exercise their First Amendment rights safely and peacefully.
McLaughlin said in a statement that ICE agents were conducting targeted operations in the city when the 37-year-old woman was shot.","Minneapolis Mayor Frey tonight doubled down on his rejection of federal officials' characterization of today's fatal shooting as an act of self-defense.

“Of course I stand by what I said,” he told Tom Llamas on ""Top Story."" ""Look, I’ve got two eyes. All of you do, too. You can see for yourself what happened was reckless, and, by the way, entirely predictably because we have been saying, the chief and I vocally for over a month, that somebody was going to get hurt or killed.""

“By the way, this is not like the first instance of horrific treatment. They were dragging a pregnant woman through the snow; we’ve seen them indiscriminately pulling Latino and Somali people off the street. That is not the way we behave in America,” he said about immigration officials' actions.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has stated that the ICE agent opened fire in self-defense.

Frey said the victim was “clearly trying to leave the situation and get out of there.” He said his office has not yet spoken with the family of the victim.

He called for the shooting to be thoroughly investigated. The state has said the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension will investigate.

“Get ICE out of this city,” Frey reiterated. “Right now crime is dropping in virtually every category, in virtually every neighborhood. That is important work. But what is clear is that the actions that ICE is taking is not about keeping people safe. It’s about terrorizing communities, it’s about ripping families apart, it’s about eating away at the very fabric that makes Minneapolis, Minneapolis, and America, America.""

Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minnesota, today criticized DHS Secretary Kristi Noem’s use of the term “domestic terrorism” to describe a woman who was shot by an ICE agent while in her vehicle today.

Smith called Noem’s description “reckless” and said it came while the incident is still under investigation, including by the FBI.

“Domestic terrorism was the Oklahoma City bombing,” Smith said. “This was a woman in her car in a neighborhood that is only a few miles from where I live. I know it quite well.”

The shooting was captured on video by a bystander.

“When you have an event like this, you have a killing like this, there is an investigation — you bring in people who know how to do investigations to understand exactly what happened,” Smith said.

“And yet the president of the United States and the secretary have been just pronouncing what they think happened,” Smith said. “I can see with my own eyes what millions of people have now seen in this video.”

She said it is hard to see in this video, any evidence that this woman rammed ICE agents.

At a news conference tonight, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem provided an account of the moments before shots rang out in Minneapolis.

She said ICE was carrying out operations in Minnesota at 10:25 a.m. CT today and attempting to push out of the snow one of its vehicles that had become stuck. At that time, “a mob of agitators that were harassing them all day began blocking them in, shouting at them, and impeding law enforcement operations,” Noem said.

ICE officers approached the driver of a vehicle that was “blocking the officers in,” she said. According to Noem, the woman “had been stalking and impeding their work all throughout the day.”

ICE agents ordered her to exit the vehicle, but she did not comply, Noem said.

“She then proceeded to weaponize her vehicle, and she attempted to run a law enforcement officer over. This appears as an attempt to kill or to cause bodily harm to agents, an act of domestic terrorism,” Noem said. “The ICE officer, fearing for his life and the other officers around him and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots. He used his training to save his own life and that of his colleagues.""

Witnesses at the scene have told NBC News that the woman did not appear to try to run over the ICE agent. Rather, they said, it seemed she was trying to drive away from them.

Noem said the ICE agent involved in today's shooting was ""hit by the vehicle"" the victim was driving.

""She hit him. He went to the hospital. A doctor did treat him. He has been released, but he’s going to spend some time with his family,"" Noem said.

She said the officer, whom officials have not yet identified, had been attacked before while on the job.

""In fact, the very same officer who was attacked today had previously been dragged by an anti-ICE rioter who had rammed him with a car and dragged him back in June. He sustained injuries at that time as well,"" she said.

A crowd has gathered in Minneapolis for a vigil following today’s fatal shooting of a woman by an ICE agent in an incident that has sparked outrage and condemnation among local officials and residents.

In a notice about the event, organizers said, “We witnessed an atrocious attack on our community today.”

Some held signs, including one that read “ICE out of Minnesota.”

Dieu Do, an immigrant rights activist, told NBC affiliate KARE of Minneapolis that “it could have been any of us.”

She disputed the characterization by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem that the person who was shot was engaging in an “act of domestic terrorism” and driving toward ICE.

“Domestic terrorism is what ICE is doing — using unmarked vehicles, unmarked clothing, coming in and taking our community members without any paperwork,” Do said.

Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., today said she wants ICE out of the state.

“I think ICE should leave,” Smith said. “The longer that they are in Minnesota, the less safe people are. And I think we could see today the implication of that, this senseless killing of this woman who was in her car.”

Smith also got emotional when asked why she thought the Trump administration is fixated on Minnesota.

“I wish I knew,” Smith said. “I mean, I wish they would just leave us the f--- alone. I mean, seriously.”

“When did things stop being about politics and and start being about actual human decency?” she said.

“We can all hypothesize on what all of their political reasons are,” Smith said. “But meanwhile, a woman died being shot in her car — and everything that they are doing is making it worse and not better.”

Emily Heller, 39, wasn't even dressed when she heard whistles alerting the neighborhood that ICE agents were in the area this morning.

“I’ve never seen someone die in front of my house before. This was horrendous,” Heller told NBC News.

Heller said she's never been involved in activities to warn or protest the federal immigration agency, but when she walked out to her porch she said she saw six or seven ICE vehicles and a protester who had parked perpendicular to traffic.

Heller said she saw agents exit their cars and tell the driver to leave, to ""get out of here.""

“And then they went up to her car and started trying to open her door, and that’s when I’m sure she got spooked and tried to flee,"" Heller said. ""So she reversed a little bit and then angled her wheels so she could drive away. And as she was trying to move forward, one of the ICE agents stepped in front of her vehicle and reached across the hood and fired his weapon about three or four times and shot her in the face.""

The driver crashed into a post and hit some cars and “just slumped over in her vehicle,"" Heller said. She shared graphic video that shows the woman covered in blood in the driver's seat. A man with raised arms who identified himself as a physician asked ICE agents if he could check the woman's pulse but was denied, according to both Heller's account and the video.

Heller said the agents wouldn't let anyone near the scene and told people that emergency services were on the way. In the video, one agent can be heard saying, ""We have our own medics.""

It took about 15 minutes for EMS to arrive, Heller estimated, because vehicles were blocking the street.

“They were on foot when they got through, and they carried her body out, just like by her limbs, they didn’t even have a stretcher,"" Heller said. ""She was carried out like a sack of potatoes.""

“I’ve never seen anything like this before. This was horrific and will change my life forever,” she said. “It’s just so terrifying. I feel so scared.""

She said she felt as if the ICE agents were untrained, inexperienced and didn’t know what they were doing. Heller said the driver was being told to leave but also being instructed to stop at the same time, then the man ""just fired"" his gun.

""They’re just out of their league, and they didn’t know how to handle the situation,"" Heller said. ""They couldn’t let somebody give life support. It was just total chaos.”

She said at times she was frightened watching the agents, some of whom were touching their guns. Heller thought in that moment, ""oh ... I could die,"" she said.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz repeatedly implored residents to remain calm and not “take the bait” from the Trump administration in the wake of the fatal ICE shooting in Minneapolis.

His words during a news conference echoed those of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who last year warned his owned residents not to allow protests to turn violent. At the time, Pritzker argued Trump officials were looking for a pretext to militarize their cities.

Walz gave the same warning, noting that there could be far-reaching consequences.

""To Minnesotans, don’t take the bait. Do not take the bait. Do not allow them to deploy federal troops into here. Do not allow them to invoke the insurrection act. Do not allow them to declare martial law,"" Walz said. ""Do not allow them to lie about the security and the decency of this state. And let’s let this investigation play out.”

President Donald Trump defended the actions of the ICE officer involved in the fatal shooting.

The president said in a post on Truth Social that he viewed a clip of the incident, calling it ""a horrible thing to watch.""

""The woman screaming was, obviously, a professional agitator, and the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense,"" he wrote. ""Based on the attached clip, it is hard to believe he is alive, but is now but is now recovering in the hospital.""

Trump said that law enforcement officers and ICE agents are regularly threatened.

""They are just trying to do the job of MAKING AMERICA SAFE.""

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn, expressed concern that the statements made by Homeland Security officials do ""not appear to reflect video evidence and on-the-ground accounts.""

The fourth-term Minnesota senator expressed condolences for the family of the woman who was killed today before criticizing the role of ICE agents in the state. She called for full transparency and an investigation into the shooting.

""While our immigration enforcement should be focused on apprehending and prosecuting violent criminals to make our communities safer, these ICE actions are doing the opposite and making our state less safe,"" Klobuchar said.

Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., called the actions of the federal agents ""unconscionable and reprehensible"" in her own statement this afternoon. She described the woman who was killed as a ""legal observer"" and characterized the events as ""state violence.""

“This administration has shown, yet again, that it does not care about the safety of Minnesotans,"" Omar said. ""Instead of protecting our communities, they are unleashing violence — terrorizing neighborhoods and now killing a civilian.""

Aidan Perzana, 31, said he was just waking up when he heard the honking and other activity outside his home, which faces the street where the shooting took place, and went to the window.

He said he saw a Honda askew between the curbside and the bike lane, its front end poking into the bike lane. He said there were two men in full fatigues, wearing garments that said ""police,"" but no other identification.

""One was right by the passenger door and one by the driver’s side. There was clearly commotion. I couldn’t hear what anybody was saying,"" Perzana said. ""Then a third person approached the vehicle from the driver's side and started pulling quite hard on the door handle two or three times, at which the vehicle reversed a few feet and then started going forward.""

Perzana said that he heard Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's allegation that the woman was trying to run down an officer. He said it looked like the driver was trying to flee.

""When she started driving forward, there were, I think, three shots from the person who was originally by the driver’s side door, not the person who had been pulling on the handle,"" he said.

He added that ""there was plenty of space between the officers at that point for the vehicle to make it through.""

Perzana said an ambulance arrived around 10 minutes later, but could not reach the vehicle because of ICE vehicles in the street.

""There were probably six or seven, sort of parked all askew...blocking traffic,"" he said. ""They didn’t not, you know, clear the way for the ambulance so, some people approached on foot.""

Aidan’s wife, Grace Perzana, 32, said the family has lived in the neighborhood for more than two years and ""love it."" She did not believe there were many people of Somali descent on her street, but said she does have many ""Latinx"" neighbors.

""We are really happy here,"" she said. ""We have a giant shark statue in our front yard and our neighbor has a giant T-Rex statue. There is a lot of community art, a lot of people having barbecues with music in their backyards. ""

Today's shooting is not Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey's first experience leading the city through an officer-involved shooting under public scrutiny.

Frey came to the national spotlight in 2020 when George Floyd was murdered by former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. Floyd's death was initially described as a medical emergency, but bystander video showed Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck while the man gasped, saying he could not breathe.

The case sparked renewed anger over police brutality and a racial reckoning that swept the U.S., sparking protests in the Twin Cities that eventually ignited across the country. Protests in Minneapolis at the time were fraught with physical violence between residents and police.

During a news conference today, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara urged citizens to exercise their First Amendment rights safely and peacefully.

Since arriving in Minneapolis in early December, ICE officers and agents have arrested roughly 1,400 people, Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin previously said.

That is a significant increase from the roughly 300 arrests by Dec. 12, making it a much larger operation than some Border Patrol surge operations in cities such as Charlotte, North Carolina and New Orleans.

McLaughlin also said Border Patrol agents just arrived in Minneapolis and will begin operations there today.

This week, DHS sent hundreds more officers and agents to bolster immigration enforcement in Minneapolis, posting on social media that it is waging “the largest DHS operation ever” in Minnesota.

Residents and locals gathered in the street after the ICE shooting in Minneapolis, chanting and throwing snowballs in the direction of federal agents, KARE reported. Law enforcement deployed pepper spray and tear gas.

Brandon Hewitt, who is new to the neighborhood, said he was getting up around 8:30 a.m. when he heard three gunshots. He then looked outside and said he saw that a vehicle had crashed.

“I’m pretty right-leaning, but seeing this, this is not what you need to do,” he told KARE. “It’s not how to do it. It’s not how we’re supposed to do things around here in America.”

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called for ICE to leave the city.

“What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust. They are ripping families apart, sowing chaos in the streets and, in this case, quite literally killing people,” he said at a news conference after the shooting. “This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.”

Frey said that there was little he could say to improve the situation, but he had a message for federal immigration agents in the city.

“To ICE, get the f--- out of Minneapolis,” the mayor said. “We do not want you here. Your stated reason for being in this city is to create some sort of safety, and you are doing the opposite.”

An Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis today after a group of people began blocking agents during an immigration-related operation, the Department of Homeland Security said.

Video footage from NBC affiliate KARE 11 of Minneapolis showed a burgundy SUV with what appeared to be a bullet hole in the windshield. The vehicle had crashed into a light pole. It’s not clear to whom the SUV belongs or from where the bullet was shot.

Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin accused the woman who was killed of weaponizing her vehicle, ""attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them."" McLaughlin said in a statement that ICE agents were conducting targeted operations in the city when the 37-year-old woman was shot.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260107-3x2-minnesota-shooting-scene-vl-211p-6a7722.jpg",N,,2026-01-07 19:58:12.196444

Former San Francisco Judge Dana Leigh Marks said the move to shutter the largest of three immigration courts serving Northern California feels like a step toward dismantling the path to asylum entirely.
The San Francisco court, which is the largest of three that hear cases from the Central Valley to the Oregon border, has a backlog of 120,000 cases.
“For a long time, it has been seen as a thorn in the side of more restrictive immigration policies,” Marks said.
“The only rationale I can find to justify closing the San Francisco court instead of relocating it in the close area … is that it’s an effective way to close down a more liberal court.” KQED’s Tyche Hendricks contributed to this report.","San Francisco’s main immigration court is set to close by the end of the year, driving former judges and advocates to worry that it’s part of an effort by the Trump administration to drastically remake and shrink the overburdened immigration system in the Bay Area and beyond.

Former judges told KQED that staffers were informed Tuesday that the court would not renew its lease at 100 Montgomery St., where the majority of the Bay Area’s asylum cases are heard.

The court, which began 2025 with 21 judges, now has just four remaining after 13 were fired and four more retired at the end of the year, which some attorneys told KQED they were pressured into. Nationwide, more than 100 immigration judges have been fired since last January.

Former San Francisco Judge Dana Leigh Marks said the move to shutter the largest of three immigration courts serving Northern California feels like a step toward dismantling the path to asylum entirely.

“The system is bleeding from 1,000 small cuts,” she said. “It seems to me like what the current administration is trying to do is maximize the dysfunction in order to allow a change in the law by Congress. To eventually eliminate the system and eliminate the due process that immigrants get.”

Marks said she’s heard from current immigration attorneys that when the judge presiding over their client’s cases has been fired, their court dates have been removed from the docket and pushed back by up to three or four years.

Former Judge Arwen Swink, who was fired from San Francisco’s bench last month, told KQED that current staffers got an email confirming that the Montgomery Street court would shutter by January 2027, when the court’s current lease ends. She and three other former judges, who spoke with KQED on the condition of anonymity to protect their sources from retaliation, said the court is aiming to end operations at the site as soon as the summer and plans to consolidate remaining staff in the Bay Area’s other immigration courthouse in Concord.

The Rev. Leah Martens, who has been attending vigils outside the nearby Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in recent months as part of the Interfaith Movement for Human Integrity, said the news on Tuesday felt like “a gut punch.”

“It feels like this administration is continuing to make moves that make it harder for people to find legal pathways to be secure,” she told KQED. “It feels like that’s not the goal anymore.”

Martens said the immigration system is already backlogged, and she worries that shutting down the city’s main court will only further slow immigrants’ cases.

The San Francisco court, which is the largest of three that hear cases from the Central Valley to the Oregon border, has a backlog of 120,000 cases.

Another in Concord, which opened in 2024 and was expected to grow to a similar size, has just seven judges. Sacramento’s smaller court shrunk from six to three judges last year. The two locations are responsible for around 90,000 more cases.

On Wednesday morning, the line of people waiting for check-in appointments outside the ICE field office on Sansome Street, about half a mile from the court, extended down the block and around the corner. Martens said some of the people standing outside the federal building, holding folders of legal paperwork and bundled against the early morning cold, had also been lined up Monday or Tuesday but hadn’t made it through the long, slow-moving queue.

The Rev. Deborah Lee, who heads the Interfaith Movement for Human Integrity, said she sees the closure of San Francisco’s court as part of a series of moves by the Trump administration to dismantle the immigration judicial system.

Last spring, ICE officers began arresting immigrants outside courtrooms where they had mandatory hearings, a tactic that was previously unprecedented. DOJ attorneys would move to have asylum-seekers’ cases dismissed, while officers waited in courtroom hallways to take them into detention if they were. The DOJ used similar tactics to detain immigrants who reported to ICE check-in appointments like those held at 630 Sansome St.

If asylum-seekers fail to appear for a mandatory hearing or appointment, their case can be dropped altogether.

Marks said prosecutors have also increasingly moved to deny cases before immigrants have a hearing and offer asylum cooperation agreements, under which people can go to a country other than their home country if they agree to leave the U.S., without taking the necessary legal steps.

“What this current administration has been doing is almost like a smash-and-grab robbery. They’re not following any of the established rules … providing flimsy and transparent justifications, or just disregarding the rules,” Marks said. “Some might not hold up with litigation, but they aren’t waiting.”

Milli Atkinson, who directs the Immigrant Legal Defense Program at the Bar Association of San Francisco, said it is possible that the DOJ could shift some hearings in the city to three courtrooms in the Sansome Street building, which is federally owned and not expected to close. But no judges are located at the site, and the communication sent to Montgomery Street staff suggests that operations will be consolidated to Concord.

“Logistically, it’s just going to be a nightmare,” she said. “It is going to be chaotic for several months, where people are not going to know if they have a hearing scheduled, where the hearing is scheduled, who their judge is, if their case is going to be moved.”

Amanda Maya, the asylum program director at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights, said the move also backpedals on the goal of opening Concord’s court: easing access for immigrants in the East Bay and Central Valley.

“It was an incredible development for people who were already in the East Bay and were having to travel to San Francisco, where it didn’t make sense, or people in the Central Valley who unfortunately don’t have an immigration courthouse,” Maya said. “But now we’ve created the problem that existed, but for people on the Peninsula or people who live in the South Bay.”

Maya also said that many of the Bay Area’s legal resource centers and nonprofits are based in San Francisco because of its proximity to the court. Programs like the Bar Association of San Francisco’s Federal Pro Bono Project, through which immigrants can get legal advice from attorneys, have spent years building relationships with the city’s judges and court staff.

Marks said it’s not unheard of for the immigration court to move to a new location when its lease expires, but she said eliminating what has been perceived as one of the most liberal courts nationwide feels calculated.

“For a long time, it has been seen as a thorn in the side of more restrictive immigration policies,” Marks said. “The only rationale I can find to justify closing the San Francisco court instead of relocating it in the close area … is that it’s an effective way to close down a more liberal court.”

The City’s law enforcement partners at the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department West Hollywood Station have confirmed that Deputies responded midday to that block following resident reports of men in two large SUVs having detained an individual from a small pickup truck, which was then left unattended. Deputies remained with the vehicle until a family member responded and took possession of the vehicle.

According to the West Hollywood Station, there is no confirmation from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that it conducted the detention.

Mr. Mamdani’s pick to lead the city’s Commission on Human Rights, Christine Clarke, is another step toward filling out his new administration. The commission investigates complaints of unlawful incidents of discrimination and educates the public about the nuances of New York’s human rights law.

The appointment of Ms. Clarke, the chief of litigation and advocacy at Legal Services NYC, a nonprofit organization that provides free legal assistance to low-income New Yorkers, also gave Mr. Mamdani the opportunity to lean into the issue of income inequality that was central to his campaign for mayor.

“For nearly 82 years, no matter its name, the City Commission on Human Rights has done the vital work of protecting human rights in our city, of delivering justice,” Mr. Mamdani said, speaking from an area in Jackson Heights, Queens, that is known as Diversity Plaza because of the vast range of countries represented by its stores and vendors. “That work has never been more important, and the person entrusted to lead it has never been more important either.”

At Legal Services NYC, Ms. Clarke worked on a federal discrimination lawsuit against the city filed by several survivors of domestic violence who claimed the police had violated their civil rights by denying them interpreters.

The ensuing settlement called for new practices for the Police Department, and mandated training for officers responding to domestic violence cases involving people who are not proficient in English.

Mr. Mamdani and Ms. Clarke vowed on Wednesday to beef up what is commonly regarded by critics as a lackluster commission, low on funds and slow to respond to discrimination cases. Last month, Thomas P. DiNapoli, the state comptroller, issued an audit that found the commission had “allowed some housing discrimination cases to sit at times for years without resolution.”

In response to a reporter’s question, Ms. Clarke acknowledged “enormous delays in the Commission on Human Rights” and vowed to speed up its output.

Frey blamed Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials for escalating the situation in the city.

DHS says driver was trying to ram agents

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that an ICE agent fatally shot a person in a vehicle, claiming that the person was trying to ram agents.

""Our officer followed his training and did exactly what he was trained to do,"" United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said in a press conference Wednesday afternoon.

The agency's full statement can be read below:

Today, ICE officers in Minneapolis were conducting targeted operations when rioters began blocking ICE officers and one of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them—an act of domestic terrorism.

An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots.

He used his training and saved his own life and that of his fellow officers.

The alleged perpetrator was hit and is deceased. Thankfully, the ICE officers who were hurt are expected to make full recoveries.

This is the direct consequence of constant attacks and demonization of our officers by sanctuary politicians who fuel and encourage rampant assaults on our law enforcement who are facing 1,300% increase in assaults against them and an 8,000% increase in death threats.

This is an evolving situation, and we will give the public more information as soon as it becomes available.”

Operations are set to continue in the city and state despite the ongoing investigation, Noem said.

""We're still out on the streets doing our work,"" she said. ""We are going to continue to operate in Minneapolis and the state of Minnesota.""

Noem said the agent who shot and killed Good was taken to the hospital, treated by a doctor and released to spend time with his family. She did not provide any details about possible injuries or how long he may be out.

She added that the same agent was previously in a similar situation where he was ""hit and drug"" by a car. She didn't provide other details.

Videos circulating online show moments before and after the shooting

Videos, appearing to show the moments leading up to and after an ICE agent shot a driver, began circulating on social media Wednesday afternoon.

In the videos, a red Honda Pilot is seen idling, blocking the roadway with the driver's side window down. ICE agents approach in a truck, step out and approach the vehicle, telling the driver to get out using an expletive. One of the agents begins pulling on the handle of the SUV. The driver appears to slowly back, turn to the right and move forward before accelerating. As the driver begins accelerating, at least two gunshots can be heard.

The car continues accelerating for a moment before crashing into a parked car a short way down the street.

ICE agents were near the front driver’s side fender when the driver attempted to accelerate away.

Frey said at the Wednesday press conference that he had viewed the video and said it did not appear the driver was trying to hit ICE agents.

""The narrative that this was just done in self-defense is a garbage narrative,"" Frey said. ""It is not true.""

City officials said there was no indication the woman who was shot was the target of any law enforcement activity.

Leaders, Minnesota residents respond to ICE shooting

At a separate press conference later Wednesday, Gov. Tim Walz said the state was prepared for protests he expects to take place in the coming days, and urged Minnesotans to ""not take the bait"" from the Trump administration to engage in violence.

""If you protest, and express your First Amendment rights, please do so peacefully as you always do,"" Walz said. ""We can't give them what they want. The hearts and minds of the people in this state are on our side. To Americans, I ask you this: Please stand with Minneapolis. To Minnesotans, know that our administration is going to stop at nothing to seek accountability and justice.""

The governor, who announced a day earlier that he would not be seeking reelection, said he was afraid the federal government's actions would lead to escalation.

""We've been warning for weeks that the Trump administration's dangerous sensationalized operations are a threat to our public safety; that someone was going to get hurt,"" Walz said. ""Just yesterday, I said exactly that. What we're seeing is a consequence of governance designed to generate fear, headlines and conflict. It's governing by reality TV. And today that recklessness caused someone their life.""

Reporters in the area saw more than 100 federal agents descend on the scene near 34th Street and Portland Avenue after the shooting was reported at around 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday.

According to KARE11 reporters at the scene, a crashed car at the intersection had a bullet hole in the front windshield on the driver's side. Two other cars have wreckage damage. Near the scene, protesters began chanting anti-ICE slogans.

A tense interaction nearby saw protesters throwing snowballs at federal officials. The immigration officials responded with pepper spray and paintballs, which are considered non-lethal crowd control devices.

The incident happened during what the Department of Homeland Security called its ""largest immigration operation ever."" An estimated six hundred agents and investigators are examining alleged fraud in the state.

State Senator Omar Fateh said in a social media post that he's received reports that a doctor at the scene was denied the ability to provide lifesaving CPR by federal law enforcement. In a press conference, Frey said he could not verify this witness account.

A witness showed KARE reporters what appeared to be video of responders attempting to resuscitate someone.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara previously said his department does not enforce immigration laws, according to KARE 11. On Tuesday, he said he appointed a designated supervisor and placed additional officers on standby around the clock due to concerns of potential unrest.

“Every day for the last several weeks has been a challenge,” O’Hara said, adding that his greatest concern is the potential for unrest or a tragedy in which someone could be seriously hurt or killed. He asked protesters to remain peaceful and urged federal agents to conduct their work “professionally and lawfully.”

According to DHS, agents have arrested more than 1,000 people in Minnesota, including 150 in Minneapolis on Monday.

In a statement on his Truth Social platform, President Donald Trump said he had seen at least one of the videos showing the Minneapolis shooting.

""I have just viewed the clip of the event which took place in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is a horrible thing to watch,"" he wrote. ""The woman screaming was, obviously, a professional agitator, and the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self-defense. Based on the attached clip, it is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital.""

The president said he blamed the incident, and others like it over the past several months, on left-leaning protesters interfering with ICE operations.

""The situation is being studied, in its entirety, but the reason these incidents are happening is because the Radical Left is threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis,"" Trump wrote.

Large crowds chanting anti-ICE slogans formed near the scene of the shooting, local news outlets showed.

Anti-ICE protests

There have been passionate protests in some cities against the immigration enforcement operations of the Trump administration, which has vowed to arrest and deport what it says are ""millions"" of undocumented migrants.

The DHS called the violence a ""direct consequence of constant attacks and demonization of our officers.""

The shooting reportedly occurred at 34th Street and Portland Avenue in Minneapolis. Nearby, ICE officers were seen pepper-spraying and shoving protesters during immigration enforcement operations in South Minneapolis, footage broadcast by local CBS affiliate WCCO showed.

Dozens of protesters and bystanders were seen on the scene after the incident. ""There's no way whatever this person did that they deserved to be killed for it,"" one bystander told the broadcaster.

Trump has made preventing unlawful immigration and expelling undocumented migrants top priorities during his second term, and has tightened conditions for entering the United States and obtaining visas. During his campaign, Trump likened undocumented migrants to ""animals,"" frequently linking them, without evidence, to criminal behavior.

ICE – which critics accuse of transforming into a paramilitary force under Trump – has been tasked with deporting an unprecedented number of undocumented migrants during the Republican's second term.

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz urged for the public to ""remain calm"" as his team gathered information on the shooting.

Trump's White House called Minneapolis Mayor Frey a ""scumbag"" for comments after the shooting in which he accused ICE of ""causing chaos and distrust.""

Video obtained by the Minnesota Reformer shows an ICE officer demanding the driver of a maroon SUV get out of the vehicle. As the vehicle begins to pull away, an officer fires three shots through the windshield and driver-side window. The video shows no apparent harm to the officer, who walked away from the vehicle shortly after the shooting.

But Trump wrote on social media that “it is hard to believe he is alive.”

“The woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense,” Trump wrote.

Minnesota’s Democratic congressional delegation, and other Democrats in Washington, D.C., strongly condemned the incident and questioned the subsequent comments from the administration.

“We need full transparency and an investigation of what happened, and I am deeply concerned that statements made by DHS do not appear to reflect video evidence and on-the-ground accounts,” Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar, the state’s senior senator, said in a statement.

A statement from several Minneapolis City Council members identified the victim as Renee Nicole Good, 37. A photo of the SUV shows several stuffed animals hanging out of the glove compartment.

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said that the woman tried to run over the agent.

“One of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them—an act of domestic terrorism,” McLaughlin said. “An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called the victim a “domestic terrorist.”

House Republican Whip Tom Emmer gave his support to the ICE officer.

“Our brave ICE agents put their lives on the line every day to protect our communities from dangerous criminals,” he said in a statement. “May God bless and protect them in their efforts. Shame on the elected officials who endanger these agents by spewing lies and hateful rhetoric.”

Dems call for investigation

Democrats on Capitol Hill denounced the attack and the administration’s response.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called for the ICE officer who shot the woman to be criminally investigated.

“There is no evidence that has been presented to justify this killing,” Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said in a statement. “Secretary Kristi Noem is a stone-cold liar and has zero credibility. The masked ICE agent who pulled the trigger should be criminally investigated to the full extent of the law for acting with depraved indifference to human life.”

Minnesota Democrats said the ongoing immigration enforcement campaign in the Twin Cities had heightened tensions.

“For weeks, Donald Trump has directed ICE and DHS agents to racially profile and arrest Minnesotans in their homes, their workplaces, and on our streets,” Minnesota Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum said in a statement, adding that more than 2,000 federal immigration agents are in the state.

“Trump’s reckless and dangerous immigration policies do nothing to make us safer,” she continued. “Today in Minneapolis, these actions resulted in a masked federal agent fatally shooting a woman in the head.”

Democratic Sen. Tina Smith said the woman fatally shot by an ICE officer was a U.S. citizen. She called for ICE to leave Minnesota.

Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, the first Somali-American woman elected to Congress and whose district includes the site of the shooting, said the woman was a legal observer, which is a neutral third party who attends protests or other public demonstrations to observe and record law enforcement actions towards protesters.

“ICE’s actions today were unconscionable and reprehensible,” Omar said.

DHS practices, budget questioned

DHS received billions for immigration enforcement in last year's tax and spending cuts package passed by congressional Republicans. The funding can be used for hiring new ICE officers and detention and removal of immigrants.

On Jan. 3, ICE announced it hired 12,000 new officers, doubling from 10,000 agents to 22,000.

A top Senate Democratic appropriator, Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, wrote on social media that “Democrats cannot vote for a DHS budget that doesn’t restrain the growing lawlessness of this agency.”

New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker said in a statement that he was concerned the aggressive DHS practices will lead to more tragedies.

“All evidence indicates that hiring standards have been lowered, training is inadequate, and internal controls are insufficient,” he said. “These conditions have allowed agents to operate without proper oversight, and, in some cases, unlawfully.”

Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego also criticized the hiring practices of ICE, specifically calling out White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, a lead architect of the Trump administration's immigration policy.

“What happened is a disgrace and we need an investigation immediately,” Gallego said on social media. “It's clear that that agent didn't have the proper training, and that's because Stephen Miller is going full speed ahead to hire as many agents as possible.”

Day care investigation

The federal immigration operation in Minneapolis began last month but intensified this week after a right-wing influencer reported day care centers run by members of the Somali community as fraudulent.

In response, the Trump administration directed states to provide “justification” that federal child care funds they receive are spent on “legitimate” providers and Noem has zeroed in on the city, which has a large Somali community, for immigration enforcement.

The shooting by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent occurred Wednesday morning in a residential neighborhood in Minneapolis as federal immigration officials conducted a sweeping operation, Gov. Tim Walz said.

The Minneapolis County Council released a statement Wednesday afternoon that said Good, 37, was the woman who was shot and killed. Good's family confirmed to KUSA that she's from the Colorado Springs area.

Earlier in the day, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said it didn't appear she was the target of any law-enforcement activity.

The Minneapolis City Council released a statement saying Good was ""out caring for her neighbors"" when she was killed.

“This morning an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a member of our community"" the statement says in part, KARE11 reports. ""Renee was a resident of our city who was out caring for her neighbors this morning and her life was taken today at the hands of the federal government. Anyone who kills someone in our city deserves to be arrested, investigated, and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""

O'Hara said the woman was in her vehicle, which was blocking the street. Video circulating on social media shows ICE agents approaching the car on foot and the woman beginning to drive away as an agent yanks on her door handle. At least two shots were fired into the vehicle, which then crashed.

A red SUV was visible at the scene with a bullet hole through the driver's side windshield. The SUV was smashed into a light pole, with two damaged cars parked nearby, KARE11 reported.

O'Hare said that the woman was taken to a hospital, and her spouse has arrived there.

""This is a very tragic situation where a woman lost her life."" O'Hara said.

DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement the woman was among a group of protesters and attempted to hit ICE agents with her vehicle ""in an attempt to kill them."" She said an ICE agent fired shots at the woman, who was hit and killed.

Videos, appearing to show the moments leading up to and after an ICE agent shot the driver, began circulating on social media Wednesday afternoon.

In the videos, a red Honda Pilot is seen idling, blocking the roadway with the driver's side window down. ICE agents approach in a truck, step out and approach the vehicle, telling the driver to get out, using an expletive.

One of the agents begins pulling on the handle of the SUV.

The driver appears to slowly back up, turn to the right and move forward before accelerating. As the driver begins accelerating, at least two gunshots can be heard.

The car continues accelerating for a moment before crashing into a parked car a short way down the street.

ICE agents were near the front driver’s side fender when the driver attempted to accelerate away.

Frey said he viewed the video and said it did not appear the driver was trying to hit ICE agents.

ICE agents who were injured are expected to make a full recovery, McLaughlin said. She did not say how many agents were injured or what their injuries are.

DHS said on Tuesday that it had launched an immigration enforcement operation with 2,000 agents, tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

The Immigration Defense Network, a coalition of groups serving immigrants in Minnesota, held a training session Tuesday night for about 100 people who are willing to hit the streets to monitor the federal enforcement.",https://media.kcentv.com/assets/KUSA/images/e0012286-f16d-4d76-a781-d69c2713752d/20260107T230509/e0012286-f16d-4d76-a781-d69c2713752d_1140x641.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 19:58:30.596781

The full picture of what exactly happened is still coming into focus, including through eyewitness accounts and videos. But federal officials are describing the killing in starkly different terms from state and local officials.

How did the shooting occur?

Minneapolis Police Department chief Brian O'Hara said officers responded to a report Wednesday morning of shots being fired in an incident involving federal law enforcement.

The city's officers found a woman with a gunshot wound to the head who was later pronounced dead at a local hospital, the police chief said in a news conference Wednesday.

Watch the news conference in the player above.

O'Hara offered a preliminary picture of what happened: The woman was in her car and blocking a roadway. A federal officer then approached the motorist on foot while the vehicle began to drive away. At least two shots were fired and then the vehicle crashed alongside the roadway.

Neither the ICE officer nor the victim have been identified by authorities. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said the woman was 37 years old. O'Hara said she appeared to be a middle-aged white woman.

The Minnesota Star Tribune reported that the victim's mother identified her as Renee Nicole Good, saying she was ""loving, forgiving and affectionate.""

There was ""nothing to indicate that this woman was the target of any law enforcement investigation,"" the police chief said.

Videos taken by bystanders and posted to social media show two officers approaching a car that is stopped across the middle of a snowy and icy road. One officer attempts to open the driver's side door and reaches into the vehicle as it starts reversing. A third officer with his gun drawn crosses in front of the car as it moves away from the agents. That officer, who appears to be knocked backward but not hit, opens fire on the vehicle. The car then speeds toward the curb, crashing into parked vehicles.

What the Trump administration is saying

The Department of Homeland Security said the shooting was an act of self-defense. Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told PBS News in a statement that the ICE officer fired defensively, ""fearing for his life"" and the lives of others.

Speaking from Texas, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem likened the incident to an ""act of domestic terrorism"" against ICE officers by a motorist who tried to run them over with her vehicle.

""An officer of ours acted quickly and defensively shot to protect himself and the people around him,"" she told reporters.

President Donald Trump weighed in on the shooting on social media, suggesting the driver was ""very disorderly"" and ""viciously ran over the ICE Officer, [sic]"" who he said was recovering in the hospital after the incident. DHS' McLaughlin said in the statement that ""the ICE officers who were hurt are expected to make full recoveries.""

What Minnesota officials are saying

Watch the clip in the player above.

Frey strongly rebuked the federal characterization of events, saying that he had viewed footage of the incident.

""They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defense,"" he said. ""I wanna tell everybody directly, that is bulls**t.""

A reporter asked Frey whether the woman was driving her car as a ""weapon"" toward the ICE agent. The mayor said that didn't appear to be the case.

Frey said the ICE agent was ""recklessly using power"" that resulted in a person's death.

""They are not here to cause safety in this city. What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,"" Frey said.

He then said he had a message to ICE: ""Get the f**k out of Minneapolis. We do not want you here.""

Gov. Tim Walz addressed Minneapolis residents in a later news conference, saying, ""I feel your anger.""

The governor, who mentioned the protests following the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd throughout Wednesday's news conference, then asked for any protests to remain peaceful. ""They want a show,"" he said of the Trump administration. ""We can't give it to them.""

He then addressed the Trump administration.

""We do not need any further help from the federal government. To Donald Trump and Kristi Noem: You've done enough,"" the governor added.

Why is ICE in Minneapolis?

Minneapolis is the latest major U.S. city to see a surge of immigration enforcement activity. The Trump administration sent more than 2,000 federal agents to the area earlier this week. ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons told Newsmax that this is the ""largest immigration operation ever.""

The deployment followed mounting scrutiny from federal investigators over fraud allegations targeting Somali child care providers in the state. Trump has also singled out Somalis in his anti-immigrant rhetoric.

In his social media post, Trump claimed that the ""Radical Left is threatening, assaulting, and targeting"" law enforcement officers and ICE agents on a ""daily basis.""

Walz, who had called the deployment a ""war"" against Minnesota, responded to DHS' social media post about the shooting, saying he had viewed video of the incident.

""Don't believe this propaganda machine,"" the governor wrote. ""The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.""

This deference may be under reconsideration, given the latest ruling in the Illinois Guard case.
In both the Illinois Guard case and the “reciprocal tariff” case, the question of proportionality arises.","Card players recognize the signs of a “tell,” a player’s demeanor that telegraphs intent for the next hand. Just before Christmas, the Supreme Court in Trump v. Illinois made a procedural ruling that prevented the Trump administration from deploying Illinois National Guard troops in Chicago. Could this decision signal that the Court may rule against the administration in the Trump tariff cases?

The stay blocking deployment of troops in Chicago was upheld by a 6-3 vote. It centered on interpreting 10 U.S.C. §12406(3)—a statute the administration invoked to federalize (activate) the National Guard to enforce federal law. The Supreme Court concluded that the government had not shown that this statute authorized the president to deploy the Guard in Chicago. It cited the statutory requirement that that the president first be “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws”—a condition it found was not met or shown. The Court’s majority (Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, and Neil Gorsuch dissenting) defined “regular forces” as the regular US military. Federal troops generally cannot be used for domestic law enforcement unless explicitly authorized by Congress (e.g., the Insurrection Act, pointing to limits under the Posse Comitatus Act). The Court found that there was no showing that “regular forces” could not execute the laws and that the legal conditions for military use had not been fulfilled.

The president’s use of “reciprocal” tariffs on imports of almost everything from everywhere, first announced on April 2 under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), would seem to be as remote a fact pattern that could be imagined from the issues in the Illinois Guard case. But there are a few striking parallels in the two sets of facts and perhaps some similarities in the reasoning. In both cases the president is claiming powers without limit, powers that intrude on the domains of other parts of the American government. Both cases involve the separation of powers—in the Guard case, it is the vertical separation between the states and the federal government. In the tariffs case, it is the potential trespass on the powers of the Congress.

Here is a breakdown of the similarities in the legal considerations before the Court.

Intrusion on powers entrusted by the Constitution to other parts of the government

Although not unknown—for example, in civil rights cases—federalizing a state’s guard over the governor’s objection is one of the most intrusive actions the federal government can take against a state. Illinois argues that accepting the government’s position for federalizing the Guard would allow the president to regularly commandeer state military forces for routine crime control even when state authorities were functioning and opposed the action. This would dramatically weaken the balance struck between federal and states’ police powers. There would be no limits. See brief of the State of Illinois.

Similarly, by declaring an emergency under IEEPA, any time that the president wishes to apply a tariff, he could do so when conducting normal commercial relations with other countries. In the tariffs case, it is the president assuming powers clearly assigned by the Constitution to the Congress. The president’s “emergency” power to deploy tariffs would have no effective limits, as only a vote in both Houses by a two-thirds supermajority could assure the end of an emergency and the removal of the tariffs the president declared. See V.O.S. Selections v. Trump and the oral argument at the Supreme Court on the cases.

Stretching statutory authority beyond its text

10 U.S.C. §12406 allows federalization of the Guard in limited circumstances. Detaching the statute from its preconditions, especially the requirement that the president be “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws,” would convert an exceptional power into a general domestic policing authority. In other words, the statute was being read as: “If the president thinks it useful, he may federalize the guard.” Congress did not write §12406 that broadly.

IEEPA, a sanctions statute, does not even include tariffs in its list of means to be used. It refers to unusual circumstances of a foreign threat that constitutes an emergency. Trade deficits are neither unusual nor clearly an emergency. Tariffs might be used to enforce a trade sanction but not converted into a general domestic revenue raising or even retaliatory authority.

Bypassing existing authority

When presidents deploy military force domestically, they rely on the Insurrection Act, which has explicit triggers (e.g., insurrection, obstruction of federal law, deprivation of constitutional rights). The Act carries political and legal accountability and has a well-understood history of precedents. It has been used in limited circumstances to maintain order in Little Rock, AR, when ending segregation in the public schools in the 1950s, for example, and in the face of widespread riots.

The reciprocal tariffs are an end-run around Congress’s chosen framework. The Congress provided authority to deal with balance of payments emergencies (limited to a 15 percent tariff and 150 days duration). There are separate authorities to deal with threats to national security (Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962) and to retaliate against foreign unfair trade practices (Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974). During most of the last 90 years, there has been delegated trade agreement authority to modify tariffs. That authority expired during the presidency of Joseph R. Biden Jr.

Expansion of presidential powers

What would come next if the Court approved the government’s theory in upholding deployment of the Guard? Could the Guard be federalized for fighting crime, enforcing immigration or other laws, or dealing with political unrest generally? Could a standing alternative police force be created? Could invoking emergency powers be normalized if this deployment of the Guard was normalized?

Similarly, if the Court upholds the tariffs, what constraints exist on the president’s future use of the power to tax trade if the “reciprocal” tariffs he imposed are allowed to stand?

Conclusion: Proportionality

The Roberts Court has been very favorable to the executive branch, including allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) broad scope to enforce immigration laws, in granting the president immunity from criminal acts when conducting the business of government, and in a host of other ways. This deference may be under reconsideration, given the latest ruling in the Illinois Guard case. The stay on the Guard may be a harbinger of a shift of attitude for a new majority of the court. Although the executive has been given extensive support from the Court to act as it wishes, there are still and ought to be constitutional limits. The Illinois decision may be instructive: The reasoning it applied is a strong mandate for returning the Constitution to its place in ensuring balance among co-equal branches of the legislative and the executive, with the Court sitting as the arbiter that the respective roles will be respected.

One of the most important powers the Constitution grants to Congress is the power to impose tariffs, the power to tax. The entire structure of government, the system of checks and balances among the branches, can readily be undermined if the president is allowed to exercise unrestricted power to raise revenue through imposing tariffs.

In both the Illinois Guard case and the “reciprocal tariff” case, the question of proportionality arises. Is the threat clearly of so great a magnitude—whether civil unrest in the former case, or external threats of economic harm in the latter—that sweeping powers should be assumed as intentionally granted to the executive by the Congress? The cases could not be superficially more disparate but raise a similar question. How much authority is acceptable to be transferred from other parts of the nation’s governance to the executive?",https://www.piie.com/sites/default/files/2026-01/RC2HQHAAS7CQ.JPG,N,,2026-01-07 17:58:43.618584

Videos taken by bystanders with different vantage points and posted to social media show an officer approaching an SUV stopped across the middle of the road, demanding the driver open the door and grabbing the handle. The SUV begins to pull forward and a different ICE officer standing in front of the vehicle pulls his weapon and immediately fires at least two shots into the SUV at close range, jumping back as the vehicle moves toward him.

It was not clear from the videos if the vehicle made contact with the officer. The SUV then sped into two cars parked on a curb nearby before crashing to a stop. Witnesses screamed obscenities, expressing shock at what they’d seen.

Immigration authorities accused the victim, who the Minnesota Star Tribune identified as Renee Nicole Good, of trying to run over officers with her car. In a post on Truth Social, President Donald Trump defended the ICE agent who shot the victim, saying the agent “seems to have shot her in self defense.”

In a post on X, Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith said the driver was a U.S. citizen.

“I’m gathering information, but the situation on the ground is volatile,” Smith said. “ICE should leave now for everyone’s safety. Please be safe Minneapolis.”

After the shooting, Mayor Jacob Frey said immigration agents were “causing chaos in our city.”

“We are demanding ICE leave the city and state immediately. We stand rock solid with our immigrant and refugee communities,” Frey posted on social media, referring to ICE.

During a press event Wednesday afternoon, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced he had issued a “warning order” to the Minnesota National Guard — though the Guard has not been activated — to protect Minnesotans. He blamed the Trump administration for operations that endanger the public, and went on to call on residents in cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, and Portland to “stand with us.”

“This was so preventable. So unnecessary,” he said. “Maybe we’re at the McCarthy moment. Do you have no decency?”

Chicago had similar shootings involving federal agents

Wednesday’s deadly shooting follows similar incidents reported in the Chicago area during Operation Midway Blitz, the Trump administration’s aggressive deportation campaign. In one raid, a man was killed, and in another a woman was injured.

Silverio Villegas González, a father and cook originally from Mexico, was shot at “close range” as he allegedly tried to flee from ICE agents who sought to stop his car on Sept. 12 in suburban Franklin Park.

Villegas González was shot in his neck and taken to Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, where he was placed on a breathing tube before being pronounced dead less than an hour later, according to the Cook County medical examiner’s office. A toxicology report showed he had cocaine in his system at the time of the shooting.

Shortly after the shooting, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security reported an agent was “seriously injured” when he was “dragged a significant distance” by Villegas González’s car as he fled a stop. DHS officials said the agent had opened fire, fearing for his life.

But body camera footage first obtained by the Chicago Sun-Times shows the federal agent telling local police he was “dragged a little bit.” Speaking over the radio, his partner relays the agent suffered “a left knee injury and some lacerations to his hands.”

Villegas González had no criminal history, but DHS has said he had “a history of reckless driving” and was in the country without legal status.

A month later, Marimar Martinez, 30, was shot several times for allegedly tailing a Chevrolet Tahoe driven by Border Patrol agent Charles Exum. Martinez allegedly boxed it in and ultimately collided with it.

Exum opened fire, striking Martinez five times, leaving her with seven gunshot wounds. The shooting drew about 100 protesters to the Brighton Park neighborhood, who were met with pepper balls and tear gas deployed by federal agents.

Martinez was charged with assault, but federal prosecutors later dropped the case.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9744c4a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2302+0+193/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F81%2Fc0%2F4a9ebbed4fee9a0b76f6882912f4%2Fimmigration-enforcement-minnesota.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 18:58:39.605314

Among the Republicans defending ICE after the shooting are several members of leadership, including Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) and House Republican conference chair Lisa McClain (R-Mich.).

""Our brave ICE agents put their lives on the line every day to protect our communities from dangerous criminals. May God bless and protect them in their efforts,"" Emmer said in a statement.

What happened: An ICE officer shot and killed a 37-year-old woman who drove her vehicle close to federal agents Wednesday morning, Axios' Nick Halter and Kyle Stokes reported.

DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement: ""An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots.""

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, citing video of the incident, called that account ""bullshit,"" telling reporters, ""Having seen the video myself ... this was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying.""

In a video viewed by Axios — filmed a short distance from the scene — someone yells, ""Hey!"" and gunshots are audible as a dark-colored SUV attempts to drive past a gathering of ICE agents and vehicles.

What they're saying: ""This is what happens when Democrats continue to DEMONIZE LAW ENFORCEMENT,"" McClain said in a post on X responding to McLaughlin's statement. ""Praying for all our brave ICE agents who are working to keep us safe.""

The House Republican conference's official X account similarly replied to McLaughlin's statement with a pro-ICE graphic and the caption: ""REPOST IF YOU STAND WITH ICE 🇺🇸""

Rep. Michelle Fischbach (R-Minn.) called the incident a ""targeted assault on ICE agents"" and said she stands ""with the officer who acted in self-defense to save lives.""

Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said: ""It appears to, I guess, anybody who sees the video from certain angles, that the driver of the vehicle weaponized that vehicle against law enforcement officers.""

The other side: Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), who represents Minneapolis, called the shooting ""unconscionable and reprehensible"" and called for a ""full, comprehensive investigation and legal action"" against ICE.

""The masked ICE agent who pulled the trigger should be criminally investigated to the full extent of the law,"" said House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.).

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Rep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) both proposed voting down any DHS appropriations bill that ""doesn't restrain the growing lawlessness"" of ICE.

Several Democratic lawmakers also called for ICE to withdraw from Minneapolis and other major American cities, with Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.) saying the agency is ""needlessly causing chaos in Minnesota.""

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A federal officer shot and killed a Minneapolis motorist when she allegedly tried to run over law enforcement officers during an immigration crackdown in the city, authorities said Wednesday.

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot the woman in her vehicle in a residential neighborhood in Minneapolis, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

The shooting marks a dramatic escalation of the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations in major American cities under the Trump administration. It’s at least the fifth person killed in a handful of states since 2024.

The twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul have been on edge since DHS announced Tuesday that it had launched the operation, with more than 2,000 agents and officers expected to participate in the crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

A large throng of protesters gathered at the scene after the shooting, where they vented their anger at the local and federal officers who were there, including Gregory Bovino, a senior U.S. Customs and Border Patrol official who has been the face of crackdowns in Los Angeles, Chicago and elsewhere.

In a scene that hearkened back to the Los Angeles and Chicago crackdowns, bystanders heckled the officers and blew whistles that have become ubiquitous during the operations.

“Shame! Shame! Shame!” and “ICE out of Minnesota!” they loudly chanted from behind the police tape.

After the shooting, Mayor Jacob Frey said immigration agents were “causing chaos in our city.”

“We are demanding ICE leave the city and state immediately. We stand rock solid with our immigrant and refugee communities,” Frey said on social media.

The area where the shooting occurred is a modest neighborhood south of downtown Minneapolis, just a few blocks from some of the oldest immigrant markets in the area and a mile (1.6 kilometers) from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020.

“We’ve been trying to live life as fully as possible in light of the fear and anxiety that we feel,” said the Rev. Hierald Osorto, pastor at St. Paul’s-San Pablo Lutheran Church, which has a predominantly Latino congregation in the area.

During a news conference in Texas on Wednesday, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed that the agency had deployed more than 2,000 officers to the Twin Cities and already made “hundreds and hundreds” of arrests.

For nearly a year, migrant rights advocates and neighborhood activists across the Twin Cities have been preparing to mobilize in the event of an immigration enforcement surge. From houses of worship to mobile home parks, they have set up very active online networks, scanned license plates for possible federal vehicles and bought whistles and other noise-making devices to alert neighborhoods of any enforcement presence.

On Tuesday night, the Immigration Defense Network, a coalition of groups serving immigrants in Minnesota, held a training session for about 100 people who were willing to hit the streets to monitor the federal enforcement operation.

“I feel like I’m an ordinary person, and I have the ability do something so I need to do it,” Mary Moran told KMSP-TV.

These bonds, ranging from $5,000 to $15,000, target select applicants from ""high-risk"" nations for short-term B-1/B-2 visitor visas, refundable only upon full compliance or denial. This Policy transforms lawful travel into a financial privilege, disproportionately excluding poorer, majority non-white populations and entrenching a mobility apartheid that raises profound Human Rights alarms.​

Policy Mechanics and Historical Lineage

The Policy originated as a 2025 State Department pilot addressing elevated visa overstay rates and weak document security, now encompassing 38 states after incorporating 25 new ones, with Africa hit hardest at over 20 countries plus Venezuela. Consular officers impose these sums—often dwarfing years of per-capita income—rendering entry a liquidity test for ordinary citizens.

""The bond scheme is intended to deter visa overstays and ensure 'compliance' with the terms of short-term visas,""

officials maintain, grounding it in Department of Homeland Security overstay analyses.​

Integrated into President Donald Trump's second-term framework, the regime pairs with biometric upgrades and rigorous ""public charge"" evaluations to constrict migration pathways. Its selective application—

""only to some applicants deemed higher overstay risk""

—fosters nationality-based profiling, laced with class and racial undertones, particularly evident in Venezuela amid economic sanctions and geopolitical strains.​

Economic Ripples and Social Exclusion

High bond thresholds threaten to slash tourism, family visits, and business exchanges from listed nations, where scraping together thousands in liquid funds remains elusive for most.

""The high bond levels are expected to depress tourism flows, reduce in-person business links, and complicate family visits from affected countries,""

especially burdensome for African states now numbering 24 on the roster. Diaspora ties weaken, remittances falter, and cultural connections fray under this Policy's weight.​

Such exclusion codifies global hierarchies, where Northern travelers glide unimpeded while Southern ones hit paywalls. Critics invoke ""mobility apartheid,"" akin to historical pass systems, as

""the list largely consists of Global South countries with lower income levels,""

perpetuating unequal mobility through financialized gates. Venezuela's designation, set against ""heightened tensions,"" blends migration controls with broader U.S. pressure tactics.​

The Racialised Underpinnings of Financialised Borders

Financial barriers racialise U.S. borders by proxy, as the roster fixates on Africa and Latin America—majority non-white regions—while sparing Europe and affluent peers despite comparable overstay data. In low-income contexts like Senegal or Nigeria, a $5,000 bond equates to multiple years' earnings, accessible solely to elites.

""Costly visa deposits turn lawful travel into privilege for the wealthy,""

amplifying disparities where mobility tracks wealth often aligned with racial privilege.​

This Policy echoes entrenched patterns, from quota eras to profiling spikes, encoding bias via discretion and risk metrics.

""Rights groups characterize the bonds as a form of 'pay-to-enter' migration control that deepens inequality in mobility,""

spotlighting Human Rights violations in access rationing. Venezuela's inclusion

""exposes political logic behind America’s expanded visa bonds,""

merging enforcement with foreign Policy aims.​

Broader Implications for Global Mobility Equity

The regime accelerates ""pay-to-play"" borders, layering onto digital visa tools and AI checks that already sideline the less affluent.

""Visa bonds export Washington’s migration anxieties onto poorer, dependent states,""

offloading costs while asserting dominance. Diplomatic strains emerge, potentially derailing trade with African Union members or hemispheric deals over Latin inclusions.​

U.S. economies suffer too—fewer visitors from Nigeria or Venezuela dent hospitality sectors in key cities. Yet the Policy delivers political dividends for Trump's base, prioritizing ""tough"" optics over equitable flows. Human Rights standards, from UN mobility pacts, clash with this tiered system, demanding scrutiny of its disparate impacts.​

Human Rights Critiques and Policy Pathologies

Human Rights advocates decry the bonds as discriminatory,

""warn[ing] the policy will effectively price out many ordinary travelers and small businesspeople, viewing it as a discriminatory barrier that falls overwhelmingly on poorer nations.""

By design, the Policy functions as exclusion, not enforcement, violating equality principles in global passage.

""US visa bonds weaponise financial barriers against Global South mobility,""

entrenching apartheid-like divides.​

Geopolitics infuses the Policy further: Venezuela and like cases serve sanction proxies, isolating foes under migration guise. This financial Policy tests international norms, inviting reciprocity or boycotts from the Global South.

Toward Dismantling the Apartheid

Dismantling requires legislative caps, indigency waivers, or judicial probes into racial impacts. Global South coalitions could enact mirror Policies, pressuring equity. Awareness campaigns, hammering

After taking questions from the media, the news conference with Noem has now ended.

Stay with us as we bring you the latest on what we learned.

Release of body camera footage up to FBI, Noem says

Noem says the FBI is leading the investigation into the events of the shooting. When asked whether body camera footage from the ICE agents would be released as part of it, she declined to answer, saying it was up to the FBI.

She reiterated the version of events told by federal officials today - that ICE agents were wrapping up another operation and heading back to the office when their vehicle got stuck in the snow.

While they were stuck, the woman blocked their paths and harassed them, Noem said.

Officer who opened fire was 'experienced' agent

Noem is repeatedly pressed about her comments that the officer who opened fire acted in ""self-defence"".

She says the officer is an ""experienced"" agent, but did not provide details on whether he had previously opened fired in the June incident where she says a car was also used as a ""weapon"".

Local officials 'refuse to protect Minnesotans', says Noem

Noem blames local Democratic leaders for not enforcing federal laws, making it necessary for federal officers to be in the city.

The mayor and governor ""refuse to protect Minnesotans, and instead choose to protect the criminals. That's why we're here,"" she claims.

Federal officers in the city are there to ""bring peace"" and have arrested 1,500 ""criminals"" in recent weeks in Minneapolis.

She also references recent fraud allegations made against the city's Somali immigrant community, which have helped fuel the federal crackdown in the city.

ICE agent was hit by a car last summer, says Noem

Noem says an ICE agent injured today was previously hit by a car in June.

He was injured then, too, she says.

""In fact, the very same officer who was attacked today had previously been dragged by an anti-ICE rioter who had rammed him with a car and dragged him back in June,"" says Noem.

""He sustained injuries at that time as well.""

Noem says 'mob of agitators' was harassing ICE agents

The incident began when law enforcement agents were attempting to remove an ICE vehicle that had gotten stuck in snow, says Noem.

""A mob of agitators that were harassing them all day began blocking them in,"" she says about the crowd that formed around the agents.

The woman, says Noem, was stalking and impeding officers, before making the decision to ""weaponise"" her vehicle in an effort to ""kill"" officers.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to speak shortly

Kristi Noem, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, is in Minneapolis and is scheduled to hold a news conference in a few minutes.

The department oversees a variety of agencies, including immigration enforcement like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) which was involved in the deadly shooting earlier in the day.

Noem has said the officer who opened fire was in fear for his life after the woman allegedly tried to use her vehicle as a weapon. She called the incident ""an act of domestic terrorism"".

What do ICE guidelines say when officers can use deadly force?

The shooting is expected to be heavily-scrutinised, and will certainly include a review of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) policy on when deadly force is permitted.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) falls under DHS, and is subject to the same rules, which were last updated in February 2023.

According to the DHS guidelines, ""deadly force must be objectively reasonable in light of the facts and circumstances confronting the [law enforcement agent] at the time force is applied"".

Deadly force can only be used when the officer ""has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury"" to the officer or another person.

The rules add that deadly force ""shall not be used solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing subject"" unless the person ""poses an imminent threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person"".

Agents are also ""prohibited from discharging firearms at the operator of a moving vehicle unless the use of deadly force against the operator is justified under standards articulated elsewhere in this policy"".

Agents also must consider ""that hazards that may be posed"" by an out-of-control vehicle.

A state-led investigation of the shooting is already underway, according to Governor Tim Walz.

Minneapolis City Council says Renee Good was 'caring for her neighbors' when she was shot

The Minneapolis City Council shared a statement confirming the identity of the deceased woman as Renee Nicole Good and condemning ICE's actions in the city.

""Renee was a resident of our city who was out caring for her neighbors this morning and her life was taken today at the hands of the federal government,"" the statement reads. ""Anyone who kills someone in our city deserves to be arrested, investigated, and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""

The Council goes on to express support for immigrant communities in the city, and echoed calls from Mayor Jacob Frey for ICE agents to leave immediately.

""Minneapolis is resilient and will not back down as the federal government ramps up their attacks on our community,"" it said.

Analysis: Shooting being characterised in starkly different ways

Anthony Zurcher

North America correspondent

It is almost inevitable that the fatal shooting of a civilian in Minneapolis by an ICE officer will exacerbate already high tensions in the city.

Both the Trump administration and Democratic state and local officials are characterising the incident in starkly different ways.

Donald Trump, in a Truth Social post, blamed a “professional agitator” and a “radical left movement of movement of violence and hate”. Jacob Frey, the Democratic mayor of Minneapolis, offered an expletive laced call for immigration enforcement officials to leave the city.

Given that there is video of encounter, the American public will have the opportunity to pass its own judgement.

Minnesota has become a battleground on the immigration issue in recent months, as hundreds of immigration enforcement officials conduct operations in the area.

The increased enforcement comes as Donald Trump has derided the state’s large Somali immigrant population after members of the community were convicted of a widespread fraud in the distribution of federal Covid aid. Allegations of further corruption in state social services led to Tim Walz, the state’s Democratic governor, to abandon his re-election bid last week.

In a press conference earlier, Walz called the shooting “totally predictable” and “total avoidable” but warned against violent protests.

Minnesota Attorney General calls ICE deployment 'reckless'

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison says he is monitoring reports of an ICE-involved shooting in Minneapolis, in which a woman was killed.

He says reports are still coming in and there are still a lot that officials do not know, but he adds that President Donald Trump's decision to deploy thousands of armed ICE agents to the state ""is causing serious harm and spreading terror throughout our communities"".

He calls the move ""reckless"" and says it is a ""causal factor"" in Wednesday's incident, regardless of the outcome of the investigation.

""I will do everything I can to change this awful path we are on,"" he says, adding that he will work to hold anyone who broke the law accountable.

Shooting occurred near site of another high profile killing by law enforcement

During the news conference, Mayor Frey urged residents to protest peaceful saying the ""city has been through a lot"".

It was a veiled reference to other high profile incidents including the May 2020 killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man by a local police officer. Derek Chauvin was convicted on state charges and sentenced to over 22 years in prison.

Today's shooting occurred in the Powderhorn Park neighbourhood, a short distance from the intersection where Floyd was killed.

Video of the incident went viral sparking large scale protests against police brutality and racism locally before spreading across the nation and internationally.

Avelo Airlines is ending its deportation flights on Jan. 27 after months of harsh criticism and protests. The news comes after Delaware lawmakers recently introduced legislation that would strip state incentives from companies that support the massive nationwide immigration deportation efforts under President Donald Trump’s administration.

Delaware Stop Avelo Coalition has gathered at the Wilmington Airport since May to pressure the budget airline to drop the deportation flights. Activists in other states have also staged protests against the airline’s cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement efforts across the country.

Avelo Communications Manager Courtney Goff said in a statement the company will end its participation in the nationwide Department of Homeland Security program and close its Arizona hub.

“The program provided short-term benefits, but ultimately did not deliver enough consistent and predictable revenue to overcome its operational complexity and costs,” she said.

Caritas Kerby, co-organizer of the Delaware Stop Avelo Coalition, said she believes the activism across the country led to Avelo’s decision to end its role in the controversial flights.

“I firmly believe that Avelo is folding due to the pressure campaigns all over the country,” she said. “It’s been months and months and months of hard work, late nights, meetings, coordination of a bunch of different organizations, and it’s feeling like a really big win.”

Goff denies that Avelo had a contract with the federal government to provide deportation flights, in spite of the company confirming to several media outlets in April that it agreed to provide ICE with flights to support “deportation efforts.”

“We realize this is a sensitive and complicated topic,” Andrew Levy, Avelo Airlines founder and CEO, said in a statement published by Houston Public Media in April. “After significant deliberations, we determined this charter flying will provide us with the stability to continue expanding our core scheduled passenger service and keep our more than 1,100 crewmembers employed for years to come.”

Goff told WHYY News that Avelo was a subcontractor of CSI Aviation, which is currently the prime contractor for ICE deportation flights. According to the official tracker of federal government spending, CSI Aviation to date has been paid more than $560 million for ICE deportation flights.

Data from Human Rights First, a nonprofit group that tracks ICE flights, shows Avelo did fly deportation flights. The group’s report said the Trump administration conducted at least 11,192 ICE air charter flights from January through the end of November 2025, with Avelo serving about 17% of all November flights.

“We did do government flying, we are not disputing that,” Goff said in an emailed statement.

Proposed bills target Avelo Airlines’ economic incentives

A pair of Delaware lawmakers filed measures last month to address Avelo’s connection to ICE. The resolution and bill are sponsored by state Sen. Ray Seigfried, D-Talleyville, and Rep. Mara Gorman, D-Newark. Gorman said her constituents have been unhappy that Avelo has been profiting from these deportation flights. While Avelo did not run those flights out of Delaware, it did in other states, with a hub in Mesa, Arizona.

Senate Concurrent Resolution 123 would urge the Delaware River and Bay Authority, which operates the Wilmington Airport, to prohibit agreements or incentives to businesses with ICE contracts that help deport individuals who have not been afforded sufficient due process protections.

Senate Bill 207 would remove a financial incentive for commercial airlines that operate ICE flights that include detainees who lack a valid judicial warrant or have not received required due process rights.

While the Senate bill’s language is broad, it would have potentially impacted Avelo’s jet fuel tax exemption and DRBA marketing incentives.

“We have every right to say how we’re going to provide financial incentives to an organization that’s violating a person’s due process,” Siegfried said.

In a statement, DRBA spokesperson James Salmon said that “while the DRBA understands and acknowledges community concerns regarding Avelo’s activities at other airports, those activities are outside the scope of the DRBA’s authority.”

DRBA could make deal with second ICE contractor

The proposed legislation could prevent or eliminate incentives on a possible lease agreement between DRBA and Daedalus Aviation Group at the Wilmington Airport.

Last month, DHS paid Virginia-based Daedalus nearly $140 million to buy six Boeing 737s to use in deportation flights. Top company officials also head a separate company that has a nearly $1 billion contract to support “self deportations.” Daedalus did not respond to a request for comment.

Gorman said the bills are needed because Delawareans should know about companies operating inside the state that may be profiting off of the deportation of people without legal documentation who have been denied due process.

“[The resolution] asks DRBA to review the existing contracts, apply greater scrutiny to future agreements involving companies that conduct ICE deportation flights,” Gorman said. “And basically says that if public money is being used, the public deserves transparency and accountability about where those dollars are going.”

Members of the Delaware Stop Avelo Coalition said they’re concerned the DRBA is trying to hide a possible deal with Daedalus Aviation because of its work helping ICE deport people who don’t have the proper documents to be in the country.

The DRBA is a bi-state government agency that owns and operates several transportation hubs across New Jersey and Delaware. It is run by a board of commissioners appointed by each state’s governor and is funded by tolls, user fees, ticket sales and retail transactions.

Rebekah Rodriguez, a member of the coalition, said she supports the lawmakers’ efforts.

“We think the legislation is important to increase transparency, to try to make sure that there’s no private profit off of the illegal deportations of our neighbors, and make sure that our institutions and representatives are being accountable,” she said.

DRBA pulls Daedalus agenda item after public scrutiny, revises agenda

The Delaware River and Bay Authority was expected to consider the Daedalus Aviation lease agreement at its Dec. 16 meeting.

Rodriguez said some activists showed up to the meeting to voice their concerns after seeing the lease agreement item on the agenda. She said the board quickly pulled it once the meeting started.

“Our community members showed up at that meeting and it was local clergy, parents and wage workers in our community,” she said. “When the DRBA saw us there, even though they are a public entity and they are answerable to the people of Delaware, they abruptly just took that resolution off and went into an executive session.”

WHYY News obtained the agenda that lists the lease agreement item from members of the Delaware Stop Avelo Coalition. That agenda is no longer on the economic development agency’s website.

DRBA posted a revised agenda where the resolution number of the lease agreement now discusses employee retirement plans. Salmon did not respond to follow up questions from WHYY News.

Kerby said that while she considers the Avelo decision a win, her group will continue to pressure companies in the state not to do business with ICE.

“We are still going to be fighting in Delaware,” she said. “We have more work to do, but we’re celebrating how powerful we can be together.”

Delaware DOJ says DRBA not subject to state public records laws

It’s unclear if taking down the original agenda and replacing it with one that removes the mention of the lease agreement would violate Delaware open records laws.

That’s because the bi-state agency is not subject to either states’ Freedom of Information laws, according to a 2020 Delaware FOIA legal opinion. DOJ lawyers said the agency adopted its own FOIA policy in 1990. Questions to Salmon about the legality of altering the December agenda went unanswered.

“DRBA contends that it is not subject to unilateral legislation, as relevant caselaw and the language of the compact itself do not permit any additional duties or obligations be undertaken by DRBA without the express authorization of both states,” the DOJ opinion reads.

That legal decision said DRBA could be subject to either of the states’ FOIA laws by passing legislation. If the states chose to do so, the bill must contain a direct statement that they intend to amend the compact under which DRBA was created to make those laws apply.

This water barrier is part of a push by President Donald Trump to build a “Smart Wall” made up of steel barriers, waterborne barriers, patrol roads, lights, cameras and detection technology.

U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the deployment of the barriers Wednesday during a visit to the Rio Grande Valley that included a roundtable discussion with U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel as well as ranchers whose property is often traversed by migrants moving north after crossing the border.

Standing before one of the buoys — large floating, cylindrical devices that can measure up to 15 feet long and four to five feet in diameter — Noem said 130 miles of the water barrier were already under contract and were beginning to be installed that day.

This water barrier is part of a push by President Donald Trump to build a “Smart Wall” made up of steel barriers, waterborne barriers, patrol roads, lights, cameras and detection technology. The projects are funded by the 2025 tax and spending megabill, which Trump named the One Big Beautiful Bill.

Noem touted the water barrier as a deterrent to people crossing the border illegally as well as drug smugglers and human traffickers.

Homeland Security and the Border Patrol are working with the U.S. International Boundary and Water Commission and the state of Texas to ensure proper installation of the buoys, Noem said.

The state of Texas is already familiar with using buoys to deter border crossings. Gov. Greg Abbott ordered the installation of a 1,000-foot water barrier along the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass in 2023 as part of his mission to tighten border security, and an additional 1,000 feet of buoys after Trump took office in January 2025.

“Texas finally has a partner in the White House,” Andrew Mahaleris, press secretary for Abbott, said in a statement Wednesday. “The floating marine barriers deployed by Texas have been a resounding success, and Governor Abbott is proud to work with the Trump Administration and Border Patrol to expand the program. ”

The buoys sparked protests from activists concerned about migrant safety and a complaint from the Mexican government alleging the buoys violated water treaties between the U.S. and Mexico. The U.S. Department of Justice under President Joe Biden sued Texas over the buoys, citing similar concerns. The U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has allowed the buoys to remain in place while the merits of the case move forward in a lower court. The state has argued it has the right to defend itself against an “invasion” of drug cartels.

Weeks after the buoy wall was installed in Eagle Pass, Mexican authorities reported a migrant had been found dead, caught on one of the floating spheres. On Wednesday, Noem argued that the water barrier would prevent migrant deaths by discouraging them from trying to cross the river.

“They’ll create a safer environment for agents on patrol, and securing our waterways not only protects Americans, it saves the lives of illegal aliens by deterring them from daring to attempt to cross through this treacherous water,” Noem said.

The nonpartisan budget office projected that U.S. population will grow from 349 million people this year to 364 million people in 30 years, a 2.2% smaller gain than it had predicted at this time a year ago. In September, the office issued a revised demographics report that showed Trump’s plans for mass deportations and other strict immigration measures would result in roughly 320,000 people removed from the United States over the next 10 years.

The country's total population is projected to stop growing in 2056 and remain roughly the same size as in the previous year, the CBO said. But without immigration, the population would begin to shrink in 2030 as deaths start to exceed births, making immigrants an increasingly important source of population growth, according to the report.

The figures released Wednesday are used by the CBO for budget projections and economic forecasts.

Even if the limits on immigration and increased deportations end with the Trump administration in three years, “it’s still a demographic shock,” said William Frey, a demographer at the centrist Brookings Institution.

Social Security and Medicare, which are already buckling under an aging population, will be under increasing pressure with even fewer than expected people in the labor force paying taxes. By the end of the decade, all of the nation’s baby boomers, born between 1946 and 1964, will be over age 65.

With fewer immigrants in the labor force and projections for U.S. fertility rates showing a long-term decline below replacement levels, ""that reduces the number of kids who are going to be born in that four-year period” of the second Trump administration, Frey said.

The latest numbers come as Trump has pushed for the largest mass deportation campaign in history. The CBO's numbers account for the success of those efforts in the first year of his second term in office.

The administration has used a variety of methods to remove people from the country, including through a visa ban on applications for immigrants from some countries and deploying Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in U.S. cities to track down immigrants who are in the country illegally.

Trump’s tax and spending law, passed by Congress and signed in July, included roughly $150 billion to ramp up his deportation agenda over the next four years. This includes money for extending the U.S.-Mexico border wall, building detention centers and adding thousands of law enforcement staff.

When it comes to estimating the nation’s population and future growth, immigration is always the wild card because it varies much more year to year than the number of births and deaths. Immigration has fueled U.S. population growth this decade because of an aging population and fertility lower than the replacement rate, with the number of deaths expected to start exceeding the number of births in about five years. The U.S. Census Bureau said that immigration increased by 2.8 million people in 2024 over the previous year.

Since Trump returned to office in January 2025, though, demographers and economists have struggled to decipher the impact of his policies on immigrant growth in the United States.

The bureau’s population estimates for last year have not been released yet, but the Current Population Survey estimated that the number of adult immigrants fell by 1.8 million people from January to November 2025. But those numbers have come under scrutiny, with some experts claiming they may reflect a decline in participation by immigrants in the survey rather than a dramatic drop in immigrant numbers.

Last September, the CBO reduced its immigration estimate for 2025 by 1.6 million people, and Pew last year estimated that the number of immigrants dropped by 1.4 million people in the first half of 2025, from a high of 53.3 million immigrants in January 2025.

“These immigrants bring both themselves and the potential for children in the near term,” Kenneth Johnson, a senior demographer at the University of New Hampshire, said in an email. “They contribute both to the labor force through their arrival but also to the potential future growth of the US population through their potential to have children in the near term.”

Julie BosmanMitch Smith and

State and local officials demanded an end to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota after a federal officer shot and killed a 37-year-old woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday.

Details remained in dispute, with President Trump saying the agents had acted in self-defense on social media, while state and local officials described federal accounts of the shooting with terms like “propaganda” and “garbage.”

Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman, said in a statement that an agent had opened fire after a woman “weaponized her vehicle” in an attempt to kill federal officers, while the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, described the incident as “an act of domestic terrorism.”

Mayor Jacob Frey called that account “bullshit,” describing the shooting instead as “an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.” Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota posted on social media, “Don’t believe this propaganda machine.”

In an afternoon news conference, the governor said the shooting was predictable. “We have been warning for weeks that the Trump administration’s dangerous, sensationalized operations are a threat to our public safety,” Mr. Walz said, adding that it cost a person her life on Wednesday.

He directly addressed the president and Ms. Noem, telling them, “You’ve done enough.”

Here’s what we’re covering:

What videos show: Three videos of the shooting posted on social media and verified by The New York Times show two federal agents trying to get a woman to exit a vehicle that is partially blocking a street. The driver reverses, then pulls forward and begins to turn. A third agent pulls out a gun and fires a shot, then continues firing as the vehicle moves past him. Read more ›

Victim unidentified: City officials have not named the woman who was killed, though Mayor Frey cited her age. Representative Ilhan Omar, a Democrat whose congressional district includes the shooting scene, described the person as a “legal observer.” The Minneapolis police chief, Brian O’Hara, said there was “nothing to indicate that this woman was the target of any law enforcement investigation or activity.”

Calls for calm: Governor Walz asked for people to protest peacefully as about a thousand people gathered at the scene, chanting for immigration agents to leave and throwing snowballs at the police. Mr. Walz said the state’s National Guard troops were prepared to deploy if protests got out of hand. The shooting was about a mile from where George Floyd was killed by the police in 2020. Read more ›

Federal crackdown: About 2,000 federal agents were expected to take part in the immigration enforcement operation, which could last for weeks, according to the Trump administration. Federal officials have framed the crackdown as a response to illegal immigration and widespread fraud in state social service systems. Read more ›

Other shootings: Federal agents enforcing immigration laws have been involved in several shootings in recent months, including in the Chicago and Los Angeles areas. At least 10 such shootings have been reported by news outlets since President Trump returned to office.

Video reporter

Videos circulating on social media and verified by The New York Times show the shooting of a woman by a federal agent in Minneapolis on Wednesday, as well as the moments immediately before and after.

A maroon Honda Pilot is stopped on Portland Avenue, apparently blocking one lane of the snowy residential street. The driver rolls forward slightly, then stops and waves at approaching vehicles, signaling that they should drive past.

The videos show the driver wave one vehicle by. When a truck with flashing lights approaches, she waves again, but the truck stops and federal agents emerge.

Two step out and move toward the driver’s side. The agents tell the driver to get out.

One of the agents tries to open the driver’s side door and reaches through the window. A third agent crosses in front of the Honda, as the driver begins to reverse, turning to drive away from the agents.

Immediately after the Honda shifts from reverse into drive and begins to move ahead, that agent at the front of the vehicle, standing near the driver’s side headlight, pulls out a gun and aims at the driver.

The Honda moves forward, turning to the right. The agent aiming the gun fires, and continues to shoot as the vehicle moves past him.

The Honda accelerates, colliding with two parked vehicles and a light post. The agent who fired approaches the vehicle, then walks away and tells other agents to call 911.

The Minneapolis neighborhood where federal immigration officers fatally shot a woman on Wednesday is less than a mile from where George Floyd was killed by the police in 2020.

The death of Mr. Floyd, on May 25, 2020, threw the community and the nation into a period of unrest, with widespread calls to view policing differently.

On Wednesday, hundreds were gathering once again, just blocks away from the site of Mr. Floyd’s killing, to protest the presence of the federal agents who shot and killed a 37-year-old woman in her car.

The tree-lined, mostly residential neighborhoods surrounding the scene are some of the most diverse in the city, with fairly large Hispanic and Black populations.

“We’re a really connected area, a community-centric neighborhood,” said Alex Stillman, 37, who lives near where the shooting took place and was inside when it happened. “Most people know each other or know how to get in contact with each other.”

For decades, the community has been home to working-class activists with far-left political leanings. Locals often brag that the biggest day of the year there is the May Day parade celebrating laborers.

Several years ago, a large homeless encampment sprawled across Powderhorn Park, a large park several blocks from Wednesday’s shooting. It has since been mostly cleared out by city and park officials. But both the encampment and heightened attention after Mr. Floyd’s death brought increased car traffic and crime into the neighborhood.

Federal agents have been stationed in Minneapolis since December and ramped up their presence this month, leading to clashes with immigration rights activists across the city.

Mitch Smith and

Local officials in Minneapolis called on federal forces to leave the city in a news conference on Wednesday afternoon after tensions flared when a woman was fatally shot during a confrontation with immigration agents.

Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, punctuated his call for Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to get “out of Minneapolis” with an expletive, adding that the presence of the agents was sowing chaos in the city.

“People are being hurt,” he said. “Families are being ripped apart.”

Mr. Frey also urged residents to stay calm. He said that the Trump administration wanted to provoke a response that would justify a more forceful federal intervention and he called on residents to “show them something far more beautiful than the kind of division that they’re trying to stoke.”

Elliott Payne, the president of the Minneapolis City Council, also condemned the presence of ICE in Minneapolis during an interview from the scene.

“They’re an escalating factor, he said. “We need them out of our city.”

Homeland Security officials said the shooting happened during an immigration enforcement operation as agents were being confronted by protesters.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement that the woman who was shot had “weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them.” She added that the ICE agent had feared for his life and fired the shots defensively.

But Mr. Frey said he had viewed video footage of the shooting and he maintained that the version of events put out by DHS was incorrect.

Federal officials have defended the overall crackdown in Minneapolis as a necessary response to illegal immigration and widespread fraud in state social service systems.

Last year, the Trump administration launched several aggressive immigration enforcement operations in Democratic cities, where protesters have confronted agents that have sometimes led to violent clashes.

Stephen Miller, the deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security adviser under President Trump’s administration simply described the incident on social media as “domestic terrorism.”

The attorney general of Minnesota, Keith Ellison, said on social media that there were a lot of unknowns surrounding the shooting. But he said that President Trump’s decision to send armed ICE agents to the state is “spreading terror throughout our communities.”

Avelo Airlines is ending its deportation flights on Jan. 27 after months of harsh criticism and protests. The news comes after Delaware lawmakers recently introduced legislation that would strip state incentives from companies that support the massive nationwide immigration deportation efforts under President Donald Trump’s administration.

Delaware Stop Avelo Coalition has gathered at the Wilmington Airport since May to pressure the budget airline to drop the deportation flights. Activists in other states have also staged protests against the airline’s cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement efforts across the country.

Avelo Communications Manager Courtney Goff said in a statement the company will end its participation in the nationwide Department of Homeland Security program and close its Arizona hub.

“The program provided short-term benefits, but ultimately did not deliver enough consistent and predictable revenue to overcome its operational complexity and costs,” she said.

Caritas Kerby, co-organizer of the Delaware Stop Avelo Coalition, said she believes the activism across the country led to Avelo’s decision to end its role in the controversial flights.

“I firmly believe that Avelo is folding due to the pressure campaigns all over the country,” she said. “It’s been months and months and months of hard work, late nights, meetings, coordination of a bunch of different organizations, and it’s feeling like a really big win.”

Goff denies that Avelo had a contract with the federal government to provide deportation flights, in spite of the company confirming to several media outlets in April that it agreed to provide ICE with flights to support “deportation efforts.”

“We realize this is a sensitive and complicated topic,” Andrew Levy, Avelo Airlines founder and CEO, said in a statement published by Houston Public Media in April. “After significant deliberations, we determined this charter flying will provide us with the stability to continue expanding our core scheduled passenger service and keep our more than 1,100 crewmembers employed for years to come.”

Goff told WHYY News that Avelo was a subcontractor of CSI Aviation, which is currently the prime contractor for ICE deportation flights. According to the official tracker of federal government spending, CSI Aviation to date has been paid more than $560 million for ICE deportation flights.

Data from Human Rights First, a nonprofit group that tracks ICE flights, shows Avelo did fly deportation flights. The group’s report said the Trump administration conducted at least 11,192 ICE air charter flights from January through the end of November 2025, with Avelo serving about 17% of all November flights.

“We did do government flying, we are not disputing that,” Goff said in an emailed statement.

Proposed bills target Avelo Airlines’ economic incentives

A pair of Delaware lawmakers filed measures last month to address Avelo’s connection to ICE. The resolution and bill are sponsored by state Sen. Ray Seigfried, D-Talleyville, and Rep. Mara Gorman, D-Newark. Gorman said her constituents have been unhappy that Avelo has been profiting from these deportation flights. While Avelo did not run those flights out of Delaware, it did in other states, with a hub in Mesa, Arizona.

Senate Concurrent Resolution 123 would urge the Delaware River and Bay Authority, which operates the Wilmington Airport, to prohibit agreements or incentives to businesses with ICE contracts that help deport individuals who have not been afforded sufficient due process protections.

Senate Bill 207 would remove a financial incentive for commercial airlines that operate ICE flights that include detainees who lack a valid judicial warrant or have not received required due process rights.

While the Senate bill’s language is broad, it would have potentially impacted Avelo’s jet fuel tax exemption and DRBA marketing incentives.

“We have every right to say how we’re going to provide financial incentives to an organization that’s violating a person’s due process,” Siegfried said.

In a statement, DRBA spokesperson James Salmon said that “while the DRBA understands and acknowledges community concerns regarding Avelo’s activities at other airports, those activities are outside the scope of the DRBA’s authority.”

DRBA could make deal with second ICE contractor

The proposed legislation could prevent or eliminate incentives on a possible lease agreement between DRBA and Daedalus Aviation Group at the Wilmington Airport.

Last month, DHS paid Virginia-based Daedalus nearly $140 million to buy six Boeing 737s to use in deportation flights. Top company officials also head a separate company that has a nearly $1 billion contract to support “self deportations.” Daedalus did not respond to a request for comment.

Gorman said the bills are needed because Delawareans should know about companies operating inside the state that may be profiting off of the deportation of people without legal documentation who have been denied due process.

“[The resolution] asks DRBA to review the existing contracts, apply greater scrutiny to future agreements involving companies that conduct ICE deportation flights,” Gorman said. “And basically says that if public money is being used, the public deserves transparency and accountability about where those dollars are going.”

Members of the Delaware Stop Avelo Coalition said they’re concerned the DRBA is trying to hide a possible deal with Daedalus Aviation because of its work helping ICE deport people who don’t have the proper documents to be in the country.

The DRBA is a bi-state government agency that owns and operates several transportation hubs across New Jersey and Delaware. It is run by a board of commissioners appointed by each state’s governor and is funded by tolls, user fees, ticket sales and retail transactions.

Rebekah Rodriguez, a member of the coalition, said she supports the lawmakers’ efforts.

“We think the legislation is important to increase transparency, to try to make sure that there’s no private profit off of the illegal deportations of our neighbors, and make sure that our institutions and representatives are being accountable,” she said.

DRBA pulls Daedalus agenda item after public scrutiny, revises agenda

The Delaware River and Bay Authority was expected to consider the Daedalus Aviation lease agreement at its Dec. 16 meeting.

Rodriguez said some activists showed up to the meeting to voice their concerns after seeing the lease agreement item on the agenda. She said the board quickly pulled it once the meeting started.

“Our community members showed up at that meeting and it was local clergy, parents and wage workers in our community,” she said. “When the DRBA saw us there, even though they are a public entity and they are answerable to the people of Delaware, they abruptly just took that resolution off and went into an executive session.”

WHYY News obtained the agenda that lists the lease agreement item from members of the Delaware Stop Avelo Coalition. That agenda is no longer on the economic development agency’s website.

DRBA posted a revised agenda where the resolution number of the lease agreement now discusses employee retirement plans. Salmon did not respond to follow up questions from WHYY News.",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/avelo_airlines_plane.png,N,,2026-01-07 21:57:14.402263

Rubio told reporters that he described a threefold process to lawmakers on Venezuela that revolved around oil: first, stabilization of the country; next, finding access for companies to the Venezuelan market; and the final phase, “one of transition”.

“We are going to take between 30 and 50m barrels of oil,” Rubio said. “We’re going to sell it in the marketplace at market rates, not at the discounts Venezuela was getting.”

Oil aside, the operation has split Washington along predictable lines. Republicans have rallied behind Trump’s characterization of the raid as a straightforward law enforcement action to arrest an indicted drug trafficker. Democrats warn of an illegal act of war that could plunge Venezuela into chaos and set a dangerous precedent for unilateral presidential action.

“What we did is we took out an illegitimate president,” the Republican senator Markwayne Mullin said after the briefing. “He was never duly elected, so there can’t be regime change if he should have never been put in place to begin with.”

On early Saturday morning, special operations forces struck multiple targets across northern Venezuela, captured Maduro and Flores from their home, ferried them to the USS Iwo Jima, flew them to the Stewart air national guard base, then delivered them to New York. Days later, Maduro stood in federal court pleading not guilty to “narco-terrorism” conspiracy, cocaine importation and weapons charges stemming from a 2020 indictment.

Senator Chris Murphy was incredulous coming out of the confidential briefing, telling reporters the Trump administration is “going to take the oil by force, by force”.

“This is an insane plan,” Murphy said. “They are talking about stealing Venezuelan oil at gunpoint for a period of time, undefined as leverage to micromanage the country.” He added that he “heard no detailed plan” on Venezuela’s stability.

Across Capitol Hill after the follow-up briefing to the House, Democrats were similarly taken aback by the brazenness of the president’s campaign to cut out Venezuela’s dictatorship without consulting Congress. New York congressman Gregory Meeks said it was all the more reason to look at another war powers resolution.

“You better believe they would have a different position if this was Joe Biden,” Meeks said about the Republicans. “We’re being treated like the Duma in Russia, where Vladimir Putin does not have to consult the Duma. He just does whatever the heck he wants to do. And that’s what’s happening here to the American people.”

The push reflects broader public unease about the operation. More than six in 10 Americans believe it should have required congressional approval, according to a Washington Post poll released on Sunday. A separate Reuters/Ipsos survey found roughly three-quarters express concern the US will become too involved in Venezuela. Overall public opinion mirrors the partisan split on Capitol Hill, with the Reuters poll showing about one-third approving the operation, one-third disapproving and one-third unsure.

“Across America, people are just saying: what the hell is going on?” the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said. “We need answers as to how long this is going to last. We need answers to how many troops, how much money, are there guardrails, things we don’t do, and a number of things that we had talked about were very troubling.”

But the question on what happens next in Venezuela is still unclear. Trump has said the US would “run” the country for an unspecified period and has allowed the country’s vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, a handpicked and supposed Maduro loyalist, to remain in a leadership role for now.

“The reality is the entire Maduro apparatus is still intact, and we know every other regime, if nothing else, it’s about self-preservation,” the Democratic senator from Vermont Peter Welch said. “So what you have here is a situation where everyone is in great admiration of the capacity of our military and how they did something that was extraordinarily dangerous and complicated, but there is no answer about what comes next.”

International condemnation has been swift. Brazil, Chile, China, France, Iran, Mexico, Russia and Spain have all denounced the operation. At the UN security council on Sunday, Russian and Chinese representatives demanded Maduro’s immediate release while the US defended the action as targeted law enforcement.

Republican lawmakers and US officials are also narrowing their sights toward Greenland, in the name of national security.

“The other thing I would point out, China and Russia are operating off the coast of Greenland,” the Republican senator Eric Schmitt of Missouri said. “Denmark is not capable of protecting Greenland, and so in my view, we have a very keen interest in Greenland.”

Trump has kept a naval fleet positioned off Venezuela’s coast, and this morning the US Coast Guard seized two Venezuela-linked oil tankers in separate operations, signaling the administration has no plans to ease pressure on the regime.

“Our military is prepared to continue this,” Hegseth told reporters. “The president, when he speaks, he means it. He’s not messing around. We are an administration of action to advance our interests, and that is on full display.”

Congress is poised to further balloon opens in a new tab the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) already bloated budget, expanding ICE’s sprawling detention apparatus opens in a new tab at a time of record deaths opens in a new tab in detention. It would provide billions to private contractors already profiting from the windfall of funds DHS received last summer, including for private prisons, militarized immigration policing, and surveillance companies. Over the last year, we have seen the danger of aggressive immigration policing, leading to the detention of longtime residents, children, and even U.S. citizens. Passing this bill and giving DHS more money to detain our neighbors is dangerous and may lead to irreversible harm.

Congress reportedly is nearing an agreement to fund DHS for 44,500 immigration detention beds opens in a new tab, allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to abduct and deport more people at any given day than ever before. This number is up from 41,500 beds appropriated for FY24 and would be layered on top of the beds ICE is already spending on with the unprecedented $45 billion that Congress allocated as part of the 2025 reconciliation bill. This is especially alarming given reports that ICE is planning to erect new warehouse gulags opens in a new tab for potentially over 80,000 people at a time. At Fort Bliss opens in a new tab, the nation’s largest detention site, we have already seen people exposed to brutal conditions, including sexual abuse, overcrowding, and inadequate food; we expect these warehouses to similarly be sites of humanitarian catastrophe and immense suffering.

ICE is currently detaining a record-breaking population of over 68,000 people opens in a new tab with deadly consequences—six people died in ICE custody in December 2025 alone, during the deadliest year opens in a new tab for people in detention in decades. Further, there is also nothing in this bill that prevents the administration from using this added funding to detain families, including young children, hundreds of whom have been detained for months in facilities without safe drinking water, medical care opens in a new tab, education, or access to lawyers. This is a system that needs oversight, not another windfall in funds. Passing this bill would signal Congress’ consent to this dangerous and exploding network of detention sites at the very moment that our communities need their representatives to hold ICE accountable.

This critical funding fight comes as our communities are facing persistent militarized enforcement operations by masked agents, leading to the separation of hundreds of children from their parents and caregivers opens in a new tab, and a nationwide, racial profiling opens in a new tab operation ensnaring immigrants and U.S. citizens opens in a new tab alike. This moment presents an opportunity for Congress to push back. Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee Sen. Murray released a statement opens in a new tab criticizing Senate Republicans for choosing to release a partisan bill to fund DHS and called for more accountability from President Trump’s “out-of-control DHS.” As the Appropriations Committees negotiate a bicameral conferenced version of the Homeland Security bill, we urge Congress to oppose any additional funds for ICE and use this bill to rein in the Trump administration’s reckless abuse and assault on our communities under the guise of immigration enforcement.

For working-class and poor people in developing countries, there are limited options to attaining legal status in the U.S.","For this week’s Infinite Scroll column, Brady Brickner-Wood is filling in for Kyle Chayka.

Late last year, the White House’s social-media team lauded ICE’s torrential deportation efforts with a string of memes seemingly engineered to go viral. In one video posted to Instagram, the song “all-american bitch,” by Olivia Rodrigo, provides a soundtrack to a montage of deportees being forced onto buses and planes; in another, Sabrina Carpenter’s “Juno” plays as ICE agents accost people in the streets, the lyric “Have you ever tried this one?” repeating each time a new person is detained. Another video uses the satirical song “Big Boys,” from a “Saturday Night Live” skit featuring SZA, as agents handcuff people in parking lots. A line from the song—“It’s cuffing season”—flashes in all caps across the screen. Rodrigo, Carpenter, and SZA have denounced the videos as “hateful,” “evil,” and “peak dark,” respectively. (In response to Carpenter, the White House doctored a video promoting her own “S.N.L.” appearance to make it seem as if she said she would “arrest” the cast member Marcello Hernández for being “too illegal.”) Unlike other cases of Trump using musicians’ songs, against their will, at rallies or in campaign materials—Beyoncé, Adele, and Jack White, among them—these videos are not one-off inanities or easily ignorable promotional assets. Instead, they are part of a hundred-million-dollar “wartime recruitment” effort, according to an internal document obtained by the Washington Post, aimed at hiring thousands more deportation officers in the new year, a propaganda crusade intended to portray ICE as a team of Avengers valiantly defending American soil from a malevolent foreign terror. By splicing pop songs and familiar meme formats into cruel detainment footage, ICE strains to attract a younger demographic, hoping to convince people that the agency is a vibrant—and trollishly funny—organization engaged in the noble work of putting away bad guys. Oh, the pop stars got mad? Joke’s on them. Now even more people know ICE is hiring.

The Trump Administration has pledged to deport a million immigrants each year during the President’s second term—even, it appears, if the immigrants have not committed crimes or are lawfully residing in the U.S. This past summer, as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Congress increased ICE’s budget to more than a hundred and seventy billion dollars across the next four years, netting out to an annual allocation that is more than the combined yearly budgets of all local and state law-enforcement agencies in the country. ICE has used some of this money to go on a hiring spree; the agency recently announced that it had signed up twelve thousand new officers and agents—a hundred-and-twenty-per-cent increase to its workforce.

Some of these new ICE agents may have been lured in by the ads running on national television, or by the promotional content appearing on social-media sites and streaming services. On platforms such as Hulu, HBO Max, Snapchat, Spotify, and YouTube, pre-roll and automated ads have begun popping up with alarming frequency. “Join the mission to protect America,” a narrator says, in one recent ad that appeared on Spotify. In another ad specifically targeting local law-enforcement officers in Chicago, an apocalyptic vision of America is reinforced: “You took an oath to protect and serve, to keep your family, your city, safe. But in sanctuary cities, you’re ordered to stand down while dangerous illegals walk free.” According to the internal document obtained by the Post, ICE hopes to target prospective hires through location-based marketing tactics like geofencing, a technology that allows the agency to send ads to the phones of people in specific locations, such as college campuses, gun and trade shows, military bases, and Nascar races. ICE has also allotted funds for right-wing influencers and streamers to promote hiring efforts, and flooded official Department of Homeland Security and ICE social-media feeds with memes. “Want to deport illegals with your absolute boys?” one graphic posted to X and Instagram reads; another image shows a classic car parked on a beach with the header “America After 100 Million Deportations.”

The U.S. government has, of course, never been shy about its spending on defense advertising. In 2023, the Department of Defense’s total advertising budget was $1.1 billion, with the bulk of the funds being directed to military-recruitment efforts; in 2025, the Army’s advertising budget alone surpassed a billion dollars. Still, what makes the D.H.S.’s spending on ICE advertising so disorienting is not only how the agency is being branded as another branch of the military—a domestic war organization hellbent on eradicating a rival militant force—but how it has weaponized social media and digital culture against itself, a somewhat novel strategy for a governmental department. Traditional military calls to action, sometimes combined with white-supremacist tropes, are being deployed in the many memes and A.I.-generated images that the D.H.S. and the White House post daily to TikTok, X, and Instagram, such as Uncle Sam beckoning prospective recruits to save the country, or a nineteenth-century Manifest Destiny painting captioned with the slogan “A Heritage to Be Proud Of, a Homeland Worth Defending.” Anxieties about the border are hardly new, but they have been embellished to dangerous, deranged degrees during Trump’s second term. To declare war on immigrants, many of whom are fleeing persecution and violence fomented by past American interventionism, requires a powerful, blinding narrative strong enough to smokescreen the degradation and dehumanization at the core of the messaging. “The light will defeat the dark,” Stephen Miller, Trump’s White House deputy chief of staff, declared at Charlie Kirk’s memorial service, in September. “We will prevail over the forces of wickedness and evil. They cannot imagine what they have awakened.” Protect the homeland. Remove the invaders. Destroy the aliens. The dog whistles have turned into fire alarms.

Trump’s time in office has obliterated the pretense that there’s any meaningful separation between the state and corporate interests. The decisions and forces that affect society, that dictate the livelihoods and well-being of its citizens, are at the mercy of the market, and the now frighteningly transparent ways that the market serves and benefits its dutiful governmental benefactors. Trump, conflating his politics with capitalist preponderance, has realized that to further his political and economic power, he must activate the state’s most powerful asset: the War Department. Threatening to occupy Greenland. Overthrowing the Venezuelan government and laying claim to its oil reserves. And, crucially, deploying the National Guard into U.S. cities, declaring a domestic war against a fabricated enemy: those who have altered the imagined portrait of the American pastoral.

When defenders of the Trump Administration’s immigration policies cite the possibility of legal immigration, they, too, are perpetuating the reality that market supremacy has usurped legislative processes. For working-class and poor people in developing countries, there are limited options to attaining legal status in the U.S. But if a person seeking status is already wealthy or attains corporate sponsorship, for instance, a viable pathway to citizenship opens up, even if only slightly. This prioritization of wealth is no better articulated than in the launch of Trump’s “gold card,” a literal card with Trump’s face on it that, for a million dollars, grants a foreign-born purchaser a visa and a fast track to citizenship. These are the people the Administration believes deserve entry into the country; most anyone else, apparently, is deemed an enemy of the state. ICE’s “wartime recruitment” ads also, paradoxically, prey on those who are struggling to find a way to survive within the bottlenecked economy, people for whom the stable annual salary provided by a job with ICE, and a fifty-thousand-dollar signing bonus, would surely improve their quality of life. The agency also promises a path toward meaning, a heroic call to “fulfill your mission.” The fantasy of fulfillment, the dream of belonging—something the so-called enemy is plenty familiar with. ♦","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/695d8f8fe9d1cdb554fa06a4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/NewYorker_ICEads_Final_animation_v2.png",N,,2026-01-07 16:58:45.311950

The Trump administration deported Edgar Sosa Rojas, 47, without his Venezuelan passport, his wife, Maria Stella Ferrer, told the Herald.","Amid the escalating tensions between the United States and Venezuela that resulted in the capture of strongman Nicolás Maduro, the Trump administration has been sending Venezuelan immigrants to Mexico since at least December.

The Miami Herald has spoken with Venezuelans immigrants — including a single mother with two young children and a man who had fled government authorities in Venezuela and then a guerilla group in Colombia — and their families. They say they were held in detention centers in Texas before being handed over to Mexican authorities. The Mexican government later sent them by bus to the southern city of Villahermosa, where violence and organized crime has exploded in recent years, as well as the municipality of Palenque, in the state of Chiapas near the border with Guatemala.

“Once I entered immigration detention, I lost everything,” said Omar Vergara Flores, a 36-year-old man who had just purchased a home in Austin with his wife and was planning to acquire a construction franchise.

A shelter administrator in Villahermosa, the capital city of Tabasco, told the Herald his center has received several Venezuelan men, women, and children deported from the U.S. since Caracas announced on Dec. 12 that the United States had unilaterally suspended deportation flights to Venezuela.

U.S. deportations to Venezuela are heavily influenced by the political relations between the two countries. The last U.S. flight sending immigrants to Venezuela was on Dec. 10, according to Human Rights First, an organization that tracks and analyzes deportations, though the U.S. has not publicly announced their suspension. Caracas had previously stopped accepting flights in March 2025, after the Trump administration revoked Chevron’s license to pump petroleum in Venezuela, and again later in the year over U.S. military activity in the Caribbean.

The deportations of Venezuelan detainees to Mexico appear to be part of the Trump administration’s aggressive expansion of deportations of immigrants to countries that are not their own, which the administration has negotiated with several countries. Deported and detained Venezuelans, as well as their family members, said immigration agents offered to send them to countries like Honduras, Colombia, Nicaragua and Ecuador, as well as Uganda, an East African nation with no shared language or cultural ties to Venezuela.

The Department of Homeland Security did not answer questions about how many Venezuelans it had sent to Mexico in 2025 or this year, nor under what agreements. Top Mexican immigration officials did not respond to Herald queries about how many Venezuelans U.S. authorities had sent south of the border, whether they would be able to go to the Mexican capital to access consular services, and why they were being transported to southern states with a strong presence of organized crime. The Human Rights Office within the Mexican immigration agency referred the Herald to its communications department.

In an email obtained by the Herald, an Immigration Customs and Enforcement officer told relatives of Vergara Flores that he had been sent to Mexico on Dec. 25 because “all flights to Venezuela are on hold until further notice.” The email’s timing coincided with the U.S. military ramp-up in the Caribbean that culminated in Maduro’s capture in Caracas on Saturday.

“The breaking point for us was when we requested bond [in immigration court] and it was denied, when accused rapists and murderers [in the criminal system] are granted bail,” Vergara Flores said, referring to his own case. His wife, Jennyfer Carrillo, added: “We mean nothing to them.”

Vulnerability in Mexico

July Rodriguez, who founded an organization supporting Venezuelan immigrants in Mexico, has documented at least two different waves of Venezuelans deported from the U.S. since President Donald Trump returned to the White House. The first took place in March when Maduro temporarily blocked deportation flights and the Trump administration sent over 200 Venezuelans it accused of being gang members to a notorious prison in El Salvador. In December, advocates witnessed another round of deportations to Mexico.

Mexican authorities have stopped sending deported immigrants to Tapachula, a southwestern city, “because organized crime brazenly took over the state of Chiapas, and many Mexicans have had to leave Chiapas, displaced to Guatemala,” Rodriguez told the Herald. But Villahermosa, the new destination, has experienced an explosion in violent crime in recent years.

Leaving Venezuelans in southern Mexico also makes it harder for them to obtain travel documents, since the country has only one Venezuelan consulate, located in Mexico City, a 12-hour bus ride away. There are also fewer legal resources to help deported migrants legalize their status compared to other parts of Mexico.

“The level of vulnerability Venezuelans face in Mexico is extremely serious,” Rodríguez said. “There is no clear policy that allows them to leave the country. Many choose to leave on foot or by bus through Guatemala. Others risk their lives trying to reach Mexico City, while some remain in Mexico with no support.”

‘A nightmare’

Vergara Flores was among those dropped off in the middle of the night in Villahermosa. He has a bachelor’s degree in architecture and another degree in informatics. He was building a stable life with his wife and had even purchased a home after entering the U.S. in 2022 through the Mexican border.

ICE detained him during a routine check-in appointment in June, after he had attended them without issues six other times. In detention, Vergara Flores lost weight and hair due to stress, lack of sunlight and unhealthy food, he said. Nearly seven months later, on Christmas day, he was among dozens deported to Mexico.

The couple’s new house is now on the market.

“He lived only one month in the house,” Carrillo said. “His detention shook our lives and turned it upside down. It was a nightmare that we never thought we would experience. We fought until the very end.”

Vergara Flores had been a beneficiary Temporary Protected Status until April, when the Trump administration began its efforts to strip the deportation protections of over 600,000 Venezuelans.

Carrillo realized her husband was slated for deportation when she could no longer find him in the system she used to send him money while in detention. Friends and relatives of other detainees started sharing on a WhatsApp group that their loved ones were being sent to Mexico.

Vergara Flores is currently waiting for his Venezuelan passport to arrive so he can leave Mexico. Without it, he would be forced to travel by foot or bus toward the Guatemalan border—a dangerous route where criminal groups target migrants.

“He was scared,” his wife said. “I’m still scared for him, but we are starting to see the light.”

Deportations on hold

On the U.S. side of the border, there are Venezuelan waiting for pending court hearings. But those who have already signed voluntary departure documents — often after prolonged detention that detainees, families, and advocates say has taken a toll on migrants’ physical and mental health — have no such option. Vergara Flores, desperate to get out of detention, agreed to depart voluntarily. But he believed he would be sent to Venezuela, not Mexico.

Freddy Villegas, a 31-year-old computer engineer, is among those detained who say the Trump administration offered a one-way ticket to a third country. He fled persecution from paramilitary groups in Caracas in 2021 and entered the United States later that year. He applied for asylum in August 2022, citing threats and fear of return to Venezuela. While his asylum case was still pending, he was granted TPS.

On July 1, ICE detained Villegas during a check-in appointment. He continues to fight for asylum and told the Herald that ICE officials told Venezuelans and Cubans at his detention center that it would be difficult to get their countries’ governments to take them back.

“They offered us the option to resettle in another country, such as Colombia or Mexico, but I refused,” Villegas said. He said he would rather remain in ICE custody, even though his health has suffered, than be sent to a third country or returned to Venezuela, where he fears persecution.

Villegas said he has lost 22 pounds during his detention and developed a vitiligo-like condition, which he attributes in part to prolonged confinement and limited access to sunlight. Some other Venezuelans, however, eventually became exhausted by their circumstances and agreed to be sent to Mexico.

Persecution by guerrillas

Venezuelans deported to Mexico are charting their next steps, but not having legal status there or documentation can make it difficult. The Trump administration deported Edgar Sosa Rojas, 47, without his Venezuelan passport, his wife, Maria Stella Ferrer, told the Herald. That has made leaving Mexico difficult.

Sosa Rojas first fled persecution in Venezuela in 2014, seeking refuge with his family in Colombia, where his wife was born. But safety there was short-lived. A guerrilla group kidnapped Sosa Rojas in December 2023 and later released him in Mexico, according to his wife and documents the Herald reviewed.

The Herald reviewed complaints filed with Colombian government agencies, as well as records from the Institute for Women in Migration, a Mexican organization that advocates for migrant women’s rights in Mexico and the United States.

He sought asylum in the U.S. in 2024, but authorities detained him in August and sent him to Mexico, where he was dropped off near the Guatemalan border.

He is now retracing the same dangerous route through Central America that once brought him to the United States, heading back toward the Colombia–Venezuela border, his wife said. Ferrer fears he could be kidnapped by cartels along the way, again.

“The United States was supposed to be the safest country,” his wife said. “But they deported him instead.”

O'Hara said he was ""very concerned"" with the tactics used by federal immigration agents.","An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer fatally shot a 37-year-old woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday, according to federal and local authorities. The shooting occurred less than 24 hours after the Trump administration announced a large-scale immigration crackdown was underway in Minnesota.

In a statement, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said ICE agents were met by ""rioters"" during a targeted operation. McLaughlin accused the victim of being ""one of these violent rioters"" who ""weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them.""

""An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots,"" she added.

Local authorities have raised concerns about the circumstances behind the shooting. At a fiery press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said ICE was ""trying to spin this as an action of self-defense. Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody that is bull***. ""

""This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed,"" he added.

The mayor called on ICE agents to leave the city, asserting that federal immigration authorities were ripping families apart and sowing chaos on Minneapolis streets.

At the same press conference, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said local police arrived at the scene to find a woman with a gunshot wound to the head. They performed life-saving measures at the scene, including CPR. The woman was transported to Hennepin County Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead, he added.

Preliminary information, according to O'Hara, indicates that the woman was in her vehicle and blocking the road on Portland Avenue between 33rd and 34th St.

""At some point, a federal law enforcement approached her on foot, and the vehicle began to drive off. At least two shots were fired,"" he said, adding that the car then crashed on the side of the roadway.

O'Hara said he was ""very concerned"" with the tactics used by federal immigration agents. He noted that the use of deadly force is justified at times, but that most law enforcement agencies in the U.S. are trained to minimize the risks and the need for deadly force.

""In any professional law enforcement agency in the country, I think they would tell you it's obviously very concerning whenever there's a shooting into a vehicle of someone who's not armed,"" he said.

An Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday after a group of people began blocking agents during an immigration-related operation, the Department of Homeland Security said.

ICE agents were conducting targeted operations in the city when a woman, 37, allegedly ""weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them,"" Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey pushed back on DHS’s narrative in a press conference Wednesday afternoon.

""They are already trying to spin this as an action of self defense,"" Frey said, referring to ICE. ""Having seen the video of myself, I want to tell everybody directly that is b---s---.""

Video posted to social media shows several agents approaching a burgundy SUV in the middle of the street and ordering the driver to get out. When one agent grabs the driver’s side door handle, the car reverses and then drives forward.

An agent standing near the front of the vehicle appears to draw his firearm and fire three shots at it, the video shows. The vehicle then crashes into a parked car and hits a light pole.

Frey said after the shooting the first priority of local law enforcement was to get the victim to the hospital, and the second was to get ICE off the scene because they were ""making a difficult situation more problematic.""

""What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust. They are ripping families apart, sowing chaos in the streets and, in this case, quite literally killing people,"" he said. ""This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.""

Frey had a message for federal immigration agents in the city.

""To ICE, get the f--- out of Minneapolis,"" the mayor said. ""We do not want you here. Your stated reason for being in this city is to create some sort of safety and you are doing the opposite.""

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said at a press conference that the agents' vehicles got stuck in the snow and they were trying to push them out when the woman ""attacked them.""

""It was an act of domestic terrorism,"" she said.

The agent fired what McLaughlin said were ""defensive shots"" and killed the woman.

""He used his training and saved his own life and that of his fellow officers,"" she said.

Frey said it did not appear from video of the incident that the vehicle was being weaponized against the agent.

""This woman was in her car and it appears then blocking the street because of the presence of federal law enforcement, which is obviously something that has been happening not just in Minneapolis but around the country,"" Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said at the mayor's news conference.

Aidan Perzana, 31, said he witnessed the incident and it didn't look like the woman was trying to run over an agent.

""I heard that Noem is trying to say they were trying to run down an officer. There was plenty of space between the officers at that point for the vehicle to make it through,"" he told NBC News, adding that it looked like the driver was trying to flee.

Aidan’s wife Grace Perzana, 32, said the family has lived in the neighborhood two and a half years and ""we love it.""

""We are really happy here. We have a giant shark statue in our front yard and our neighbor has a giant T-Rex statue,"" she said. ""There is a lot of community art, a lot of people having barbecues with music in their backyards.""

Residents and locals gathered in the street after the shooting, chanting and throwing snowballs in the direction of federal agents, KARE reported. Law enforcement deployed pepper spray and tear gas.

McLaughlin said the ICE officers injured during the incident are expected to make a full recovery. She did not detail what type of injuries the agents sustained.

DHS increasing presence in Minneapolis

President Donald Trump has unleashed immigration agents in cities across America, who have been employing increasingly aggressive tactics. The push has ramped up tensions with local officials in some cities and communities that are increasingly protesting the efforts.

In September, in the Chicago area, an ICE agent fatally shot a man during a traffic stop. His family called for justice and local police said the FBI had been investigating the death.

Since arriving in Minneapolis in early December, ICE officers and agents have arrested roughly 1,400 people, McLaughlin previously said.

That is a significant increase from the roughly 300 arrested by Dec. 12, making it a much larger operation than some of the Border Patrol surge operations in cities such as Charlotte, North Carolina, and New Orleans.

McLaughlin also said Border Patrol agents just arrived in Minneapolis and will begin operations there Wednesday.

DHS this week sent hundreds more officers and agents to bolster immigration enforcement in Minneapolis, with the agency posting on social media that it is waging “the largest DHS operation ever” in Minnesota.

The immigration enforcement operation will add up to 2,100 officers, according to two senior DHS officials. The administration began swelling the numbers Sunday and planned to continue adding forces Wednesday, the officials said. That total includes 1,500 enforcement and removal officers and 600 Homeland Security Investigations agents.

Arrests in Minneapolis could increase with the added boots on the ground.

The rush of more enforcement follows the posting of a video by a conservative content creator the day after Christmas that alleged Somali-run day care centers in Minneapolis were defrauding American taxpayers by taking federal grant money and not providing any services to children.

The FBI surged investigators in the city to look into the allegations soon after the video was posted, HSI has been door-knocking on Somali businesses since last week and the state of Minnesota concluded from its on-site checks of 10 Somali day care centers targeted in the video that they were operating normally, with children at every site except one, which was not yet open to investigators when they arrived to investigate.

Grace Perzana said she did not believe there were many people of Somali descent on the street where Wednesday's shooting happened, but said she does have many “Latinx” neighbors.

Many Minnesota residents of Somali descent, including those who are American citizens, have been staying indoors or have reduced activity outside, fearful of being snagged in the stepped-up enforcement now in its second month.",https://ktvz.b-cdn.net/2025/08/Breaking-News-2.png,N,,2026-01-07 17:59:06.490653

""We collectively are going to do everything possible to get to the bottom of this, to get justice, and make sure there is an investigation that is conducted in full,"" he said.

Frey blamed Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials for escalating the situation in the city.

""We dreaded this moment since the early stages of this ICE presence in Minneapolis,"" he said. ""Not only is this a concern we've had internally, but we've been talking about it. They are not here to cause safety in this city. What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust.

DHS says driver was trying to ram agents

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that an ICE agent fatally shot a person in a vehicle, claiming that the person was trying to ram agents.

The agency's full statement can be read below:

Today, ICE officers in Minneapolis were conducting targeted operations when rioters began blocking ICE officers and one of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them—an act of domestic terrorism.

An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots.

He used his training and saved his own life and that of his fellow officers.

The alleged perpetrator was hit and is deceased. Thankfully, the ICE officers who were hurt are expected to make full recoveries.

This is the direct consequence of constant attacks and demonization of our officers by sanctuary politicians who fuel and encourage rampant assaults on our law enforcement who are facing 1,300% increase in assaults against them and an 8,000% increase in death threats.

This is an evolving situation, and we will give the public more information as soon as it becomes available.”

Videos circulating online show moments before and after the shooting

Videos, appearing to show the moments leading up to and after an ICE agent shot a driver, began circulating on social media Wednesday afternoon.

In the videos, a red Honda Pilot is seen idling, blocking the roadway with the driver's side window down. ICE agents approach in a truck, step out and approach the vehicle, telling the driver to get out using an expletive. One of the agents begins pulling on the handle of the SUV. The driver appears to slowly back, turn to the right and move forward before accelerating. As the driver begins accelerating, at least two gunshots can be heard.

The car continues accelerating for a moment before crashing into a parked car a short way down the street.

ICE agents were near the front driver’s side fender when the driver attempted to accelerate away.

Frey said at the Wednesday press conference that he had viewed the video and said it did not appear the driver was trying to hit ICE agents.

""The narrative that this was just done in self-defense is a garbage narrative,"" Frey said. ""It is not true.""

City officials said there was no indication the woman who was shot was the target of any law enforcement activity.

Leaders, Minnesota residents respond to ICE shooting

At a separate press conference later Wednesday, Gov. Tim Walz said the state was prepared for protests he expects to take place in the coming days, and urged Minnesotans to ""not take the bait"" from the Trump administration to engage in violence.

""If you protest, and express your First Amendment rights, please do so peacefully as you always do,"" Walz said. ""We can't give them what they want. The hearts and minds of the people in this state are on our side. To Americans, I ask you this: Please stand with Minneapolis. To Minnesotans, know that our administration is going to stop at nothing to seek accountability and justice.""

The governor, who announced a day earlier that he would not be seeking reelection, said he was afraid the federal government's actions would lead to escalation.

""We've been warning for weeks that the Trump administration's dangerous sensationalized operations are a threat to our public safety; that someone was going to get hurt,"" Walz said. ""Just yesterday, I said exactly that. What we're seeing is a consequence of governance designed to generate fear, headlines and conflict. It's governing by reality TV. And today that recklessness caused someone their life.""

Reporters in the area saw more than 100 federal agents descend on the scene near 34th Street and Portland Avenue after the shooting was reported at around 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday.

According to KARE11 reporters at the scene, a crashed car at the intersection had a bullet hole in the front windshield on the driver's side. Two other cars have wreckage damage. Near the scene, protesters began chanting anti-ICE slogans.

A tense interaction nearby saw protesters throwing snowballs at federal officials. The immigration officials responded with pepper spray and paintballs, which are considered non-lethal crowd control devices.

The incident happened during what the Department of Homeland Security called its ""largest immigration operation ever."" An estimated six hundred agents and investigators are examining alleged fraud in the state.

State Senator Omar Fateh said in a social media post that he's received reports that a doctor at the scene was denied the ability to provide lifesaving CPR by federal law enforcement. In a press conference, Frey said he could not verify this witness account.

A witness showed KARE reporters what appeared to be video of responders attempting to resuscitate someone.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara previously said his department does not enforce immigration laws, according to KARE 11. On Tuesday, he said he appointed a designated supervisor and placed additional officers on standby around the clock due to concerns of potential unrest.

“Every day for the last several weeks has been a challenge,” O’Hara said, adding that his greatest concern is the potential for unrest or a tragedy in which someone could be seriously hurt or killed. He asked protesters to remain peaceful and urged federal agents to conduct their work “professionally and lawfully.”

According to DHS, agents have arrested more than 1,000 people in Minnesota, including 150 in Minneapolis on Monday.

In a statement on his Truth Social platform, President Donald Trump said he had seen at least one of the videos showing the Minneapolis shooting.

""I have just viewed the clip of the event which took place in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is a horrible thing to watch,"" he wrote. ""The woman screaming was, obviously, a professional agitator, and the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self-defense. Based on the attached clip, it is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital.""

The president said he blamed the incident, and others like it over the past several months, on left-leaning protesters interfering with ICE operations.

""The situation is being studied, in its entirety, but the reason these incidents are happening is because the Radical Left is threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis,"" Trump wrote. ""They are just trying to do the job of MAKING AMERICA SAFE. We need to stand by and protect our Law Enforcement Officers from this Radical Left Movement of Violence and Hate!""",https://media.khou.com/assets/CCT/images/ae8e45e7-b89f-4826-bc06-33590809ddf9/20260107T172437/ae8e45e7-b89f-4826-bc06-33590809ddf9_1140x641.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 16:58:56.227949

Congressional forecasters have lowered their projection of population growth over the next decade by 7 million people, in response to the Trump administration's immigration crackdown as well as falling birth rates.

The U.S. population is now projected to grow from 349 million this year to 357 million in 2035, according to a forecast released Wednesday by the Congressional Budget Office.

That's slower growth than CBO was predicting a year ago. The biggest reason for the downshift is the administration's aggressive effort to cut down on illegal immigration. The U.S. also admitted fewer foreign students in 2025, although the number of authorized green card holders is expected to increase over the next decade.

In addition to slowing immigration, people in the U.S. are having fewer children, which is also putting the brakes on population growth. By 2030, the CBO estimates there will be fewer babies born in the U.S. each year than there are deaths. Absent immigration, the population would begin to shrink at that point.

Immigration also helps to boost birth rates, since foreign-born women have more children, on average, than women born in the U.S.

The demographic outlook helps to shape CBO's annual economic forecast, which will be released next month.

Analysts caution that the long-run forecasts of births, deaths and immigration are uncertain and small changes in any of those factors could significantly change the population over time.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3696x2079+0+193/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc1%2Fbf%2F78c58a9841d882cfc881f35bf44f%2Fgettyimages-2249757777.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 15:57:44.762609

Associated Press

WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday that it launched what it described as the largest immigration enforcement operation ever carried out by the agency — with 2,000 federal agents and officers expected in the Minneapolis area for a crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

“The largest DHS operation ever is happening right now in Minnesota,” the department said in a post on X, expanding the federal law enforcement footprint in the state amid heightened political and community tensions.

The government planned to send about 2,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and officers to Minnesota, according to a U.S. official and a person briefed on the matter. The agents are expected to be dispatched in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, the person said. The people were not authorized to publicly discuss operational details and spoke with The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.

Immigrant rights groups and elected officials in the Twin Cities reported a sharp increase Tuesday in sightings of federal agents, notably around St. Paul. Numerous agents’ vehicles were reported making traffic stops, outside area businesses and apartment buildings.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was also present and accompanied U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers during at least one arrest. A video posted on X showed Noem wearing a tactical vest and knit cap as agents arrested a man in St. Paul. In the video, she tells the handcuffed man: “You will be held accountable for your crimes.”

DHS said in a news release that the man was from Ecuador and was wanted in his homeland and Connecticut on charges including murder and sexual assault. It said agents arrested 150 people Monday in enforcement actions in Minneapolis.

Minnesota governor blasts surge

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, criticized the federal enforcement surge as “a war that’s being waged against Minnesota.”

“You’re seeing that we have a ridiculous surge of apparently 2,000 people not coordinating with us, that are for a show of cameras,” Walz told reporters in Minneapolis on Tuesday, a day after announcing he was ending his campaign for a third term.

The Trump administration has singled out the area’s Somali community, the largest in the U.S. Last month, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara criticized federal agents for using “questionable methods” following a confrontation between agents and protesters.

Julia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said there had been an increase in sightings of federal agents and enforcement vehicles in locations like parking lots.

Surge includes investigators focused on fraud allegations

Roughly three-quarters of the enforcement personnel are expected to come from ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, which carries out immigration arrests and deportations, said the person with knowledge of the operation. The force also includes agents from Homeland Security Investigations, ICE’s investigative arm, which typically focuses on fraud and cross-border criminal networks.

HSI agents were going door-to-door in the Twin Cities area investigating allegations of fraud, human smuggling and unlawful employment practices, Lyons said.

The HSI agents are largely expected to concentrate on identifying suspected fraud, while deportation officers will conduct arrests of immigrants accused of violating immigration law, according to the person briefed on the operation. Specialized tactical units are also expected to be involved.

The operation also includes personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, the person familiar with the deployment said.

Hilton drops Minnesota hotel that canceled agents’ reservations

Hilton said in a statement Tuesday that it was removing a Minnesota hotel from its systems for “not meeting our standards and values” when it denied service to federal agents.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville hotel, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) outside Minneapolis, apologized Monday for canceling the reservations of federal agents, saying it would work to accommodate them. The hotel, like the majority of Hampton Inns, is owned and operated by a franchisee.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville did not respond to requests for comment.

Federal authorities began increasing immigration arrests in the Minneapolis area late last year. Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel announced last week that federal agencies were intensifying operations in Minnesota, with an emphasis on fraud investigations.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly linked his administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota to fraud cases involving federal nutrition and pandemic aid programs, many of which have involved defendants with roots in Somalia.

The person with information about the current operation cautioned that its scope and duration could shift in the coming days as it develops.

Jon Collins, a reporter for MPR News, posted to Bluesky that protesters stopped ICE agents after the shooting and were pepper sprayed.","Federal agents shot and killed a woman during a large-scale immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis on Wednesday.

Ilhan Omar, the Democratic Minnesota congresswoman, said the victim was “a legal observer” of action by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which had sent a surge of agents into the city in recent days tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

A witness to the incident, Emily Heller, told local media that the victim was shot in the face multiple times. Heller said she saw a car blocking traffic that appeared to be part of a protest against the ICE operation, and heard an agent telling the driver, a woman, to “get out of here”.

“She was trying to turn around, and the ICE agent was in front of her car, and he pulled out a gun and put it right in – like his midriff was on her bumper – and he reached across the hood of the car and shot her in the face like three, four times,” Heller told MPR News, a Minneapolis public radio station.

A video posted to social media and another video obtained by the Guardian appeared to capture the moment of the shooting as a dark red SUV drove away from agents moving toward it, although the front of the vehicle is obscured.

In a post to X, the homeland security department (DHS) insisted the person was a “domestic terrorist” who “weaponized her vehicle” and attempted “to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them”.

The department claimed several ICE officers were hurt, but said that they were expected to make “full recoveries”.

“An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots. He used his training and saved his own life and that of his fellow officers,” the DHS post said.

The videos mentioned above appear to contradict that statement, as it shows the SUV clearly backing up away from ICE officers as they approach. There is one ICE officer that can be seen partially in front of the car as the car moves forward and then away from the officers. That same ICE officer is seen firing his gun as the car appears to drive by him. Three gunshots can be heard ringing out.

There is no visible sign in the videos of ICE officers being injured. The agent who appeared to have fired the fatal shots is seen returning to a silver SUV that was driven away from the scene shortly after – through a red traffic light.

In a press conference, Jacob Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis, emphasized that the priority of local law enforcement was to get the victim to the hospital, and then to remove ICE from the scene because they were “making a difficult situation more problematic”.

He also noted that the video footage does not appear to show that a vehicle was being weaponized against the ICE officer.

Frey even issued an emphatic statement to ICE directly: “I do have a message for our community for our city and I do have a message for ICE. To ICE, get the fuck out of Minneapolis. We do not want you here. Your stated reason for being in this city is to create some kind of safety and you are doing exactly the opposite.

“People are being hurt. Families are being ripped apart. Longterm Minneapolis residents that have contributed so greatly to our city, to our culture, to our economy are being terrorized and now, somebody is dead.

Contining to address ICE, Frey said: “That’s on you. It’s also on you to leave. It’s on you to make sure that further damage, further loss of life and injury, is not done.”

The mayor also said the DHS was “trying to spin this as an action of self defense. Having seen the video myself, I wanna tell everybody directly, that is bullshit.”

Minneapolis chief of police, Brian O’Hara, told the press conference: “This woman was in her car and it appears then blocking the street because of the presence of federal law enforcement, which is obviously something that has been happening not just in Minneapolis but around the country.”

He said the victim was “a middle-aged white woman”, and that there was nothing to suggest she was the target of any law enforcement investigation or activity. Earlier, Frey said she was 37 years old.

The woman was no longer in the car when he arrived on the scene, O’Hara said, adding that “a spouse” had since arrived at the hospital. The police chief said the FBI would conduct a joint investigation with the Minnesota bureau of criminal apprehension.

Echoing Frey, Tim Walz, the Democratic Minnesota governor, posted on X that he had “seen the video. Don’t believe this propaganda machine. The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.”

Omar also rejected claims made by DHS on X in a Wednesday afternoon post: “You’re lying. There was no attempt to run the officer over and no ICE agents appear to be hurt. Get out of our city.”

Peggy Flanagan, Minnesota’s Democratic lieutenant governor, issued a statement saying: “ICE has committed an unspeakable act of violence today.

“These masked agents are out of control and creating real chaos in our state. ICE must leave Minnesota immediately – before more people are hurt. In the face of their violence, let us remain peaceful, calm, and united. Minnesotans will not allow Trump and his thugs to turn our communities into war zones.”

Large numbers of protesters gathered close to the scene in the south of the city shortly after the shooting, with law enforcement officers firing chemical irritants in an attempt to disperse them.

In various video footage, bystanders can been seen and heard blowing whistles and taunting the federal agents, telling them to go home. A woman said she spoke to an eyewitness who told her the person shot was a woman who “took off” from federal agents.

“They shot her through the windshield. They shot her in the face,” the woman said.

Jon Collins, a reporter for MPR News, posted to Bluesky that protesters stopped ICE agents after the shooting and were pepper sprayed.

“ICE teargassed a lot of people as they drove down the alley. People were stuck in alley and hit hard. Some people are still getting medical treatment,” he wrote.

The Department of Homeland Security said on Tuesday it had launched an extraordinary immigration enforcement operation, with 2,000 agents and officers expected in the Minneapolis and St Paul area for a crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

The Immigration Defense Network, a coalition of groups serving immigrants in Minnesota, held a training session Tuesday night for about 100 people who are willing to hit the streets to monitor the federal enforcement.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb9dc2e3567ce6166845974d69d43e6757e7e825/584_0_2916_2333/master/2916.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=153bbc629ee1befde1ffcc472a0c98d5",N,,2026-01-07 15:57:58.602676

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security confirmed the death on X and in a statement to Sahan Journal about 11:45 a.m.

Mayor Jacob Frey said at a news conference later in the day that the woman was 37, and noted that ICE had claimed self-defense in shooting her.

“Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everyone directly. That is [expletive],” said Frey, who demanded that ICE leave Minnesota.

Witness Caitlin Callenson shared a video with Sahan Journal that appears to show federal agents walking up to the door of a maroon SUV stopped in the middle of the street. In the video, a federal officer pulls on the SUV’s door handle, and when the driver tries to pull away from the agents, a second federal officer fires shots into the vehicle. The vehicle moves forward briefly and crashes into a curb and another vehicle.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said at the news conference that the FBI and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension are investigating the shooting.

The city of Minneapolis issued a statement at 10:26 a.m. Wednesday asking residents to stay away from the scene of the shooting at E. 34th Street and Portland Avenue in south Minneapolis. U.S. Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino was present at the scene.

Gov. Tim Walz said on social media that his public safety team was “working to gather information on an ICE related shooting this morning” and asked the public to remain calm. Sen. Tina Smith said on social media that the shooting victim was a U.S. citizen. “ICE should leave now for everyone’s safety,” she wrote.

Eyewitness accounts

Tyrice Jones told Sahan Journal he heard gunshots followed by a crash outside his building at 34th street and Portland Avenue Wednesday morning.

Jones came outside and saw a woman in a maroon SUV bleeding from what he believed was a gunshot wound.

Tyrice Jones told Sahan Journal he heard gunshots followed by a crash outside his building at 34th street and Portland Avenue Wednesday morning.

Jones came outside and saw a woman in a maroon SUV bleeding from what he believed was a gunshot wound.

“They weren’t trying to do [expletive] for her. Nothing,” Jones said. “She was just there, lifeless.”

There were ICE agents around the car, Jones said, adding that a woman who appeared to know the victim was crying in front of an apartment building asking for a doctor.

Alex Weekes told Sahan Journal he woke up around 8:30 a.m. when he heard a car honking outside his house. Weekes looked out his window and saw a red SUV parked in the street blocking other vehicles from moving along the roadway. He said he saw federal agents step out of their vehicle and approach the SUV, and then heard gunshots.

“The [person] in the SUV tried driving away from them when they did that,” he said of the agents approaching the SUV. “There was one (federal agent) near the front corner of the car, and they shot [the driver] three times.

“I was just thinking, ‘Damn, did ICE just really shoot a [expletive] guy outside my house?’ I mean you never think that’s gonna happen literally across the street.

Trevor Heitkamp lives a block away from the from the scene and said he witnessed the shooting. He left his house for a cigarette shortly before 9:45 a.m., heard a commotion, walked down the street and started recording.

The woman appeared to be trying to turn her vehicle around, Heitkamp told Sahan Journal. He said she was going no more than 5 miles an hour and was receiving direction from multiple federal agents. Heitkamp heard several people shout, “No,” and then heard multiple gun shots.

The woman’s car rolled forward and crashed, and less than a minute later a passenger exited covered in blood, he said. The two people in the car appeared to be white women, he said.

A man who also witnessed the shooting shouted at ICE that he was a doctor and asked to perform first-aid, Heitkamp said.

“The ICE agents told him to back up and stay on the sidewalk,” Heitkamp said.

He heard ICE agents call out, “No pulse.” About two minutes later, EMS crews arrived, administered CPR and carried the victim to an ambulance.

“It didn’t need to happen,” Heitkamp said. “And I don’t think the government has the right to kill its citizens for inconveniencing them.”

Liliana Zaragoza, an associate professor of law at the University of Minnesota was in the area at the time of the incident and shared her account with Sahan Journal: First responders were seen performing CPR on a person on the sidewalk. The person was undressed, and had blood in their hair and face. Minneapolis police officials were present at the scene who told Zaragoza it was a “crime scene.”

“That person looked lifeless from the moment I saw them,” Zaragoza said.

Sahan photojournalist Aaron Nesheim was at the scene as events unfolded. He reported seeing a car that had crashed, with a lone woman in the driver’s seat. The airbag was deployed and covered in blood.

Twenty to 30 ICE agents were on the scene around 9:50 a.m., and a crowd had started to gather.

The woman was slumped over the airbag. Minneapolis firefighters pulled her out of the car and moved her down the street to 34th Street and Portland Avenue, where they began performing CPR, according to Nesheim.

The crowd continued to grow as the woman was taken to the hospital. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara arrived and briefly spoke to Bovino.

Minneapolis police eventually brought in an armed tactical vehicle, apparently to help with crowd control.

The Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office posted on social media it was not involved in the shooting, but dispatched deputies to the scene to assist other law enforcement as needed.

More than 100 protesters had gathered on Portland Avenue and E. 33rd Street by 10:30 a.m., and about 40 unmarked SUVs, and Hennepin County Sheriff’s and Minneapolis Police vehicles were parked in a wide perimeter around the scene, blocking off the area with yellow tape.

Protesters shouted at officers, blew whistles and banged on drums throughout the morning and early afternoon.

Most ICE and Border Patrol agents left the scene at around 11 a.m. The Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) began collecting evidence from the victim’s Honda Pilot, which crashed into a lightpole and a parked car.

About 11 a.m., officers in camouflage sprayed a green gas on protesters, and began using pepper spray on the crowd.

Protesters remained at the scene as of 2 p.m. as officers took down yellow police tape and other barricades. A group of about 400 protesters began marching from the scene toward downtown Minneapolis shortly before 3 p.m.

Shooting comes on heels of increased enforcement

Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarity issued a written statement saying her office has been in touch with the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office, Walz and law enforcement leaders throughout the day, and is “pushing hard for a local investigation, which is the only way to ensure full transparency and review by our office.”

Venus de Mars, a local musician who lives on the block, witnessed paramedics performing CPR on the shooting victim in a snowbank. De Mars said the victim appeared to be a white woman, who was removed from the scene in an ambulance.

“They didn’t rush her away, they didn’t have sirens or anything,” de Mars said. “I’m very worried that she didn’t make it.”

City Council Member Robin Wonsley, who represents a different area of south Minneapolis, posted on social media that she was on the scene with other council members.

“Residents witnessed federal agents shoot an observer. The resident was transported to a hospital,” she wrote. “I will keep you updated as information comes out.”

The shooting comes on the heels of a progressive escalation of federal action and staffing in Minnesota, and a visit Tuesday from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. An additional 2,000 ICE and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agents were reportedly deployed to Minnesota this week, according to CBS News. Sahan Journal has not been able to verify the number.

Increased immigration crackdowns will likely continue across the country, boosted by ICE’s increased budget and staffing. There are 12,000 new ICE agents in 2026, the agency announced Monday, more than doubling its personnel from the start of 2025.

More than 150 people in Minnesota were arrested by immigration agents Monday, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a news release.

The deployment is swelling the ranks of ICE in Minnesota, which began an effort dubbed Operation Metro Surge in December. The most recent surge in agents is expected to last 30 days and include U.S. Border Patrol agents, CBS reported.

In a social media post earlier in the day, Frey said: “The presence of federal immigration enforcement agents is causing chaos in our city. We are demanding ICE leave the city and state immediately. We stand rock solid with our immigrant and refugee communities.”

“An ICE officer, fearing for ​his ‌life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and ‌the safety of ‌the public, ⁠fired defensive shots,” McLaughlin wrote in a post ‌on X.

Mayor Jacob Frey alleged the officer “recklessly” shot her, adding immigration agents are “causing chaos in our city”.

“They’re ripping families apart. They’re sowing chaos on our streets and in this case, quite literally killing people,” Frey said at a news conference.

“They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defence. Having seen the video myself, I wanna tell everybody directly, that is bulls**t,” the mayor said.

Dramatic escalation

A dark-coloured SUV with a bullet hole through its windshield and blood splattered ‌across the headrest was seen rammed into a pole on the snowy street where the shooting took place.

Venus de Mars, 65, a resident who lives near the site of the shooting, described seeing paramedics perform CPR on a woman collapsed next to a snowbank near the crashed car. Shortly ‌after, they loaded her into an ambulance that drove away without its sirens on.

“There’s been lots of ICE activity, but nothing like this,” de Mars said. “I’m so angry. I’m so angry ‍, and I feel helpless.”

The shooting marks a dramatic escalation of the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations in major US cities under the Trump administration.

The Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St Paul have been on edge since DHS announced on Tuesday it launched the operation with 2,000 agents and officers expected to participate in the crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

The shooting drew protesters into the streets near the scene, some of whom were ⁠met by heavily armed federal agents wearing gas masks who fired chemical munitions at the demonstrators.

A large throng of protesters gathered and vented their anger at the local and federal officers there. “Shame! Shame! Shame!” and “ICE out of Minnesota!”, they loudly chanted from behind the police tape.

The area where the shooting occurred is a modest neighbourhood south of downtown Minneapolis, just a few blocks from some of the oldest immigrant markets in the area and 1.6km (one mile) from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020.

Al Jazeera’s John Hendren reported Minnesota Public Radio quoted a witness saying, “ICE agents were telling the driver, a woman, to get out of here. She was trying to turn around, and the ICE agent was in front of the car, and he pulled out a gun.”

The witness said “he [an agent] reached across the hood of the car and shot her in the face, like three or four times”. The woman’s vehicle then accelerated and travelled about 30 metres (100 feet) before crashing into a utility pole.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem described the incident as an “act of domestic terrorism” carried out against ICE officers by a woman who “attempted to run them over and rammed them with her vehicle. An officer of ours acted quickly and defensively, shot, to protect himself and the people around him”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/afp_695eab31c456-1767811889.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2026-01-07 14:58:40.433542

The person is dead, according to a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security.

Video of the incident shared with the Reformer shows masked ICE officers approach a Honda Pilot stopped in the middle of Portland Avenue near near 34th Street. One officer tells the driver to “get out of the f*cking car” and tries to open the door. The driver then slowly backs up and appears to be leaving, when another officer fires three shots. The SUV then traveled a short distance before crashing into a parked car.

The witness who took the video, Caitlin Callenson, said she was on a walk when she saw an ICE vehicle stuck in the snow. As more ICE vehicles arrived, bystanders blew whistles in protest, and the driver of the SUV tried to block the ICE vehicles.

Callenson said she did not see ICE agents attempting to detain anyone leading up to or after the shooting.

After the shots were fired, the driver was “then was completely slumped over in the vehicle,” said Emily Heller, another witness. Federal agents wouldn’t allow a man who said he is a physician to examine the driver, Heller said. Emergency medical technicians arrived 15 minutes later, she said.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant Secretary Dept. of Homeland Security, writing on X, gave a different version of what happened: “One of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them — an act of domestic terrorism. An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots.”

Dozens of federal agents from ICE and the FBI, as well as Minneapolis police officers and Hennepin County sheriff’s deputies responded to the scene

As some federal officers attempted to leave, protestors blocked their vehicle. The officers fired a noxious gas at close range, causing distress and vomiting for many demonstrators and journalists.

Protests are ongoing.

Protesters hurled insults at Minneapolis Police officers, who are not supposed to assist with immigration enforcement, but were on the scene Wednesday morning.

City Council members including Robin Wonsley and Jamal Osman addressed the crowd, saying the area was an active crime scene, and that MPD was present to investigate.

“We are trying to get MPD the f*ck out of here. That is the best way they can be helpful right now,” Wonsley told the demonstrators.

Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty issued a statement soon after the shooting saying she is “pushing hard for a local investigation which is the only way to ensure full transparency and review by our office.”

U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum, a St. Paul Democrat, called on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who filmed herself observing ICE actions in Minneapolis on Tuesday, to immediately stop the ICE operation “to restore order and prevent further injuries.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Minnesota-ICE.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 14:58:48.725901

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a Minneapolis motorist on Wednesday during the Trump administration's latest immigration crackdown on a major American city — a shooting that federal officials claimed was an act of self-defense but that the city's mayor describged as ""reckless"" and unnecessary.

Watch a briefing by state and local authorities in the video player above.

The shooting happened in a residential neighborhood south of downtown Minneapolis, just a few blocks from some of the oldest immigrant markets in the area and a mile (1.6 kilometers) from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, during a visit to Texas, described the incident as an ""act of domestic terrorism"" carried out against ICE officers by a woman who ""attempted to run them over and rammed them with her vehicle. An officer of ours acted quickly and defensively, shot, to protect himself and the people around him.""

But Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey blasted that characterization and the federal deployment of more than 2,000 officers as part of the immigration crackdown in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul.

""They are not here to cause safety in this city. What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,"" Frey said, calling on the federal agents to leave the city. ""They're ripping families apart. They're sowing chaos on our streets and in this case quite literally killing people.""

""They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defense. Having seen the video myself, I wanna tell everybody directly, that is bullshit,"" the mayor said.

The shooting marks a dramatic escalation of the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations in major American cities under the Trump administration. It's at least the fifth person killed in a handful of states since 2024.

The Twin Cities have been on edge since DHS announced Tuesday that it had launched the operation, with more than 2,000 agents and officers expected to participate in the crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

A large throng of protesters gathered at the scene after the shooting, where they vented their anger at the local and federal officers who were there, including Gregory Bovino, a senior U.S. Customs and Border Patrol official who has been the face of crackdowns in Los Angeles, Chicago and elsewhere.

In a scene that hearkened back to the Los Angeles and Chicago crackdowns, bystanders heckled the officers and blew whistles that have become ubiquitous during the operations.

""Shame! Shame! Shame!"" and ""ICE out of Minnesota!"" they loudly chanted from behind the police tape.

During her Texas visit, Noem confirmed that DHS had deployed more than 2,000 officers to the Twin Cities and already made ""hundreds and hundreds"" of arrests.

For nearly a year, migrant rights advocates and neighborhood activists across the Twin Cities have been preparing to mobilize in the event of an immigration enforcement surge. From houses of worship to mobile home parks, they have set up very active online networks, scanned license plates for possible federal vehicles and bought whistles and other noise-making devices to alert neighborhoods of any enforcement presence.

On Tuesday night, the Immigration Defense Network, a coalition of groups serving immigrants in Minnesota, held a training session for about 100 people who were willing to hit the streets to monitor the federal enforcement operation.

""I feel like I'm an ordinary person, and I have the ability do something so I need to do it,"" Mary Moran told KMSP-TV.

EXCLUSIVE: Maryland’s top election officials are facing renewed scrutiny from Congressional Republicans after the state's administrator of elections declined to provide definitive answers concerning the state’s voter rolls after it was discovered an illegal immigrant serving as a superintendent of a massive school system in Iowa was allegedly fraudulently registered to vote in Maryland, Fox News Digital learned.

""Maryland's chief elections official failed to provide complete answers, leaving serious concerns unresolved — chiefly whether Ian Roberts ever received a live ballot and whether the State has implemented new protocols to verify citizenship after this bombshell report,"" Republican Wisconsin Rep. Bryan Steil exclusively told Fox News Digital Wednesday.

""This case underscores the urgent need for stronger citizenship verification requirements when registering to vote — which was reaffirmed by President Trump just yesterday in his meeting with House lawmakers,"" he continued. ""The Committee's investigation will continue.""

Steil is the chair of the House Committee on House Administration. He and Vice Chair Laurel Lee, R-Fla., sent a letter to Maryland State Board of Elections Administrator Jared DeMarinis in December 2025, demanding answers regarding illegal immigrant Ian Andre Roberts' registration to vote in the state despite not holding U.S. citizenship. Roberts is originally from Guyana with ties to the U.S. going back to the 1990s.

TRUMP DOJ DEMANDS MINNESOTA VOTING RECORDS OVER SAME-DAY REGISTRATION 'VOUCHING' CONCERNS

The House Administration Committee oversees House operations and oversight and also is charged with considering proposals to amend federal election law.

The committee pressed for answers to questions such as: ""Is Roberts still a registered voter in Maryland?;"" ""Has Mr. Roberts ever voted in Maryland? If yes, what election(s) did he participate in?;"" ""Was Mr. Roberts ever mailed an absentee ballot? If yes, for which election(s)?"" and ""How does the State Board of Elections fulfill their obligations under 52 U.S.C. §20507 to conduct a general program to remove ineligible voters from the rolls?""

Fox News Digital exclusively obtained DeMarinis' response letter to the House Committee on House Administration, which defended the state’s voter registration system but stopped short of confirming whether Roberts, an illegal immigrant later arrested by ICE, was ever mailed an absentee ballot or remains registered to vote.

MINNESOTA LETS VOTERS 'VOUCH' FOR UP TO 8 OTHERS AS FRAUD SCANDALS FUEL CALLS FOR FEDERAL CRACKDOWN

""While no voter should be on the Maryland voter rolls if they are not a citizen of the United States, being on the voter rolls does not equate to having voted in an election. This is an important distinction as we investigate potential illegalities and potential prosecution,"" DeMarinis wrote in the response letter dated Monday.

The Maryland State Administrator of Elections did acknowledge the House Administration Committee's questions specifically as they relate to Roberts but could not offer definitive information.

DEM STATE ELECTION BOARD UNDER FIRE AFTER ICE-ARRESTED SUPERINTENDENT SURFACES ON VOTER ROLLS

""Regarding the Committee’s questions concerning Ian Andre Roberts, SBE does not and cannot confirm that the identity of a voter matches that of another voter record in another state, based merely on the public facing information available,"" he wrote. ""Even in other states, as in Maryland, public information on those voter lookups is limited in order to protect personal identifying information (PII) from disclosure. Public voter lookup tools are not designed to perform voter list maintenance procedures. Therefore, SBE will not confirm whether the individual in question is or is not or was or was not a registered voter in Maryland.""

He added that public voting history in Maryland did not yield results that ""any individual with the name Ian Andre Roberts in Maryland"" had a voting history in the blue state.

Maryland Republican Delegate Matt Morgan, chairman of the Maryland Freedom Caucus, told Fox Digital Wednesday that, ""The Maryland State Board of Elections is dropping the ball.""

""By failing to comply with a basic data request, they are fueling suspicion,"" he said. ""Their primary job is to prove our elections are secure and restricted to citizens, yet they’ve chosen secrecy over transparency. If there's nothing to conceal, why withhold the data? It’s time for the SBE to stop dodging questions and start providing answers.""

Roberts' voter registration documents have faced intense scrutiny from conservatives, including when a Maryland county board of elections released redacted versions of the files in November that blacked out how Roberts answered the citizenship question.

DeMarinis said the redactions of ""the original production of the voter record was made with redactions applying to general requests for information under Maryland’s Public information Act, rather than requests specifically for a voter record.""

""Once realized, a corrected record was produced. The information redacted was redacted pursuant to State and federal laws that permit withholding of certain voter information. Federal law requires the redaction of source of voter registration,"" he said, referring to an updated release of the documents that showed Roberts reported he was a U.S. citizen on his voter application.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION STRIKES DEAL WITH OHIO TO CLEAN UP STATE VOTER ROLLS USING FEDERAL DATABASE

Roberts served as superintendent of the Des Moines school district, the largest school district in Iowa, at the time of his arrest in October. The state revoked Roberts' education license following his arrest, and he is no longer serving as the district's top leader.

He initially attempted to flee law enforcement officers, according to the Department of Homeland Security, and was found to be in possession of $3,000 in cash, a Glock 9 mm pistol and a hunting knife at the time of his arrest.

The charges are his latest in a lengthy rap sheet that goes back to 1996, federal officials previously said.

""In the end, it is important to remember as our guiding principle that as the Maryland Declaration of Rights states, ‘the right of the People to participate in the Legislature is the best security of liberty and the foundation of all free Government; . . . and every citizen having the qualifications prescribed by the Constitution, ought to have the right of suffrage,’"" DeMarinis concluded his letter.

“The largest DHS operation ever is happening right now in Minnesota,” the department said in a post on X, dramatically expanding the federal law enforcement footprint in the state amid heightened political and community tensions.

The government planned to send about 2,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and officers to Minnesota, according to a U.S. official and a person briefed on the matter. The agents are expected to be dispatched in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, the person said. The people were not authorized to publicly discuss operational details and spoke with The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.

Immigrant rights groups and elected officials in the Twin Cities reported a sharp increase Tuesday in sightings of federal agents, notably around St. Paul. Numerous agents’ vehicles were reported making traffic stops, outside area businesses and apartment buildings.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was also present and accompanied U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers during at least one arrest. A video posted on X showed Noem wearing a tactical vest and knit cap as agents arrested a man in St. Paul. In the video, she tells the handcuffed man: “You will be held accountable for your crimes.”

DHS said in a news release that the man was from Ecuador and was wanted in his homeland and Connecticut on charges including murder and sexual assault. It said agents arrested 150 people Monday in enforcement actions in Minneapolis.

Minnesota governor blasts surge

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, criticized the federal enforcement surge as “a war that’s being waged against Minnesota.”

“You’re seeing that we have a ridiculous surge of apparently 2,000 people not coordinating with us, that are for a show of cameras,” Walz told reporters in Minneapolis on Tuesday, a day after announcing he was ending his campaign for a third term.

Many residents were already on edge. The Trump administration has singled out the area’s Somali community, the largest in the U.S. Last month, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara criticized federal agents for using “questionable methods” following a confrontation between agents and protesters.

Molly Coleman, a St. Paul City Council member whose district includes a manufacturing plant where agents arrested more than a dozen people in November, said Tuesday was “unlike any other day we’ve experienced.”

“It’s incredibly distressing,” Coleman said. “What we know happens when ICE comes into a city, it’s an enforcement in which every single person is on guard and afraid.”

Julia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said there had been an increase in sightings of federal agents and enforcement vehicles in locations like parking lots.

“We can definitely a feel a heavier presence,” said Dieu Do, an organizer with the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee, which dispatches response teams to reports of agents.

Surge includes investigators focused on fraud allegations

Roughly three-quarters of the enforcement personnel are expected to come from ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, which carries out immigration arrests and deportations, said the person with knowledge of the operation. The force also includes agents from Homeland Security Investigations, ICE’s investigative arm, which typically focuses on fraud and cross-border criminal networks.

HSI agents were going door-to-door in the Twin Cities area investigating allegations of fraud, human smuggling and unlawful employment practices, Lyons said.

The HSI agents are largely expected to concentrate on identifying suspected fraud, while deportation officers will conduct arrests of immigrants accused of violating immigration law, according to the person briefed on the operation. Specialized tactical units are also expected to be involved.

The operation also includes personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, the person familiar with the deployment said. Bovino’s tactics during previous federal operations in other cities have drawn scrutiny from local officials and civil rights advocates.

Hilton drops Minnesota hotel that canceled agents’ reservations

Hilton said in a statement Tuesday that it was removing a Minnesota hotel from its systems for “not meeting our standards and values” when it denied service to federal agents.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville hotel, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) outside Minneapolis, apologized Monday for canceling the reservations of federal agents, saying it would work to accommodate them. The hotel, like the majority of Hampton Inns, is owned and operated by a franchisee.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville did not respond to requests for comment.

Federal authorities began increasing immigration arrests in the Minneapolis area late last year. Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel announced last week that federal agencies were intensifying operations in Minnesota, with an emphasis on fraud investigations.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly linked his administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota to fraud cases involving federal nutrition and pandemic aid programs, many of which have involved defendants with roots in Somalia.

The person with information about the current operation cautioned that its scope and duration could shift in the coming days as it develops.

ICE LAUNCHES ‘LARGEST IMMIGRATION OPERATION EVER’ IN MINNEAPOLIS, ACTING DIRECTOR SAYS

Minneapolis’ official X account posted earlier that it was aware of a shooting involving federal law enforcement near East 34th Street and Portland Avenue and warned the public to ""avoid this area.""

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News the incident was a ""direct consequence of constant attacks and demonization of our officers by sanctuary politicians who fuel and encourage rampant assaults on our law enforcement who are facing 1,300% increase in assaults against them and an 8,000% increase in death threats.""

President Donald Trump has unleashed immigration agents in cities across America, who have been employing increasingly aggressive tactics.
McLaughlin said the ICE officers injured during the incident are expected to make full recoveries.
Since arriving in Minneapolis in early December, ICE officers and agents have arrested roughly 1,400 people, McLaughlin previously said.
The immigration enforcement operation will add up to 2,100 officers, according to two senior DHS officials.","An Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday after a group of people began blocking agents during an immigration-related operation, the Department of Homeland Security said.

ICE agents were conducting targeted operations in the city when a woman, 37, allegedly ""weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them,"" Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called for ICE to leave the city in a press conference held in the hours after the shooting.

“What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust. They are ripping families apart, sowing chaos in the streets and, in this case, quite literally killing people,"" he said. ""This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.""

Frey added that there was little he could say to make the current situation better but he had a message for federal immigration agents in the city.

""To ICE, get the f--- out of Minneapolis,"" the mayor said. ""We do not want you here. Your stated reason for being in this city is to create some sort of safety and you are doing the opposite.""

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said at a press conference that the agents’ vehicles got stuck in the snow and they were trying to push them out when the woman ""attacked them.""

""It was an act of domestic terrorism,"" she said.

The agent fired what McLaughlin said were ""defensive shots"" and killed the woman.

""He used his training and saved his own life and that of his fellow officers,"" she said.

Frey said it did not appear from video of the incident that the vehicle was being weaponized against the agent.

President Donald Trump has unleashed immigration agents in cities across America, who have been employing increasingly aggressive tactics. The efforts have ramped up tensions with local officials and communities that are increasingly protesting the efforts in some cities.

Video footage from NBC affiliate KARE 11 of Minneapolis showed a burgundy SUV with what appears to be a bullet hole in the windshield. The vehicle had crashed into a light pole. It’s not clear to whom the SUV belongs or from where the bullet was shot.

Brandon Hewitt, who is new to the neighborhood, said he was getting up around 8:30 a.m. when he heard three gunshots. He then looked outside and said he saw that a vehicle had crashed.

""I’m pretty right-leaning, but seeing this, this is not what you need to do,"" he told KARE. ""It’s not how to do it. It’s not how we’re supposed to do things around here in America.""

Residents and locals gathered in the street after the shooting, chanting and throwing snowballs in the direction of federal agents, KARE reported. Law enforcement deployed pepper spray and tear gas.

McLaughlin said the ICE officers injured during the incident are expected to make full recoveries. She did not detail what type of injuries the agents sustained.

Since arriving in Minneapolis in early December, ICE officers and agents have arrested roughly 1,400 people, McLaughlin previously said.

That is a significant increase from the roughly 300 arrested by Dec. 12, making it a much larger operation than some of the Border Patrol surge operations in cities such as Charlotte, North Carolina and New Orleans.

McLaughlin also said Border Patrol agents just arrived in Minneapolis and will begin operations there on Wednesday.

DHS, this week, sent hundreds of more officers and agents to bolster immigration enforcement in Minneapolis, with the agency posting on social media that it is waging “the largest DHS operation ever” in Minnesota.

The immigration enforcement operation will add up to 2,100 officers, according to two senior DHS officials. The administration began swelling the numbers Sunday and planned to continue adding forces Wednesday, the officials said. That total includes 1,500 enforcement and removal officers and 600 Homeland Security Investigations agents.

Arrests in Minneapolis could increase with the added boots on the ground.

The rush of more enforcement follows the posting of a video by a conservative content creator the day after Christmas that alleged Somali-run day care centers in Minneapolis were defrauding American taxpayers by taking federal grant money and not providing any services to children.

The FBI surged investigators in the city to look into the allegations soon after the video was posted, HSI has been door-knocking on Somali businesses since last week and the state of Minnesota concluded from its on-site checks of 10 Somali day care centers targeted in the video that they were operating normally, with children at every site except one, which was not yet open to investigators when they arrived to investigate.

Minneapolis’ Police Chief Brian O’Hara, who has said his department does not enforce immigration laws, has expressed concern that the DHS immigration dragnet may lead to political unrest, KARE 11 reported.

Many Minnesota residents of Somali descent, including those who are American citizens, have been staying indoors or have reduced activity outside, fearful of being snagged in the stepped-up enforcement now in its second month.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/250107-ice-minnesota-vl-1150a-a7f6dc.jpg",N,,2026-01-07 13:59:10.290513

But what is important to understand about Border Patrol entering a neighborhood is the uncertainty.
People organized, warning the community that immigration agents were nearby.
I remember sitting at my desk and suddenly hearing the Border Patrol helicopters circling overhead.
People are threatened with criminalization for resisting or even filming Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol.","As the Trump administration expands immigration police surges across the country, what has stood out has been the acts of resistance. Communities and organizations have put together rapid response hotlines, protested outside hotels sheltering federal agents, and carried whistles to warn their neighbors when immigration police are nearby. That resistance has kept me alive and has been so necessary.

But living in Little Village, a neighborhood in Chicago that was targeted by “Operation Midway Blitz” in the fall, I’ve also seen and experienced the psychological toll of these operations, both on the communities targeted and those of us organizing to defend them.

Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino’s surge of immigration police into Chicago has made national headlines for its cruelty and aggression. But what is important to understand about Border Patrol entering a neighborhood is the uncertainty. You never know when agents will show up or when they will decide to turn their presence into a public show of force. On some days, the neighborhood felt almost normal. On others, everything would shut down without warning.

First would come the whistles. People organized, warning the community that immigration agents were nearby. Within minutes, streets that were usually crowded would empty. Sidewalks where street vendors normally worked would be completely bare. Businesses closed early. People disappeared indoors. I remember sitting at my desk and suddenly hearing the Border Patrol helicopters circling overhead. I didn’t need to see it to wonder which one of my neighbors they had taken. My stomach still drops at the sound of any helicopter blades.

So, many people decided to stay home. Parents stopped going to work. Children missed school. Entire communities went missing. They survived by asking friends or neighbors to pick up medicine, buy groceries, or take children to school when they felt it was too risky to leave their homes. Organizations of all kinds have stepped up to deliver food and supplies directly to people’s homes. Individuals volunteered to give rides, buy groceries, collect donations, walk dogs.

During the recent immigration surge in New Orleans, I heard from friends who isolated themselves weeks before agents ever arrived. They had seen the violence in Chicago and began to take safety measures as soon as the news broke of “Operation Swamp Sweep,” the immigration police raid targeting Louisiana.

The Trump administration’s assault on us is not solely about increasing deportations. It is about manufacturing fear: the fear that keeps parents inside, students out of school, workers in panic, and entire neighborhoods from living with dignity. And make no mistake: this fear is intentional. It is meant to make us feel so unwanted that we make ourselves disappear.

These psychological operations are layered and intentional. Helicopters circle above Chicago as Border Patrol turns enforcement into spectacle. During these operations, teachers are abducted, children are tear-gassed, homes are invaded. People are threatened with criminalization for resisting or even filming Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol. All of this is reinforced by Department of Homeland Security ads on Univision and Telemundo, the largest Spanish-language broadcasters, threatening to “hunt” immigrants, urging undocumented people to self-deport, and spreading fear inside homes already targeted by Donald Trump’s policies.

As an organizer I cut my teeth doing civil disobedience and rapid response against deportations more than 20 years ago. I am not usually the first person to call for organizing mutual aid or mental health support. But what I’ve seen and experienced during these months of immigration surges has left me worried. Of course we have to organize and build rapid response networks, and make sure that people know to stay inside and not open the door. But we must also build the infrastructure that allows people to make those choices without losing access to food, income, care, or community.

I don’t know what the next phase of this administration will look like. I don’t know where the next surge will land, what new tactic will be tested, or whose neighborhood will be turned into the next spectacle of violence. What I do know is that this is not random, and that it will continue to happen. And because of that, the answer cannot be isolation. It has to be each other. We have to keep organizing, building networks that meet material needs and protect people’s dignity, creating systems of care that make survival possible even when staying home becomes the safest choice.

The damage being done to our communities is intentional, but so is our response. We will continue to organize because that is how we refuse to disappear.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2237593856-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 12:13:13.264617

""The largest DHS operation ever is happening right now in Minnesota,"" the department said in a post on X, dramatically expanding the federal law enforcement footprint in the state amid heightened political and community tensions.

The government planned to send about 2,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and officers to Minnesota, according to a U.S. official and a person briefed on the matter. The agents are expected to be dispatched in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, the person said. The people were not authorized to publicly discuss operational details and spoke with The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.

Immigrant rights groups and elected officials in the Twin Cities reported a sharp increase Tuesday in sightings of federal agents, notably around St. Paul. Numerous agents' vehicles were reported making traffic stops, outside area businesses and apartment buildings.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was also present and accompanied U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers during at least one arrest. A video posted on X showed Noem wearing a tactical vest and knit cap as agents arrested a man in St. Paul. In the video, she tells the handcuffed man: ""You will be held accountable for your crimes.""

DHS said in a news release that the man was from Ecuador and was wanted in his homeland and Connecticut on charges including murder and sexual assault. It said agents arrested 150 people Monday in enforcement actions in Minneapolis.

Minnesota governor blasts surge

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, criticized the federal enforcement surge as ""a war that's being waged against Minnesota.""

""You're seeing that we have a ridiculous surge of apparently 2,000 people not coordinating with us, that are for a show of cameras,"" Walz told reporters in Minneapolis on Tuesday, a day after announcing he was ending his campaign for a third term.

Many residents were already on edge. The Trump administration has singled out the area's Somali community, the largest in the U.S. Last month, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara criticized federal agents for using ""questionable methods"" following a confrontation between agents and protesters.

Molly Coleman, a St. Paul City Council member whose district includes a manufacturing plant where agents arrested more than a dozen people in November, said Tuesday was ""unlike any other day we've experienced.""

""It's incredibly distressing,"" Coleman said. ""What we know happens when ICE comes into a city, it's an enforcement in which every single person is on guard and afraid.""

Julia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said there had been an increase in sightings of federal agents and enforcement vehicles in locations like parking lots.

""We can definitely a feel a heavier presence,"" said Dieu Do, an organizer with the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee, which dispatches response teams to reports of agents.

Surge includes investigators focused on fraud allegations

Roughly three-quarters of the enforcement personnel are expected to come from ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations, which carries out immigration arrests and deportations, said the person with knowledge of the operation. The force also includes agents from Homeland Security Investigations, ICE's investigative arm, which typically focuses on fraud and cross-border criminal networks.

HSI agents were going door-to-door in the Twin Cities area investigating allegations of fraud, human smuggling and unlawful employment practices, Lyons said.

The HSI agents are largely expected to concentrate on identifying suspected fraud, while deportation officers will conduct arrests of immigrants accused of violating immigration law, according to the person briefed on the operation. Specialized tactical units are also expected to be involved.

The operation also includes personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, the person familiar with the deployment said. Bovino's tactics during previous federal operations in other cities have drawn scrutiny from local officials and civil rights advocates.

Hilton drops Minnesota hotel that canceled agents' reservations

Hilton said in a statement Tuesday that it was removing a Minnesota hotel from its systems for ""not meeting our standards and values"" when it denied service to federal agents.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville hotel, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) outside Minneapolis, apologized Monday for canceling the reservations of federal agents, saying it would work to accommodate them. The hotel, like the majority of Hampton Inns, is owned and operated by a franchisee.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville did not respond to requests for comment.

Federal authorities began increasing immigration arrests in the Minneapolis area late last year. Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel announced last week that federal agencies were intensifying operations in Minnesota, with an emphasis on fraud investigations.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly linked his administration's immigration crackdown in Minnesota to fraud cases involving federal nutrition and pandemic aid programs, many of which have involved defendants with roots in Somalia.

The person with information about the current operation cautioned that its scope and duration could shift in the coming days as it develops.

The Chamber said in its lawsuit that the new fee would force businesses that rely on the H-1B program to choose between dramatically increasing their labor costs or hiring fewer highly skilled foreign workers.","The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on Jan. 5 agreed to expedite an appeal of a court loss by U.S. business and research groups that are challenging President Donald Trump’s $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas for highly skilled foreign workers.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the country’s largest business lobbying group, had argued that a speedy review was needed in order to preserve employers’ rights ahead of the once-annual H-1B visa lottery scheduled to begin in March. The Trump administration did not oppose the quicker timeline, and the court agreed to a plan that will allow oral arguments to proceed in February.

The Chamber of Commerce and White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The annual process is the only opportunity for most U.S. employers that wish to hire skilled workers through the H-1B program to apply for the visas, according to the Chamber’s court filings.

“Those employers’ ability to participate in the H-1B program this year therefore hinges on the outcome of this appeal; without relief by March, it will be too late,” the Chamber said in court papers filed on Jan. 2.

The Chamber is appealing a Dec. 24 decision by a U.S. District Court judge, who concluded that the new fee fell within the president’s broad powers to regulate immigration.

Before Trump imposed the new $100,000 fee in September, H-1B visas had typically come with about $2,000 to $5,000 in fees depending on various factors.

The H-1B program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign workers with training in specialty fields. Technology companies in particular rely heavily on workers who receive H1-B visas. The program offers 65,000 visas annually, with another 20,000 visas for workers with advanced degrees, approved for three to six years.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has separately issued a new regulation that replaces the random selection of the lottery with a new allotment system that prioritizes visas for higher-skilled and higher-paid foreign workers. The rule is scheduled to go into effect on Feb. 27.

The Trump administration has said that the H1-B program has been abused by U.S. employers who seek to replace American workers with lower-paid foreign workers.

The Chamber said in its lawsuit that the new fee would force businesses that rely on the H-1B program to choose between dramatically increasing their labor costs or hiring fewer highly skilled foreign workers.

“We have a government of the boss, by the boss, and for the boss, it’s all for him, and that hurts people, and it’s threatening to our democracy, threatening to the rule of law,” he added.

Conway used the fifth anniversary of the Capitol insurrection to launch a bid for Congress in New York. He’s running for the seat now held by Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), who is retiring.

“The largest DHS operation ever is happening right now in Minnesota,” the department said in a post on X, dramatically expanding the federal law enforcement footprint in the state amid heightened political and community tensions.

The government planned to send about 2,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and officers to Minnesota, according to a U.S. official and a person briefed on the matter. The agents are expected to be dispatched in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, the person said. The people were not authorized to publicly discuss operational details and spoke with The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.

Immigrant rights groups and elected officials in the Twin Cities reported a sharp increase Tuesday in sightings of federal agents, notably around St. Paul. Numerous agents’ vehicles were reported making traffic stops, outside area businesses and apartment buildings.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was also present and accompanied U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers during at least one arrest. A video posted on X showed Noem wearing a tactical vest and knit cap as agents arrested a man in St. Paul. In the video, she tells the handcuffed man: “You will be held accountable for your crimes.”

DHS said in a news release that the man was from Ecuador and was wanted in his homeland and Connecticut on charges including murder and sexual assault. It said agents arrested 150 people Monday in enforcement actions in Minneapolis.

Minnesota governor blasts surge

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, criticized the federal enforcement surge as “a war that’s being waged against Minnesota.”

“You’re seeing that we have a ridiculous surge of apparently 2,000 people not coordinating with us, that are for a show of cameras,” Walz told reporters in Minneapolis on Tuesday, a day after announcing he was ending his campaign for a third term.

Many residents were already on edge. The Trump administration has singled out the area’s Somali community, the largest in the U.S. Last month, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara criticized federal agents for using “questionable methods” following a confrontation between agents and protesters.

Molly Coleman, a St. Paul City Council member whose district includes a manufacturing plant where agents arrested more than a dozen people in November, said Tuesday was “unlike any other day we’ve experienced.”

“It’s incredibly distressing,” Coleman said. “What we know happens when ICE comes into a city, it’s an enforcement in which every single person is on guard and afraid.”

Julia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said there had been an increase in sightings of federal agents and enforcement vehicles in locations like parking lots.

“We can definitely a feel a heavier presence,” said Dieu Do, an organizer with the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee, which dispatches response teams to reports of agents.

Surge includes investigators focused on fraud allegations

Roughly three-quarters of the enforcement personnel are expected to come from ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, which carries out immigration arrests and deportations, said the person with knowledge of the operation. The force also includes agents from Homeland Security Investigations, ICE’s investigative arm, which typically focuses on fraud and cross-border criminal networks.

HSI agents were going door-to-door in the Twin Cities area investigating allegations of fraud, human smuggling and unlawful employment practices, Lyons said.

The HSI agents are largely expected to concentrate on identifying suspected fraud, while deportation officers will conduct arrests of immigrants accused of violating immigration law, according to the person briefed on the operation. Specialized tactical units are also expected to be involved.

The operation also includes personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, the person familiar with the deployment said. Bovino’s tactics during previous federal operations in other cities have drawn scrutiny from local officials and civil rights advocates.

Hilton drops Minnesota hotel that canceled agents’ reservations

Hilton said in a statement Tuesday that it was removing a Minnesota hotel from its systems for “not meeting our standards and values” when it denied service to federal agents.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville hotel, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) outside Minneapolis, apologized Monday for canceling the reservations of federal agents, saying it would work to accommodate them. The hotel, like the majority of Hampton Inns, is owned and operated by a franchisee.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville did not respond to requests for comment.

Federal authorities began increasing immigration arrests in the Minneapolis area late last year. Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel announced last week that federal agencies were intensifying operations in Minnesota, with an emphasis on fraud investigations.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly linked his administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota to fraud cases involving federal nutrition and pandemic aid programs, many of which have involved defendants with roots in Somalia.

The person with information about the current operation cautioned that its scope and duration could shift in the coming days as it develops.

Human Rights Watch said it could not independently confirm that explanation.
Human Rights Watch urged the government to end arbitrary arrests, investigate allegations of abuse, disclose the whereabouts of missing detainees and allow independent monitors access to military barracks.
It also called on international partners to condition support for South Sudan’s security forces on respect for human rights.
“Instead of addressing crime, security forces have used this campaign to commit serious abuses against marginalized youth,” Pur said.","South Sudanese security forces have carried out sweeping arbitrary arrests of boys, young men and women in the capital, Juba, since late June 2025, subjecting detainees to torture, extortion and forced conscription, Human Rights Watch said in a report released Wednesday.

The rights group said the arrests were conducted under the pretext of a crackdown on criminal gangs following reports of rising youth violence in the city. In at least one raid, police officers beat and raped women in custody, the organization said.

“Security forces have arbitrarily detained, extorted and forcibly conscripted dozens of boys and young men, and raped young women,” said Nyagoah Tut Pur, South Sudan researcher at Human Rights Watch. She called on authorities to release those unlawfully detained and hold perpetrators accountable.

Human Rights Watch said it conducted remote interviews between Aug. 7 and Nov. 23 with 37 people, including victims and relatives, as well as civil society activists and United Nations child protection experts. Three of those interviewed were children.

The group said it wrote to police and military spokespersons on Dec. 10 seeking comment on its findings but received no response.

Youth violence and gang activity have increased in South Sudan over the past decade, fueled by poverty, unemployment, displacement and prolonged conflict. In mid-June 2025, a video circulated on social media showing the gang rape of a 16-year-old girl in Juba by alleged gang members, prompting public outrage.

Soon afterward, the National Police Service, the South Sudan People’s Defence Forces and the National Security Service launched joint operations across residential neighborhoods of the capital. While authorities initially described the campaign as a seven-day operation starting in early July, witnesses told Human Rights Watch that arrests continued through the end of 2025.

By early July, authorities said at least 600 suspected gang members had been arrested. In October, police announced the arrest of 32 alleged criminals and the seizure of weapons, saying criminal proceedings would follow. Human Rights Watch said it could not verify any prosecutions related to gang activity beyond the gang rape case, in which 13 suspects were arrested and seven charged.

According to the report, boys and young men were often targeted while walking or gathering in groups. Detainees described beatings in police stations and military facilities, overcrowded detention conditions, and a lack of food and water.

Several former detainees said they were released only after relatives paid money or provided goods to security personnel. Others said they were transferred to military camps in Upper Nile state, where fighting has intensified since early 2025. Human Rights Watch said some detainees were forced into combat roles, while others were compelled to perform labor for soldiers.

At least four families told the group that relatives detained by security forces remain missing, with authorities refusing to disclose their whereabouts.

Police authorities denied allegations of forced conscription in comments to local media in August, saying the operation targeted criminals and that some detainees were moved outside Juba due to overcrowding. Human Rights Watch said it could not independently confirm that explanation.

South Sudanese law and international treaties ratified by the country prohibit arbitrary detention, torture, sexual violence and the recruitment of children by armed forces. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child states that detention of minors should be used only as a last resort.

Human Rights Watch urged the government to end arbitrary arrests, investigate allegations of abuse, disclose the whereabouts of missing detainees and allow independent monitors access to military barracks.

Mr. Rubio made his remarks in a briefing on Monday with lawmakers from the main armed services and foreign policy committees in both chambers of Congress. The same day, Mr. Trump told aides to deliver an updated plan.

The congressional briefing was focused on Venezuela, but lawmakers raised concerns about Mr. Trump’s intentions on Greenland given aggressive remarks this week by the American president and a top aide, Stephen Miller, two officials said.

Mr. Rubio did not go into detail on what he meant by buying Greenland. Mr. Trump spent decades in New York as a real estate developer, and one of his top diplomatic envoys, Steve Witkoff, comes from the same background. Mr. Trump has coveted Greenland since his first term.

Greenland is a sparsely populated, autonomous territory that falls under the sovereign boundaries of Denmark, a member of NATO. Denmark established colonial control over Greenland in the 18th century, and allowed it to become autonomous in the 20th century.

On Tuesday, leaders of six NATO nations joined with Mette Frederiksen, the prime minister of Denmark, to issue a remarkable joint statement pushing back against Mr. Trump’s assertions that the United States should take over Greenland. The nations that aligned with Denmark were Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Poland, all of which are close allies of the United States.

“Security in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the U.N. Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders,” they said. “These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them.”

“Greenland belongs to its people,” they added. “It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.”

Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Trump had not ruled out a U.S. invasion of Greenland.

“President Trump has made it well known that acquiring Greenland is a national security priority of the United States, and it’s vital to deter our adversaries in the Arctic region,” she said in a statement. “The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the U.S. military is always an option at the commander in chief’s disposal.”

Some lawmakers voiced concern about Mr. Trump’s stated plans. On Tuesday evening, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, and Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, issued a joint statement saying the U.S. government must respect its allies.

“When Denmark and Greenland make it clear that Greenland is not for sale, the United States must honor its treaty obligations and respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark,” said the senators, who lead the Senate NATO Observer Group.

“Any suggestion that our nation would subject a fellow NATO ally to coercion or external pressure undermines the very principles of self-determination that our alliance exists to defend,” they added.

On Sunday, Mr. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that “Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place.”

Those two nations are active powers in the Arctic Circle, but Greenland is not surrounded by their ships. In fact, it is the United States that has a military base in Greenland. Vice President JD Vance visited the base with his wife, Usha, last year.

Mr. Trump has also focused on Greenland because of its potential wealth of critical minerals.

The second Trump administration’s National Security Strategy says dominance of the Western Hemisphere is a top priority. That has been brought into sharp focus with Mr. Trump’s monthslong military pressure campaign against Venezuela and the seizure on Saturday by U.S. troops of Nicolás Maduro, the country’s leader, and his wife, Cilia Flores, during a deadly attack. And Mr. Trump said early last year that he planned to acquire Canada.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/06/multimedia/06dc-greenland-cvmf/06dc-greenland-cvmf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 09:57:29.565526

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the country’s largest business lobbying group, had argued that a speedy review was needed in order to preserve employers’ rights ahead of the once-annual H-1B visa lottery scheduled to begin in March. The Trump administration did not oppose the quicker timeline, and the court agreed to a plan that will allow oral arguments to proceed in February.

The Chamber of Commerce and White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The annual process is the only opportunity for most U.S. employers that wish to hire skilled workers through the H-1B program to apply for the visas, according to the Chamber’s court filings.

“Those employers’ ability to participate in the H-1B program this year therefore hinges on the outcome of this appeal; without relief by March, it will be too late,” the Chamber said in court papers filed on Jan. 2.

The Chamber is appealing a Dec. 24 decision by a U.S. District Court judge, who concluded that the new fee fell within the president’s broad powers to regulate immigration.

Before Trump imposed the new $100,000 fee in September, H-1B visas had typically come with about $2,000 to $5,000 in fees depending on various factors.

The H-1B program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign workers with training in specialty fields. Technology companies in particular rely heavily on workers who receive H1-B visas. The program offers 65,000 visas annually, with another 20,000 visas for workers with advanced degrees, approved for three to six years.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has separately issued a new regulation that replaces the random selection of the lottery with a new allotment system that prioritizes visas for higher-skilled and higher-paid foreign workers. The rule is scheduled to go into effect on Feb. 27.

The Trump administration has said that the H1-B program has been abused by U.S. employers who seek to replace American workers with lower-paid foreign workers.

The Chamber said in its lawsuit that the new fee would force businesses that rely on the H-1B program to choose between dramatically increasing their labor costs or hiring fewer highly skilled foreign workers.

A group of Democratic-led U.S. states and a coalition of employers, nonprofits and religious organizations have also filed lawsuits challenging the fee.",https://masslawyersweekly.com/files/2026/01/FLAG-VISA-FORM.webp,N,,2026-01-07 10:59:13.521301

DHS claimed the cancellation was part of a “coordinated campaign” orchestrated by Hilton Hotels in Minneapolis to “undermine and impede DHS law enforcement from their mission to enforce our nation’s immigration laws.” On Tuesday, additional online posts confirmed the hotel’s refusal to house immigration agents, leading Hilton Hotels to cut ties with the hotel.

“[W]e are taking immediate action to remove this hotel from our systems,” an X post from Hilton read. “Hilton is—and always has been—a welcoming place for all. We are also engaging with all of our franchisees to reinforce the standards we hold them to across our system to help ensure this does not happen again.”

Private businesses generally have discretion to refuse service to individuals without justification. However, federal law prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, or national origin. States can add to these protections. The Minnesota Human Rights Act additionally prohibits discrimination solely based on “creed… disability… marital status, sexual orientation, sex, or gender identity.” Neither federal nor state law expressly carve out protections based on federal employment status.

Human rights concerns

What they're saying:

Khanna posted photos of the exterior of the privately run detention facility east of Bakersfield on social media. He said his Tuesday visit was prompted by the detention of a constituent from Sunnyvale whom he said was beaten and was later deported.

He said he was escorted through the center, which he described as ""cold"" and ""stark,"" by six staff members, including the warden.

According to Khanna, several inmates told him they did not know why they were being held. He said he was most alarmed by what he described as an apparent lack of medical care at the facility.

""I am deeply shaken by my visit,"" Khanna said in videos on TikTok, Instagram and Facebook, where he wrote a lengthy description of his visit.

He decribed meeting with 47 detainees, many of whom were in tears.

Some told him, ""We are human beings. We should not be treated like animals or murderers.""

Khanna said some reported that they had rocks in the food, they didn't get fruit for weeks, they couldn't see their family members face-to-face, but could only speak to them on phones behind glass.

He said the detainees came from Afghanistan, Armenia, Bangladesh, Colombia, El Salvador, Honduras, India, Mexico, Nepal, Venezuela, and others. Most told Khanna they were never told why they were detained.

""I am sounding the alarm,"" Khanna said, adding that he wants Congressional oversight over ICE facilities.

ICE did not immediately respond for comment.

Lawsuit filed

Big picture view:

In November, several ICE detainees, including Gomez Ruiz, sued ICE in US District Court in Northern California, alleging the California City center is polluted with sewage, provides inadequate medical care and is denying people access to food and lawyers.

The California City Immigration Processing Center is about 75 miles east of Bakersfield.

It used to operate as a state prison managed by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. ICE contracted with the for-profit company CoreCivic to re-open the prison as an immigration detention center in 2025.

With 2,560 beds, the facility is the largest immigration detention center in California.

When the lawsuit was filed, more than 800 people were detained in the facility. On Khanna's visit this week, he said he was told that 1,428 detainees were there, including 215 women.

CoreCivic projects the center will reach full capacity by early 2026.

The lawsuit was filed by the Prison Law Office, a nonprofit organization that focuses on conditions in California prisons; along with the American Civil Liberties Union, the advocacy group California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice and the law firm Keker Van Nest & Peters LLP.",https://images.foxtv.com/static-media.fox.com/fmcv3/prod/fts/xys8xktu6mjjt5eh/1280/720/2q8g8han5e4dveta.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2026-01-07 10:58:53.356146

-General Ferdinand Foch

History is replete with times when an army in fighting retreat draws a line, digs in, and then counterattacks. The Russians in WW2 took world-historic losses, before turning the tide with a massive counteroffensive around Stalingrad. The French and British forces in the early days of WW1 were pushed back across the frontier. The Germans were within sight of Paris. But they became stretched out over the course of the advance. When a gap opened in their lines, the exhausted, demoralised allied troops had to rally, get into an entirely different mindset, and go on the attack.

Likewise with political debates, a side that has had the worst of it can decide to get off the defensive.

Across the world, free societies are under assault from a resurgent fascism. Across the world, fears about immigration have been one of the main—arguably the main—weapon used. And across the world, there has been a timidity on the part of progressives about countering these arguments. There is a pervasive pessimism that this is a debate we can win. That the public at large will ever side with a pro-immigration position.

To some degree this is understandable, but it is not wise. We have no choice but to fight—the closed-border, mass-deportation agenda of the modern right will destroy nations if we let it. And fascists will never stop capitalizing on nativist narratives as long as they are allowed to stand.

We are locked into a battle we did not seek and our timidity is keeping us on the defensive. It isn’t working. Our pessimism is self-fulfilling. In any contact sport, you get hurt more by flinching from the tackle than you do from committing to it. No one ever won a fist fight they were convinced they'd lose. In politics, it is not enough to contest conclusions and debate details. You must attack premises—trash and tarnish the foundations of your opponent's case. And you must put forward a positive, values-driven vision of your own.

The right has any number of advantages on immigration. And majority public opinion is often with them. But this is by no means inevitable. They are also overextended—committed to increasingly deranged visions, with the horrific consequences of their worldview more and more visible every day. It’s time to shake off our timidity, take a deep breath, and go on the offensive.

I have a hunch—no more, but no less—that most politically active progressives are ready for this. I think if a critical mass of us decided to take the fight to the enemy, many more would quickly join. And I think we would find the forces arrayed against us much weaker than we initially supposed.

After all, ‘turning points’ in war are as much psychological as they are strategic. A matter of changing the attitude and orientation of the army. First and foremost, we must understand what we are fighting for, and believe that victory is possible. Tactics will follow the will to fight, not the other way around.

Are you sure we have to fight?

That’s the question center-left parties have been asking. Their response has generally been to try and avoid talking about it. And, where that fails, to give ground, to try and find a compromise with the right, and show nativist voters that their “reasonable concerns” are being “taken seriously”. Nowhere has this worked. Barack Obama sought a deal with Republicans in which increased border security and immigration enforcement would be traded for reforms and protection for some of the existing undocumented population. He ramped up deportations to show he was serious about his side, but the deal never happened. And his preformative cruelty did nothing to arrest the radicalisation of the Republican base. Kamala Harris attempted to flank Donald Trump on the issue in 2024, arguing that Democrats had attempted to pass an aggressive bill on border security that Trump had tanked. This was a plausible enough read of the negotiations, but it didn’t matter. Voters concerned about the border went to the more viscerally xenophobic candidate by large margins.

The UK provides an even starker case. Following the 2016 Brexit referendum, the country has embarked on what can only be described as a program of national economic suicide to address the “legitimate concerns” of nativists. They are louder and angrier than ever. The current Labour government has pledged to reduce (legal) immigration, and numbers are in fact falling significantly. But, again, it doesn’t matter. Prime minister Keir Starmer has arguably gone further than any liberal leader in the world to appease the rising far right, and has been rewarded with historically low approval ratings. Even in Denmark, the poster child of centrist appeasers, their Social Democrats, after moving to the right on this issue, were mauled in local elections, losing Copenhagen for the first time in a century.

Progressive activists, and those of us in media and academia have done a little better. But only a little. The left will challenge anti-immigrant arguments as a ‘divide and rule’ tactic of capitalist elites. The billionaires, it is argued, keep us fighting a culture war so that we won’t fight a class war.

There are elements of truth here, but this assumes a rationality in the ruling class that just isn’t there. A world of closed borders does not benefit the billionaires. The Brexit project made virtually everyone in the UK worse off. Poor people are poorer, but businesses—small and large—have also felt the impact. Finally, in framing the debate as a distraction we risk implying that it’s not important. We keep trying to change the conversation back to topics we feel more secure on (economic inequality), rather than counterattacking directly.

Often progressives will call out the motivations of the nativist project: it is not, contra reactionary centrist pleading, drawing on legitimate concerns, but racism. Men like Donald Trump and Nigel Farage are bigots and must be opposed on that basis.

This has the virtue of being obviously true. It’s also a somewhat effective political attack line. But the liberal response can’t only be this. Voters have been told, over and over, that immigration is a problem. That it depresses wages, increases crime, stretches social services. That the country is full (whatever that means). What appears to have happened is a significant (and election determinative) block of people have accepted that, yes, the far right are racist, but they’re the only ones taking ‘the problem’ seriously. I’ve heard many people, on both sides of the Atlantic, say that while they find Trump or Reform distasteful, they also think we need someone unpleasant since their country is being ‘taken advantage of’.

The wealth and health of nations

The reality is that, even if those proposing further anti-immigrant measures weren't racist at all (and to be clear, they absolutely are), their policies would still be disastrous. Even current immigration regimes are far too restrictive and are massively harming us. I think we can no longer be content to try and defend the status quo. We have to take new ground.

For some on the left, there is a fear that high levels of ‘unskilled’ migration will depress wages for lower income native workers. But this just isn’t what the data says. The past 30 years of empirical research have broadly shown virtually no effect across developed countries. ‘They took our jobs’ is a self-sustaining delusion that it’s embarrassing left leaders are still falling for. It’s even more galling when the charge is made by people who are actively and explicitly against raising wages for those at the bottom. When Biden ‘ran the economy hot’ during the covid recovery, this really did raise wages for the lowest income brackets. The response from the right was apoplectic rage. Centrists in the press screamed that this would be inflationary. When a ‘soft landing’ showed these fears to be incorrect, they resolved to deny the data and discredit the experiment such that it could never happen again.

I want a progressive movement that is aggressively pro raising wages at the bottom and aggressively pro immigration. These are completely coherent goals. They don’t always have the same supporters, but they have the same enemies. It’s time to take the fight to them.

To start with, we should firmly reject the framing that there is some ‘right’ level of immigration. “How many is too many?” is a favorite challenge of the nativists. It’s the wrong question. The measure of a country's success is if its citizens are happy, healthy, and prosperous, not if an arbitrary number of people cross a border.

In focusing so much on the former, we have abandoned the latter. Nativism across the world has made us more divided, poorer, and literally sicker. And that’s before we even get to its exploitation by fascists.

Look at the phone in your pocket—it's materials, parts, and assembly happened in at least a dozen countries. No individual nation can do all of that. Only a superpower like the United States could even attempt to internalize all those processes, and that would certainly be at an incredible cost. When politicians talk of ‘made in America’ they have steel beams, not cellphones, in mind.

Likewise, in a complex modern economy, it's madness to think one country could exactly meet its labour needs in all sectors. Especially when you consider that these are always changing. It takes 10-15 years to train a doctor, but a country with staffing shortages of medical professionals needs that problem addressed now, not a decade from now. American liberals often reference farm jobs that ‘Americans don’t want to do’ when arguing for immigration. And it’s certainly true that agriculture needs non-native labour, but so do many sectors, across the income spectrum. There’s a reason Elon Musk broke (fascist) character to advocate for H-1B visas—he knows that the tech sector is structurally dependent on them. He just imagines, with the usual nativist naivety, that sectors he isn’t familiar with will work it out if confined to American workers. They won’t. The idea of pure national self-sufficiency is a preposterous myth, long past its sell by date. We live in a deeply interconnected world, and this has been true for at least 150 years.

What has changed is that as developed countries have aged (and birth rates dropped) we've needed immigration from developing countries at higher levels. Naturally, despite these often being the people who literally care for our parents, we’ve made them providing this service as difficult & demeaning as possible.

The UK is a clear case study in how grotesquely self-destructive this tendency is. Our health and care sectors are in absolute crisis and that is impacting everything else, both consequence and cause of our national decline. A decade and a half of Tory austerity has left the National Health Service (NHS) underfunded as demand has continued to rise. Providing care for someone with advanced cancer or dementia is both expensive, and incredibly labour intensive—requiring both day to day supervision, and a system of specialised medical professionals. We hence need a wide variety of workers, not all of whom we’re capable of producing natively (32% of NHS doctors are foreign born). Immigration restrictions mean that these roles are simply not being filled.

Starmer has repeatedly claimed that the country is “addicted” to foreign labour. A bizarre framing that acknowledges our interdependence, but casts it as a problem rather than a solution. Our government insists we can fill these massive staffing shortages by training more native healthcare workers. We can’t. For one thing, we need more doctors, nurses, and care workers now, not ten years from now. For another, the universities that train said professionals are also in absolute crisis as a result of our anti-immigration politics: foreign students were a key source of income, but this is drying up in the face of hostile visa rules and crackdowns. Finally, the aforementioned project of national economic suicide means we cannot pay competitive rates—or anything close to it. Brits do not want to spend a decade qualifying to be a doctor for a starting salary of £32,000 ($40,000).

And this failure is cascading. Families with older relatives with complex care needs can no longer find the support they need. Increasingly, NHS hospital beds are being used for them as there is simply nowhere else to go. This sucks up already stretched resources and staff time, which in turn means worse services for everyone else—longer waits to see a specialist, or for operations. A younger person, perhaps a parent with young children, with a cancer diagnosis they might otherwise have survived, now does not.

You know the ""is anyone on the plane a doctor?"" trope? That's our national situation. And when the person who stands up isn't white British, we reply that we’d actually rather die.

This is no less absurd than the mainstream, bi-partisan view on immigration in most developed democracies right now. Most people don’t see it because they’re not thinking through the causal chain (from restrictions to staffing shortages to outcomes). Part of going on the offensive is getting them to. Part of shaking off our timidity is believing we can.

Persuasion

Shortages of carers for our elderly, or specialist medical staff, are a particularly extreme case. But more mundane ones exist in all parts of advanced economies. As markets change, and nations specialise in different things, the norm is that some sectors will find themselves needing more workers, while in others too many workers compete for too few jobs (and hence benefit from the workers who are willing to travel for opportunities being allowed to do so).

The US is larger and more prosperous, the EU has internal freedom of movement, but both are still harmed by overly restrictive systems. Both would benefit from, not exactly more migration, but from greater ease of it—from people who want to move easily being able to fill skill gaps where they arise. Yet liberal parties the world over are too scared to say this.

It’s not just a temperamental timidity. There seems to be a tacit acceptance that electorates are simply not persuadable. Even as anti-immigrant measures cause economic harm that weakens support for incumbent parties, there’s a feeling that people would not tolerate being told the truth.

And yet, for all that public opinion isn’t favourable, it’s also very changeable. In the US, Republican opinion generally follows fox news to an almost comedic degree. Support for mass deportations went from 32% of republicans in 2016 to 88% in 2024 as it became a mainstay of Trump’s rhetoric. There’s no reason to think that, if we offered a positive vision of our own, Democrats’ opinion wouldn’t coalesce around it in the same way. In the UK, support for ending all inward migration drops by 2/3rds (45% to 15%) if you tell people doing so would mean NHS shortages. Given that would absolutely be the consequence, can we not make that case?

We liberals can have such a lack of confidence in our ability to persuade. Especially on immigration. I often hear “I agree, but the public won’t go for that”. Or, we get scared of a retort in advance—“if we say X, they’ll just say Y”.

The nativists will “just say Y’? OK, well, is “Y” true? Does it make sense? Or is it, in fact, society-destroying garbage? It is? Then say that. If their arguments are trash, then trash them. To quote, of all people, Tony Blair (who, whatever else he did, won elections), “the starting point of any campaign is to destroy the basis of [your opponents’] case.” If you allow their premises to stand, people will accept their conclusions.

So why aren't we? I think progressive timidity on this topic, in part, reflects the insecurities of our leaders. Not liking immigrants, you see, is what the “real” people think—the working class, the rural, the less affluent, the manual labourer, the straight, the white, the masculine, the male-coded elements of our society. Being pro-immigration automatically makes you less “real”—elite, effete, multicultural, overly cosmopolitan, queer, overly educated, email job, professional, female-coded—dismissive of, and ‘out of touch’ with, the “real” people of the country.

Authenticity

I’ve noticed when I really slam anti-immigration arguments, the reflexive response of many is to call me a snob. I get ‘class promoted’, becoming a “private school kid” who doesn’t know what life is like for “real people” out in the “real country”.

For whatever it’s worth, I’m definitely not a private school kid. And I grew up, and have lived for long periods in, the exact sort of “red wall”, northern parts of the UK nativists equate with maximal authenticity. And it’s fine to say things like this, to let people know where you’re coming from. But we shouldn’t stop with such a defensive move, we need to go on the offense—challenging the assumptions behind the charge.

We should note, for a start, how selective this sensitivity is. Sneering at the working class is just fine if you’re cutting food stamps, or removing family benefits, or cutting social services. The right will quickly jump to deploying some very ugly class (and race) stereotypes when advocating these. The centrists' handwringing about listening to the ‘voice of the forgotten man' is dropped the instant we start advocating for material benefits. Again, consider the real fanaticism they found in the US when faced with a progressive, pro-worker economic recovery under Biden.

And talking about “real” Americans, or “real” Brits, is just—at very best—a stupid framing. I’m not a more authentic Brit (who has more authority to define our national identity) because I was born in Grimsby, or grew up in the North East, or because I’m white and male. I’m not less of one because I’m socially liberal, or because I have a graduate degree and dual nationality. The vast majority of us are somewhere between the ‘real citizen’ and ‘out of touch elite’ caricatures.

Nor is it even true that nativist sentiment is some intrinsically working class thing. Just as often, it’s a luxury belief of affluent pensioners who can vote their distaste for a muti-cultural society without having to worry about the economic harm that causes the rest of us.

The poorest Americans still marginally prefer Democrats. Both Trump’s strongest support and strongest opposition are cross-class coalitions. Likewise in the UK, how the bottom income bracket (under £20,000, or $26,000) voted in the last election is actually pretty close to the national average: Labour 33%, Lib Dem 11, Green 8, Reform 17, Tory 24, other 7. Reform is a couple of points higher, but so are the Greens. Also the combined left-wing vote share is larger than the right one, and more of the least affluent Brits voted Green or Lib Dem than did Reform. If you want to essentialise the forgotten, “left behind” workers of the country, the data supports a socially progressive caricature more than a socially conservative one.

Of course, there is no such stereotype that captures the experience of all ‘working people’. And the one that our politicians and press impose on us is, frankly, insulting. I resent the assumption that I must dislike foreigners because of where I was born. Or that my high school friends who didn’t go to university must be bigots because of that, or because they work trade jobs. They absolutely aren't! There are of course some working class people who are nativists. But there is also a long history of workers' movements taking socially progressive positions. And there is a strong culture of aggressive social liberalism among many of the least affluent workers for those with eyes to see it.

I think the reason the snobbery charge has been allowed to silence liberalism to the degree it has is because it exploits an insecurity. Not for most of us necessarily, but for our leaders. In the UK, our politicians (and press) are usually awkward, uncharismatic upper-middle-class sorts, who genuinely are a bit out of touch. They carry totems to try and affirm a connection to ordinary people. Starmer’s father was a toolmaker, did you know? Labour candidate Alan Strickland took it several generations further, boasting ""my grandfather was the son of a miner"" in a campaign video. These dullards are hence incredibly exploitable: They don’t have a good handle on what ""ordinary people” think, but do read a lot of upper-class (in many cases literally aristocratic, or part of the UK’s de facto aristocracy) conservative writers in our press who claim to speak for them.

In the US case, reactionary centrists in the press are usually from middle-class backgrounds, have a fancy education, and have spent most of their lives in big, blue coastal cities. I think they’re uncomfortable with how all these things have been feminised by conservatives. Ventriloquizing (what they imagine to be) the voice of the common man to attack (female and queer-coded) social liberalism, is a way for them to attempt to re-affirm their masculinity within the symbolically gendered framework the country's politics operates within. The result is highly privileged New York Times writers lecturing queer barristers and bartenders about what working people think.

I don’t know how to say this more basically, but this is all complete nonsense and we have to get over it. You can’t lead an army if your main preoccupation is if your enemy likes you. Liberalism can neither accept nor afford leaders with these psychological hangups.

I don’t know about you, but in a fight for our lives, I want leaders who instinctively hate those trying to kill us. Conversely, I think troops wanting a general who does not openly sympathise with the enemy's cause is a reasonable enough minimum standard. I also think that even the less craven of us are so used to a defeatist framing that we need reminding how pernicious a creed nativism is—and that there is nothing natural or inevitable about it.

Freedom of movement

I recently found myself in Barcelona for a few days—an amazing city I always instinctively vibe with. One thing I kept thinking was, when I was young, I could have lived and worked here for a year without restriction. Or Prague, or Berlin, or Lucca, or any European city. And now no one can. We tore all that up for no good reason.

In my early twenties I traveled so much, working as I went. Pre-Brexit, we had freedom of movement in the EU and I—owing to my dad being American—had a US passport. It really made me who I am now, and I think I’m such a better, more grounded person for having been able to.

It wasn’t all positive, I was reckless, I made mistakes. You know that trope Americans like to tell of some distant ancestor arriving in a strange land with just their clothes and a few dollars? I’ve literally done that a half dozen times in my life. And it didn’t always go smoothly! I remember sleeping on a hard wood floor, in a freezing Boston apartment—a run down maze of small rooms owned by an elderly crack addict who’d make them available to passers through, in exchange for us coughing up some dollars towards his habit every now and then.

I picked up what work I could, gravitating towards campaign work—knocking doors for a political candidate, or fundraising for a progressive cause. Those roles are always hiring. I saw so much of the world with them, and talked to thousands of people from all walks of life, often volunteering myself for the more exciting sounding assignments. Want to go work a ballot initiative camping in Maine? Sure. A road trip across upstate New York in mid winter? Sounds great. And in some of those organisations, I ended up taking on much more responsibility. In the chaos of the early Trump era, I found myself running big projects at a young age. Some of my more risky moves paid off magnificently. At one point, I left my job, ducked the last month's rent I owed, and got a one-way train ticket to start a relationship with a woman in another city I’d known less than a week. She’s now my wife.

And doesn’t all that speak to some fundamental human need just as much as the desire for comfort and familiarity does? I’m hardly the only person to throw myself at the world in this way. Go to any small town, in the US, UK, or EU, listen to young people there and you’ll hear talk of “getting out”. If that is what they want, they should be free to make a go of it. Free movement with other countries increases their choices in doing so. And for that matter, think of the affluent conservative retirees who vote for this anti-immigrant crap. What do they want to do with their time? Travel!

Sorry nativism, but contrary to your claim to being universal, there is a deep seated human need for experience and adventure that your unseasoned dork ideology just can’t satisfy. Of course if someone finds deep fulfillment in living where their ancestors lived they should be able to do that—that’s the point of freedom! But the insistence that everyone else do the same is, I think, fundamentally inhuman.

And that is the consequence of nativism. Anti-immigrant types never really seem to understand that these relationships are reciprocal. Americans often joke about moving to Europe if things get bad. Partisans of both sides seem to imagine there’s some ‘politically disaffected Yank’ visa route. Those who try run headlong into some of the most unpleasant, restrictive, and expensive bureaucratic processes ever devised. When the UK stopped EU citizens from being able to work here, we lost the right to work there. A particularly stupid example of this is older, Brexit voting Brits living abroad, who were shocked to find their own legal status in jeopardy. Leopards and faces, to use the vernacular.

Reframing the debate

The great advantage of going on the attack, in both war and politics, is to fight the battle on your terms, not your opponents. One of the reasons the immigration debate feels so unwinnable, why we’re perpetually on the backfoot, is we fight it within the nativists' framing devices. On their chosen ground, so to speak.

For example, immigration rules are usually conceptualised as being a relationship between a nation (to which we belong) and outsiders (who do not) seeking entry. I think they’re better thought of as a relationship between nations. There is, for instance, an understanding between the US and UK that if the former provides a passport to one of its residents, the latter will allow them entry for a period of 6 months, but not to work or stay beyond that (and similar the other way round). The relationship between France and Italy in contrast, is that citizens of either can live in the other indefinitely and work (more or less) without restriction.

The French and Italian relationship is a better one. Both with respect to human freedom, and the economic benefits to those who do not travel. The UK has catastrophically harmed itself by opting out of this open system. Recent estimates suggest Brexit has cost us 90 billion pounds in annual revenues (three times the size of the ‘budget black hole’ the government is trying to fill) and that the average Brit is £3,500 a year worse off (or 10% of the median income).

EU freedom of movement worked. It’s a wonderful thing for people across the continent. One of the great success stories of the modern age. Something to be built upon, not apologized for. And yet this is virtually nowhere said. Occasionally, it will be pointed out that Brexit was a mistake, but for abstract ‘economic’ reasons. Part of going on the offensive will be progressives the world over using the sad story to show why anti-immigrant policies specifically make life worse for everyone.

People will often say they don’t support open borders because the public won’t go for it. I dislike the phrasing because it reinforces the nativist model that immigration rules are about a nation to which we belong and aliens outside of that. I think freedom of movement provides a better model for the world we want.

Britain should obviously never have left the EU, but nor should this be the end of our ambitions. I can think of no good reason why we also shouldn’t have a freedom of movement deal with the United States. We have historic links, the same language, and deeply interconnected cultures. This would provide astounding economic opportunities for Brits willing to travel to access much higher wages in the states. And trust me when I say there’s a lot of Americans who hold a special affection for, and fascination with, the old country. Who would take a pay cut to work here for a few years if we removed our intentionally exclusionary and expensive visa process. And both sides would bring with them skills, experience, and different perspectives. Everyone would benefit, this isn’t a zero sum game.

Talking of the US, we should explore a North American freedom of movement deal. Say Canada, USA, Mexico. These countries are likewise deeply historically, culturally, and economically connected. Think of the hundreds of billions we’d save in border enforcement alone (and what socially productive purposes that money could be used for instead). The harms caused by this regime we could likewise simply do away with. Many Americans claim they have no problem with Mexican migrants, just those who came here illegally. Taking this at face value, we can elegantly solve that problem by making all movement legal. The tearing down of ugly and intrusive border fencing would become a glorious symbol of human freedom on the march.

Nor should we limit our ambitions to the global north. Let’s start where we have the greatest connection and work out, aiming to find partners who will make mutually beneficial deals with us. Britain has a historic connection to any number of amazing countries through the Commonwealth. What would freedom of movement with, say, India look like? That’s basically unthinkable now, due to pervasive racist fears of being ‘swamped’ by ‘hordes’ of non-white aliens. But the few who’ve looked into it think it could work for both countries. A saner society would at least consider it.

Attacking nativism

Anti-immigration politics’ claim to represent some natural human sentiment is a strange one, when you think about it. One we have been too timid in aggressively undermining.

People will always have communities which they feel they belong to, but nativism requires quite a lot more than that: It says that people are not only part of communities, but the boundaries of those communities, their composition and internal norms, can never change. And that people will react with hostility to any attempt to do so.

But these things change all the time. At the time of the French revolution only 11% of the population spoke French. The remainder speaking regional languages and dialects. The modern nation—as a culturally, linguistically, and ethically homogeneous group—is an invention, and a surprisingly modern one. One that had to be imposed, often from the top down, often in the face of real opposition from those whose regional (or other) identities were stronger. This is not to say that we should become anarchists, it’s the structure that we have, but it can exist in better and worse forms.

And if distrust of those different to you is simply how people invariably feel, it’s odd that this sentiment must be stoked by endless lies and propaganda. There’s actually something very artificial about the views electorates hold on immigration—they can only be sustained in a one-sided information vacuum. People’s fears aren’t inevitable, they’re what you get when they’re force-fed demininising propaganda by the right and liberals are silent.

Actually, when I talk to ordinary nativists, I invariably find they don’t feel the things it claims to represent—pride, cultural fit, a sense of belonging. Rather these are things they desperately want to feel, and have come to believe that excluding others will allow them to. “Everyone else has their own culture, why can’t we?” is a common lament. It’s particularly stupid in America which, for better or worse, is the undisputed cultural hegimon of the world.

Even in the UK it's, at best, pathetic and, at worst, ridiculously hypocritical. Britain genuinely does have cultural products worth celebrating and heritage worth preserving. But the minute that threatens nativist bigotry, they’ll turn on it. The right-wing press lobbied hard to get sports presenter (and former England captain, something of a national fixture) Garry Lineker fired because he called the government's immigration policy “cruel”. Doctor Who actor (what could be more British than The Doctor?) David Tennant likewise drew their ire for being vocally pro trans rights. The National Trust (which preserves many of our historic buildings) was faced with attacks and boycotts for discussing the British role in the slave trade in some of it’s exhibits. Even the Church of England—a core, traditional part of our culture for hundreds of years—is regularly assailed for affirming the traditional Christian teaching of kindness to refugees. These people don’t love their country and culture, they often hate it!

And we haven't even reached the most flagrant hypocrisy of nativism. It’s natural, they aver, to prefer one’s countrymen in the same way we have a special affection for our families. This latter part is true, and this really is a deep constant in human nature across cultures and time. Family takes different forms, and everyone is different, but for most people the bonds to our children, our parents and partners, and our best friends who are like family, are the most important part of our lives.

And nothing—really nothing—is more hostile to these bonds than immigration systems. After marrying in America, my father became ill. We made the difficult decision to move back to the UK to help my family. The response of the British state (which, we should remind ourselves, is in an existential crisis due to lack of carers) was to make this incredibly difficult, expensive, and uncertain. We have spent tens of thousands on fees, additional taxes, and moving around. We have had to worry, again and again, that we would fall afoul of ever changing rules. We have had to live separately for periods. And, if the nativists have their way, this would not have been possible at all. I would have had to choose between being with my wife, or supporting a dying parent. I once asked a Labour MP how inflicting such choices on people (which their making the family visa routes more restrictive would absolutely do) increased social cohesion, or benefited the country in any way at all. They had no answer.

And this is a fairly minor instance. Across the US, Trump deportations are tearing wives from husbands, parents from children. All cheered on by the party of ‘family values.’ In the UK, for a foreign spouse to have legal status you must meet a certain income threshold. Effectively removing the right to family life from the poorest half of the country. I was just able to avoid the above choice, many are not. If the Tory Lam/Philip plan were enacted, 4-7 million legal residents would be deported, leaving perhaps 10-15 million families devastated.

Ultimately, nativism is not some universal and inevitable feeling. It does not reflect some core human need. Travel does—throughout history people have moved away from bad situations, and towards the hope of better ones. We have sought out new experiences and adventure. Family does—most of us need others, we want to give and receive love. Nativism is a perversion directly hostile to both. Indeed, in our world today it is arguably the greatest threat to them. Its exploitation by fascists is the greatest threat to free societies and free political systems.

And the anti-immigrant forces, in our current moment, are over extended. Brits listened to anti-immigrant campaigners and destroyed their economy. Most Americans are, at very best, uneasy about masked men abducting people from the streets. The world over, we are seeing the results of this ideology and they’re appalling. Nativism has always been a form of social suicide, but it packaged itself as serious, necessery, and respectable. Now it’s increasingly, and increasingly obviously, unhinged. Public opinion is already starting to drift our way, and that's before people have heard a full-throated progressive case. If we hit back hard—and directly—I think we might find the enemy line much weaker than was imagined.

Looking forward

Immigration is a good thing. It makes us wealthier, healthier, and more free. It is best understood as mutually beneficial deals between states.

We should, as in the UKs case, re-enter such deals where we left them. We can reverse our national decline any time we choose. And then we should pursue other deals on top of that. I think that gets us away from the framing of ‘letting people in’—rather, countries come to an arrangement that allows greater freedom for both.

In the US case, I know proposing a North American free movement block sounds unbelievably radical now. But, in an age of increasingly ‘two teams’ politics, I wonder if that became our side's position the base would rally to it, in the same way the right’s has rallied to mass deportations. I also wonder—I don’t know, but I wonder—if the UK and US having, in different ways, really demonstrated the brutality and stupidity of nativism might have created an opening. If overflowing hospitals, or masked men on the streets, have been shocking enough that people are open to hearing an alternative who wouldn’t have been otherwise. Of course it would provoke real howls of outrage from reactionary centrists, but that dead-end worldview is what we have to move beyond.

It would also be coherent. What we are saying on immigration would match our values, match the positions we take on other issues. It could all fit within a coherent story of progress and pluralistic freedom. I’m not insensitive to the difficulties. The calculus for politicians is challenging. But that’s no excuse for the rest of us. Liberals shouldn’t tell liberals “that’ll never happen”. I don't know that this is a debate we can win, but I also don’t know that we can’t.

And just say we did—there’s no moral arc of the universe that bends towards greater freedom, but nor is there some natural nativism that rules it out. What if we won? What if 100 years from now the world was dominated by prosperous, egalitarian, liberal democracies, of different kinds, and with their own vibrant cultures, but joined together in an international order of large, overlapping free movement zones.

I think people in that world would look back at ours with disbelief, much like we look back at slavery and witch burnings. Developed countries using state violence to tear families apart on a massive scale, to place innocent people in inhuman conditions, all so the remaining population can live poorer and die younger, will appear to them—correctly—as a sort of moral madness. It will be almost unfathomable to them why the majority of people thought such a thing was justifiable, much less necessary. Our current politics will be intelligible only as a mass psychosis into which entire nations fell.

These future people will also finally be able to assess nativism for what it is. A disgusting morbidity. The claim that, for the nativist to be happy, the state must restrict the life choices of everyone else, will sound perverse and preposterous to them. One of those semi-criminal, semi-pathological desires one hands over with a shudder to specialists in personality disorders.

The barriers between us and that future are those of beliefs. Much of what is holding us back on the liberal side is fear, and various insecurities. The fear at least I can understand. But we have seen the results of surrendering the field to the nativists. Of only offering cautious rebuttals, without a values-driven vision of our own. Of implicitly conceding that this is just how “real” people feel. It hasn’t worked, and it’s time to try something different.

A much better world is possible. A more prosperous one in which states do not sabotage their own economies at the behest of bigots. Where people willing to travel for opportunity can do so, and benefit everyone in the process. Where an aging population does not mean those with terminal cancer, or in cognitive decline, must live out their final years in indignity, fear, or squalor. Where young people can seek experience and adventure, and older people can retire where they wish. Where we can find love, and form families, across borders without harassment. A world, in a word, that is free.

The surge dramatically expands the federal law enforcement footprint in Minnesota amid heightened political and community tensions. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Acting Director Todd Lyons, during an interview with Newsmax, called the crackdown the agency’s “largest immigration operation ever.”

Neither Lyons nor Department of Homeland Security Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said how many officers were involved.

A person briefed on the operation told The Associated Press the Department of Homeland Security plans to dispatch as many as 2,000 officers to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. The person was not authorized to publicly discuss operational details and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Immigrant rights groups and elected officials in the Twin Cities reported a sharp increase Tuesday in sightings of federal agents, notably around St. Paul. Numerous agents’ vehicles were reported making traffic stops, outside area businesses and apartment buildings.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was also present and accompanied ICE officers during at least one arrest. A video posted on X showed Noem wearing a tactical vest and knit cap as agents arrested a man in St. Paul. In the video, she tells the handcuffed man: “You will be held accountable for your crimes.”

The Department of Homeland Security said in a news release that the man was from Ecuador and was wanted in his homeland and Connecticut on charges including murder and sexual assault. It said agents arrested 150 people Monday in enforcement actions in Minneapolis.

Walz blasts surge

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, criticized the federal enforcement surge as “a war that’s being waged against Minnesota.”

“You’re seeing that we have a ridiculous surge of apparently 2,000 people not coordinating with us, that are for a show of cameras,” Walz told reporters in Minneapolis on Tuesday, a day after announcing he was ending his campaign for a third term.

Many residents were already on edge. The Trump administration has singled out the area’s Somali community, the largest in the U.S.,. Last month, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara criticized federal agents for using “questionable methods” following a confrontation between agents and protesters.

Molly Coleman, a St. Paul City Council member whose district includes a manufacturing plant where agents arrested more than a dozen people in November, said Tuesday was “unlike any other day we’ve experienced.”

“It’s incredibly distressing,” Coleman said. “What we know happens when ICE comes into a city, it’s an enforcement in which every single person is on guard and afraid.”

Julia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said there had been an increase in sightings of federal agents and enforcement vehicles in locations like parking lots.

“We can definitely a feel a heavier presence,” said Dieu Do, an organizer with the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee, which dispatches response teams to reports of agents.

Includes investigators focused on fraud

Roughly three-quarters of the enforcement personnel are expected to come from ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, which carries out immigration arrests and deportations, said the person with knowledge of the operation. The force also includes agents from Homeland Security Investigations, ICE’s investigative arm, which typically focuses on fraud and cross-border criminal networks.

HSI agents were going door-to-door in the Twin Cities area investigating allegations of fraud, human smuggling and unlawful employment practices, Lyons said.

The HSI agents are largely expected to concentrate on identifying suspected fraud, while deportation officers will conduct arrests of immigrants accused of violating immigration law, according to the person briefed on the operation. Specialized tactical units are also expected to be involved.

The operation also includes personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, the person familiar with the deployment said. Bovino’s tactics during previous federal operations in other cities have drawn scrutiny from local officials and civil rights advocates.

Hilton drops hotel that canceled reservations

Hilton said in a statement Tuesday that it was removing a Minnesota hotel from its systems for “not meeting our standards and values” when it denied service to federal agents.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville hotel, about 20 miles outside Minneapolis, apologized Monday for canceling the reservations of federal agents, saying it would work to accommodate them. The hotel, like the majority of Hampton Inns, is owned and operated by a franchisee.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville did not respond to requests for comment.

Federal authorities began increasing immigration arrests in the Minneapolis area late last year. Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel announced last week that federal agencies were intensifying operations in Minnesota, with an emphasis on fraud investigations.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly linked his administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota to fraud cases involving federal nutrition and pandemic aid programs, many of which have involved defendants with roots in Somalia.

It is the largest such detention facility in California.

Since its opening early last year, the detention center — which is operated by the company CoreCivic via a contract with U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) — has become one of the most notorious facilities.

In November, detainees held in California City brought a class action lawsuit alleging, among other things, that the staff there “routinely engage in abusive behavior and unreasonable use of force.” It also alleges that people “are routinely subjected to solitary confinement for conduct that should not be punished at all.”

On Dec. 19, California Attorney General Rob Bonta wrote a letter to the Trump Administration detailing “dangerous and inadequate living conditions” endured by detainees. If even half of what he says is true, it should be intolerable. We should have learned from the horrors of slavery and the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II that treating humans in an inhumane way leaves an indelible stain on our history.

And, unless something is done quickly to address the situation, things in immigration detention are going to get worse.

Trump’s inhumane plan

Late last month, The Washington Post ran a story about a Trump Administration immigrant detention plan so cruel that it could have been ripped from the pages of the Marquis de Sade’s playbook for sadism. The plan is to dramatically expand the number of facilities in which immigrants can be warehoused by using actual warehouses to hold them.

The administration hopes to utilize these facilities to expedite the movement of individuals from the moment they are picked up by ICE agents to the moment they are deported.

“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” ICE Acting Director Todd M. Lyons told The Post. The article also states that the goal of the administration is “to deport immigrants as efficiently as Amazon moves packages.”

“Like Prime, but with human beings,” Lyons said.

Human beings treated like packages?

We must say, “not in the United States.” It is time for Congress to hold hearings to shed light on the cruelty currently happening in these facilities and halt the administration’s warehouse plan.

As The Post notes, “Such structures are designed for storage and shipping, not human habitation ... (for) thousands of full-time residents.”

Lawless places

It is already clear that existing ICE detention facilities across the country are lawless places not fit for human habitation. The immigrants who are housed there are being subject to dreadful conditions of confinement.

Remember Alligator Alcatraz? PBS reminds us that “President Donald Trump toured (the Everglades Detention Facility) in July and suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide.”

A few months after that well-publicized tour, Alligator Alcatraz has become a nightmare for people who are sent there. Amnesty International notes that they “are living in inhuman and unsanitary conditions ... (M)edical care is inconsistent, inadequate or denied all together.” Moreover, people held there are “always shackled when they were outside their cage.”

Meanwhile, the ICE facility at Fort Bliss, Texas — the largest such facility in the country — “is a massive tent camp … located in the middle of the desert on a military base.”

In December, the American Civil Liberties Union sent a letter to ICE and to relevant Congressional Committees about Fort Bliss alleging that “detained immigrants are held for weeks at a time ... in cramped, squalid soft-sided tents with 72 people per unit, where toilets and showers flood eating areas with raw sewage.

“As immigrants detained at Ft. Bliss report, officers have beaten detainees and used threats of violence, criminal charges and imprisonment in attempts to coerce people held at Ft. Bliss to leave the United States and cross the border into Mexico.”

We can’t expect the courts to stop such treatment because prior judicial decisions suggest that detainees have less legal protection than prisoners. Because their detention is not regarded as punitive, it is not covered by the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.

But as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held more than 20 years ago: “(A civil) detainee is entitled to ‘more considerate treatment’ than his criminally-detained counterparts.“ And, according to the court, a civil detainee should not be “confined in conditions identical to, similar to or more restrictive than those in which criminal counterparts are held.”

Today, I am not confident that today’s Supreme Court would apply such a principle to people in Trump’s immigration detention gulag. That is why it is up to the American people and Congress to reject what the administration is doing in California City, Alligator Alcatraz, Fort Bliss and other detention centers.

Humans, whatever their immigration status, should never be treated as “packages.”",https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/public/incoming/9fke9k/picture313788624/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/6b4f79c6-d7a1-4803-a314-8979950cb8e0,N,,2026-01-07 09:57:33.355424

Sebastian, who asked to be identified by his first name because of his ongoing immigration case, says he was happy to learn U.S. forces had captured President Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela in the early hours of Jan. 3.

""I felt a relief, because I thought that there'd be a radical change in the country,"" he told NPR. ""Maybe things were going to be different.""

But in a press conference later that day, President Trump said his administration had a conversation with Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro's deputy and vice president. Trump said his administration was working with her toward U.S. plans to run the country.

That announcement left Sebastian disappointed. He said he feels the danger is still as present in Venezuela.

But the Trump administration says it is safe for Venezuelans to go back to their country, especially those who were in the U.S. with temporary protected status, or TPS. The administration ended the program for more than 600,000 Venezuelans last year, saying then that conditions in the country had improved.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, told Fox News on Sunday, ""the great news for those who are here from Venezuela on temporary protected status is that now they can go home with hope for their country — a country that they love — that there is going to be peace, prosperity and stability.""

But Sebastian, who came to the U.S. in 2023 and had TPS, said that does not make sense.

""The Trump administration has been saying for a year the conditions have changed for good in Venezuela,"" Sebastian said. ""But I would ask, if the U.S. has to extract a man who took over the government, how am I supposed to believe that the situation in Venezuela is good? It's contradictory, I see the opposite — the situation is worse.""

The Department of State has advised U.S. citizens not to travel to Venezuela ""due to severe risks to Americans, including wrongful detention, torture in detention, terrorism, kidnapping, arbitrary enforcement of local laws, crime, civil unrest, and poor health infrastructure.""

On Monday, at least 14 journalists — most from international news organizations — were detained in Venezuela, according to Venezuela's National Union of Press Workers. There are also reports that armed groups are already working to suppress any support for Maduro's ouster.

Luis Falcón said going back to Venezuela under these conditions can put those returning at extreme risk. He came to the U.S. in 2017 after fleeing persecution.

He used to work for the Presidential Honor Guard, the security detail assigned to presidents and their family members. But after retiring in 2009, he started to join protests against the Maduro government. Authorities threatened him with jail time for betraying the country, and he decided to leave Venezuela.

""I'm grateful for the big step taken in Venezuela,"" Falcón said. ""But this is the beginning of the end. There's still a long road ahead for Venezuela to become a country of liberties, opportunities and justice for those Venezuelans who have been part of the opposition.""

He said returning now is impossible.

""Putting a foot back in Venezuela means I will be taken to jail, tortured, and potentially killed,"" Falcón said.

He says TPS should be restored for Venezuelans until there's a transition of government there. But the Trump administration has doubled down that Venezuelans in the country with temporary status must leave.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in an interview with Fox News on Sunday that ""Venezuela today is more free than it was yesterday."" She added that every individual under TPS ""has the opportunity to apply for refugee status and that evaluation will go forward.""

However, immigration attorneys said that's misleading.

""Saying that someone can apply for refugee status within the U.S. — the generous interpretation is that she misspoke,"" said Lily Axelrod, an immigration lawyer based in Memphis, Tenn. ""The less generous interpretation is that she doesn't know what she's talking about or is lying.""

To apply for refugee status, she says, an immigrant must be outside the U.S. Axelrod said Venezuelans in the U.S. could still apply for asylum, although that could be a challenge, especially after the Trump administration paused all asylum decisions in November.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x1688+0+142/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9a%2F19%2F70374f9d4974a2a7f4dcefb6101f%2F260105-nyre-josealvaradojr-30.JPG,N,,2026-01-07 08:57:33.590085

The challenge to Trump’s tariffs has been one of the most closely watched cases on the court’s docket amid the broader impact on the global economy.

In a social media post on Friday, Trump said such a ruling would be a “terrible blow” to the US.

“Because of Tariffs, our Country is financially, AND FROM A NATIONAL SECURITY STANDPOINT, FAR STRONGER AND MORE RESPECTED THAN EVER BEFORE,” Trump said in another post on Monday.

However, data on this is mixed. The US gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 4.3 percent in the third quarter of 2025, marking the biggest increase in two years. Meanwhile, US job growth has slowed, with sectors heavily exposed to tariffs seeing little to no job growth.

“Jobs in sectors with higher import exposure grew more slowly than jobs in sectors with lower import exposure, suggesting tariffs may have weighed on employment,” Johannes Matschke, senior economist for the Kansas City branch of the Federal Reserve, said in an analysis in December.

Legal arguments

Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) in February 2025 on goods imported from individual countries to address, what he called, a national emergency related to US trade deficits.

Arguments challenging the legality of the decision began in November. At the time, the court’s liberal and some conservative justices had doubts about the legality of using the 1977 act.

Justice Neil Gorsuch, whom Trump appointed during his first term, was among those sceptical.

“Congress, as a practical matter, can’t get this power back once it’s handed it over to the president,” Gorsuch said at the time.

Chief Justice John Roberts told Solicitor General D John Sauer, who argued on behalf of the administration, that imposing tariffs and taxes “has always been the core power of Congress”.

The act grants broad executive authority to wield economic power in the case of a national emergency.

The matter reached the Supreme Court after the lower courts ruled against the Trump administration, finding that the use of the law exceeded the administration’s authority.

Among the courts that ruled against the White House was the Court of International Trade. In May, the New York court said that Congress, and not the executive branch, has “exclusive authority to regulate commerce”. This decision was upheld in a Washington, DC, appeals court in August.

Legal experts believe it is likely that the high court will uphold lower court decisions.

“My sense is that, given the different justices’ concerns, the Supreme Court will decide that IEEPA does not provide the ability for the Trump administration to adopt the tariffs,” Greg Shaffer, a law professor at Georgetown University, told Al Jazeera.

If the Trump administration were to lose the case, the US would need to refund some of the tariffs.

“It [ruling against the administration] would mean that those who paid tariffs that were imposed illegally would have to be reimbursed. I would think that that would be the outcome,” Shaffer added.

In September, Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent said on NBC’s Meet the Press that the US would “have to give a refund on about half the tariffs”.

There’s more to come in 2026. The lawsuits are part of a coordinated legal strategy by Democratic AGs in 22 states and the District of Columbia to resist the ever-widening power of the executive branch.

It’s not unusual for states to sue an administration; the party not in the White House has often turned to the courts. But it’s one of the few pathways for Democrats now, since Republicans hold the presidency, both chambers of Congress and have appointed a majority of the U.S. Supreme Court. And Trump in his second term has taken a much broader view of presidential power than previous administrations, asserting far more authority than his predecessors.

Democrats hope to retake at least one chamber of Congress in November’s midterm elections. But for most of the coming year, the party will be relying on AG court challenges as their main venue to take on Trump.

‘A boundless power’: Democratic states ask Supreme Court to halt Trump troop deployment to Chicago

One of the most prolific AGs is Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield, who has led or joined 52 lawsuits against this Trump administration.

“It’s not a slogan or a political brand,” Rayfield said of the coalition in an email interview with Stateline. “It’s a working partnership. When we coordinate, we’re able to defend the constitutional balance, push back when a president overreaches, and make sure our residents aren’t left paying the price for unlawful decisions coming out of Washington.”

The state AGs have brought cases over Trump’s tariffs and National Guard deployments. They’ve also fought cuts to federal research, education programs, food assistance, disaster recovery, health care and housing. And they say it’s their job to maintain core civil rights protections as well as stick up for the people in their state who, they argue, are harmed by the whims of the president’s executive orders.

“None of the institutions in our government have been built to respond and react to the scale and speed of the destruction that’s being wrought by the Trump administration,” New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez told Source New Mexico.

Since the beginning of 2025, the attorneys general have toured the country on multistate listening tours and have touted their accomplishments on progressive legal podcasts. They’ve won 40 of the 51 resolved cases, according to a tracker from the Progressive State Leaders Committee.

The AGs are not alone in taking legal action. Individuals, businesses, labor unions, associations, universities, local governments and other entities have filed 554 cases against the president’s expansion of executive branch powers, according to Just Security, a daily digital law policy journal with a litigation tracker that monitors challenges to Trump administration executive actions.

But the attorney general coalition serves as “a coordinated, quick-moving and high-capacity force protecting the rule of law, federal funding streams, and people’s rights,” said Jonathan Miller, chief program officer of the Public Rights Project, which helps state and local governments partner on litigation that protects and advances civil rights.

The attorneys general have proven such a successful coalition that the Public Rights Project is adopting a similar approach that makes it easier for cities and counties to pool expertise, coordinate legal theories and act collectively, Miller said.

“The rule of law is ultimately about people,” Miller said. “When courts enforce the law, families stay housed, public health and emergency services stay open, and local leaders can govern without political coercion. That’s the foundation for restoring faith in democratic institutions: making the legal system work the way it’s supposed to for the people it’s supposed to serve.”

Immediate action

Democratic AGs began filing their multistate lawsuits the day after Trump took office, challenging the president’s executive order ending birthright citizenship. The immediate legal action was intended to send a clear message to the Trump administration that state attorneys general will “stand up for our residents and their basic constitutional rights,” New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin said in a statement at the time. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments in the case this spring.

Rayfield said some days their work aims to build an emergency firewall to halt unlawful presidential actions — such as deploying the National Guard. Other days, it’s more targeted, fact-driven litigation designed to keep money, benefits and services flowing to states.

In December, Rayfield, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Washington Attorney General Nick Brown led a coalition of 19 attorneys general and the governor of Pennsylvania in challenging the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for threatening to punish doctors, hospitals and clinics that provide gender-affirming care.

Democratic AGs sue DOJ to receive federal funding for victims of violent crimes

In early November, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments from Oregon’s then-solicitor general, Benjamin Gutman, who argued on behalf of a coalition of a dozen states that sued over Trump’s sweeping tariff policy on most goods entering the United States. Rayfield and Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes began discussing a tariff lawsuit in April, before a joint appearance at a town hall in Oregon. Both had been considering it, but it was their in-person discussion that led to the collaboration, Mayes said during a panel discussion hosted by the “Legal AF” podcast on the MeidasTouch Network.

“This is not what I get up every day wanting to do,” Mayes told Cronkite News outside the Supreme Court, after Gutman argued the tariff case. “But if Donald Trump decides to violate the Constitution, violate statute, or harm the people of Arizona, I’m going to file that lawsuit.”

After Trump’s 2024 election, Democratic attorneys general began meeting almost daily over Zoom to prepare their legal approach for a second term. This time around, they had a better sense for what was coming because it was outlined in Project 2025, the conservative blueprint that has shaped much of the Trump administration’s agenda so far.

As they enter their second year of legal collaboration, the AGs continue to meet regularly, but because they’ve developed close working relationships, it’s at a “more sustainable cadence,” Rayfield said.

Republicans sue, too

Republican attorneys general say they, too, are taking action to protect state sovereignty. Alaska Attorney General Stephen Cox wrote in an op-ed in The Washington Post in November that lawsuits emerging from progressive states, particularly state- and municipal-driven cases in state courts over climate change, are “as much of a threat to state sovereignty as the federal government” as well as an attempt to “remake the nation in the image of progressive enclaves such as San Francisco and Portland, Oregon.”

“They reach into states like Alaska with their rules and regulations,” Cox wrote. “They push misguided legal theories targeting ordinary Americans. And they file lawsuits that would give state courts in ideologically aligned jurisdictions the chance to control the economies of states like mine.”

Republican attorneys general have been largely supportive of the president’s second-term agenda, including supporting the deployment of out-of-state National Guard troops to protect federal facilities. Led by Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, Republican attorneys general in 26 states sent a letter in support of such a mobilization in June in Los Angeles, describing it as “the right response — and one we fully support.” And as recently as October, Republican attorneys general in 16 states wrote a letter supporting the Trump administration’s attacks on boats it says are smuggling drugs in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean.

State attorneys general have long taken on the executive branch, no matter who was in power.

Democratic attorneys general filed 138 multistate lawsuits against federal agencies during Trump’s first administration, according to a 2020 assessment by Paul Nolette, a political scientist at Marquette University in Milwaukee.

And some Republican attorneys general were especially litigious during the Biden administration. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton famously sued the Biden administration 106 times, including a suit challenging the administration’s offshore drilling policy in the final days of the presidency. Paxton followed in the footsteps of his Republican predecessor, now-Gov. Greg Abbott, who sued the Obama administration 31 times as a Republican attorney general: “I go to the office. I sue the federal government. Then I go home,” he told The Dallas Morning News in 2012.

20 state AGs sue feds for tying transportation and disaster funding to immigration enforcement

Attorneys general in more progressive states say their actions during the current administration have kept their states from losing billions of dollars in federal funds that would have otherwise been blocked for schools, public health, domestic violence prevention and other services. In Oregon, it’s an estimated $4.5 billion, Rayfield said. Arizona estimates it has held on to $1.5 billion. In California, it’s $168 billion.

In Oregon, one of the lawsuit hearings this fall drew an audience so large that an overflow courtroom adjacent to a packed main federal courtroom was needed. A crowd quietly watched arguments on a video display as lawyers for the state of Oregon and the city of Portland argued that the Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard troops was not only a vast federal overreach, but also a threat to state sovereignty and public safety.

The administration said it deployed the Guard to protect federal agents, including those from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But when an attorney for the U.S. Justice Department described protesters as “vicious and cruel radicals” for their demonstrations outside of an ICE facility in Portland, the phrase elicited muffled snickers from the otherwise decorous courtroom observers.

Among the protesters dominating news reports and social media feeds was a 20-something in a chicken costume. Other peaceful protesters spawned a new symbol of resistance: inflatable frog costumes. And naked bike riders rolled up en masse to the ICE facility, too, braving a cold, wet day and exposure on Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show.”

But the issue in front of U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut was no laughing matter.

Oregon’s lawsuit challenging Trump’s National Guard deployment was a critical public safety outcome for the state, Rayfield said. It prevented troops from mobilizing in Portland, forestalling what he described as “the kind of escalation that could have caused real harm.”

Attorneys general are prepared in 2026 to monitor and enforce their courtroom victories, Rayfield said. He and other state officials and local prosecutors have warned U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi that excessive force by DHS officers won’t be tolerated during immigration enforcement activities. If warranted, they’ll refer them for prosecution, he said.

“That isn’t just a legal win — it’s a safety win,” Rayfield said. “The president cannot use federalization as a shortcut to move troops into American cities without lawful cause. That matters for Portland, and it matters for every state watching what happened here.”",https://stateline.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Democratic-AGs.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 09:57:40.751053

Tim Walz said, his decision to end his bid for a third term as Minnesota’s governor came down to this: Facing a torrent of threats and taunts from the Trump administration over a fraud scandal that has plagued the state’s social services system, he concluded that abandoning his political campaign might shield his constituents from further harm.

“I don’t think any governor in history has had to fight a war against the federal government every single day,” Mr. Walz told reporters on Tuesday in his first lengthy remarks about his decision, announced on Monday, to quit the race.

The announcement came a few weeks after the White House began portraying Mr. Walz, a former vice-presidential candidate and member of Congress, as an avatar of Democratic misgovernance. In early December, federal agencies began threatening to cut funding for Minnesota programs in response to a sprawling criminal investigation into fraud in a Covid-19 program meant to feed children and other safety net programs overseen by the state. Federal prosecutors have asserted that as much as $9 billion might have been stolen.

The White House simultaneously launched an immigration crackdown in Minnesota as the president railed against the state’s Somali diaspora, noting that a majority of defendants charged in the fraud cases are of Somali origin. Last week, Republicans on Capitol Hill scheduled a hearing about Minnesota’s fraud scandal, and demanded that Mr. Walz testify.

Mr. Walz, who was first elected in 2018 and whose current term in office will end early next year, pledged to continue tightening oversight of safety net programs that proved easy to defraud. Speaking defiantly, he also said that his critics should not expect him to spend his remaining year in office being cowed.

“I have more energy today than I’ve ever had,” Mr. Walz, 61, told reporters at Tuesday’s news conference, where he and colleagues announced the rollout of a new paid family and medical leave program for the state, one of his signature legislative initiatives. “I am committed to this state more than I have ever been.”

Being unburdened from the constraints and demands of a campaign, he said, would allow him to focus on fighting fraud and protecting immigrants and L.G.B.T.Q. Minnesotans in the months ahead.

“The attacks on Minnesota are far beyond me, and it’s hurting Minnesotans,” said Mr. Walz, who called the president’s insults toward Somalis in the state “absolutely unconscionable.”

Asked to respond to the governor’s comments, a White House spokeswoman said the administration’s efforts to combat fraud and illegal immigration in Minnesota would continue.

“Dropping out of the race won’t shield him from the consequences of his actions,” the spokeswoman, Abigail Jackson, said in an emailed statement, which urged the governor to apologize for allowing “tax dollars to be misused so badly.”

The governor said that Republicans in the closely split Legislature should brace for a confrontational session in the coming weeks, adding that he intends to press them to vote on gun control bills and other measures he feels strongly about.

“Expect for the next 11 months for me to ride you like you’ve never been ridden, to make sure that you’re doing your job,” he said.

Mr. Walz said he had decided to drop out of the race over the holidays after conversations with members of his family. In a podcast interview recorded Monday, his daughter, Hope Walz, said that the federal scrutiny of Minnesota reflects that “Trump just hates” her father.

Part of the reason he stepped aside was his belief that doing so stood to “kind of get that target off of Minnesota,” she said in the show “One Hour Detours.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/06/us/06nat-walz-speaks-1/06nat-walz-speaks-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 06:58:11.482885

Applicants must agree to the terms of the bond through the U.S. Treasury Department’s online payment platform, Pay.gov, the State Department said.

The U.S. government has said the bonds seek to deter visitors from overstaying their visas intended for tourism or business purposes.

According to the audit, the Department of Human Services distributed more than $425 million in grants to 830 grantees between July 1, 2022, and Dec. 31, 2024.

One auditor noted that several documents were created by the Behavioral Health Administration only after the audit began and had been backdated in response to document requests.

Two grantees were overpaid, and the Behavioral Health Administration paid some grantees for work performed before it fully executed the grant agreements, according to the audit. The agency also made payments to grantees for costs that were either not incurred or not properly supported by source documents.

In a survey of employees at the Behavioral Health Administration, the report says 73% of respondents said they did not receive sufficient training to manage grants.

""Executive leadership has repetitively shown staff that they won't take the staff's concerns or questions seriously until something serious happens or it makes the news,"" one employee wrote in the survey.

State Sen. Mark Koran, R-North Branch, a member of the Legislative Audit Commission, says the audit shows that Department of Human Services leadership ""failed at every level.""

""The OLA report shows a complete breakdown in how DHS's Behavioral Health Administration manages hundreds of millions in taxpayer-funded grants,"" Koran said. ""BHA failed to verify that grantees were providing the services they were paid for, failed to put basic financial controls in place, and then created documentation after the fact to mislead auditors.""

Temporary commissioner for the Department of Human Services, Shireen Gandhi, said she was ""shocked"" to learn the information included in the audit.

""With respect to the audit report, while it's upsetting that DHS has findings in areas we have placed concerted effort, the OLA's report highlights the importance of the grant compliance work already underway at the department. And the findings provide us with a road map for our focus going forward to continue strengthening oversight and integrity of behavioral health grants,"" Gandhi said. ""I take the report seriously, I accept responsibility for the findings, and I will ensure DHS closes the findings.""

The report comes amid a widening fraud scandal in the state. Criticism about Minnesota's fraud caused Gov. Tim Walz to announce on Monday that he is dropping his bid to be reelected to a third term.

On Sunday, the Trump administration began a massive deployment of hundreds of DHS agents to the Twin Cities area. Agents deployed from Homeland Security Investigations are expected to look into alleged fraud cases following last month's investigation by federal agents in Minneapolis that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said was for ""child care and other rampant fraud.""

More than 90 people face federal charges as a result of fraud schemes that have been uncovered in Minnesota since 2021. Prosecutors estimate the total amount of fraud could reach $9 billion. The scandal started with a $250 million COVID-era scheme involving a nonprofit called Feeding Our Future, which was accused of stealing from the Federal Child Nutrition Program.

Since then, federal prosecutors have uncovered ""large-scale fraud"" in a housing program for seniors and people with disabilities, and a program that provides services to children with autism. The Trump administration is also probing claims of fraud by day care centers in Minnesota, which gained national attention after a conservative YouTube personality named Nick Shirley posted a video that showed him visiting federally backed child care centers around Minneapolis and finding no children there.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/12/04/3e591d27-7363-4260-a4c2-7fddcbc90859/thumbnail/1200x630g8/75f5365ffce9a29d4ae2457a0fc61ec5/gettyimages-2237567426.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 01:57:19.185133

But the data available for 2025 show ICE agents in Hawaiʻi conducted 194 arrests between Jan. 8 and Oct. 15, up from 52 arrests the year before under the Biden administration.
Based on the available 2025 data, there were an average of 20 arrests per month in Hawaiʻi last year, compared to four per month in 2024.
By May, ICE had conducted 128 arrests in Hawaiʻi; 31 arrests were made over the same period in 2024.
The ICE data does not specify where most of the at-large arrests occurred.","Updated tallies are not yet complete but already eclipse those in 2024. Data show immigration arrests are increasingly likely to take place at ICE offices and at the state’s civil court houses.

Arrests and removals by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Hawaiʻi through October were quadruple those in all of 2024, based on ICE operations data.

The exact numbers for the full calendar year won’t be available until mid-March due to delays in data releases by the Department of Homeland Security. But the data available for 2025 show ICE agents in Hawaiʻi conducted 194 arrests between Jan. 8 and Oct. 15, up from 52 arrests the year before under the Biden administration.

Those numbers are certain to rise. They do not include dozens of arrests made on Kauaʻi in early November at six properties in Kapahi and Kalāheo used as workforce housing by a cleaning contractor, Hawaii Care and Cleaning Inc.

Citizens of Mexico made up nearly a quarter of all those detained by ICE in Hawaiʻi so far in 2025, followed by Chinese nationals, and citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia. But more than 100 other nationalities were represented.

Arrests increasingly occurred when people came to ICE offices for mandatory check-ins or turned up at state courthouses on matters unrelated to immigration, Neribel Chardon, a senior staff attorney with The Legal Clinic, said Monday.

Chardon, one of a handful of pro bono attorneys in Hawaiʻi, said ICE personnel can usually find some grounds for arresting someone. That can include failing to update contact details with the immigration court or missing a notice to appear.

Those decisions are hard for attorneys to appeal, she said, “because the person failed to comply with their obligations, and they ended up in detention.”

She said she had not seen an increase in arrests in immigration court as had been reported in other states.

The data was obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the UCLA Center for Immigration Law and Policy Deportation Data Project and dates back to Sept.1, 2023. Arrests or apprehensions made by U.S. Customs and Border Protection at ports of entry, including airports, are not included in the count.

Based on the available 2025 data, there were an average of 20 arrests per month in Hawaiʻi last year, compared to four per month in 2024. The uptick began immediately after the Trump inauguration on Jan. 20. By May, ICE had conducted 128 arrests in Hawaiʻi; 31 arrests were made over the same period in 2024.

Until the 44 Kauaʻi arrests in November, May was officially the month with the highest number of arrests – 34. Almost all of them took place on May 6 and 7 when ICE agents detained workers from Central America at coffee plantations on the Big Island.

The data shows that most of the arrests this year were “at-large”, meaning they occurred in public spaces such as courts, streets and workplaces, rather than in facilities where people are already incarcerated.

The ICE data does not specify where most of the at-large arrests occurred.

Asked for comment, ICE responded with an emailed statement last week that arrests reflected the agency’s “mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens to make America safe. So far, DHS has arrested over 622,000 illegal aliens, and we have no plans of stopping or slowing down.”

After that initial surge in immigration arrests in Hawaiʻi in the first five months of the Trump administration, arrests dropped off from June through October, when agents made 61 arrests — or about half as many. That ran counter to the trend nationally, where the rate of administrative arrests increased by about 60%, according to analysis by The Washington Post.

Some jurisdictions saw far greater spikes.

The District of Columbia saw a fivefold increase in arrests, the highest in the nation according to the Deportation Data Project, while New Mexico saw a fourfold increase.

Montana was the only other state that saw a fall in administrative arrests similar to Hawaiʻi, but the number of arrests in Montana and Hawaiʻi is relatively small compared to states like Texas, skewing percentage comparisons.

ICE media did not respond to a question about the downturn. Analysis of the same data by the Prison Policy Institute found that arrest rates were higher in states that fully cooperated with the Trump administration, which has set a goal of 3,000 immigration arrests per day.

Current estimates are that ICE is detaining 1,000 people per day, and there are approximately 605,000 people in detention nationwide.

Forced Removals And Voluntary Departures Up

Other indicators published by the Deportation Data Project and the tracreports.org site at Syracuse University also show how overall increases in immigration enforcement under the Trump administration have played out in the islands.

Those include an uptick in both the number of requests by ICE to Hawaiʻi authorities, such as county police, to detain individuals for 48 hours. By mid-October ICE in Hawaiʻi had requested 71 detainers, 22 more than the 49 requested during 2024.

Detainer requests are the legal mechanism for holding individuals until ICE agents can take them into custody for alleged immigration or criminal violations. In some mainland jurisdictions, local law enforcement has notified ICE about individuals in their custody who they suspect might also have immigration violations, under memoranda of understanding with the Department of Homeland Security.

Local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration actions has been controversial across the islands. In response, representatives of local law enforcement said last April they were not actively participating in immigration enforcement operations under existing agreements with DHS — other than complying with the detainers.

Detainers for people being held in cells at the Honolulu Police Department and the Oʻahu Community Correctional Facility make up over 40% of the running total for 2025. There was also a large increase in the average daily number of inmates held in the Honolulu federal detention center, which houses ICE detainees, including some from the mainland.

The average daily number of ICE detainees at FDC Honolulu in January 2025 was 15. At the end of November, it was 81, according to agency data published on tracreports.org.

As of Oct. 15, ICE data showed 218 individuals had been booked into FDC Honolulu, exceeding the 130 detainees booked in during 2024. That number includes detainees arrested by ICE on the mainland housed at the Honolulu facility while awaiting proceedings.

In July, ICE issued a departmental memo requiring the mandatory detention of all immigrants who entered the United States without inspection, a move that also restricts their access to bond hearings before an immigration judge.

Chardon said it has been increasingly difficult to get her clients released on bond under the revised guidelines, even though there was evidence that federal judges were pushing back on the mandatory detention policy, according to reporting by Politico.

The federal Bureau of Prisons agreed to provide 125 beds to the Department of Homeland Security under a new agreement approved in February, Civil Beat confirmed. That’s resulted in ICE detainees from as far away as Florida being temporarily housed there, local immigration attorneys said.

Of those booked into the Honolulu facility in 2025 up to mid-October, 121 were detained for alleged immigration violations, 66 had previous criminal convictions, and 31 had pending criminal charges.

The data also shows that more people were removed by ICE or chose to leave Hawaiʻi voluntarily in 2025 than in 2024, however the total won’t be available until mid-March.

The final disposition of 224 people released from FDC Honolulu so far in 2025 is shown in a dataset of “Detention Stints” — a log of when detainees were booked in and booked out, and the reason for their release from Honolulu, including transfers to a facility elsewhere. That number includes people arrested in 2024 and released in 2025.

As of Oct. 15, 106 people had been deported from Hawaiʻi, compared to 113 forced removals in all of 2024. But using a daily rate to measure the difference in the rates of removals year-over-year, 143 people could be expected to have been deported by Dec. 31 — a 35% increase over 2024.

Already, far more people have chosen to depart voluntarily in 2025 than in 2024, with 30 leaving so far, compared to two individuals the previous year.

The Trump administration is promoting a self-deportation program that offers undocumented people a $3,000 payment and a free flight to their destination.

“We encourage every person here illegally to take advantage of this offer and reserve the chance to come back to the U.S. the right, legal way to live the American dream,” the ICE emailed statement said.

Chardon said that voluntary self-removal could be risky for undocumented people looking to get safely out of the U.S. because they could still be arrested and detained if Customs and Border Patrol agents at the airport determine they had entered the country illegally.",https://d1l18ops95qbzp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/2025/11/26113616/IMG_6805-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 02:57:06.528821

Reyes noted that Secretary of State Marco Rubio identified “immediate security challenges” in the country last year.
The DHS under the Trump administration has voided 12 designations for 11 countries, drawing lawsuits in courts across the country.
A New York judge blocked the agency last year from removing TPS protections early for Haitians in the US.
But the agency months later issued a Federal Register notice that it would remove protections when they’re set to expire in February, arguing that conditions had improved enough in the country to remove protections.
Reyes probed government lawyers over the decision to remove protections for Haitians.","A Washington, DC federal judge pressed lawyers for the Trump administration on how Haitian immigrants targeted for removal from the US could safely return to a country deemed unsafe for travel by the government.

Judge Ana C. Reyes noted that Secretary of State Marco Rubio identified “immediate security challenges” in the country last year. The Federal Aviation Administration prohibits civilian US aircraft from operating in portions of Haitian airspace because of security forces’ inability to prevent attacks from terrorist groups, she said.

“Can you explain to me how it’s safe to return to a country or live in a country when it’s not even safe to fly into that country?” she asked.

The District Court for the District of Columbia case is one of multiple legal challenges to the Department of Homeland Security’s termination of Temporary Protected Status for Haiti, stripping lawful status and work authorization for more than 350,000 Haitian immigrants in the US.

TPS allows immigrants from designated countries to stay in the US for up to 18 months when conditions like armed conflict make it unsafe to return. The DHS under the Trump administration has voided 12 designations for 11 countries, drawing lawsuits in courts across the country.

A New York judge blocked the agency last year from removing TPS protections early for Haitians in the US. But the agency months later issued a Federal Register notice that it would remove protections when they’re set to expire in February, arguing that conditions had improved enough in the country to remove protections.

Reyes probed government lawyers over the decision to remove protections for Haitians. When Justice Department attorney Dhruman Sampat said he wasn’t a foreign policy expert in response to her query on air travel, Reyes responded “I’m just asking as a matter of logic.”

She also asked why it’s a national interest to remove Haitians. The government has argued that the secretary has broad discretion to make determinations of the national interest that can’t be reviewed by the courts.

Reyes asked whether Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem could decide it’s in the national interest to remove Haitians because she “doesn’t like vanilla ice cream.” Sampat quipped that it could be a possible economic consideration for a decision.

“Listen to yourself,” Reyes said. “I understand you’re in a tough spot, but just take a breath and listen to yourself.”

Hearings on the litigation will continue Wednesday. Reyes said before adjourning that her critiques of government attorneys have generated significant press coverage. She added that counsel for DHS had done a “phenomenally good job” in the hearing.

Like the Hispanic and Latino communities, as well as other migrant groups across the U.S., Asian families live under constant threat of unlawful detentions, family separations, neglect, abuse and trauma at for-profit prisons.
In the 19th century, our nation’s first mass deportation laws targeted the surveillance, registration and detention of Chinese people living in the American West.
Last year, a survey by the Asian American Foundation reported that 63% of Asians now feel unsafe because of their race.
The five deaths of Asian nationals in ICE custody in 2025 are not just isolated tragedies.","More than 30 people died while being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in 2025, marking it as the deadliest year for those held in custody by the agency in two decades. At least five of the detainees who died were Asian nationals: Chaofeng Ge, Nhon Ngoc Nguyen, Tien Xuan Phan, Kaiyin Wong and Huabing Xie. So far their deaths have received little public attention, even as ICE increases raids, expands capacity at its facilities and accelerates deportations across the country.

As I grieve these deaths, I’ve also witnessed ways that mass deportations have induced palpable fear throughout the Asian American community. Like the Hispanic and Latino communities, as well as other migrant groups across the U.S., Asian families live under constant threat of unlawful detentions, family separations, neglect, abuse and trauma at for-profit prisons.

In August, ICE guards found 32-year-old Chaofeng Ge hanging in a shower stall at the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Philipsburg, Pa. Although investigators ruled Ge’s death a suicide, the autopsy report stated that he was found with his hands and feet tied behind his back. Despite these troubling circumstances, the federal government has yet to release the full records regarding Ge’s death to his family. Chaofeng’s brother filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit in November seeking transparency and accountability, and complained that the prison provided no Mandarin interpretation, leaving his brother isolated and possibly without access to medical care or mental healthcare while in custody.

Seven detainees at the California City Immigration Processing Center have made similar claims, accusing ICE of inhumane conditions inside its network of for-profit detention centers, including delayed medical care, inadequate food and water, and limited access to interpreters. Things are likely to only get worse unless the corporate profiteering that drives mass detention ends now.

Ge’s death points not only to the dangerous conditions inside ICE facilities, but also to the wider climate of terror that mass deportation policies have instilled in large segments of our community. Currently, 1 in 7 Asian immigrants living in the U.S. are undocumented and under imminent threat of removal, and undocumented Asian students represent a significant share of the population, accounting for approximately 16.5% of those eligible for DACA benefits.

Given the widespread and devastating impact of ICE arrests, more than 70% of Asian Americans now disapprove of President Trump’s immigration policies, arguing that his mass deportation practices have gone too far.

Trump’s policies are largely a continuation of immigration laws that have historically excluded Asian Americans. In the 19th century, our nation’s first mass deportation laws targeted the surveillance, registration and detention of Chinese people living in the American West. My family’s own immigration records from a century ago speak of my great-grand-uncle’s removal and of my grandparents’ detainment at the Angel Island Immigration Station in San Francisco.

Even though my grandfather was a native-born American citizen, his bride was imprisoned by armed guards for weeks because the government had racially profiled the two as illegal immigrants. White witnesses were required to testify on my grandfather’s birthright citizenship, and my grandmother was required to correctly answer a 56-question interrogation or else be deported. The poems of Chinese prisoners inscribed on the walls of the Angel Island immigration center speak to the fear and injustice that they and thousands more endured.

The use of deportations as a form of international segregation persists today as politicians rehearse old stereotypes to scapegoat and expel migrants. Once again charged as “criminal” and “invading armies,” a wide range of Asian groups face racialized deportation practices that deny them their rights and fracture families.

Consider Yunseo Chung, a 21-year-old Korean American student and lawful permanent U.S. resident. After she exercised her right to free speech while participating in student-led demonstrations at Columbia University, ICE moved to revoke Chung’s status and sought to deport her multiple times. Only when Chung sued the U.S. government to prevent her deportation did she gain a restraining order, blocking her removal.

Another innocent caught in this system is 6-year-old Yuanxin Zheng, a Chinese immigrant who arrived in New York City with his father in April. Even as they were following proper procedures to gain asylum, the family was forcibly separated by ICE on Nov. 26. Among the more than 2,600 children arrested this year by ICE, Yuanxin is one of the youngest. And although Yuanxin’s panic-stricken father was allowed a brief phone call with his son, he was left in the dark about his child’s whereabouts. ICE didn’t reunite the two until they were deported together, more than three weeks later.

Southeast Asian refugees also face a form of double jeopardy under the current administration’s policies. More than 15,000 Southeast Asians, many of whom served prison sentences for offenses committed in their youth, confront a second punishment: deportation orders.

For example, while serving 26 years in prison for murder, Phoeun You graduated from self-help programs, rebuilt his life and proved his commitment to change as he earned parole. Yet You never got to embrace his parents upon his release. Instead, he was immediately deported to Cambodia, a nation he never knew, and was permanently separated from his family. “I went from a life sentence to an eternal life sentence,” You told me when we spoke in February.

Last year, a survey by the Asian American Foundation reported that 63% of Asians now feel unsafe because of their race. ICE’s use of racial profiling and our nation’s xenophobic climate have undoubtedly contributed to these anxieties.

The five deaths of Asian nationals in ICE custody in 2025 are not just isolated tragedies. They reveal a system that has expanded faster than oversight can follow. Language barriers, delayed medical care and a lack of transparency inside detention centers have already had fatal consequences. This broken system does not make America safer but instead strikes fear throughout entire communities. ICE’s racial profiling and punitive enforcement practices do not bring about security but instead inflict lasting traumas on families and on generations like mine.

Ge’s passing demands justice — not only for his family, but for the end of for-profit prisons, of family separation and of the racist and violent enforcement of deportations. Each is a cruel and unusual punishment; together they constitute a morally bankrupt immigration system.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bbb1f49/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5125x2691+0+364/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F41%2F77%2Fe2eb709f40bda3433b47319364cc%2F2237821829.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 23:57:17.166086

In a statement, the department said the states’ access to those funds would be restricted pending further review.
“Our states should not be political pawns in a fight that Donald Trump seems to have with blue state governors,” New York governor Kathy Hochul said, adding the step was “vindictive” and “cruel”.
In recent weeks, the Trump administration has singled out Minnesota, alleging rampant fraud is being committed by immigrants in the welfare system and in social service programs.
Rights advocates say the Trump administration is using the fraud investigations as an excuse to target immigrants and political opponents more broadly.","Donald Trump’s administration is freezing more than $10bn in federal childcare and family assistance funds to California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said, citing what it called concerns about fraud and misuse.

“For too long, Democrat-led states and Governors have been complicit in allowing massive amounts of fraud to occur under their watch,” Andrew Nixon, HHS spokesperson, said in a statement.

The Trump administration has threatened federal funding cuts to organizations and states over a number of issues since taking office – ranging from alleged fraud in programs of states governed by Democrats to diversity initiatives and pro-Palestinian university protests against US ally Israel’s assault on Gaza.

On Tuesday, HHS said it notified the five states, all with Democratic governors, that its freeze applied to the “Child Care and Development Fund” worth $2.4bn, the “Temporary Assistance for Needy Families” worth $7.35bn and the “Social Services Block Grant” worth $869m.

In a statement, the department said the states’ access to those funds would be restricted pending further review. The administration has not laid out details of either the fraud claims or the widening plan to withhold funds, which was first reported by the New York Post.

Democrats condemned the freeze. “Our states should not be political pawns in a fight that Donald Trump seems to have with blue state governors,” New York governor Kathy Hochul said, adding the step was “vindictive” and “cruel”.

Trump himself has not spoken on the specifics, but he proclaimed on social media Tuesday: “The Fraud Investigation of California has begun.”

In the fallout, HHS officials said no state will receive childcare funds without providing more verification. Several states told the Associated Press that they had not received any guidance on that decision.

Tara Gallegos, a spokesperson for California governor Gavin Newsom, said in an email that “Donald Trump is a deranged, habitual liar whose relationship with reality ended years ago” and defended California’s record at stamping out fraud in government programs.

The senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, said Trump’s move to halt funding aims to score political points, not to stop fraud.

In recent weeks, the Trump administration has singled out Minnesota, alleging rampant fraud is being committed by immigrants in the welfare system and in social service programs.

Trump administration officials have frequently and sharply attacked the state’s Somali community, the largest in the country, as well as the Minnesota governor Tim Walz, the 2024 Democratic vice-presidential nominee, and the Democratic representative Ilhan Omar, a Somali American who represents a Minneapolis-based district in Congress.

Federal childcare funding has been put on hold in Minnesota since late last month amid investigations into a series of alleged fraud schemes at daycare centers run by people with family roots in Somalia.

Rights advocates say the Trump administration is using the fraud investigations as an excuse to target immigrants and political opponents more broadly.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6fd97cad218febce3b2ccfc2971798be060addd/411_0_4815_3850/master/4815.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=aa69ee392a6fae374112c93d25baa6bc",N,,2026-01-06 22:56:19.531020

“You cannot rely on the article for one thing and not the other,” Judge Reyes said.
Lawyers representing the plaintiffs have also said that the government has sought to cast Haitian T.P.S.
If Judge Reyes pauses the revocation for Haitians, the government is likely to appeal, and the case could end up before the Supreme Court.
Early last year, Ms. Noem announced the end of T.P.S.","The Trump administration’s effort to revoke protections for 350,000 people from Haiti who fled their troubled homeland is facing what could be the last legal challenge before Temporary Protected Status for Haitians expires early next month.

Ending T.P.S. for Haitians was part of a wave of actions by the Department of Homeland Security last year as President Trump launched his campaign to carry out mass deportations and remake the U.S. immigration system.

T.P.S., which provides a shield against deportation for people from countries in the throes of a humanitarian crisis or armed conflict, has been a target of Trump officials, who say the program has become anything but temporary and no longer serves its intended purpose.

But revoking protections for Haitians, Venezuelans and people from several other countries has prompted more than a dozen legal challenges, including the case involving Haitians that is being heard this week in federal court in Washington, D.C.

Lawyers challenging the decision to end T.P.S. for Haitians have argued that the move was driven by politics and racial animus rather than by a required assessment of safety conditions in Haiti, where gangs have taken control of much of the capital since the 2021 assassination of the last elected president.

The lawyers have asked the judge in case, Ana C. Reyes of the Federal District Court, to put the revocation of T.P.S. for Haitians on hold while the lawsuit proceeds. Judge Reyes said on Tuesday that she expects to rule on that request by Feb. 2, the day before the status is scheduled to expire for Haitians.

During the hearing, Judge Reyes pressed government lawyers about whether the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, had adequately reviewed conditions in Haiti before terminating T.P.S.

The administration, which is seeking to dismiss the lawsuit, has argued that ending T.P.S. for Haitians is in the national interest and that Secretary Noem is “unfettered by any statutory standard whatsoever.”

At the hearing on Tuesday, the judge focused on an email exchange that the administration cited as evidence that it had met its obligation to assess whether conditions in Haiti had improved sufficiently to justify ending the protection.

In the exchange, a homeland security official asked a State Department official for input on designation for Haiti T.P.S. According to the judge, the State Department official replied that the agency “believes there would be no foreign policy concerns.”

“That response does not address country conditions in Haiti,” Judge Reyes told one of the government lawyers, Dhruman Sampat.

The judge noted that the one-sentence reply from the State Department official had been sent just 53 minutes after the inquiry arrived on a Friday afternoon, and she suggested that the official could not have consulted experts or otherwise conducted a meaningful review.

In a back and forth that lasted more than 30 minutes, Mr. Sampat argued that the term “foreign policy” could reasonably be interpreted to encompass conditions on the ground. Judge Reyes was unconvinced. “This does not address whether it’s safe for Haitian T.P.S. holders to return to Haiti,” she said.

The named Haitian plaintiffs in the lawsuit include a registered nurse, a doctoral candidate researching Alzheimer’s disease, a woman adopted by Americans and a college student.

In a government notice, the Trump administration had cited a U.N. finding that there were “emerging signals of hope” in Haiti. But it did not refer to the U.N.’s assessments that Haiti was immersed in a “life and death emergency” and was going through one of five “highest concern” hunger crises in the world.

The judge faulted the government for “selectively” using the line from the report to justify not extending T.P.S., while ignoring a plethora of concerns about conditions in Haiti the U.N. had laid out.

“You cannot rely on the article for one thing and not the other,” Judge Reyes said.

Later in the hearing, the judge read aloud a statement from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in which he said that Haiti was facing “immediate security challenges.” The judge then asked the government lawyer if Mr. Rubio had been consulted about conditions in Haiti.

Lawyers representing the plaintiffs have also said that the government has sought to cast Haitian T.P.S. beneficiaries as criminals after identifying fewer than 900 out of 350,000 of the beneficiaries, or about .25 percent, as public safety threats.

“They are trying to fit the facts to their conclusion,” said Geoff Pipoly, a lead litigator for the plaintiffs. “Their entire process was informed by political considerations.”

T.P.S. was created by law 35 years ago to offer humanitarian protection to people from countries experiencing armed conflict, natural disasters or other “extraordinary and temporary” conditions.

While the program allows recipients to live and work legally in the United States, it does not provide a pathway to permanent residency or citizenship.

Applicants must pass background checks, and those with a felony conviction or two or more misdemeanors cannot secure the status. Its holders can obtain driver’s licenses and Social Security numbers, but they are not eligible for most public benefits.

The Trump administration has moved aggressively to cancel T.P.S. from more than one million immigrants. People who lose the status become undocumented, lose their jobs and face deportation.

Economists have warned that shedding hundreds of thousands of workers by removing T.P.S. and carrying out mass deportations could disrupt could disrupt American businesses and cause prices of many goods and services to climb. Labor shortages in the hospitality, senior care and construction industries are all but certain.

Aline Gue, a Haitian community leader who attended the hearing, said, “Ending T.P.S. will not only break up our communities, it will result in the loss of billions of dollars for the U.S. economy.""

“It puts our Haitians in a position to be deported to a country where there is documented mass displacement, widespread gender-based violence and no recourse for justice,” she said.

If Judge Reyes pauses the revocation for Haitians, the government is likely to appeal, and the case could end up before the Supreme Court.

Early last year, Ms. Noem announced the end of T.P.S. for about 350,000 Venezuelans who had received it in 2023 and later ordered the termination of the status for another 250,000 Venezuelans granted protection in 2021.

Ms. Noem argued that conditions in Venezuela had improved and said recipients of the program were a burden on American taxpayers. She also claimed that members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan criminal gang, were among those benefiting from the designation.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/06/multimedia/06nat-immig-tps-1-pvhl/06nat-immig-tps-1-pvhl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 21:57:12.434962

Cody Whipple, another Republican seeking to represent Horsford’s Congressional District 4, applauded Trump’s capture of Maduro.
Joe Lombardo, who is credited by Trump with helping lift him to victory in Nevada, did not respond to requests for comment on Trump’s military action in the South American nation.","Nevada’s sole Republican congressman, Rep. Mark Amodei, had as of Monday evening yet to comment on the military capture of former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro or President Donald Trump’s assertion the country and its oil production industry are under U.S. control.

Maduro and his wife, captured Saturday in Caracas by an elite U.S. military squad, entered pleas of not guilty Monday in New York to charges of trafficking cocaine.

Amodei’s office did not respond to a request for comment Monday. His silence comes as Nevada’s Democratic congressional delegates are calling out Trump for deploying the military for a criminal matter and for engaging in regime change and nation-building, policies Trump has previously decried.

“Our current strategy of nation-building and regime change is a proven, absolute failure,” Trump said while campaigning in 2016.

Maduro “was a brutal dictator who deserves no sympathy,” Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said on social media. “But the Trump Administration using American service members to overthrow a foreign leader it has criminally indicted under U.S. law sets a dangerous precedent.”

Trump, she said, “made a dangerous decision to bypass Congress with his actions in Venezuela, and so far he has offered no real details on plans for the future other than a vague assertion that the ‘United States will be running the country.’”

The prosecution of Maduro, Cortez Masto added, “contradicts” Trump’s pardon of former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who was found guilty by a federal jury of conspiring to traffic cocaine and sentenced to 40 years in prison. He was released last month as a result of Trump’s pardon.

On Monday, Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez was sworn in as interim president in Maduro’s absence. But in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Stephen Miller, a White House deputy chief of staff, laid out a scenario that more closely resembles a military takeover than the criminal apprehension of two individuals.

“We live in a world in which you can talk all you want about international niceties and everything else. But we live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power,” Miller said. “By definition, we are in charge, because we have the United States military stationed outside the country. We set the terms and conditions. We have a complete embargo on all of their oil and their ability to do commerce. So for them to do commerce, they need our permission. For them to be able to run an economy, they need our permission.”

Sen. Jacky Rosen, a Democrat and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called Maduro an “illegitimate and brutal dictator” but noted only Congress has the power to declare war. “This illegal regime change operation won’t make our country safer and risks destabilizing the region, dragging us into additional military conflicts, and increasing the amount of immigrants seeking refuge at our border.”

Trump’s administration needs to “explain why it lied when it claimed in its briefings that regime change wasn’t the U.S. goal in Venezuela,” Rosen said, and urged Congress to pass Senator Tim Kaine’s (D-Virginia) War Powers Resolution “to prohibit Donald Trump from carrying out additional strikes without our input.”

In a statement issued Saturday, Rep. Dina Titus, a former Political Science professor at UNLV, detailed more than half a century of U.S. regime change efforts in Latin America.

“In each case, our long-term interests were not advanced, regional relationships were damaged, and the Hemisphere saw more turmoil and violence, not less, “ she said. “Instead of learning from history, President Trump has perpetuated a failed foreign policy.”

The Trump administration’s action, Titus said, “is clearly based largely on the desire to take over Venezuela’s oil.”

The U.S. invasion of a sovereign nation, she added, “opens the door for Xi Jinping to do the same in Taiwan and lends legitimacy to Vladimir Putin’s goals in Ukraine.” Titus said Trump, who calls himself “the ‘President of Peace’ has once again shown that he is the ‘Commander-in-Chaos.’”

Titus faces challenges in 2026 from six Republicans, including State Sen. Carrie Buck, who did not respond to requests for comment on Trump’s takeover of Venezuela.

Rep. Susie Lee, also a Democrat, said Maduro’s capture raises “more questions for the Trump Administration than answers. The American people are opposed to another forever war.”

Lee noted that taking control of Venezuela is “an act of war, not a law-enforcement activity, and requires Congressional authorization and clear legal authority, neither of which the Administration has been given.”

Three Republicans vying to replace Lee are praising Trump’s actions.

Dr. Aury Nagy praised Trump’s “decisive leadership” but a spokesman was unable to say whether Nagy supports putting U.S. troops in Venezuela.

Marty O’Donnell, who is prioritizing affordability in his campaign, commended Trump and the military for taking decisive action without loss of life to Americans.

Dr. Jeff Gunter, who served as an ambassador during Trump’s first term, praised the military action that resulted in Maduro’s capture as a “’lawful, moral, and necessary’ step to protect American families from drug cartels and liberate Venezuela from socialist tyranny.”

Gunter is best known in political circles for an attack ad in the 2024 Republican primary race for U.S. Senate, in which he portrayed fellow Republican Sam Brown as a swamp creature. Brown was disfigured by an improvised explosive device in 2008 in Afghanistan, where he was serving in the U.S. Army.

Gunter did not respond when asked whether he supports U.S. troops on the ground in Venezuela.

Rep. Steven Horsford, a Nevada Democrat, echoed colleagues in asserting Trump’s actions “appeared to be driven largely by access to Venezuela’s oil resources.”

“Nevadans struggling through the Trump Slump get no relief from another reckless attempt at nation-building abroad,” he said. “President Trump is occupying Venezuela for corporate oil profits while the American people are clamoring for affordability relief here at home.”

David Flippo, one of several Republicans seeking to oust Horsford, praised Trump’s actions. In a statement, the former Air Force commander said Trump acted “exactly how the Commander-in-Chief is supposed to act…”

He did not respond when asked whether he supports prolonged U.S. involvement and troops in Venezuela.

Cody Whipple, another Republican seeking to represent Horsford’s Congressional District 4, applauded Trump’s capture of Maduro.

“Operations like this send a clear and unmistakable message: the United States will not tolerate criminal regimes poisoning our communities with fentanyl and other deadly drugs,” Whipple said in a statement. He did not say whether he supports deploying U.S. troops to Venezuela.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, criticized the federal enforcement surge as ""a war that's being waged against Minnesota.""

""You're seeing that we have a ridiculous surge of apparently 2,000 people not coordinating with us, that are for a show of cameras,"" Walz told reporters in Minneapolis on Tuesday, a day after announcing he was ending his campaign for a third term.

WATCH: Fraud scandals and Trump's rhetoric escalate fears in Minnesota's Somali community

Many residents were already on edge. The Trump administration has singled out the area's Somali community, the largest in the U.S. Last month, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara criticized federal agents for using ""questionable methods"" following a confrontation between agents and protesters.

Molly Coleman, a St. Paul City Council member whose district includes a manufacturing plant where agents arrested more than a dozen people in November, said Tuesday was ""unlike any other day we've experienced.""

""It's incredibly distressing,"" Coleman said. ""What we know happens when ICE comes into a city, it's an enforcement in which every single person is on guard and afraid.""

Julia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said there had been an increase in sightings of federal agents and enforcement vehicles in locations like parking lots.

""We can definitely a feel a heavier presence,"" said Dieu Do, an organizer with the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee, which dispatches response teams to reports of agents.

Surge includes investigators focused on fraud allegations

Roughly three-quarters of the enforcement personnel are expected to come from ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations, which carries out immigration arrests and deportations, said the person with knowledge of the operation. The force also includes agents from Homeland Security Investigations, ICE's investigative arm, which typically focuses on fraud and cross-border criminal networks.

HSI agents were going door-to-door in the Twin Cities area investigating allegations of fraud, human smuggling and unlawful employment practices, Lyons said.

The HSI agents are largely expected to concentrate on identifying suspected fraud, while deportation officers will conduct arrests of immigrants accused of violating immigration law, according to the person briefed on the operation. Specialized tactical units are also expected to be involved.

The operation also includes personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, the person familiar with the deployment said. Bovino's tactics during previous federal operations in other cities have drawn scrutiny from local officials and civil rights advocates.

Hilton drops Minnesota hotel that canceled agents' reservations

Hilton said in a statement Tuesday that it was removing a Minnesota hotel from its systems for ""not meeting our standards and values"" when it denied service to federal agents.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville hotel, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) outside Minneapolis, apologized Monday for canceling the reservations of federal agents, saying it would work to accommodate them. The hotel, like the majority of Hampton Inns, is owned and operated by a franchisee.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville did not respond to requests for comment.

Federal authorities began increasing immigration arrests in the Minneapolis area late last year. Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel announced last week that federal agencies were intensifying operations in Minnesota, with an emphasis on fraud investigations.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly linked his administration's immigration crackdown in Minnesota to fraud cases involving federal nutrition and pandemic aid programs, many of which have involved defendants with roots in Somalia.

The person with information about the current operation cautioned that its scope and duration could shift in the coming days as it develops.

He also says ICE will reimburse agencies for overtime related to immigration enforcement.
RELATED: Texas troopers to enforce immigration laws under new federal partnership with ICE He plans to take the agreement to the Commissioners Court soon.","Texas counties with large populations are now on the clock.

Because of a January 1 deadline in Texas law, sheriffs of counties with more than 100,000 residents are required to formally partner with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement under the federal 287(g) program.

Counties have until the end of 2026 to sign on and implement one of three enforcement models.

While several major metro counties are still weighing their options, Bexar County has already signed on, becoming one of the first large urban areas in the state to do so.

Three Models, Different Levels of Authority

“By the end of this year, all of the counties with over 100,000 residents must enter into some type of agreement with ICE, but there are various levels,"" explained immigration attorney Kate Lincoln-Goldfinch.

Under the task force model, officers can use enforcement power in routine work or while assisting an ICE-led task force.

The warrant service officer program allows local officers to serve and execute administrative warrants on migrants in local custody.

The jail enforcement model focuses on identifying and processing people eligible for removal who are already in county jails.

Bexar County chose the Warrant Service Officer Model.

Sheriff Javier Salazar says it was the most cost-effective option for taxpayers and allowed patrol deputies to operate as usual. Under the agreement, one deputy will be assigned to serve ICE warrants inside the county jail. That deputy is still waiting for ICE training.

“The vast majority of our community will not see any difference in how the sheriff's office does what we do,” Salazar said.

Salazar says he moved early to sign onto the program so his office could spend the year showing the community what participation will look like, and ensuring an agreement was in place in case the rule changed.

Lincoln-Goldfinch says the decision is not simple for many counties, especially those with large immigrant populations.

She says she's not surprised that major metro counties like Harris, Dallas, and Travis have not yet signed on, saying officials must balance compliance with state law and maintaining trust within their communities.

“When immigrants are afraid of sheriffs, they are not reporting being the victims of crime. They might avoid being witnesses to crime,” Lincoln-Goldfinch said.

Salazar says preventing that fear is a priority.

“We're going to come out and handle their case appropriately and not be conducting ourselves as if we're immigration agents,"" Salazar said.

Other Agencies Signing On Voluntarily

While some counties are still deciding, other law enforcement agencies are joining the program even though the law does not require them to.

Precinct 3 Constable Mark Vojvodich says his office agreed to the Task Force Model to formalize practices already in place.

“When we make arrests for a felony or a misdemeanor, and then if we run across somebody with an ICE detainer, we'd report that to them anyway, and this was a method we could use to add some other tools to our toolbox,"" he explained.

Vojvodich says none of his deputy constables will be dedicated specifically to ICE, but they will be able to assist if requested. He also says ICE will reimburse agencies for overtime related to immigration enforcement.

“Once it becomes an ICE issue, like we're waiting 45 minutes for ICE to arrive, they will actually compensate us on an overtime basis and pay back Bexar County taxpayers,"" Vojvodich says.

Those reimbursements, he says, can help offset other budget pressures.

“The day-to-day operation for a constable won't really change,"" Vojvodich assures the community.

RELATED: Texas troopers to enforce immigration laws under new federal partnership with ICE

He plans to take the agreement to the Commissioners Court soon.

Balcones Heights has also signed onto the program, telling the I-Team its decision is about public safety, not politics.

Mayor Johnny Rodriguez sent this statement following the city's December vote:

The Mayor and City Council set the goals and objectives for the City of Balcones Heights. It is then the responsibility of the City Administrator and the Chief of Police to operationalize those goals through professional judgement and day-to-day management.

Our goal is clear and unchanged: to make Balcones Heights the safest suburban city in Bexar County. The decision to enter a 287 (g) agreement authorized by Congress since 1996 was made by our professional leadership as an operational tool to advance that goal. This was not a political statement, but a judgement call by those responsible for public safety. We respect that chain of responsibility and place our trust in our professionals to act lawfully, effectively, and in the best interest of our residents

Potential Legal Consequences

Counties that do not participate by the end-of-year deadline could face legal action from the Texas Attorney General. Senate Bill 8 gives the AG the authority to take noncompliant jurisdictions to court.

The Attorney General’s Office did not respond to a request for comment.

The governor's office is urging compliance with the program.

Until DHS can provide transparency and assurance that these operations are conducted lawfully and effectively, similar enforcement actions should be suspended.”","WASHINGTON — Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi today sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem raising serious concerns about how DHS conducted Operation Midway Blitz in Illinois, including in his district, warning that the operation appears to have swept up large numbers of individuals without criminal convictions and produced deadly consequences.

The Congressman writes:

“DHS has said this operation focused on dangerous criminals, but the facts suggest that many people with no criminal convictions were arrested instead. During my oversight visit, I learned that individuals were targeted and held not because they had been convicted of a crime, but merely because they had been charged with an offense in the past.”

He further notes that public reporting contradicts DHS’s stated priorities:

“While DHS has stated that roughly 4,500 people were detained during Operation Midway Blitz, reports show that only about 15 percent of those detained had prior criminal convictions. When enforcement actions primarily affect people without criminal convictions, it undermines DHS’s stated focus on targeting the most dangerous individuals.”

The letter also highlights the death of Nenko Gantchev, who died in DHS custody after being arrested when he voluntarily appeared for a scheduled immigration interview.

“He was not detained because of a criminal conviction,” Krishnamoorthi writes, “but because of enforcement practices that prioritized increasing the number of immigrants detained rather than focusing on genuine public safety threats. His case underscores the human cost of enforcement actions that do not center on individuals with criminal convictions.”

To ensure accountability, Congressman Krishnamoorthi requests written responses from DHS by January 15, 2026, to the following questions:

How many people detained during Operation Midway Blitz had criminal convictions?

How many detainees with no prior criminal convictions were charged with a crime by DHS at the time of their arrest?

Please provide body-camera footage for any arrests of individuals without prior convictions or active charges.

To which facilities were individuals detained in Illinois transferred, and how many of those transferred experienced serious health deterioration while in DHS custody?

How will DHS ensure that future enforcement actions target individuals with serious criminal convictions or active warrants?

The Congressman concludes:

“Immigration enforcement should focus on individuals who pose real public safety risks, not on families, workers, or bystanders caught in a dragnet. Until DHS can provide transparency and assurance that these operations are conducted lawfully and effectively, similar enforcement actions should be suspended.”",https://krishnamoorthi.house.gov/profiles/evo/assets/images/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-06 21:57:20.950790

Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith acted unlawfully when making two key appointments to New Zealand’s human rights watchdog, the High Court has ruled, in a decision that is likely to curb ministerial discretion when filling sensitive public service roles.

The court found Goldsmith failed to follow proper procedure when appointing Chief Human Rights Commissioner Stephen Rainbow and Race Relations Commissioner Melissa Derby in 2024.

“The decision was unlawful because: (a) the minister applied the incorrect legal test; and (b) the minister failed to take into account relevant considerations,” Justice David Gendall found in a decision published late last month.

While the ruling is embarrassing for Goldsmith – the minister charged with overseeing the justice system – it does not make the appointments of Rainbow and Derby to the Human Rights Commission invalid.

While the court heard evidence that neither candidate received backing from a four-person panel of experts set up to consider the appointments, Gendall said each still met many of the criteria required for their roles.

“I do not consider the fact that the minister departed from the recommendations of the panel here rendered his decision unreasonable… the minister was not bound to follow their recommendations, and it was open to him to place different weight on the various criteria,” he said.

‘Errors’ in appointment

The application for judicial review was brought by Paul Thistoll, chief executive of campaign group Rights Aotearoa, in his capacity as a private citizen.

Thistoll said he wanted to ensure the appointments followed “a lawful, robust process that respects the statutory criteria set by Parliament”.

“The court has confirmed that the minister cannot simply bypass the legal requirements of the Crown Entities Act and the Human Rights Act,” he said in a statement.

“While the minister has discretion, he must apply the correct legal tests and genuinely weigh the mandatory considerations.”

Thistoll initially wanted the appointments of Rainbow and Derby to be overturned, but later dropped this from his application, which Gendall said was the correct course of action.

But the judge disagreed with counsel for Goldsmith, who argued that declaring the appointments unlawful but not invalid would be “futile” and have no practical value.

“I agree with the applicant [Thistoll], that the declaration sought here would serve a real purpose in ensuring that future recommendations for the position of human rights commissioners proceed lawfully,” he said.

“When potential appointees for such positions occupy an important public office intended to help ensure the human rights of New Zealanders are upheld and promoted, there is a clear and substantial public interest in having errors in their appointment publicly declared.”

Unlawfulness ‘rests with the minister’

The court heard that neither Rainbow nor Derby was on the initial shortlists of candidates drawn up by the appointment panel. The panel comprised former solicitor general and Supreme Court justice Sir Terence Arnold, former Attorney-General Chris Finlayson KC, barrister Paul Rishworth KC and Māori advocate Lorraine Toki.

Once interviews were completed, the panel did not recommend Rainbow, noting he was “less commanding than other leading candidates” when responding the questions about legal matters.

After Derby’s interview, the panel’s assessment was that she “lacked depth and experience, and that she would find the role very challenging”.

Thistoll’s counsel told the court that there were concerns that ACT Party leader David Seymour had spoken with Goldsmith directly about Rainbow’s candidacy after learning his application had not been successful.

Both Rainbow and Derby were subsequently appointed to their respective roles and commenced work in November 2024.

While they were not the appointment panel’s preferred picks, Gendall said the experts noted both candidates had qualities suitable for their roles.

For Rainbow, these included “excellent communication skills, his ability to build bridges across the political divide, and his prior experience as an advocate for LGBT rights”.

Derby was described as having first-rate intellectual ability, an approachable personality, a sound knowledge of human rights and social issues, Te Tiriti o Waitangi dimensions and an understanding of the rights of indigenous peoples.

Gendall pointed out that Rainbow and Derby had done nothing wrong or unlawful themselves, saying “the unlawfulness rests with the minister in making his decision, in which they had no involvement”.

The deployment, which began over the weekend, represents one of the largest single-city mobilizations of Department of Homeland Security personnel in years, according to a person briefed on the operation. The surge dramatically expands the federal law enforcement footprint in Minnesota amid heightened political and community tensions.

The person was not authorized to publicly discuss details of the operation and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.

Immigrations and Customs Enforcement Acting Director Todd Lyons said during an interview with Newsmax that the agency was carrying out its “largest immigration operation ever,” though he did not specify how many officers were involved.

Roughly three-quarters of the personnel are expected to come from ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, which carries out immigration arrests and deportations, the person said. The operation also includes agents from Homeland Security Investigations, ICE’s investigative arm, which typically focuses on fraud and cross-border criminal networks. HSI agents were going door-to-door in the Twin Cities area investigating allegations of fraud, human smuggling and unlawful employment practices, Lyons said.

The HSI agents are largely expected to concentrate on identifying suspected fraud, while deportation officers will conduct arrests of immigrants accused of violating immigration law, according to the person briefed on the operation. Specialized tactical units are also expected to be involved.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was also in the Minneapolis–St. Paul area and accompanied ICE officers during at least one arrest. In a video posted on the social media platform X, Noem is seen wearing a tactical vest and knit cap as agents arrest a man in St. Paul. In the video, she tells the man, whose hands are cuffed behind his back, “You will be held accountable for your crimes.”

The Department of Homeland Security said in a news release that the man arrested was from Ecuador and that he was wanted in Ecuador and Connecticut on charges including murder and sexual assault.

When asked how many officers and agents had been deployed to Minnesota, Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin declined to provide a figure, citing officer safety. She said DHS had surged law enforcement resources to the state and had already made more than 1,000 arrests of people it described as killers, rapists, child sexual offenders and gang members.

The operation also includes personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including Commander Gregory Bovino, whose role in previous federal operations in other cities has drawn scrutiny from local officials and civil rights advocates, the person familiar with the deployment said.

Federal authorities began increasing immigration arrests in the Minneapolis area late last year. Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel announced last week that federal agencies were intensifying operations in Minnesota, with an emphasis on fraud investigations.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly linked his administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota to fraud cases involving federal nutrition and pandemic aid programs, many of which have involved defendants with roots in Somalia.

The person with information about the current operation cautioned that its scope and duration could shift in the coming days as it develops.

WASHINGTON—The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) has filed a brief in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in support of the Trump administration’s lawsuit to shut down Texas’s law granting in-state tuition to illegal aliens who live in the state.

Not only does Texas let illegal aliens attend its public universities, but it lets illegals who meet a three-year state residency requirement pay only in-state tuition, while charging American citizens from out of state much higher tuition.

Congress has passed a law against this practice, giving Americans from any state an entitlement to pay the same in-state tuition to another state’s public universities as illegal aliens who live in that state pay based on their residence.

True, the Supreme Court has held that laws passed by Congress that tell states what laws they may or may not pass are instances of unconstitutional “commandeering” of states. But, as FAIR shows in its brief, if a law of Congress can be read to establish a federal right to engage in certain activity—here, pay the same instate tuition that illegal aliens are allowed to pay based on their residence—that law overrides and preempts any state law that violates that right.

“For Texas, it’s not enough to let illegal aliens—who are not permitted to live in the United States at all—into its state schools, and apply lower admission standards to instate illegal aliens than to out-of-state Americans,” said Christopher J. Hajec, deputy general counsel of FAIR. “Even after all that, Texas also lets them pay much less in tuition than the out-of-state Americans have to pay. That’s where federal law and its supremacy come in, however. We hope the court sees that Congress’s law against this practice in clearly constitutional, and rules for the United States.”

Tammy Verhas said Monday her room was entered about 6:45 a.m. by three Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who grabbed and cuffed her husband, Jose Martinez, and detained him in a detention facility. Both are U.S. citizens.

“We were in bed asleep and all of a sudden flashlights were going all over the place and three men came in and grabbed Jose,” Verhas said. “I was trying to film the whole thing, and they brought in a woman to try and keep me from filming, but I was able to shove her off of me.”

Carnival Cruises declined to comment on the incident citing a policy regarding individual guests, and officials with ICE in the Phoenix area were checking on the incident with counterparts in Miami.

While at the detention facility, Martinez was told has his name had come up with warrants for being a violent offender. It was later found that the Martinez they were looking for was not him, and he was released from the detention center and reunited with Verhas off ship by cruise security.

“They gave me no reason, and that name association was their justification,” Martinez said. “I gave all my documented information to Carnival. I should have known before getting on the ship that my name would have been flagged for any issues.

“I was treated like a criminal right from the start,” Martinez added. “I have never been in this type of situation before. I was traumatized.”

Verhas had her phone taken away for a time because of the video she had taken of the incident. ICE told her she would only receive her phone back if she deleted the video she had taken. Verhas complied and her phone was returned to her.

“I was told ‘This is how we do it.’” Verhas said. “I was traumatized by the whole situation.”

Verhas said there have been issues in the past with her husband’s name being flagged.

“This isn’t the first time we have had issues with being stopped,” Verhas said. “We’ve been pulled out of line a number of times with TSA, and all those times we have complied without any issues.”

Verhas and Martinez are not sure what steps they will take next.

“We’re not sure if we are pursuing litigation,” Martinez said. “I’m still coming down from the shock.

“We’re reaching out to Carnival corporate to see what can be done,” Martinez added.

He shared the news on Tuesday during an interview with Newsmax.

""We have the largest immigration operation ever taking place right now,"" Lyons told the media outlet. ""It is a great effort by ICE.""

Lyons added that ICE, as well as agents with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS ) have been going ""door-to-door"" to visit companies that were accused of hiring illegal immigrants, as well as businesses that are potentially involved in human trafficking and recent fraud cases.

""States like Minnesota that have a strong sanctuary city policy and sanctuary protections do attract other illegal aliens to come there to take advantage of welfare, public assistance, SNAP benefits,"" he told Newsmax. ""And that's just a magnet that brings a criminal element that can hide in plain sight -- and that's what we're finding up in Minnesota.""

Lyons said (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem was in Minnesota during the operation, adding that agents arrested multiple suspects.

""She ran an awesome, successful operation,"" he said, ""[She] got a suspected murderer and a wanted rapist that was hiding, again, in plain sight in Minneapolis,"" Lyons said. ""And that's what ICE agents are doing on the ground up there.""

DHS shared a clip of the interview and shared it on social media.

""Under the leadership of @Sec_Noem, DHS law enforcement is surging to Minneapolis to root out fraud, arrest perpetrators and remove criminal illegal aliens,"" DHS noted on X.

The news comes amid fraud claims in Minnesota.

FBI director Kash Patel last week said he already ""surged personnel and investigative resources"" to the city to dismantle ""large-scale fraud schemes"" exploiting federal programs. The cases allegedly involved members of the area's Somali immigrant community.

""Fraud that steals from taxpayers and robs vulnerable children will remain a top FBI priority in Minnesota and nationwide,"" Patel previously wrote on X, noting that the FBI uncovered and dismantled a $250 million fraud scheme that stole federal food aid meant for vulnerable children during the coronavirus pandemic.

Patel said the investigation exposed sham vendors, shell companies, and large-scale money laundering tied to the Feeding Our Future network. He also said the case led to 78 indictments and 57 convictions so far.

""The FBI believes this is just the tip of a very large iceberg,"" Patel added. ""We will continue to follow the money and protect children.""

It also follows allegations made in a 42-minute video posted by independent journalist Nick Shirley. In the footage, Shirley visited what appeared to be empty daycare centers, mostly run by members of the Somali community, which receive millions of dollars in taxpayer money.

At one point, he attempted to confront daycare staff members. The video shows a woman yelling, ""Don't open up. It's ICE."" She also tells Shirley and his team to ""go away.""

Shirley asks the woman how she feels about the fraud that's taking place in Minnesota, but she continues to holler.

""Tim Walz and the fraudsters aren’t escaping this one,"" Shirley wrote on X, adding that no children were present at the center. ""In one day my crew and I uncovered over $110,000,000 in fraud, this is just the tip of the iceberg. We the people simply work too hard and pay too much in taxes to allow this to happen, they must be held accountable.""

Walz has since announced he won't be seeking re-election.

Zarazua said ICE agents tried to intimidate her into coaxing her boyfriend out, but she refused and demanded to see a judicial warrant.
“I told them they need an arrest warrant signed by a federal judge to do this,” she said.","A man who fled federal immigration agents and took refuge in a Bloomington office building, where the agents were refused entry, was ultimately arrested Tuesday following an hours-long standoff.

The man was stopped by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents near the Walmart in Bloomington while driving to work, said his girlfriend, Michelle Zarazua. He then fled on foot and ran into the Wilderness Inquiry building, a nearby outdoors travel company, shortly before 9 a.m., the company’s employees told Sahan Journal.

“He called me and he told me that he was in this building because he was scared and he didn’t know what to do,” Zarazua said. “So I came from my job and tried to help.”

The arrest comes days after more immigration officers were reportedly sent to Minnesota in a surge of enforcement that continues the work of Operation Metro Surge that began in December. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was seen taking part in an early morning raid in St. Paul on Tuesday amid the expanded enforcement efforts.

Wilderness Inquiry said in a written statement that the man came into their building in distress as ICE was attempting to apprehend him. The company’s staff let the man stay in their vestibule where he was visible to ICE agents, but did not let agents in the building as they consulted their legal counsel about what to do.

What followed was a back-and-forth through an interpreter between the man, who was inside the office, and immigration agents and Bloomington police, who were outside.

“I am proud of the Wilderness Inquiry team, who showed composure and compassion during a very difficult situation today,” Wilderness Inquiry’s Executive Director Erika Rivers said in the statement.

ICE agents can make arrests in public spaces without a warrant signed by a judge, but need a judicial warrant in order to gain entry and make arrests in private spaces like homes and businesses.

Reached for comment, ICE declined to provide details about the incident or detainee. Bloomington police declined to comment on the arrest, and said their involvement was “limited to helping maintain the peace and ensure the safety of all individuals involved.”

More than two dozen bystanders watched the incident unfold. Zarazua said ICE agents tried to intimidate her into coaxing her boyfriend out, but she refused and demanded to see a judicial warrant.

“I told them they need an arrest warrant signed by a federal judge to do this,” she said. “And they said, ‘No, I don’t need that, I’m going to arrest him no matter what.’”

Law enforcement ultimately presented a felony arrest warrant about two hours after the man arrived at the building, prompting him to voluntarily surrender.

Reports of ICE activity in the Twin Cities proliferated across social media Tuesday. Several videos showed the arrest of an Ecuadorian man in St. Paul, where Noem was present.

John Larson as ally in fight against Trump - CT Mirror,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/06/william-tong-endorses-john-larson-as-ally-in-fight-against-trump/,"U.S. Rep. John B. Larson, D-1st District, accepted the endorsement of Attorney General William Tong on the fifth anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, each ignoring the congressman’s three Democratic rivals to focus on their party’s great unifier: President Donald Trump.
“I don’t have to guess what John Larson is about.
Larson is “fighting for people that come to Mayberry Village, that come to the community center here.
He’s fighting for immigrants like my parents, who walk around with a target on their backs every single day,” Tong said.
“That’s why I’m supporting John Larson.","U.S. Rep. John B. Larson, D-1st District, accepted the endorsement of Attorney General William Tong on the fifth anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, each ignoring the congressman’s three Democratic rivals to focus on their party’s great unifier: President Donald Trump.

The chosen venue for the Tuesday morning press conference was the community center named for his late mother, Lois Nolan Larson, at Mayberry Village, the one-time federal housing project in East Hartford that has been a blue-collar touchstone for Larson through his nearly 50 years in public life, the last 27 as a congressman.

Tong, the first of the state’s six statewide constitutional officers to take sides in the rare intra-party challenge to a Connecticut congressional incumbent, said he and Larson share modest beginnings that shape their politics and fuel their opposition to a president the attorney general has sued 45 times this year.

“I don’t have to guess what John Larson is about. I don’t have to guess what this campaign is about. It’s about the people that live here,” said Tong, the son of Chinese immigrants. “It’s about the people that fight for every inch, every single day.”

Larson, 77, who has not had a Democratic primary since winning the open seat in 1998, is facing a challenge from former Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin, state Rep. Jillian Gilchrest of West Hartford, and Hartford school board member Ruth Fortune.

Tong’s repeated references to Mayberry Village and Larson’s upbringing in a public housing seemed calculated to draw a contrast with Bronin, who grew up in Rye, N.Y., and Greenwich, and is by far the best funded of the three challengers.

Larson is “fighting for people that come to Mayberry Village, that come to the community center here. He’s fighting for immigrants like my parents, who walk around with a target on their backs every single day,” Tong said. “That’s why I’m supporting John Larson. The other reason why I’m supporting John Larson is because in our official roles, we are on the front lines of this fight against a president and the federal government that every day seeks to do us harm.”

Tong’s endorsement was expected. He had joined Larson in September in opposing the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigrants and speaking out against the Department of Homeland Security targeting the congressman over his harsh criticism of the tactics employed by DHE’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

Larson had compared masked ICE agents to the SS and Gestapo of Nazi Germany.

On Tuesday, Larson accused Secretary of State Marco Rubio of lying to Congress when he assured members that the Trump administration was not working for regime change in Venezuela, not long before U.S. commandos seized its president, Nicolas Maduro, snubbing congressional leaders who should have been consulted.

“How about respect for the law, the Constitution and the War Powers Act?” Larson said.

He offered sarcastic praise for the president on one count.

“At least he was honest about this: It’s about the oil. It’s about the oil and taking over those refineries,” Larson said. “And by the way, who’s going to defend those refineries and the American corporations that go there? And who’s going to defend that pipeline? United States military. This president and his administration need to come before Congress.”

Larson said Democrats need more than criticism of Trump and pivoted to a favorite topic: the preservation of Social Security. He faulted Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee after President Joe Biden quit the race, for failing to talk about issues other than Trump’s fitness.

“I begged the Harris administration to talk about Social Security, to put it out there, and we didn’t. We talked about Donald Trump, and as bad as he is, if you don’t have a plan, you’re not going to be successful. And we will have a plan, and you’ll hear about it in more detail.”

Larson said he is working with two other members of the House Ways and Means Committee, Richard Neal of Massachusetts and Mike Thompson of California, on legislation addressing student debt and the difficulty in renters becoming homeowners.

“We’re going to be back to the new New Deal,” Larson said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_9382-scaled.jpeg,N,,2026-01-06 16:58:10.201062

Since Inauguration Day, more than 1.5 million immigrants have either lost or will lose their temporary legal status, including their work authorizations and deportation protections, due to President Donald Trump’s aggressive revocation of legal immigration.

It’s the most rapid loss in legal status for immigrants in recent United States history, experts in immigration policy told States Newsroom. The Trump administration curtailed legal immigration by terminating Temporary Protected Status for more than 1 million immigrants and ending Humanitarian Parole protections for half a million more individuals.

“I don’t think we’ve ever, as a country, seen such a huge number of people losing their immigration status all at once,” said Julia Gelatt, the associate director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute.

The move to strip so many immigrants of their work authorization is likely to not only affect communities, but also batter the economy, both immigration and economic experts told States Newsroom.

“Seeing well over 1 million people lose their work authorization in a single year is a really huge event that has ripple effects for employers and communities and families and our economy as well,” Gelatt said.

Dozens of lawsuits have been filed by immigrant rights groups and TPS recipients themselves challenging the terminations as unlawful.

“This is the continuation of the Trump administration attack against the immigrant community, and specifically about the TPS program, a program that, for many of us has been a good program, a life-saving program,” said Jose Palma, a TPS recipient from El Salvador and coordinator of the National TPS Alliance, which is part of several TPS lawsuits.

Who is granted Temporary Protected Status?

A TPS designation is given because a national’s home country is deemed too dangerous to return to due to violence, war, natural disasters or some other unstable condition.

When Congress created the program in 1990, it was initially meant to be temporary, which is why authorizations can be as short as six months and as long as 18 months.

Immigrants who are granted TPS must go through background checks and be vetted each time their status is renewed, but the program does not provide a path to citizenship.

Under the Biden administration, the number of TPS recipients grew, as did the category of humanitarian parole.

That policy decision was heavily criticized by Republicans, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem vowed to reevaluate TPS country designations for terminations during her Senate confirmation hearing this year.

“This program has been abused and manipulated by the Biden administration, and that will no longer be allowed,” Noem said during her hearing.

Before the Trump administration came into office in late January, there were more than 1.3 million immigrants in the TPS program, hailing from 17 countries. Under the first Trump administration, there were roughly 400,000 TPS recipients.

“Almost a million new people got onto TPS protections under President Biden, so we saw a really rapid expansion, and now we’re seeing a very rapid contraction, which is all to say that in the first Trump administration, there weren’t so many people who had TPS,” Gelatt said.

Noem has terminated TPS for immigrants from 11 countries, and the more than 1 million immigrants affected will lose their protections by February.

Noem extended six months’ protection for South Sudan earlier this year, but decided in November to terminate protections by January. She most recently terminated a TPS designation for Ethiopia on Dec. 12.

The other countries with TPS termination are Afghanistan, Burma, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria and Venezuela.

“We’ve never seen this many people lose their legal status in the history of the United States,” David Bier, the director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said. “This is totally unprecedented.”

People losing their status are also concentrated in certain areas. Florida has more than 400,000 TPS recipients, and Texas has nearly 150,000. Bier said he expects certain industries with high TPS workers to feel the impact, such as construction and health care.

Haiti, Venezuela

Immigrants from two countries — Haiti and Venezuela — make up a majority of recipients set to lose their TPS protections, at nearly 935,000 people.

Venezuelans, who make up 605,000 of those 935,000 TPS recipients, were first granted protections during Trump’s first term.

On his final day in office in 2021, his administration issued 18-month deportation protections for Venezuelans — known as Deferred Enforcement Departure, or DED — citing the country’s unstable government under President Nicolás Maduro.

“Through force and fraud, the Maduro regime is responsible for the worst humanitarian crisis in the Western Hemisphere in recent memory,” according to the Jan. 19, 2021, memo. “A catastrophic economic crisis and shortages of basic goods and medicine have forced about five million Venezuelans to flee the country, often under dangerous conditions.”

After the Trump administration’s 18-month DED designation, the Biden administration issued the TPS designation for Venezuelans who came to the U.S. in 2021 and again in 2023. The move created two separate TPS groups for Venezuelans.

“The bottom line is that removing the 935,000 Venezuelans and Haitians would cause the entire economy to contract by more than $14 billion,” said Michael Clemens, a professor in the Department of Economics at George Mason University.

He added that not all the TPS recipients are in the labor market. Some are children or elderly dependents who cannot work. Clemens said the TPS workforce population of Haitians and Venezuelans is about 400,000.

Humanitarian Parole program

Separately, under the Biden administration, nearly 750,000 immigrants had some form of humanitarian parole, granting them work and temporary legal status due to either Russia’s war in Ukraine or efforts by the administration to manage mass migration from Central American countries.

DHS has moved to end humanitarian parole for 532,000 immigrants hailing from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, opening them up for deportation proceedings.

“The onslaught of attacks that we’ve been seeing on temporary forms of immigration status, specifically with a humanitarian focus, is truly saddening and concerning,” said Alice Barrett, a supervising immigration attorney at the immigrant rights group CASA.

Not every recipient has been affected. The agency has kept humanitarian parole for 140,000 Ukrainians who came to the United States after Russia’s invasion in 2022, and 76,000 Afghans who were brought in after the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from their country.

But since the National Guard shooting in late November in Washington, D.C. — tied to an Afghan national granted asylum — the program is under increased scrutiny, and all immigration-related paperwork from Afghans has been halted.

Court decisions influential

This is not the first time the Trump administration has tried to end TPS.

During the president’s first term, he tried to end TPS for Haiti, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Sudan, but the courts blocked those attempts in 2018.

This time is different, said Palma of the National TPS alliance.

“The only thing different right now is that the Supreme Court is allowing the Trump administration to continue with termination of TPS, even though lower courts are saying, ‘No, we should stop the cancellation of TPS for now, until it’s clear whether the decision was illegal or not,’ ” he said.

So far, in emergency appeals, the high court has allowed the Trump administration to move forward in stripping legal status for the two groups of Venezuelan TPS recipients and individuals in the humanitarian parole program.

Barrett at CASA, which is leading the legal challenge of TPS termination for Cameroon and Afghanistan, said when it comes to TPS termination, “what we are seeing in the second Trump administration is a supercharged version of what we saw in the first Trump administration.”

“We are essentially seeing during this administration more actual terminations happening early on even while litigation is pending, which has certainly been disappointing for members of the community, because they’re still left in this limbo,” she said.

Barrett added that even when TPS recipients try to apply for longer-term legal status, they face multiple hurdles.

“For example, we are seeing them questioned or denied relief at asylum interviews because they did not apply for asylum within one year of entering the United States, even though the Code of Federal Regulations clearly creates an exception to this one-year filing deadline for people who have been in other valid status before applying for asylum,” Barrett said.

“These members of our community who have been in lawful status therefore now risk being placed in removal proceedings and even (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) detention, where conditions are increasingly inhumane and dangerous,” she continued.

TPS recipients are still continuing to fight in the courts and share their stories, Barrett said.

“These cases are still in progress, and we remain hopeful that despite preliminary rulings leaving so many hardworking individuals and their families in a state of uncertainty, upon thorough review and litigation of these cases the courts will recognize the improper nature of recent TPS terminations and restore status for those seeking safety here in the United States,” she said.

Venezuela has been considered non-cooperative with deportation flights, accepting a limited number of deportees.","Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans are being encouraged to go home or face deportation following the U.S. operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

Why it matters: Venezuelan immigrants had temporary U.S. legal protections until last year, in part due to poor economic conditions and human rights abuses under the Maduro government.

""President Trump's decisive action to remove Maduro marks a turning point for Venezuelans. Now, they can return to the country they love and rebuild its future,"" said U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesperson Matthew Tragesser in a statement.

Zoom in: A Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation in 2023 gave about 348,000 Venezuelans legal status and the opportunity for work permits. The Trump administration terminated that status in April.

Another TPS designation from 2021 gave roughly 268,000 Venezuelans protection and was terminated in November.

Many more Venezuelans live and work in the U.S. with visas or could apply for permanent legal status (like a green card).

Between the lines: Venezuela is ""more free today than it was yesterday,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on Sunday, the day after the Maduro raid became public.

Noem said TPS holders can apply for ""refugee status.""

But asylum isn't currently an option. A December policy memo from USCIS ordered a pause on all asylum applications.

Venezuelans are also affected by the Trump administration's pause on all immigration decisions because Venezuela is on the travel ban list.

USCIS did not respond when asked whether there are any changes to process applications from Venezuelans.

The bottom line: Rep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) said Monday, after an unannounced ICE detention oversight visit, that there are now plans to ramp up deportation flights.

""A supervisor told me that in light of the abduction of Nicolás Maduro this past weekend that the Department of Homeland Security is going to be taking another look at the possibility of deporting Venezuelans back to Venezuela,"" he said.

Venezuela has been considered non-cooperative with deportation flights, accepting a limited number of deportees. Many deported Venezuelans had been sent to other countries, including Mexico, to facilitate faster removals.

Following preliminary approval, two law firms appointed as class counsel and three additional non-appointed firms filed a petition for fees to be awarded in connection with the class action settlement.
As to the three non-appointed law firms, the Court found that they ""cannot appoint [themselves] class counsel by showing up.
Furthermore, the class notice ""never alerted class members that still other lawyers would come out of the woodwork to seek a third again whatever their class counsel would seek for its work.""
It offers strong precedent for any company defending a large class action and preparing to enter into a class action settlement.","Duane Morris Takeaways: On December 23, 2025, Judge William Alsup of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California entered an order in Bartz, et al. v. Anthropic PBC, Case No. 24-CV-5417 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 23, 2025), requiring five law firms seeking a fee award in connection with a class action settlement to file a declaration setting forth the full extent of any of the firms' actual or proposed fee-sharing agreements and the extent to which any arrangement may result in some class members receiving a sweeter recovery than other class members. Judge Alsup also ordered preservation of all communications and other documents relating to such side deals.

The ruling is significant because it shows that only appointed class counsel may be eligible to receive a fee award in connection with a class action settlement, and may not outsource its responsibilities to non-appointed counsel or seek any other arrangements that may favor some class members to the detriment of other class members. Furthermore, the ruling shows that any such side deals must be disclosed publicly prior to any final approval of a class action settlement.

Many of these gen AI class actions are ""bet-the-company"" lawsuits, even for the world's largest companies. Plaintiffs in gen AI class actions typically invoke the Copyright Act in order to seek millions — and sometimes even billions — of dollars on the theory that thousands or millions of unauthorized copies of copyrighted works, times up to $150,000 per copyrighted work for willful infringement, equals a crushing, settlement-inspiring number.

InBartz, the parties reached a $1.5 billion settlement, which the Court preliminary approved, and which we blogged about previously here and here.

Following preliminary approval, two law firms appointed as class counsel and three additional non-appointed firms filed a petition for fees to be awarded in connection with the class action settlement. The fee petition sought $225 million for class counsel and $75 million for the non-appointed law firms. Id. at 3, 7. These three non-appointed firms had agreed to gather contact information for the class list and to provide input on the claim form and claims process, two for the publisher class members (""Publishers' Coordination Counsel""), and one for the author class members (""Authors' Coordination Counsel""). Id. at 3.

The Court's Decision

The Court declined to rule on the fee petition, ordering that a number of disclosures and preservation efforts be made first in order ""to set the record straight"" concerning aspects of the fee petition. Id. at 1. Such was necessary, according to the Court, because it appeared that counsel may have entered into one or more ""side deals."" Id. at 3.

As the Court explained, ""[t]wo and only two law firms were ever appointed class counsel."" Id. at 1. Moreover, ""preliminary approval and the class notices confirmed that only two firms were approved to serve the class ... Those firms never proposed a fee splitting scheme, and none was ever even preliminarily approved."" Id. at 7.

As to the three non-appointed law firms, the Court found that they ""cannot appoint [themselves] class counsel by showing up. Nor can class counsel appoint someone else to do its work."" Id. at 2. As the Court further explained, it had not had a chance to vet the non-appointed counsel for conflicts, or to prevent duplication of effort by overlapping law firms. Id. at 8. In addition, the Court found it concerning that ""we do not yet know whether 'Publishers' Coordination Counsel' will share any part of their bonanza with one or more publishers so as to give those publishers a premium to not opt out ... and thereby avoid triggering [the defendant]'s right to about the settlement."" Id. Furthermore, the class notice ""never alerted class members that still other lawyers would come out of the woodwork to seek a third again whatever their class counsel would seek for its work."" Id. (emphasis added).

For these reasons, the Court ordered that, within one week, all law firms who filed fee petitions or on whose behalf fee petitions were filed, must publicly file a declaration (not under seal) setting forth the ""full extent"" to which such firm agreed or made a proposal ""to share any portion(s) of any fee award in this class action or in any other class action (putative or certified) involving any party (or class member) herein,"" and stating as to each such agreement or proposal its date, terms, the extent to which it is verbal and the extent to which it is in writing (or in an email or text or other message), and the parties and the names of all persons who made the agreement. Id. at 10. The Court also ordered public disclosure in a declaration of the ""full extent to which any arrangement has been made or proposed by which any class member would receive a sweeter recovery than other class members."" Id. at 10-11. Finally, the Court further ordered that ""[a]ll emails, messages, and written materials relating to any of the above shall be preserved for future potential discovery."" Id. at 11.

Implications For Companies

The Bartz fee petition order is as extraordinary as it is unique. It offers strong precedent for any company defending a large class action and preparing to enter into a class action settlement. Specifically, Bartz shows that plaintiffs' firms seeking any portion of a fee award in connection with such a settlement will need to publicly disclose any side deals prior to any final settlement approval. Therefore, settling defendants should consider seeking to discover any side-deal information before entering into such settlement. That way, any obstacles to final settlement approval such as that presented by the Bartz fee petition order might be considered before the parties reach any settlement.",http://www.mondaq.com/images/profile/companythumb/21358.webp?v=20241101122045,N,,2026-01-06 18:58:55.595498

DHS shared a clip of the interview and shared it on social media.

""Under the leadership of @Sec_Noem, DHS law enforcement is surging to Minneapolis to root out fraud, arrest perpetrators and remove criminal illegal aliens,"" DHS noted on X.

The news comes amid fraud claims in Minnesota.

FBI director Kash Patel last week said he already ""surged personnel and investigative resources"" to the city to dismantle ""large-scale fraud schemes"" exploiting federal programs. The cases allegedly involved members of the area's Somali immigrant community.

""Fraud that steals from taxpayers and robs vulnerable children will remain a top FBI priority in Minnesota and nationwide,"" Patel previously wrote on X, noting that the FBI uncovered and dismantled a $250 million fraud scheme that stole federal food aid meant for vulnerable children during the coronavirus pandemic.

Patel said the investigation exposed sham vendors, shell companies, and large-scale money laundering tied to the Feeding Our Future network. He also said the case led to 78 indictments and 57 convictions so far.

""The FBI believes this is just the tip of a very large iceberg,"" Patel added. ""We will continue to follow the money and protect children.""

It also follows allegations made in a 42-minute video posted by independent journalist Nick Shirley. In the footage, Shirley visited what appeared to be empty daycare centers, mostly run by members of the Somali community, which receive millions of dollars in taxpayer money.

At one point, he attempted to confront daycare staff members. The video shows a woman yelling, ""Don't open up. It's ICE."" She also tells Shirley and his team to ""go away.""

Shirley asks the woman how she feels about the fraud that's taking place in Minnesota, but she continues to holler.

""Tim Walz and the fraudsters aren’t escaping this one,"" Shirley wrote on X, adding that no children were present at the center. ""In one day my crew and I uncovered over $110,000,000 in fraud, this is just the tip of the iceberg. We the people simply work too hard and pay too much in taxes to allow this to happen, they must be held accountable.""

Walz has since announced he won't be seeking re-election.

ICE in Minnesota

What we know:

Activists and city leaders have noted increased ICE activity in Minneapolis on Tuesday. In posts on social media platform Bluesky, Minneapolis City Council member Jason Chavez warned of immigration officers checking Latino residents' status.

In his post, Chavez writes: ""Activity is really hot this morning on Lake Street and Powderhorn. There’s also confirmed ICE vehicles using Uber stickers. Please be careful.""

The backstory:

The Trump administration is reportedly sending upwards of 2,100 ICE agents and Department of Homeland Security investigators into the Twin Cities for the new operation. The basis for the new operation is to take on fraud in the Twin Cities, according to reports.

Sec. Noem in St. Paul

Local perspective:

The Department of Homeland Security also shared videos Tuesday morning of Sec. Kristi Noem assisting agents in the arrest in St. Paul of an Ecuadorian national who they say was wanted for murder.

In the video, agents are seen moving into an apartment near the Payne Market off Payne Avenue near Jenks Avenue East on Tuesday.

What they're saying:

In a post on X, Noem wrote: ""Another murderer and sexual predator off of Minneapolis’s streets thanks to @ICEgov. Just arrested this criminal illegal alien from Ecuador who has an active warrant for murder and sexual assault in Ecuador. He was convicted of robbery and extortion in Ecuador.""

Local perspective:

Tuesday morning, protesters gathered outside the Whipple Building at Fort Snelling, where immigration court takes place, as part of an ""emergency protest.""

The massive 30-day surge began on Sunday with roughly 1,000 additional agents deployed to Minneapolis and St. Paul, including from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, a person familiar with the plans told MS NOW. Agents who were already on the ground are expected to have their deployment extended, the person said.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed the deployment to MS NOW but did not provide details on the number of agents on the ground.

The fraud allegations were fueled by a viral video from 23-year-old conservative content creator, Nick Shirley, that alleged Somali-run day cares were receiving federal subsidies without actually providing child care. In the 43-minute video, Shirley visits what he says are fake day care centers. But the evidence for his allegations are unsubtantiated. The director of one of the facilities told a local news station that Shirley had arrived at the center with a team of people, some masked, causing fear.

Still, the video was spread by top officials in the Trump administration, including Vice President JD Vance and FBI Director Kash Patel.

President Donald Trump has often attributed the alleged fraud to the state’s Somali immigrant population. Late last year, ICE carried out an immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis aimed at people who had received deportation orders, including immigrants from Somalia. As of mid-December, at least 400 immigrants were detained, according to DHS.

Minneapolis is among a growing list of cities targeted by the Trump administration in a nationwide crackdown on crime and immigration. In recent months, agents and National Guard troops have been sent to cities including Washington, D.C., and Memphis. States and cities have filed lawsuits over the actions.

Recommended

In a rare reversal last week, Trump announced he is pulling National Guard troops out of Chicago; Los Angeles; and Portland, Oregon.

The move substantially expands federal law enforcement’s presence in Minnesota amid rising political and community tensions. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced on Monday that he is suspending his campaign for a third term as his administration faces scrutiny over the fraud allegations. DHS recently paused federal child care payments to the state and announced last week that the suspension would be expanded nationwide pending a fraud investigation.

On Monday, ICE posted an email appearing to be from a Hilton hotel that said reservations for DHS and ICE agents had been canceled. A statement from Hilton said the hotel in the email is “independently owned and operated, and the actions referenced are not reflective of Hilton values.” The company added that it is “investigating this matter with this individual hotel.”

Following Maduro’s capture, Miami Mayor Eileen Higgins called on the Trump Administration to reinstate TPS for Venezuelans.
In mid-December, the Venezuelan government claimed that the U.S. had suspended deportation flights to Venezuela, a claim denied by Washington.
Following Maduro’s capture, a DHS spokesperson confirmed to EL PAÍS that the flights are not suspended.","The capture of Nicolás Maduro by U.S. forces has opened a new chapter of uncertainty for many Venezuelan exiles in the United States, for whom the lack of clarity regarding a democratic transition and the possibility of further military action are dampening any thought of returning to their country. This ambiguity is compounded for hundreds of thousands of people who are in limbo after the Trump administration canceled temporary immigration protections, as well as for asylum seekers who fear their cases will be affected by the changing circumstances in Venezuela.

“In the last 48 hours, the community has been in complete panic,” says John De La Vega, a Venezuelan lawyer in Miami who says he has received calls from “hundreds of people” worried about their immigration cases since news broke that a commando unit had captured Maduro in a surprise attack last weekend. “The main uncertainty is: If Maduro has been captured, will my asylum case fall apart? Will the government stop approving asylum cases because of this situation?” says De La Vega.

On the other hand, for many, the news revived hopes that Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuela would be restored after the Trump administration canceled it last year, leaving more than 600,000 Venezuelans in immigration limbo, many of them residents of South Florida, the lawyer added.

This decision was compounded by the cancellation of the humanitarian parole program that had allowed more than 100,000 Venezuelans to live and work legally in the United States for a period of two years.

Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were indicted in the Southern District of New York on narcoterrorism charges. Trump has stated that the U.S. will run the country: “We’re going to stay until such time as the proper transition can take place.” He also asserted that the U.S. military is “prepared to do a second wave” of attacks, although “we probably won’t have to do it.”

But the situation inside Venezuela remains uncertain. Vice President Delcy Rodríguez assumed the interim presidency, but it is unclear who effectively controls the military and security structures that sustained Chavismo for more than two decades. Key regime figures, such as Diosdado Cabello, considered the number two in Chavismo, and high-ranking military officers continue to operate within the country, fueling fears of reprisals and a further narrowing of political space.

Among the diaspora, many believe that the conditions that forced them to flee remain in place, and the country’s immediate future remains uncertain.

One person who lost her TPS status and doesn’t see returning as an option is Rossaly Nava, a 43-year-old Venezuelan who has lived in the U.S. for 10 years. Nava, originally from Maracaibo, was involved with the opposition and had to flee the Chavista regime. Her former boss, a member of parliament, remains detained in Venezuela on charges of treason and other offenses. “This doesn’t guarantee that I can return,” she says. “Maduro isn’t looking for me, but there are those directly responsible, like Diosdado Cabello and his torturers, who know perfectly well who I am. I can’t return until I’m certain that those who attacked me won’t be there.”

When she had TPS, “I was protected,” she explains, but today she only has an asylum process that began 10 years ago. “I consider myself at risk of being returned to a country that is not ready to protect those of us who were linked to the opposition,” she adds.

On Saturday, a crowd in Doral, the Miami-Dade city with the largest Venezuelan diaspora in the country, where many backed Trump in the hope that he would remove Maduro from power, celebrated the latter’s capture. That enthusiasm, however, has given way to discontent following the end of immigration protections, amid an anti-immigrant offensive that has sown fear in the community.

Following Maduro’s capture, Miami Mayor Eileen Higgins called on the Trump Administration to reinstate TPS for Venezuelans. But that hope was dashed on Sunday when Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem—who canceled TPS for Venezuela four months ago, claiming it was contrary to the national interest—stated that the country is “more free than it was yesterday” and that those who lost TPS could apply for asylum instead.

“That only confused the community even more,” says Helen Villalonga, president of Amavex, a human rights organization, who says that “many people have contacted her” seeking clarification because “they believe they can now apply for asylum, but asylum is not requested from within the United States.”

Furthermore, Villalonga maintains that Venezuelans need protection now more than ever. “Before, we didn’t have an invasion; now we do.”

The confusion also extends to the subject of deportations. In mid-December, the Venezuelan government claimed that the U.S. had suspended deportation flights to Venezuela, a claim denied by Washington. Following Maduro’s capture, a DHS spokesperson confirmed to EL PAÍS that the flights are not suspended.

Patricia Andrade, founder of Venezuela Awareness, warns about the deportations, saying, “You can’t send people to a country that remains unstable, where orders have been given to imprison those who support Trump’s actions.” She says her contacts in Venezuela describe an apparent normalcy, but that “there is a lot of fear” among the population, that paramilitary groups are in the streets, and that Chavistas are “shoring up the few followers they have left.”

Last month, the Trump Administration suspended immigration processing for citizens of a list of countries that includes Venezuela. However, De La Vega, the lawyer, clarifies that asylum has not been eliminated, but rather that “what is suspended is the decision-making process, the government’s approval or denial of cases.” Nevertheless, he warns that the situation is extremely volatile. “We have to wait. The situation in Venezuela is going to change day by day, almost hour by hour.”",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/WAA3IQMQ2RHNTMENZUEL65AMD4.jpg?auth=f490e3d9bb8839ef5a3e86ee2e43f97934c59ab3c9874000bc7195dbbf1f8a64&width=1200,N,,2026-01-06 15:57:16.607631

Quotations from affidavits and forensic examinations of MPP asylum seekers were reviewed and grouped into predefined trauma categories.
Major themes included physical and sexual violence, violence directed toward family or friends, police violence, gang violence, extortion, forced labor, and robbery.
This finding aligns with recent studies showing younger age distributions among asylum seekers in the US.20 Several factors may explain this finding.
These findings highlight the importance of considering the health and safety of asylum seekers in the design of asylum policies.","Introduction

Asylum seekers are individuals who apply for international protection due to fears of persecution or violence in their home countries.1 In 2024, the United Nations estimated that 123.2 million people were forcibly displaced worldwide due to persecution, conflict, violence, human rights violations, or other events disturbing public order.2 Among these displaced individuals, many sought asylum in countries with established protective programs, such as the US, where pending asylum cases exceeded 2.2 million in 2025.3

This unprecedented increase in asylum cases has coincided with increasingly restrictive US border policies. Citing border security concerns, the US implemented the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) in January 2019, requiring asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border to remain in Mexico while awaiting hearings. The MPP marked a shift from international norms, which traditionally permitted asylum seekers residence in the host country during case processing. Individuals subjected to the MPP reported being returned to border towns where they faced dangers including threats of violence and kidnapping, forced family separation, and unstable living conditions, including living in overcrowded tent cities without access to running water or electricity.4 Objective systematic data on trauma in this population are limited, although nongovernmental organizations such as Human Rights First and Amnesty International estimate the number of violent attacks on individuals subjected to the MPP to be over 13 000, with the true number likely higher due to underreporting.5,6

Due to these concerns, the MPP remained subject to legal and policy challenges and was suspended temporarily in January 2021, formally halted after a Supreme Court ruling in June 2022, and reinstated again by the US Department of Homeland Security in January 2025.7 In parallel, other policies such as Title 42 expulsions based on public health safety with the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent asylum transit bans limiting asylum applications for individuals who had already traversed multiple countries similarly restricted access at the US southern border, showing a broader transition in the US asylum landscape toward more restrictive migration policies.8,9

Such measures not only limited access to asylum but also placed asylum seekers, a group already fleeing persecution and violence in their home countries, into unstable environments associated with a heightened risk of trauma. Global research has consistently documented high rates of trauma-related conditions among asylum seekers, including a meta-analysis of more than 5000 adults in 2020 that estimated a posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) prevalence of 31%.10,11 A more recent 2021 study of 57 asylum seekers from Central America, a region impacted by the MPP, showed PTSD rates approaching 79%.12 With respect to the MPP, several small case series and reports from nongovernmental organizations have raised concerns about the exacerbation of trauma for those subjected to the MPP.13-17 However, larger systematic studies on individuals exposed to the MPP remain limited, in part due to challenges with access and follow-up in this displaced population. To address this gap, forensic medical evaluations and legal affidavits, which are frequently collected to support asylum claims by providing objective documentation of trauma, could serve as valuable resources for examining the association of health outcomes with the MPP. To better understand the association of exposure to the MPP with migration-related trauma, we examined legal affidavits and forensic medical examinations of 94 asylum seekers at an academic-affiliated asylum clinic, comparing traumatic experiences before and after the implementation of the MPP in 2019.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study evaluated traumatic experiences before and after the introduction of the MPP in January 2019. Participants were selected between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2022, from an academic-affiliated asylum clinic providing pro bono forensic evaluations to asylum seekers. These forensic medical evaluations were performed for asylum seekers to document objective findings of their previous trauma and are associated with a higher rate of asylum application success. A study of over 2800 asylum applicants between 2008 and 2018 found that nearly 82% of those applying for immigration relief were granted relief compared with only 42% without a forensic medical examination.18 Clinicians performing the forensic medical evaluations undergo training to follow the Istanbul Protocol, which is a set of international guidelines for the effective investigation and documentation of torture and other human rights violations.19 Evaluations were conducted by the University of Southern California Human Rights Clinic in Los Angeles, California, and Tijuana, Mexico, as well as remotely due to limitations with the COVID-19 pandemic. Eligibility criteria included all asylum seekers aged 18 years or older who completed forensic medical examinations at the clinic during this period. Exclusions included age younger than 18 years, examinations missing substantial data, and cases containing potentially identifiable material even after deidentification. Of 108 forensic evaluations screened, 14 were excluded (9 individuals younger than 18 years, 3 records with duplicate information, and 2 with insufficient data) leaving 94 cases for analysis (eFigure in Supplement 1). Data from legal declarations and forensic exams were securely stored in REDCap and deidentified. Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Southern California Social Behavioral Institutional Review Board, which waived the requirement of informed consent due to the research being retrospective and posing minimal risk to participants with deidentified data. The study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline for cohort studies.

A standardized data abstraction form was developed to record demographic characteristics (age, sex, and country of origin) and study outcomes focusing on MPP exposure, traumatic events, and reporting of PTSD. Exposure to the MPP was classified from the legal documentation and corroborated by forensic examiner report. The primary outcome variable of interest was traumatic exposures during migration, categorized as physical violence, sexual violence, violence against family or friends, violence by organized criminal groups, violence by government organizations, forced labor, and extortion or robbery (eTable in Supplement 1). Posttraumatic stress disorder was assessed based on either documentation by the forensic examiner stating the participant’s presentation was consistent with PTSD or a formal score on the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, when available. The demographic data in our study were collected using predefined categories on the intake form, which specified ethnicity rather than race. Ethnicity, when reported, was classified according to the original source documentation and recorded by the researchers given their potential relevance to the outcomes of interest. The available response options included: Asian; African, Afro-Latino, or Afro-Caribbean; Hispanic or Latin American; Middle Eastern; White; Other, and Not stated. “Other” included options such as Indigenous, Pacific Islander, or other multiracial backgrounds not captured by the other categories. Sex was documented in applications and included in the data abstraction. Conversely, gender identity was reported in a minority of cases, typically when relevant to the asylum claim (eg, persecution based on gender identity), so it was not systematically included in analyses, although LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, and other) status, when reported, was recorded (Table 1). Data abstraction was performed by 3 researchers (K.J., S.M., and K.E.). Fifteen percent of cases were dual-abstracted to assess interrater reliability, showing high agreement between abstractors (pooled κ = 0.81). The remaining cases were divided evenly among the 3 researchers.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis was conducted from January 2023 to May 2025 using Stata, version 17 (StataCorp LLC). Logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association of exposure to the MPP with trauma during migration. Specifically, the odds of an asylum seeker reporting any of the traumatic events listed during migration was measured. To limit potential confounders with the year of evaluation and changing asylum landscape, we divided patients into 3 groups anchored on the introduction of the MPP in January 2019: asylum seekers from 2016 to 2018 (n = 26), asylum seekers from 2019 to 2022 exposed to the MPP (n = 22), and asylum seekers from 2019 to 2022 who were not exposed to the MPP due to exemptions or alternative entry points (n = 46). Post-2019 is used to refer to the group that includes the years 2019 through 2022. Participants in the post-2019 non-MPP group were excluded from the MPP for a variety of reasons including alternate entry points and exemption from the policy based on home country.

Statistical tests were 2-sided. Logistic regression was performed between the pre-2019 group and both the post-2019 MPP and post-2019 non-MPP groups to calculate the odds that any traumatic event occurred during migration, reported as odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs and a preestablished statistical significance of α = .05. Additional sensitivity analysis was completed with only participants with a Latin American country of origin to assess for regional bias. Additional adjustments for other factors (age, sex, and reason for asylum) were not performed because of the small sample size.

Qualitative analysis was performed using a deductive approach. Quotations from affidavits and forensic examinations of MPP asylum seekers were reviewed and grouped into predefined trauma categories. Selected illustrative quotations were chosen to highlight key themes. All quotations were deidentified and pulled directly from source data. Some appear in first or third person, reflecting the way they were originally documented by attorneys or clinicians.

Results

Among 94 participants, the mean (SD) age was 33.1 (10.1) years, 56 (60%) were men and 38 (40%) were women, and 68 (72%) originated from Latin America, with Africa the next most common region (20 [21%]) (Table 1). Additional participants were from Asia, the Middle East, and Russia. The most common asylum claim across all groups was persecution based on social group membership, reported by 75 participants (80%), followed by political opinion, reported by 29 participants (31%). The MPP group had a younger mean (SD) age of 30.6 (6.9) years and higher percentage of participants from Latin America (19 of 22 [86%]).

The primary outcome, trauma reported during migration, was higher in the MPP group (14 of 22 participants [64%]) compared with in the pre-2019 group (3 of 26 participants [12%]) (OR, 9.20; 95% CI, 2.12-39.89) (Table 2). The post-2019 group not exposed to the MPP did not have higher odds of trauma (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.32-5.85). In a sensitivity analysis limited to participants from Latin America, the OR for trauma between the pre-2019 and MPP group was 4.40 (95% CI, 0.75-25.84), which did not reach statistical significance.

As a secondary outcome, the clinical examiner’s impression of PTSD was higher in the MPP group, (21 of 22 participants [95%]) than in the pre-2019 group (11 of 26 [42%]) (OR, 28.64; 95% CI, 3.33-246.25) (Table 2). In the post-2019 non-MPP group, 36 of 46 participants (78%) were assessed as having PTSD, a higher rate than the pre-2019 group (OR, 4.91; 95% CI, 1.72-13.99).

In addition to the quantitative patterns of trauma prevalence, we examined qualitative narratives to further characterize the nature of traumatic experiences. Thematic analysis of affidavits and forensic examinations highlighted different forms of trauma reported by asylum seekers. Major themes included physical and sexual violence, violence directed toward family or friends, police violence, gang violence, extortion, forced labor, and robbery. These narratives contextualize the quantitative findings by illustrating the lived experiences of asylum seekers. Representative deidentified quotes for each theme are presented in Table 3 and map onto the higher rate of migration-related trauma observed quantitatively in the MPP group.

Discussion

This cohort study found that exposure to the MPP was associated with higher odds of migration-related trauma and PTSD among asylum seekers. These results highlight the association of MPP exposure with migration-related trauma and its potential downstream health outcomes. We discuss these findings in 3 areas: demographic, trauma and protective factors, and policy implications.

First, we examined demographic patterns across groups. Asylum seekers exposed to the MPP were the youngest group in our cohort and had the highest proportion from Latin America. This finding aligns with recent studies showing younger age distributions among asylum seekers in the US.20 Several factors may explain this finding. First, the MPP was originally designed to apply primarily to individuals from Latin American countries traversing Mexico, which shifted the affected population toward primarily Central American nationals. Second, trends from the Northern Triangle countries (Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador) in particular have shown an increase in younger migrants over the past decade.12 Data from the World Bank correlate with this finding, showing that Central American asylum seekers are increasingly arriving in their early 20s with a growing proportion of women and families compared with previous years.21 These demographic trends are consistent with our finding that the MPP group skewed younger than other groups in our cohort.

These results are consistent with previous research showing high rates of trauma at the US-Mexico border.12 ,14-16,22,23 Systemic gang violence was a common reason asylum seekers in our cohort fled their home country, and reports document that gang-related murders of deported asylum seekers and continued exploitation during migration continue to be problems facing migrants in Mexico.22 Returned migrants, known as “retornados,” face marginalization and risk revictimization.16 In a Mexican migrant encampment study, women expressed widespread fear of sexual violence and distrust of authorities.23 Such themes are demonstrated in our forensic evaluations (Table 3). For example, 1 participant described repeated robberies and direct threats from gang members, including receiving messages stating “I know where you are… where you live.” Another woman described an inability to secure safe lodging in Mexico, which led to sexual violence against her child.

In contrast, asylum seekers after 2019 who were not subjected to the MPP did not report higher rates of trauma. Access to safer communities and services in the US may have been protective against trauma. Research suggests that protective factors such as social support, faith, and civic engagement have been associated with decreased migrant stress.24 Those admitted to the US likely benefited more from these factors. However, while protective factors may mitigate the association of migration-related trauma, the more important distinction is that individuals exposed to the MPP were more likely to be placed in high-risk environments such as tent cities or unsafe border regions with inherently higher trauma exposure.

Similar patterns have emerged globally, where restrictive policies and high-risk environments have been associated with higher rates of trauma and a greater burden of mental health disease among displaced populations. Research on Syrian refugees living in tent-city camps documented overcrowding, insecurity, and limited access to basic services being associated with a high rate of PTSD.25 Médecins Sans Frontières reported that among a group of migrants who crossed the Mediterranean to Italy, over 80% of respondents experienced torture either in their country of origin or in transit, most commonly at the hands of traffickers (61%) or law enforcement (29%).26 More than one-third of these incidents occurred in countries designated by European authorities as “safe” for migrants. This parallels the experiences of individuals in our cohort who, despite being returned to Mexico under the MPP, continued to report unsafe and harmful conditions. Similarly, a study of nearly 500 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh found high rates of depression and PTSD that were linked not only with exposure to previous trauma but also ongoing daily stressors such as overcrowding, food insecurity, and violence and crime in their refugee camps.27 Together, these findings highlight how restrictive migration and asylum policies such as the MPP that compel migrants to remain in unsafe environments can perpetuate rather than alleviate trauma among displaced populations.

These results should be interpreted in the broader context of ongoing US border policy debates. Although the MPP aimed to manage migration and strengthen border security, it was associated in our study with higher reported rates of violence, exploitation, and psychological distress. This finding adds to evidence that deterrent-based approaches may be associated with higher rates of migrant trauma and reliance on riskier migration routes, compounding the premigration trauma that compelled many asylum seekers to flee their home countries in the first place.28

Despite its suspension in 2021, the MPP was reinstated in January 2025 and continues to shape the asylum process.7 Other recent measures, such as the US Department of Homeland Security Third Country Removals,29 permit deportation to countries where assurances of migrant safety are uncertain. Although such policies may reduce cross-border entry or perpetuate the image of security in the short term, our results suggest that they may do so at the cost of exposing migrants to unsafe environments. Policymakers should therefore weigh not only border security objectives but also the public health and human rights consequences of these policies.

These findings highlight the importance of considering the health and safety of asylum seekers in the design of asylum policies. Potential approaches such as expanded legal pathways, increased access to mental and trauma support, and targeted international initiatives to address root causes of migration, such as systemic violence and economic instability in countries of origin, could reduce the harms observed in this study. If the MPP continues, a more robust multinational effort to ensure asylum seekers receive adequate protection and basic social support would be important for their health and safety.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, the sample was drawn from a medicolegal clinic that evaluates primarily asylum seekers who have obtained legal representation and undergone forensic medical examinations. Amnesty International has estimated that only 5% of asylum seekers subject to the MPP have been able to obtain legal representation, so our patient population likely represents a subgroup with greater access to legal and medical resources.6 Second, the retrospective design of this study limits causal inference and relies on preexisting documentation, which may vary in documentation style and introduce reporting bias. For example, the higher rate of PTSD observed in both the MPP and post-2019 non-MPP groups may reflect increased attention to screening and documentation of PTSD in recent years rather than true differences among groups.

Preexisting conditions and socioeconomic factors were not controlled for and may have confounded the observed associations. The MPP group skewed younger and had a larger proportion of migrants from Central America. A planned sensitivity analysis limited to Latin American participants showed that the odds of migration-related trauma in the MPP group was not significantly different compared with the pre-2019 group, highlighting that migration from Latin America, a region heavily affected by violence and instability, may be an independent risk factor in itself for migration-related trauma.12 In addition, logistic regression analyses were unadjusted given the small sample size, which limited our ability to control for all factors. Finally, other asylum policies implemented after 2019, such as the asylum transit ban and changes to US Customs and Border Protection processing, may have contributed to the observed differences, making it difficult to isolate the associations of MPP alone.

Conclusions

In this retrospective cohort study of asylum seekers before and after the introduction of the MPP in 2019, exposure to the MPP was associated with higher rates of trauma experiences during migration and a higher rate of PTSD reported in forensic medical examinations. These findings highlight the possible health consequences of restrictive border policies and underscore the need for immigration policies that consider the safety and well-being of asylum seekers throughout the migration process.",https://cdn.jamanetwork.com/ama/content_public/journal/jamanetworkopen/939758/zoi251354t1_1766526075.21591.png?Expires=2147483647&Signature=OXtrjfMik3Amwe3VBf-XQZulDWr6VB~pXDdDEvUY-A5Jp6LAkSfYGKVg3X64hOf0~01ofJQmo-U6ypcRyHnkNCgfMVfMrFT6OXYQ424WHkW5yQCC5MtirI8rS-VdWlsCo2hFZQP4Pxc64HDIdl-JBIkMkA3MOvNItquen7w1KuEhHZfWwpd8lKw3MBqw50eBvTkp9Fwy~Uc0XjlrAi3ta~jfR6NsHvvmEfKE~n4R5~gvxy~DqKjHLEymMmn1Hzwnx0~GzV2fzpMUQjDVgdRpKq0ks125r10fdgR~Nt5gd5Adin3pTZAxD6HCZJgpmlo12l9YQYOLWSHlYvVmTimMgg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA,N,,2026-01-06 14:57:21.711024

Proposal would hold sanctuary sheriffs accountable with criminal penalties, removal from office; modeled on Texas law upheld by federal courts

Representative Nancy Mace today proposed the South Carolina Immigration Enforcement Act, legislation that would impose penalties on sheriffs and jail administrators who refuse to honor federal immigration detainer requests. The bill is modeled on Texas SB 4, which was upheld by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2018.

“South Carolina already bans sanctuary cities on paper. This bill puts teeth behind that ban,” said Rep. Mace. “If a sheriff releases a criminal illegal alien back onto our streets because they refuse to work with ICE, they should face the consequences, including removal from office.”

Under current South Carolina law, political subdivisions are prohibited from adopting sanctuary policies, but lacks enforcement. The State Law Enforcement Division has never found a single jurisdiction out of compliance, even as some have refused dozens of ICE detainer requests and been designated “non-cooperative” by federal immigration authorities.

The South Carolina Immigration Enforcement Act would:

• Require jails to honor ICE detainer requests and notify ICE 48 hours before releasing detainees

• Create a misdemeanor offense for those who knowingly refuse to comply, punishable by up to one year in jail and a $1,000 fine

• Trigger automatic removal from office upon conviction

• Impose civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day on noncompliant jurisdictions

• Cut off Local Government Fund appropriations for three years to jurisdictions that violate the law

• Allow any citizen to file a complaint with the Attorney General

BUILT TO WITHSTAND LEGAL CHALLENGES

The legislation was drafted to address anticipated Constitutional challenges that have been raised against similar laws in other states:

Anti-Commandeering Doctrine: The Supreme Court’s ruling in Printz v. United States (1997) held that the federal government cannot compel state officers to enforce federal law. However, this bill is a state law requiring state officers to cooperate with federal authorities, not a federal mandate. States have broad authority to direct their own employees. The Fifth Circuit upheld Texas SB 4 on precisely this basis, finding that a state choosing to require its officers to cooperate with ICE does not violate anti-commandeering principles.

Fourth Amendment Concerns: Some courts have found that holding individuals solely on an ICE detainer, which is an administrative request, not a judicial warrant, may violate the Fourth Amendment. This bill addresses that concern by including an explicit exception: if the detainee provides proof of U.S. citizenship or lawful immigration status (driver’s license, passport, or federal documentation), the detainer compliance requirement does not apply. This mirrors the Texas model that survived court challenge.

Due Process / Removal from Office: The bill’s removal provision is grounded in existing South Carolina constitutional and statutory authority. Article VI, Section 8 of the South Carolina Constitution provides that any officer convicted of a “crime involving moral turpitude” may be suspended by the Governor and, upon conviction, the position “shall be declared vacant.” The bill explicitly designates a violation as official misconduct under S.C. Code §8-1-80, which already provides for removal upon conviction. This is not a novel mechanism, it leverages existing state law.

First Amendment / Criminalizing Speech: Unlike Tennessee’s recent legislation which criminalizes voting for sanctuary policies, this bill criminalizes only the act of knowingly refusing to comply with a detainer, not speech, advocacy, or voting. This avoids First Amendment concerns that could arise from punishing officials for their policy positions rather than their conduct.

Indemnification / Liability Shield: The bill includes a state indemnification provision protecting law enforcement agencies and officers from civil liability when they comply with detainer requests in good faith. This removes a key excuse some sheriffs have cited for non-cooperation, fear of lawsuits, while ensuring officers are protected when following state law.

“We studied what worked in Texas and what’s being challenged elsewhere,” Rep. Mace said. “This bill is designed to hold up in court. It uses existing South Carolina constitutional provisions, follows the Texas model the Fifth Circuit already blessed, and avoids the First Amendment problems in Tennessee’s approach.”

Mace previously led congressional oversight efforts investigating South Carolina Sanctuary Sheriff Kristin Graziano who refused to cooperate with ICE. Subsequently, Graziano released many violent, criminal illegal aliens onto the streets of South Carolina from 2021 to 2024 when voters elected a new sheriff due to this issue.

The number of 287(g) agreements in South Carolina has grown from 3 to 20 counties since January 2025, along with the State Law Enforcement Division and three municipalities.

“Our sheriffs who are doing it right deserve recognition. Any one who isn’t should be held accountable. This bill does both, and it’s built to last. There will never be another sanctuary sheriff in South Carolina if I’m in charge.”

I hope that you managed to have a bit of break over the holidays and are feeling well rested and ready for the many challenges that we already know 2026 will have in store, both for migrants and for those of us working to support them.

Regulations laid just before the break have brought some provisions of the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Act into force today, including the ability to take people’s mobile phones from them when they arrive in the UK. This seems likely to make it more difficult for people to access and provide evidence for their asylum claim, as well as creating barriers to maintaining contact with family. Access to legal representatives will need to be facilitated somehow. I will write up a short post on the regulations as a whole a.s.a.p. but I have looked at these powers in a bit more detail here.

In other news, Home Office oral questions take place at 2.30pm today in the House of Commons. And as spotted by the Law Gazette, there has been an increase to the solicitors’ guidelines hourly rates effective 1 January 2026.

On Free Movement, we have had a few case write ups since the last newsletter. This includes an interesting one for students to be aware of, where a university was held to have acted unlawfully after refusing to reinstate a student’s sponsorship which was withdrawn following delays in the processing of tuition payments made via a third party.

We also had a post on the High Court finding safeguarding failures at Brook House and this one on a costs decision from the Court of Appeal in a visit visa delay case, containing an important reminder about the need to comply with the pre action protocol in full. There was also a look at recent updates to the CPIN for Pakistan on asylum claims based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

There was quite the case dump by the courts just before the break, so we will be working to catch you up on all of those over the next couple of weeks. For everything else on Free Movement and elsewhere, read on.
