,Human Rights,2025-11-09 12:01:19+00:00,CBC,Advocates concerned temporary immigration cuts don't address systemic issues - CBC,"Matthew Robertson, CBC News",,,,,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/impacts-federal-government-carney-temporary-immigration-9.6971297,"The cuts are being made to the temporary foreign worker program and the international student program.
The TFW program allows employers to hire foreign workers to fill positions that are unable to be filled by Canadians.
The program also prevents temporary foreign workers from pursuing permanent residency because they are seen as “low-skilled,” she said.
Last year, after the federal government placed a cap on international students, institutions struggled to fill the financial gap.
“Targeting international students without addressing the real issue of funding in post-secondary is a short-sighted approach,” said Fairweather.","The Carney government’s first budget will significantly reduce the number of temporary immigrants it admits to Canada over the next three years.

The cuts are being made to the temporary foreign worker program and the international student program. The 2026 target for temporary foreign worker (TFW) arrivals is now 60,000, down from the 82,000 the government announced last year, and the international student target is now 150,000, down from 305,900.

The move aligns with the tougher stance the Carney government has made on immigration compared to his predecessor, Justin Trudeau.

During a conversation at the Canadian Club in Toronto on Friday, Carney mentioned that in 2018 temporary residents were about three per cent of Canada's population, and by the time he became prime minister they made up 7.5 per cent.

“That is an enormous shift in a very short period of time, and far exceeded our ability to welcome people and make sure that they had good housing and services,” said Carney.

The TFW program allows employers to hire foreign workers to fill positions that are unable to be filled by Canadians.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has said he wants the federal government to scrap the program entirely, saying it has led to increased youth unemployment by importing cheap labour.

""The Liberals have to answer: Why is it that they are shutting our own youth out of jobs and replacing them with low-wage, temporary foreign workers from poor countries who are ultimately being exploited?"" he said in September.

But Lynn Bueckert, the secretary business manager for the Hospital Employees' Union in B.C., said in a statement that foreign workers are filling critical positions — “sustaining the system, not draining it.”

Marisa Berry Mendez, a campaigner with the francophone wing of Amnesty International Canada, said the TFW cuts do not address the exploitative nature of the program.

A report from Amnesty International called on the federal government to overhaul the TFW program and Tomoya Obokata, a special rapporteur for the UN Human Rights Office, called the program “a breeding ground for contemporary forms of slavery.”

The top occupations for temporary foreign workers are in agriculture, often as general farm workers or harvesting labourers.

Berry Mendez said the root of the problem is that the TFW visa ties the worker to their employer. The program also prevents temporary foreign workers from pursuing permanent residency because they are seen as “low-skilled,” she said.

“If they’re in a situation of abuse then they’re pretty much trapped,” she said.

During the process of assembling the Amnesty International report, Berry Mendez said she heard stories of wage theft, unsafe living and working conditions, verbal abuse, sexual abuse and violence.

Bueckert wants to see a “federal pathway to permanent residency for health-care workers,” and Berry Mendez said permanent immigration should be used to meet the “vast majority of labour market demands.”

The cuts to international students could have a significant impact on the resources of post-secondary institutions, said Annabree Fairweather, the executive director of the Confederation of University Faculty Associations of B.C.

In Canada, undergraduate international students were expected to pay an average of $41,746 in tuition this school year, compared with $7,734 for domestic students.

Universities and colleges across the country have increasingly relied upon international students for funding. Provincial funding to universities fell from 60.7 per cent in 2008-09 to 44.8 per cent in 2022-23. The average was weighed down by Ontario, whose public funding fell from 54.3 per cent in 2008-09 to 32.5 per cent in 2022-23.

Last year, after the federal government placed a cap on international students, institutions struggled to fill the financial gap. The Council of Ontario Universities projected a financial loss of $300 million for last school year, and worsening losses in the years following.

Post-secondary institutions have had to reduce costs by cutting programs and teaching positions. Conestoga College, based in Kitchener, Ont., cut several programs days before the start of the school year, and said it will axe around 80 programs before next fall.

Wasiimah Joomun, the executive director of the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations, said cuts are widespread in post-secondary education.

“At the institution level, even at the student union level, they are now having conversations about what are the core services that we do absolutely need to provide and what are the core services we can let go,” said Joomun.

Fairweather said the reduction in resources has negative effects on both students and faculty. Cuts to staff mean larger class sizes and less administrative support, causing work to be downloaded on remaining instructors.

“That work distribution is contributing to, honestly, a real crisis of burnout and the faculty being unable to deliver the kinds of quality education that they have traditionally been able to offer students,” said Fairweather.

Both Fairweather and Joomun said federal and provincial governments need to reassess how they fund education in order to make up for the shortfall the reduction of international student tuition causes.

“Targeting international students without addressing the real issue of funding in post-secondary is a short-sighted approach,” said Fairweather.","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/0c4da258-0e4d-4b45-a94b-08072f98e7bb,1762461433755/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C322%2C7972%2C4484%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-11-09 07:17:08.514905

Last month Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood admitted her department is “not yet fit for purpose”. The disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act that so few convictions have been secured by Immigration Enforcement against small boat pilots and passengers has hiked pressure on the Prime Minister.

Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp said: “Someone tell Keir Starmer it is illegal to cross the Channel illegally. These figures lay bare the collapse of border enforcement under Labour.

“Even more staggering, not a single person was convicted under Section 25 for facilitating illegal entry, the law designed to target smugglers. Meanwhile, convicted offenders from countries like Albania, Sudan, Iraq, and Iran are still being housed at taxpayers’ expense instead of being deported.

“This is what happens when you put human rights lawyers in charge of border control. The British people deserve a system that actually enforces the law.”

Of the 30 convicted pilots, 11 were from Sudan; four were from Iran and three were Palestinian. And of the 38 passengers, the greatest number were from Albania (seven), followed by Iraq (five) and Afghanistan and Vietnam (both four). The figures do not take account of the work of the National Crime Agency.

Setting out how he would tackle small boats crisis, Mr Philp said the Tories would “leave the ECHR, remove all illegal immigrants within a week of arrival” and “end the merry-go-round of appeals”. He claimed the Prime Minister “doesn’t have the backbone to do this”.

A Home Office spokesperson said: “The information set out in the FOI relates only to convictions obtained by Immigration Enforcement in the first six months of this year and does not represent the activity taken across law enforcement to tackle this threat. We are taking decisive action to dismantle the organised criminal networks behind small boat crossings which danger lives and compromise UK border security.”

The Home Secretary is expected to announce an overhaul of the asylum and immigration system this month with officials studying Denmark’s tougher rules on family reunion and its policy of only allowing most refugees temporary residency.

Reform UK MP Lee Anderson responded to the Immigration Enforcement figures, saying Labour was betraying Britain by failing to protect borders.

He said: “This is yet another staggering display of incompetence and deceit from this Labour Government. Instead of cracking down on illegal activity, their solution is simply to make it legal.

“This is a party that has failed the British public on every level. The problem will only be solved when march into the Home Office, remove those complicit in Britain’s betrayal, and restore real border control and national security.”",https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/139/1200x630/6539384.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 07:17:46.032927

But while crossings have slowed, border advocates say the human toll of migration has not.
“What we are doing here in our community is remembering the people who have died along the U.S.-México border,” said Alan Lizárraga, a spokesperson for BNHR.
Lizárraga says that even as migration slows, the dangers persist and may even increase due to stricter enforcement policies.
“Regardless of whether migration is high or low, we still have a system that doesn’t care about their lives,” Lizárraga said.","EL PASO, Texas — New data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) shows migrant encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border have dropped dramatically, reaching their lowest levels in years. But while crossings have slowed, border advocates say the human toll of migration has not.

According to CBP, illegal crossings in September fell to 26,002 nationwide, marking a 93% decrease from the peak of President Joe Biden's administration. Officials also reported zero parole releases for the fifth consecutive month, crediting enforcement measures for what they called “the most secure border in American history.”

Despite the progress federal officials describe, members of the Border Network for Human Rights (BNHR) in El Paso are using the Day of the Dead season to remind the public of those who have lost their lives seeking safety or opportunity in the United States.

“What we are doing here in our community is remembering the people who have died along the U.S.-México border,” said Alan Lizárraga, a spokesperson for BNHR.

The organization built a series of small altars this week to honor migrants who died during their journeys north. While CBP has not yet released an official figure for migrant deaths this fiscal year, hundreds have died in recent years, often due to heat exposure and dehydration in remote desert areas.

Lizárraga says that even as migration slows, the dangers persist and may even increase due to stricter enforcement policies.

“We believe that migrant deaths and the policies that we have have a direct correlation,” he said. “We are seeing policies pushing people to take alternative routes that are dangerous because of the terrain and conditions they go through.”

The BNHR also highlights concerns over deaths of those in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody.

According to the Department of Homeland Security, 18 people have died in ICE custody over the past year, twelve of them between December 2023 and September 2024, with causes ranging from leukemia and strokes to suicide.

“Regardless of whether migration is high or low, we still have a system that doesn’t care about their lives,” Lizárraga said. “We are spending so much money militarizing the border instead of fixing a broken immigration and asylum system.”

For now, CBP officials say their focus remains on maintaining control of the border, while advocates continue calling for reforms they believe would make the journey safer for those who still decide to take it.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/AP22103751696259_crop,N,,2025-11-09 07:17:50.688048

Sample of Portland, Oregon, declared in a Nov. 8 statement regarding recent immigration enforcement activity in that state.

“It does not matter whether some of our brothers and sisters have proper documentation or not,” said Archbishop Sample. “They are our brothers and sisters in the body of Christ.”

The archbishop’s statement — posted in both English and Spanish on the archdiocesan website and the archbishop’s social media platforms, along with a video version of the message — follows months of immigration raids and arrests under President Donald Trump‘s crackdown on immigrants lacking permanent legal status in the U.S., a group known to be majority Catholic Christians.

“My heart is heavy because of the continued fear and anxiety that runs through the community of our Hispanic brothers and sisters in this archdiocese,” said Archbishop Sample. “This is due to the increased ICE activity within our communities, even now in the vicinity of some of our parishes.”

Upheaval in Portland amid ICE activity

Oregon has become one of several flashpoints for tensions over the Trump administration’s hardline immigration policies, with regular protests taking place outside the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement field office in Portland.

“I want to assure our Hispanic brothers and sisters that the shepherds of the church in the United States are working diligently to advocate for their humane and respectful treatment. We are doing all that we can to alleviate this suffering,” said Archbishop Sample, who noted he is currently attending the annual U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops‘ fall plenary meeting in Baltimore.

Both Portland, Oregon’s largest city, and the state government have codified their sanctuary status, prohibiting their respective law enforcement personnel from assisting any federal agency with immigration enforcement.

In September, Trump federalized 200 members of the Oregon National Guard to protect the building. The city of Portland and the state of Oregon sued, with U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut — a Trump appointee — temporarily blocking the deployment of the troops in an October order made permanent Nov. 7.

More than 200 individuals residing in Oregon have been detained by ICE officers since Trump took office, said Reyna Lopez, executive director of the farmworker advocacy organization PCUN (Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste), during an Oct. 31 press conference in Portland.

Several North Portland public schools have implemented “secure the perimeter” protocols — locking all exterior doors while continuing learning activities — in response to reported ICE activity. On Nov. 6, some 100 community members surrounded César Chávez School an hour ahead of dismissal to watch out for ICE officers during student pickup.

Catholic teaching on immigration, deportation

Catholic social teaching on immigration balances three interrelated principles — the right of persons to migrate in order to sustain their lives and those of their families, the right of a country to regulate its borders and control immigration, and a nation’s duty to regulate its borders with justice and mercy.

The Catholic Church’s teaching also makes clear human laws regulating migration are also subject to divine justice, but it has not yet issued teaching exploring the morality of deportation beyond the magisterium of St. John Paul II.

The late pontiff’s 1993 encyclical “Veritatis Splendor” (“Splendor of Truth”) and 1995 encyclical “Evangelium Vitae” (“The Gospel of Life”) — both quote the Second Vatican Council’s teaching in “Gaudium et Spes,” the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World, naming “deportation” among various specific acts “offensive to human dignity” that “are a disgrace, and so long as they infect human civilization they contaminate those who inflict them more than those who suffer injustice, and they are a negation of the honor due to the Creator.”

He underscored their moral severity in “Veritatis Splendor” by calling them examples of “intrinsic evil,” explaining that, no matter the motives, these acts are “not capable of being ordered to God and to the good of the person.”

Across the U.S., Christians account for approximately 80% of all of those at risk of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation effort, with the single largest group of affected Christians being Catholics, according to a joint Catholic-Evangelical report published by World Relief.

Nationwide: 1 in 6 Catholics potentially directly affected by ICE activity

The report found one in six Catholics (18%) are either vulnerable to deportation or live with someone who is.

According to a Pew Research Center data analysis from March 2025, more than four out of 10 Catholics in the U.S. are immigrants (29%) or the children of immigrants (14%). But eight out of 10 Hispanic Catholics are either born outside the U.S. (58%) or are the children of an immigrant (22%), while 92% of Asian Catholics are either immigrants (78%) or are the children of an immigrant (14%). Far fewer white Catholics — just 15% — share this immigrant experience: only 6% were born outside the U.S., with another 9% born in the U.S. to at least one immigrant parent.

“As your archbishop and spiritual father, I wish I could remove this cross from you,” Archbishop Sample told the Hispanic Catholic faithful in his message.

The archbishop assured them he was “deeply concerned over what you are experiencing right now, along with all of your local parish priests. I know this is a great burden for them as well, because they feel helpless to take this cross from you. … Please know that I and your pastors stand with you in solidarity during this difficult time.”

Archbishop Sample also addressed priests “who are caring for people during these difficult times,” promising his “support and prayers.”

“We are in this together to uphold the dignity of every human person, every child of God,” said Archbishop Sample, urging all to “lean on the love that Jesus has for each one of us.

“He alone is our hope, and in him alone do we trust. He is with you always and will never abandon you,” said the archbishop. “Place yourselves in his hands.”

Portland archbishop’s message concludes with ‘Viva Cristo Rey’

Archbishop Sample concluded his message with “¡Viva Cristo Rey!” (“Long live Jesus Christ!”) — the battle cry of the Cristeros, who defied the anti-Catholic, secular government of Mexico during the Cristero War of 1926-1929. The Cristeros’ defiant cry was made famous in particular by Blessed Miguel Pro. The Mexican martyr and Jesuit priest extended his arms in the form of a cross and shouted those words before he was executed by firing squad in 1927.

In 2000, St. John Paul II canonized 25 martyrs from the Cristero War. In 2016, Pope Francis canonized the most recent Cristero martyr, St. José Sánchez del Río, a teenager remembered for repeating “¡Viva Cristo Rey!” many times before his own public martyrdom in 1928.

The high court in Johannesburg has ordered an anti-migrant vigilante group to stop blocking foreigners from entering government health facilities and schools, actions it said were unconstitutional.

The group, named Operation Dudula from the Zulu for “force out”, was founded in 2021. Its self-described mandate is to remove African migrants – by force, if necessary – from the country. It blames them for South Africa’s rampant crime, inequality and unemployment.

Some politicians have capitalised on and stoked xenophobia in the country, which has a history of extreme violence towards black African foreigners.

Judge Leicester Adams ruled that Dudula must stop spreading hate speech and stop evicting foreign nationals from their homes or stalls. He also said the police cannot search foreigners’ homes without a warrant, and must have a clear reason to believe someone is in the country illegally before asking for identification.

In two of South Africa’s provinces, Dudula members stopped people they suspected of being foreign nationals from accessing hospitals, demanding they produce identification.

In response, rights groups including Kopanang Africa Against Xenophobia and Abahlali baseMjondolo took the group to court in 2023.

The national immigration and police departments, who have been accused of aiding Operation Dudula, were also named as respondents. Dudula did not oppose the court application. The judge noted that “they were aware of it and decided to ignore the court proceedings”.

Abahlali’s Mqapheli Bonono told The Continent what Dudula was doing was clearly illegal. But they weren’t stopped by police, private security or hospital management, who Bonono said were complicit. Kopanang’s media organiser Mike Ndlovu said the ruling “sets a crucial precedent that the rule of law, not mob justice, protects everyone in South Africa regardless of nationality”.

(It's worth noting that The New York Times previously investigated a case in which an ICE agent fatally shot a man in Chicago, and found discrepancies in the official DHS account. )

According to a court document filed against Jimenez, who was charged with assaulting a federal officer, one of the officers — gun in hand — approached Jimenez and told him to leave, then took out a canister of pepper spray. Jimenez briefly drove forward and away from the incident before ""rapidly"" reversing back towards a second officer, the criminal complaint says.

The officer with the pepper spray then shot Jimenez in the shoulder through the back window, according to the document. Trisha McLaughlin, a DHS spokesperson, told ABC News that ""the subject fled the scene and abandoned his vehicle."" Jimenez later checked himself into a hospital, where, after treatment, he was arrested by federal officers before being released on bond.

Statements Jimenez's lawyer provided the LA Times, The New York Times, ABC News and the news radio station KPCC agreed with some details — the agent approached Jimenez with a gun in hand and took out his pepper spray, while Jimenez quickly reversed his vehicle.

They disagreed with other details, though — according to the lawyers, Jimenez, who was afraid, had to back up in order to leave, he said, because the agent's cars were blocking a lane of traffic. The lawyers claimed that the agent fired at Jimenez while he was driving away.

A responding Chicago police officer was injured during the incident, according to another CPD officer at the scene.

The incident happened as federal agents launched several operations Saturday in the Little Village neighborhood as part of Operation Midway Blitz, possibly detaining at least two people.

In a statement posted to X, DHS said agents were conducting operations near 26th Street and Kedzie Avenue in the Little Village neighborhood when the shooting happened.

An angry crowd gathered after federal officer allegedly detained a young woman near 26th and Kedzie.

Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino was there. He could be seen in cellphone video with an apparent tear gas canister in his hand.

Residents demanded the detained woman's release while in pursuit of their caravan.

During the incident, DHS says an unknown male, who was driving a black Jeep, fired shots at agents and fled the scene. DHS also said ""an unknown number of agitators"" threw a paint can and bricks at Border Patrol vehicles.

Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez says cellphone video recorded by a resident shows something different.

""It's very clear. They came out of the vehicles pointing their weapons and they used tear gas on people,"" Sigcho-Lopez said.

Moments later, a Chicago police officer who had been called to the intersection for crowd control was hit by a car, another officer at the scene told our Chicago sister station, WLS. He was taken to the hospital. CPD has not updated his condition.

CPD officials confirmed to WLS, police officers responded to the scene for a report of shots fired, and ""there are no reports of anyone struck by gunfire.""

More chaos ensued when CBP agents appeared to use tear gas as they took another person into custody near 26th and Pulaksi, all under the watchful eye of the agency's helicopter.

""It's just been terrible to see what ICE is doing to our communities,"" resident Hubertine Henzler said. 'We're scared for our neighbors. We're scared for our friends.""

Saturday afternoon, warning whistles and vehicle horns once again blared as neighbors say federal agents attempted, unsuccessfully, to detain a man and his 11-year-old niece near 25th and Sawyers.

Tensions flared after CPD was once again called for crowd control when federal agents left after claiming a vehicle rammed their SUV.

It's unclear where those who were detained were taken or if they were charged with any crime. WLS has reached out to DHS for comment.

ICE and Homeland Security Investigations agents took up to 15 people into custody after the raid, Kenner Police Chief Keith Conley said in a video posted Saturday on social media. Conley said the raid stemmed from ""nuisance"" complaints at the Kenner boat launch, adding that his agency worked with Louisiana State Police and federal agencies including the FBI, ICE, DEA and HSI on the joint operation.

Few details of the operation were available Saturday. Authorities have not identified the people who were detained, nor have they said what, if any, criminal charges or immigration laws they are accused of violating.

Mark McCormick, a Kenner Police spokesperson, in a text message said Kenner Police ""did not arrest or charge any individuals.""

""These individuals were placed in the custody of ICE officers and any questions regarding charges or status should be directed to ICE officials,"" he said. A State Police spokesman, Capt. Nick Manale, also referred questions to ICE.

Spokespeople for ICE, HSI and the FBI did not respond to requests for the identities of those detained in the operation and information about what wrongdoing authorities may have accused them of.

The operation marks one of the largest immigration raids of President Donald Trump's second term in the New Orleans area, immigrant rights advocates and attorneys say — second only to a raid at a New Orleans flood mitigation construction site in May in which between 15 and 24 people were detained.

Conley said the operation followed a need to get tougher on ""lawlessness"" and ""nuisance crimes"" he said have been occurring along the Lake Pontchartrain lakefront.

""Citizens were getting harassed, bullied,"" he said in the video.

Law enforcement arrived at the lakefront and ""interviewed a lot of people,"" Conley said, adding that HSI and ICE and took ""13 or 15 people into custody for further investigation.""

Union Migrante, an immigrant advocacy group whose members investigate and fact-check reports of immigration raids in the New Orleans area, shared video of the operation on its Facebook page, urging residents in Kenner, which has a large Hispanic community, to avoid the area.

The group said the operation was underway at around 10:15 p.m. Friday and that a helicopter was involved.

The video shows ICE agents leading men with hands bound behind their backs to a row of what appear to be Louisiana State Police cruisers.

Amid President Trump's immigration crackdown, Louisiana State Police and Kenner Police have both entered controversial 287(g) agreements, which empower local police officers to enforce federal immigration laws.

The other is a ""task force model"" agreement which gives local officers a wider array of authorities to perform immigration enforcement actions.

Louisiana State Police, too, have entered a task force model agreement, records show.

Federal agencies which previously played little role in immigration enforcement, including the DEA and FBI, have seen agents redirected to such operations under the Trump administration.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/c8/cc8b0c24-1f4a-4fb6-88c1-8189981d4e2a/62a358ee7ad45.image.jpg?crop=1613%2C848%2C0%2C192&resize=1200%2C631&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-09 03:17:28.328604

DHS further alleges a group of people also threw a paint can and bricks at Border Patrol’s vehicle.

Cell phone video shows agents get out of their vehicle on Kedzie Avenue. Employees of a nearby business told WGN-TV they sheltered indoors after hearing gunfire and a crash.

The Chicago Police Department was called in for help and cleared the scene.

CPD said their officers were sent to the 2500 block of South Kedzie Avenue for reports of shots fired at federal agents. Officers secured the scene and there are no reports of anyone hit by gunfire.

One police officer, however, was accidentally hit by a GMC pickup truck driven by a 20-year-old woman. The officer suffered minor injuries and was taken to an area hospital in good condition, while the woman was issued two citations, according to CPD.

The suspect who reportedly fired shots at the agents and the Jeep he was driving have not been found.

Those who live in the area, however, are accusing federal agents of being aggressive.

Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th Ward) said he asked agents for warrants and identification after hearing they tried to detain a man in a vehicle with a child inside.

“When we arrived here, there was an 11-year-old little girl dragged by these masked individuals and the neighbors are trying to surround to make sure that they didn’t take her,” he said.

Sigcho-Lopez added that witnesses told him agents broke the window of a car.

“Look at what they’ve done to our community. Since 10 a.m. then and this is sadness. This is outrageous,” he said.

WGN-TV has reached out to DHS on the incident involving an 11-year-old girl and is awaiting a response.

In her opinion, Mexico continues to be perceived primarily as a transit country for migrants headed to the United States, though growing numbers seek to remain and work in Mexico. She cited Haitians, Cubans, Guatemalans, Hondurans, Salvadorans, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans as the most common asylum-seeking populations.

Carballo added that many applicants arrive without documentation, complicating verification of their status and rights. ""When families and foreigners arrive in Mexico, many don't have their documents, this makes them more vulnerable to red tape and delays,"" she said. She also pointed to U.S. policies that require Mexico to accept deported migrants, adding strain on the country's system and complicating efforts to distinguish who is seeking asylum locally.

The United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) reported 78,906 asylum applications in Mexico last year. Of 31,922 initial decisions, 78 percent were approved. Although figures for 2025 have not been released, UNHCR representative Giovanni Lepri estimated in June that Mexico receives roughly 250 new asylum and refugee requests daily — about 100 in Chiapas, another 100 in Naucalpan, and 50 elsewhere.

Lepri said at the time that the caseload remains high despite declining financial support, leaving the Mexican Commission for Refugee Assistance (COMAR) under-resourced. He also noted that COMAR handled just a few thousand cases annually in 2016–2017 but now processes close to 100,000 per year and that the agency needs to ""strengthen"" capacity, especially as UNHCR has begun reducing personnel and external support by about 20%.",https://d.latintimes.com/en/full/584950/border-before-migrants-arrive-el-ceibo-guatemala.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 07:18:06.726912

The U.S. Supreme Court will return Monday for a short week of arguments, in which the justices will consider whether state and local government officials can be held personally liable for alleged religious rights violations and whether government contractors are entitled to immediately appeal denials of derivative sovereign immunity.

The justices will also hear two cases involving the First Step Act's compassionate release provision, 18 U.S.C. Section 3582(c), and what factors district courts can consider when entertaining motions for sentence reductions.

The court will also release orders on Monday, and close Tuesday for Veterans Day.

Forced Haircut Liability

On Monday, the Supreme Court will debate whether state and local government officials can be held personally liable for alleged religious rights violations.

Louisiana man Damon Landor has asked the justices to overturn a Fifth Circuit decision affirming the dismissal of his Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, or RLUIPA, lawsuit against guards at the Raymond Laborde Correctional Center in Cottonport, Louisiana, who allegedly violated his religious rights by forcibly shaving his head in 2020. Landor, a devout Rastafarian who follows the Nazarite Vow against cutting one's hair, claims the guards handcuffed him to a chair and shaved off his dreadlocks despite his invocation of a previous Fifth Circuit decision that found the Louisiana Department of Corrections and Public Safety's prohibition on inmates having dreadlocks was unlawfully burdensome under the act.

An unanimous three-judge panel ""emphatically"" condemned Landor's treatment, but found that circuit precedent from 2009 required dismissal of his claims seeking monetary damages against the guards in their individual capacities. U.S. Congress enacted RLUIPA under its spending clause power, the panel held, which means only the recipient of federal funding – Louisiana in this case – can be held liable for violating the act.

Landor, however, contends RLUIPA unambiguously authorizes lawsuits like his. The act allows a person to ""assert a violation of this chapter as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government,"" which is defined to include ""any other person acting under color of state law."" Landor claims the Supreme Court's 2020 decision in Tanzin v. Tanvir, which held that nearly identical language in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act allows suits against federal officials in their individual capacities, settles this case. The two acts have long been described as twin statutes and should be read the same way, he said. If RLUIPA prohibits plaintiffs from seeking monetary damages from state officials, then the statute loses a significant deterrent factor, Landor adds. Courts have consistently held that prisoners' claims for prospective relief under the act become moot once they're transferred or released from a facility, so the only viable remedy for past wrongs is monetary damages against officials in their individual capacities, he said.

The federal government agrees, noting that Landor's suggested interpretation follows Congress' policy determination that private lawsuits are important mechanisms for enforcing RLUIPA. Federal lawmakers have broad discretion when it comes to setting conditions for federal funding, the government said, and they often require state and local officials to honor certain rights and statutes as a way to ensure that federal funds are used appropriately. Additionally, nothing in the U.S. Constitution bars Congress from imposing liability on parties other than the named funding recipient, the government claims.

Louisiana counters that legislation like RLUIPA that's enacted under the Constitution's spending clause operates more like a contract, and, therefore, only the named parties can be held liable for any alleged violations. Nonparties like individual officials cannot be bound by terms of a contract they didn't agree to, the state said. The statute also doesn't clearly and unambiguously allow for suits against officials in their individual capacities or for monetary damages. While courts have held that RFRA's language allows plaintiffs to sue federal officials in their individual capacity, the fact that RLUIPA is aimed at states requires a different analysis of the language due to sovereign immunity concerns, Louisiana said.

Weil Gotshal & Manges LLP partner Zachary D. Tripp will argue for Landor, Libby A. Baird, of the U.S. Solicitor General's Office, will argue for the federal government in favor of Landor, and Louisiana Solicitor General J. Benjamin Aguiñaga will argue for the state.

The case is Landor v. Louisiana Department of Corrections and Public Safety et al., case number 23-1197.

Derivate Immunity Appeals

Also on Monday, the justices will consider whether court orders denying government contractors derivative sovereign immunity should be immediately appealable.

The GEO Group Inc., which operates a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Aurora, Colorado, has petitioned the high court to review the Tenth Circuit's dismissal of an interlocutory appeal of a district court's finding that the contractor must face claims of unjust enrichment and allegations that it violated the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. Alejandro Menocal claims in a class action that GEO forced detainees to conduct housekeeping work with threats of solitary confinement for noncompliance and underpaid participants in a voluntary work program.

A three-judge panel dismissed GEO's appeal for lack of jurisdiction, finding that the district court's derivative sovereign immunity ruling wasn't a collateral order eligible for immediate appeal under 28 U.S.C. Section 1291. The questions of whether GEO is entitled to derivative sovereign immunity and whether the contractor is liable for the alleged allegations are based on similar fact patterns, namely whether the challenged actions were ordered by the government or not, the panel said.

GEO argues the Tenth Circuit is wrong and that decisions on derivative sovereign immunity are ""final decisions"" under Section 1291 and subject to an interlocutory appeal exception. District court orders denying similar Immunities, such as absolute immunity, qualified immunity and Eleventh Amendment immunity, are immediately appealable because they effect whether a dispute can continue to the merits. Derivative sovereign immunity is similarly dispositive, GEO said, and can't be effectively reviewed on appeal after final judgment. Even if there is some overlap between the facts that help determine immunity and liability questions, the Supreme Court has in the past said the questions are distinct enough to trigger Section 1291's exception, the contractor said.

Menocal, on the other hand, claims GEO's interpretation would lead to piecemeal and costly litigation. Derivative sovereign immunity, despite its name, is not an immunity from liability but a defense to liability, he said, so the question of whether it applies in a particular dispute are usually fact-based ones decided by juries. In virtually every case, derivative sovereign immunity will be intertwined with the dispute's merits, making appeals of final judgments the best avenue to challenge adverse rulings, Menocal said.

The federal government mostly agrees with Menocal, but warns the Supreme Court against issuing a categorical rule. In most situations, it said, decisions on whether contractors are entitled to derivative sovereign immunity will be fact-based defenses that can be vindicated on appeal with a reversal of a final judgment. But there are certain, rare situations in which such decisions may require interlocutory appeals. The Supreme Court could rule against GEO in this case while still leaving some room for interlocutory appeals in those certain situations, the government said.

Greenberg Traurig LLP shareholder Dominic E. Draye will argue for GEO Group, Gupta Wessler LLP principal Jennifer D. Bennett will argue for Menocal, and Sopan Joshi, of the U.S. Solicitor General's Office, will argue for the federal government in favor of Menocal.

The case is The GEO Group Inc. v. Menocal et al., case number 24-758.

Sentence Reduction Challenges

On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will debate defendants can meet the First Step Act's compassionate release provision's ""extraordinary and compelling reasons"" requirement for sentence reduction by alleging grounds typically used for habeas corpus relief.

New York defendant Joe Fernandez, who is currently serving a life sentence in relation to the 2000 murders of two drug cartel members, has asked the justices to review a Second Circuit decision reversing a reduction in his sentence under the compassionate release provision. A Southern District of New York judge reduced Fernandez's sentence to 11 years of time served in 2021 after finding major issues with the sufficiency and reliability of evidence presented against the defendant at trial, including eyewitness testimony, and due to the disparities between the length of Fernandez's sentence and those of his co-defendants.

A three-judge panel reinstated Fernandez's life sentence after finding that none of those reasons rose to the level of ""extraordinary and compelling reasons"" required under Section 1291. Fernandez had also previously raised similar challenges under 28 U.S.C. Section 2255, which allows for federal inmates to vacate constitutionally or statutorily defective sentences.

Fernandez claims the Second Circuit impermissibly limited the range of considerations that district courts can take review when deciding whether to reduce a sentence under the First Step Act. The statute's plain language, he said, imposes no ""categorical"" restrictions on what factors courts can review, respecting the historic tradition of granting courts wide discretion in sentencing. Fernandez said he can properly argue that the same reasons that in certain cases may warrant invalidation of a sentence under the habeas corpus statute, warrant a reduction of his sentence in this case. As long as defendants don't use the compassionate relief provision to argue for invalidation of his conviction or sentence, they are free to argue that similar grounds warrant a reduced sentence.

The federal government counters that Fernandez's interpretation of the First Step Act's compassionate release provision would allow defendants to end run the habeas corpus statute. The plain meaning of the compassionate release provision requires a defendant's reasons to be highly unique and often unforeseen. Since Congress predicted that defendants would lodge challenges to their convictions and sentences based on allegedly constitutional violations, abuse of discretion or ineffective assistance of counsel, those reasons don't amount to the ""extraordinary and compelling"" ones contemplated by the compassionate release provision, the government said.

Cravath Swaine & Moore LLP partner Benjamin Gruenstein will argue for Fernandez, and Eric J. Feigin, of the U.S. Solicitor General's Office, will argue for the federal government.

The case is Fernandez v. United States, case number 24-556.

Sentence Reduction Reasons

Also on Wednesday, the justices will consider if district court's can consider disparities created by prospective changes in sentencing laws as ""extraordinary and compelling reasons"" that warrant a sentence reduction under the First Step Act.

Defendants Daniel Rutherford and Johnnie M. Carter have petitioned the high court in consolidated cases to review the Third Circuit's determination that a 2023 rule issued by the U.S. Sentencing Commission, which states that defendants serving ""unusually long"" sentences who would be subject to much shorter sentences under current law, creates an ""extraordinary and compelling"" reason to reduce an individual's sentence under the First Step Act's compassionate relief provision. Rutherford and Carter are currently serving more than 42 years and 70 years in prison, respectively, under now-defunct mandatory minimum statutes for armed bank robberies.

Both men challenged their sentences as unusually long and grossly disparate under the Sentencing Commission's sentence, but the Third Circuit ruled that the guidelines didn't change the fact that the First Step Act's compassionate release provision specifically forbids courts from deeming prospective changes in law as an ""extraordinary or compelling"" reason prompting a sentence reduction.

Rutherford argues the Third Circuit's decision contradicts a long history of giving district courts wide discretion to consider all relevant information when sentencing a defendant. What constitutes an ""extraordinary and compelling"" reason for sentence reduction is a case-specific inquiry that, under the plain text of the compassionate release provision, must consider a sentence's length and what would be available under present law. Congress enacted the compassionate release provision with the exact aim of alleviating unusually long sentences, he said, and the Supreme Court should not allow courts to undermine the statute's purpose.

Carter adds that Congress purposefully delegated power to the Sentencing Commission to define what types of ""extraordinary and compelling"" reasons would require sentence reductions. The commission's 2023 decision to allow district courts to consider prospective changes in law was well within its discretion and should receive some deference from the Supreme Court, he said.

Meanwhile, the federal government, claims guidance from the Sentencing Commission can not change the fact that Congress made sentencing reforms explicitly prospective. Lawmakers had the option to apply reforms retroactively to defendants like Rutherford and Carter, but it decided against that. The courts and the commission should respect that policy choice, the government said. Additionally, the commission's limited role is to describe what subsets of potential reasons might warrant a sentence reduction and the 2023 guidelines clearly exceed the boundaries of its delegate power.

Defendants Daniel Rutherford and Johnnie M. Carter have petitioned the high court in consolidated cases to review the Third Circuit's determination that a U.S. Sentencing Commission rule issued in 2023 state that defendants serving ""unusually long"" sentences

David C. Frederick, a Kellogg Hansen Todd Figel & Frederick PLLC partner, will argue for Rutherford, Debevoise & Plimpton LLP partner David A. O'Neil will argue for Carter, and Eric J. Feigin, of the U.S. Solicitor General's Office, will argue for the federal government.

The consolidated cases are Rutherford v. United States, case number 24-820, and Carter v. United States, case number 24-860.

The doors to some of Chicago’s most authentic Mexican restaurants have remained locked for fear of federal agents.","Baltazar Enriquez began wearing his whistle in June, when the threat of the Trump administration’s immigration raids was more focused and the fear perhaps less widespread in Chicago. The whistle — green plastic, attached to an orange lanyard — was at first a small gesture of preparedness. It has since become a symbol of resistance.

In the beginning, the sight of it around Enriquez’s neck prompted questions and confusion in Little Village, one of Chicago’s proudest Latino neighborhoods. He remembers people asking him, perplexed: “What is a whistle gonna do?”

“And we said, ‘Well, the whistle is in case immigration is around, and you start blowing. The whistle is for people who are undocumented to go away, to lock their doors, lock their gates and not open the door.’

“And it grew like wildfire. Now everybody’s using it.”

For the past two months of President Donald Trump’s so-called Operation Midway Blitz, federal agents have engaged in a norm-defying assault on the Chicago area. In Little Village, where Enriquez is president of the community council, restaurant doors have remained locked and business along 26th Street has slowed.

The resistance born there, though, has spread. A movement that began in Chicago’s Latino enclaves has arrived in neighborhoods everywhere, breaking through segregation and boundaries long defined by race and socioeconomic status. A city known for its resilience and a take-no-nonsense attitude has found another reason to unite

And in its unity, the city has made a statement, an unmistakable message akin to the one a woman packing whistles at a recent “Whistlemania” event on the Northwest Side hoped to send.

“Show ’em that you don’t (expletive) with Chicago,” she said.

The whistles have become part of the city’s soundtrack, the sight of them around people’s necks as common as Bears jerseys. But the resistance to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and U.S. Border Patrol agents, often dressed in tactical gear, toting weapons built for war through city neighborhoods and suburban subdivisions, has taken many forms. A movement has grown through acts large and small.

Resistance is a woman documenting the deployment of tear gas in Broadview. It’s neighbors coming together to grab one of their own from the grasp of federal agents in Old Irving Park. It’s a white suburban mom rushing from her house in Mount Prospect, phone camera in hand, to scream at federal agents to get out of her village.

It’s a 24-year-old man, the son of Mexican migrants, who alerted dozens of day laborers of the presence of ICE during a recent raid in the northwest suburbs, and then sheltered and protected them. It’s a young Black man on the South Side recording the detainment of several U.S. citizens following an apparently warrantless raid and sharing that video with the world.

And it’s hundreds of high school students who walked out of their classes and into the streets of Little Village, carrying flags and signs and blowing whistles, literally and figuratively.

In Little Village alone, Enriquez said, he and his colleagues on the community council have distributed almost 10,000 whistles. In the earliest days of the Chicago resistance, he said ICE and Border Patrol officers responded with bewilderment when people began blowing them in their presence. Enriquez can remember one agent who smirked and laughed at the sound.

“But he didn’t, once he saw people locking their doors and getting away,” he said.

The movement, like the noise, has only grown more intense.

‘No longtime activist’

She resisted because others inspired her to resist. Because for weeks she’d watched videos of protests at an ICE detention facility in Broadview and of standoffs between Chicagoans and federal agents in Brighton Park and the East Side and everywhere else. Videos that, at times, showed the targets of the raids “literally fighting for their lives.”

She resisted, ultimately, because agents showed up on her street on a random Sunday afternoon in October. Outside her door. On her quiet block in Mount Prospect. That’s when Lisa Porter ran outside.

“It was sort of like I was finally able to find a place to put my rage,” she said later, “and try to be a little productive instead of feeling so helpless.”

Porter, 53, had never been all that politically active. She’d never been much of a protester. She’s a suburban mother of three — a 13-year-old daughter and twins who are 11. “I’m no longtime activist,” she said.

Her resistance began that day “by running out and screaming at people.”

“Now, granted,” she said, “I recognize that that’s not necessarily a tactic that everyone thinks is terribly effective. (But) I had been seeing a lot of it on those videos, and really it seemed to be the thing that got them to back down.”

There were agents in two SUVs down her street that day, and others circling nearby blocks in four or five more vehicles. She remembers their masks. About 20 of her neighbors had gathered outside to bear witness, with some of them, like Porter, rushing to protect anyone who might be targeted. Rumors swirled up and down the street and in the aftermath: that it was a cartel member they were after.

Or a sex offender. Or a murderer. Or someone who was all three?

The “worst of the worst,” as the Trump administration has often put it.

“There were several different stories that they told,” Porter said, but she knows that at “no point did they say, ‘Stay in your houses. There’s a dangerous criminal on the loose.’”

She cannot be sure whether the agents ultimately apprehended anyone. If they did, she didn’t see it, which leads her to believe it didn’t happen. She was, after all, trailing the vehicles — confronting the agents inside, screaming at them. A Tribune photographer captured Porter in mid-scream, her face twisted in rage, the masked agents on the other end of her ire avoiding eye contact.

The one in the driver’s seat is looking away from her. The other straight ahead.

She was yelling “a lot of not-safe-for-work things,” she said.

She remembers one interaction, when an agent that day asked her if she was “OK with criminals in the neighborhood.”

“You’re the criminals,” she told them. “You’re the ones kidnapping people off the street.”

About two weeks later, Porter received a text from a neighbor. ICE was back. Porter made her way to her neighbor’s house but by the time she arrived the agents were gone. It left locals feeling uneasy and angry again. On the way home, Porter noticed a young man mowing a nearby lawn. She flagged him down and offered a warning:

“I just want you to be safe,” she told him. “ICE is in the area.”

But he already knew. What he said in response has lingered in Porter’s mind.

She can still hear him saying it:

“They came and took my dad 10 minutes ago.”

‘These are my people’

He resisted because he identifies with those who’ve been targeted and deported. Because he has never forgotten the sacrifices his parents made or their journey from Michoacán, Mexico, to West Englewood, where he “didn’t grow up in one of the best neighborhoods,” but where he found opportunity, nonetheless.

He resisted, ultimately, because “these are my people.” That was one of Efrain Cuevas’ first thoughts when he noticed the caravan of Ford Explorers with Texas plates last month. And there was a moment, however brief, when his mind offered an alternative to what he was seeing.

“I guess people from Texas are visiting,” he said to himself. But at the same time he knew. He knew those vehicles carried federal agents and he saw them as they came closer. That was when Cuevas began shouting. Began screaming, with as much force as he could muster:

“La Migra! La Migra!”

“Which is ICE, in Spanish,” he said. “Everybody just started running.”

“It was everybody for themselves.”

Cuevas, 24, is an American citizen and Chicago native. He attended Chicago Bulls College Prep on the Near West Side. He said he served in the Marines. Now he works in maintenance at an apartment complex in northwest suburban Hoffman Estates. The apartments needed new windows and so the management company hired a crew.

Dozens of laborers arrived. Cuevas estimates that about 40 of them were in the U.S without legal permission.

In a way, they reminded him of his parents. They’d come to this area seeking opportunity. The only difference, as Cuevas saw it, was that he happened to be born here and they didn’t. But he wondered: “Why can’t we all just be human?”

“We all bleed red,” he said. “But, you know, I guess people just don’t like specific skin colors.”

When he started shouting upon the arrival of the agents, the workers began to scramble. It was “chaos,” Cuevas said, “and I’ll always see people just running in different directions.” They’d been there to install windows but now there was panic. Some of the crew members found their way into the buildings they were working on. Cuevas opened doors to unoccupied units where workers hid.

He tried to interrupt detainments in progress and asked for search warrants. One of the agents, he said, asked him if he was a U.S. citizen.

“Yes, sir,” Cuevas responded, and again asked to see a search warrant.

“But these agents are like — the Constitution? They don’t even care about it,” he said.

It was only after everything quieted down that Cuevas realized that agents detained at least three workers. Dozens of others remained hidden until the agents left. Some of the workers had their car keys taken, Cuevas said. The agents swiped them out of the ignition through open windows so that the owners of those cars wouldn’t be able to drive away.

Cuevas tried to facilitate safe exits when the time came and, for days after, everything played over in his mind: the sight of the SUVs, the workers running, the agents giving chase.

“I’m still in shock,” he said.

A week later, the new windows and the equipment to install them were still scattered about the property, a job left unfinished. Cars remained parked on the grass, left behind by people taken away, or ones who escaped and were too afraid to come back. The scene offers constant reminders. Cuevas has thought a lot about his parents, who “wanted to give their kids an American dream.”

He suspects it wasn’t much different for the workers.

“I saw this and it really did hit home for me,” he said. “And I was like, I have to protect these people …

“Who’s gonna look after them?”

‘Chicago isn’t playing around’

Resistance is as much a part of Chicago’s history as resilience, and in a lot of ways one can’t exist without the other. This is a city that rose from the ashes of a fire and rebuilt itself 150 years ago. The Haymarket Riot of the 1880s, when the working class fought for an eight-hour work day, remains one of the most important labor movements in American history.

In 1968, the turmoil surrounding the Democratic National Convention — where Mayor Richard J. Daley’s police force met anti-Vietnam war activists with brute and bloody force — underscored a greater American unrest. One speaker, Connecticut Sen. Abraham Ribicoff, lambasted Daley for his “gestapo tactics” against protesters.

Almost 60 years later, little has changed about the city’s spirit. The difference, though, is that those resisting now aren’t doing so in opposition to war in a faraway place. They’re resisting, instead, what they consider to be an invasion of their city and their neighborhoods. They’re resisting the presence of federal agents who look more like soldiers, and immigration raids that feel like attacks.

The deeds of resistance, themselves, can be wide-ranging. They don’t fit neatly into boxes. They can be, as one viral social media post detailed, as simple as a middle schooler handing out whistle packets with a know-your-rights card on a city street. They can be the profane messages, written on the street in chalk, against ICE outside of its facility in Broadview, or the 14 suburban women who were arrested Friday after they hopped the concrete barricades that have proliferated around the processing center, sat down in the middle of the street and held hands in a organized display of civil disobedience.

They can be marches. Or walkouts. Or a local ironworker and union board member who spread the word in a video on Tik-Tok — seen more than 32,000 times as of Friday evening — that “Chicago isn’t playing around.”

“We’ve been standing up to government since the 1800s,” Paul Goodrich of Iron Workers Local #63, says into the camera. He wears his hard hat and a short beard. And, as a white man who works “a hard job,” as he put it, he has the look of the kind of person President Donald Trump most tries to appeal to. But Goodrich isn’t having it.

“If Donald Trump thinks that he could come in here and send his police force to hold us down, he’s wrong,” he said. “The whistles are everywhere … this is what we do. The best thing we do in Chicago is organize. So good luck.”

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment for this story. In previous statements, its spokespeople have labeled residents opposed to their enforcement as “rioters, gangbangers and terrorists.”

In Chicago, some moments of recent resistance have received national attention. Not long after the formal announcement of Operation Midway Blitz, there was the viral video of a man on a bike eluding federal agents downtown. Scenes of the protests in Broadview have been broadcast to the rest of the country.

But resistance often comes in quieter forms, in the shadows.

In the days after the late September nighttime raid of an apartment building in South Shore, in a predominantly Black neighborhood, residents spoke out against the militarized invasion of their community — one in which some federal agents rappelled from helicopters.

Someone placed a small memorial on a fence near the place where 37 people had been taken into custody. There was a hula-hoop. A pink stuffed animal. A hopeful message:

“This too will pass … Protect South Shore. Protect Chicago.”

Resistance can be a lot of things but they always come in the form of “an oppositional action,” said Rachel Einwohner, a Purdue University political sociologist who has studied resistance movements for nearly 30 years.

“It could be posting on social media,” she said. “It could be participating in a march. It could be giving shelter to somebody who, you know — you hear the whistle and you’re like, ‘Oh, my God, ICE is coming,’ and you see somebody running, and you let them into your house.”

Chicago’s history of taking stands “is absolutely important” in shaping this current moment of resistance, Einwohner said, but resistance movements are not limited by ideology or political leaning. She noted that one “could say MAGA was a whole resistance movement” of its own, one that spawned Midway Blitz, but now Chicagoans find themselves pushing back.

“In this particular moment, the city of Chicago is absolutely being targeted because of its history, because of its politics, because of the Trump administration and how they’re kind of seeing things,” Einwohner said.

To stand in opposition requires very little. The challenge for scholars in her line of work, Einwohner said, is quantifying the difference any of it makes.

How does one measure the effectiveness of a social media post? Or the blowing of a whistle?

Or a march or a walkout? It can be difficult to answer.

“But small acts have huge consequences,” Einwohner said, and she thought of the person who thought to take video of George Floyd’s murder. “If she hadn’t done that, then things would be a lot different. So (resistance can be) just kind of saying, ‘I’m going to be a witness to this,’ and I’m going to say, ‘No, this is not right.’”

Whistlemania

They resisted because they believe this is not right. Because they felt like they had to do something, even if it was small.

Wednesday evenings are usually quiet at Illuminated Brew Works in Norwood Park, but the place was almost full a little after 6 p.m. on a recent Wednesday. By 6:30, it was at capacity — not a spot at the bar or any of the tables organizers brought in just for the night.

The brewery is tucked into a small industrial space off of Northwest Highway, not far from O’Hare International Airport, in Chicago’s far northwest corner. It’s a part of the city’s 41st Ward — one of the few in Chicago where Trump found success in the 2024 election. Norwood Park is not necessarily a bastion of progressivism. It is instead something of a reddish or purple island in a deep blue city.

And yet even here, where Trump won several nearby precincts, organizers of a Whistlemania event, one of several throughout Chicago in recent weeks, did not bring enough whistles. Or know-your-rights cards. Or any of the other supplies that would’ve met demand.

Agnes Guerra, one of those organizers, was not sure what to expect. She feared low turnout, and worried that a whistle-packing event in one of Chicago’s most conservative-leaning neighborhoods might come and go unnoticed.

“This ward is very red,” she said, but over the past two months she found herself “doing something every day to keep myself sane.” Sometimes that meant protesting in Broadview. Sometimes it meant spending money to support businesses that had been affected by the raids. She said she was among the early wave of protesters in Broadview when agents reacted with force.

“My joke is how do you radicalize middle-aged white women?” she asked.

“You throw tear gas at them.”

She met another neighborhood organizer, Virginia Jimenez, online, and the planning began for Whistlemania at the brewery. They thought they needed enough whistles and information packets for 1,000 people. That seemed like a lofty goal. But they could’ve used twice as many. The sight of so many people coming into the brewery to fold informational flyers into small booklets, and pack them into little bags with plastic whistles, made Guerra and Jimenez emotional.

It was especially personal for Jimenez, who recounted her personal history of arriving in the United States from Guatemala when she was 5-years-old.

“I’m very passionate about our rights, just as humans,” she said. In recent weeks she has spent a lot of time driving children of migrants around the city, to and from school or to appointments or to the grocery store, because their parents are too afraid to leave home. Too afraid of walking through their door and never returning again.

Jimenez and Guerra hoped the whistle packs they collected that night might make a small difference.

They could offer a warning. Maybe help slow a pursuit. Perhaps tell someone to run.

About 20 minutes after Whistlemania began, Guerra grabbed a microphone and said they were running low on supplies. Not long after that, she announced that they’d run out. The 1,000 whistles they had packed were destined for churches and little free libraries on street corners.

And, eventually, around people’s necks, waiting to be heard.

‘We had to fight’

They sounded the alarm in the distance down 26th Street in Little Village on a recent Tuesday morning, the shrill growing louder along with that of the chants that accompanied it. By then, students at Social Justice High had walked out of class. They’d grabbed their signs and flags and marched toward the arch at the neighborhood’s eastern edge.

The arch is the community’s most prominent landmark, and the words that stretch across it, in large letters, offer a warm greeting: “Bienvenidos a Little Village.” Lately, though, the place hasn’t felt all that inviting. The doors to some of Chicago’s most authentic Mexican restaurants have remained locked for fear of federal agents.

Along the usually busy 26th, which is Little Village’s version of Main Street, foot traffic has slowed outside of the quinceañera boutiques and other local establishments. Parking is easy to come by. Small signs taped to windows are common, ones that read: “ICE/CBP agents DO NOT have consent to enter this business/restaurant unless they have a valid judicial warrant.”

Anxiety has run high here ever since Trump’s second inauguration 10 months ago. Yet it has been especially tense since the start of the blitz and even more so since federal agents, accompanied by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Cmdr. Greg Bovino, showed up in Little Village on Oct. 23. A confrontation ensued and the agents dispersed tear gas.

The community felt attacked. Wounded. The students marched because they wanted to heal.

One of them, Lia Sophia Lopez, helped lead the march down 26th. She carried a bullhorn and led chants, her voice cracking at times with emotion. She addressed the crowd upon its arrival under the arch, and preached a message of unity and resilience and resistance.

“When they attacked our community, it hurt,” she said. “We had to fight. We had to protect our people. Because people are scared to leave their homes.

“People are scared to even walk across the street. … We’re doing this to protect the people’s peace so people are not scared of leaving and people are not scared to fight back.”

She began to head back toward school, with more than a hundred others who’d walked out, and the route took the students past the locked restaurants and quiet storefronts, through a wary neighborhood that refuses to give in. Days later, Baltazar Enriquez, president of the community council, stepped out of his office and into Don Pepe, the restaurant right next door.

He took a look around at the empty tables and said, “This restaurant used to be full at this time.” For months, Enriquez has tried to comfort and lead neighbors while his community — home to the city’s largest Mexican American population — became a focal point of the raids. Now it was the afternoon of Halloween and an eerie quiet hung over 26th Street. Enriquez grappled with a new question that had been facing his community:

Should it cancel its annual Halloween parade? Or should it encourage a community gathering in a time of constant unease, one in which “we’ve got ICE everywhere,” Enriquez said. He thought of children yearning to wear their costumes and march carefree down the street. He thought of parents who’d been too afraid to leave home but who needed a small taste of normalcy. Of belonging.

He came to think it wasn’t much of a decision at all.

And so the parade would go on. It had to go on.

Enriquez solicited dozens of volunteers. They planned to protect children in the case of a raid. To make a human circle, if the need arose, to block federal agents.

In the end, none of it was needed. But the resistance had been ready. To protect each other. To make noise.

They didn’t have tear gas or guns. But they had each other. And the little pieces of plastic Enriquez and thousands of other Chicagoans keep around their necks.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CTC-L-Little-Village-ICE04.jpg?w=1024&h=697,N,,2025-11-08 22:16:45.595294

The Portland Immigration Rights Coalition said there were five confirmed detentions in the Seaside area on Saturday.

“Through hotline calls and through our community partners as part of the Oregon for All coalition, PIRC has received information for five community members who were detained in the Seaside area on Nov. 8,” said PIRC spokesperson Natalie Lerner. “We have heard there may be additional detentions and want the community to know we are here for them as a connection to resources. As with all of the currently-escalating immigration enforcement in our state, we condemn today’s detentions — those abducted are believed family, friends, and community members. Immigration agents only serve to sow panic and trauma in our state, and we are proud to be part of the strong community response to support our neighbors. Our hotline is here 24/7 for anyone across the state who has had their family or friends taken or who believes they have witnessed ICE activity.”

According to a KMUN news report about the activity, federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers began running license plates and pulling people over and taking them into custody around 8 a.m.

Prior to Saturday, the last time a local ICE presence was reported was through Facebook in Depoe Bay in May and one arrest was reported in Newport in September.

The Seaside detentions come as the Trump administration ramps up ICE activity nationwide.

The Facebook posts, many anonymous, began popping up mid-morning: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was observed and reported apprehending people in Seaside.

Photos and videos were posted of ICE vehicles outside of Beach Books in Seaside and reports said “two to seven” people were taken into custody.

Beach Books store employee Hilary Weigel said she had seen the posts on Facebook but did not see anything at the store.

“I believe it happened before the store opened (at 10 a.m.),” Weigel said.

Jenny Pool Radway told KMUN reporter Katie Frankowicz that all five of the people detained in Seaside were on their way to jobs in the area. Pool Radway is the executive director of the Astoria-based nonprofit Consejo Hispano that provides servised to the Latine communities on Oregon’s North Coast. She likened Saturday’s operation to “a fishing expedition.”

“You’re not picking up someone who is a danger to the community,” Pool Radway said. “These are our friends, our neighbors, just regular tax-paying community members who are being hunted down.”

Seaside police dispatch, the Clatsop County Sheriff’s Office and Sgt. Litwin at the Astoria Police Department all reported that their offices were not involved in any ICE activity and they had not been contacted by the agency.

The Facebook posts ramped up throughout the morning and into the afternoon, reporting sightings of ICE vehicles moving up from Cannon Beach to Astoria, however, the only known apprehensions occurred in Seaside.

One post came from North Coast State Rep. Cyrus Javadi.

There was affordability, the 34-year-old democratic socialist said in his first news conference since winning the election the night before. Then there was what he called “an authoritarian administration” under President Donald Trump.

""It'll be my job to deliver on both,"" Mamdani said. ""It will be my job to stand up for the city.""

Trump, a Queens native, has loomed over the election in his hometown, and he has threatened to punish New York with measures such as cutting the city's funds if voters elected Mamdani, a state assemblyman from Queens. If Mamdani became mayor, Trump recently said it would be hard for him to give ""a lot of money"" to New York, adding Mamdani would waste the money with his left-leaning politics.

Mamdani has vowed to fight back in court when he takes office in January.

Here’s a rundown of what Trump could do to the nation’s largest city, and what Mamdani can do in response to − as his campaign platform promised − “Trump-proof” New York.

Deploy National Guard

In contrast to some of the other largest cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, New York has been untouched by the Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard. Trump could try deploying troops to city streets.

Gov. Kathy Hochul, a moderate Democrat, has had National Guard at subway stations to reduce transit crime, but has reportedly been preparing to push back on Trump deploying troops into the city.

Lame-duck Mayor Eric Adams forged a bond with Trump after the Justice Department dropped federal corruption charges against Adams so he could help with Trump’s immigration crackdown.

In contrast, Mamdani has discussed forming a coalition with state officials, including Trump’s nemesis, New York Attorney General Letitia James, to sue the federal government if troops get sent. He’s cited the success by LA Mayor Karen Bass and Gov. Gavin Newsom in lawsuits that blocked Trump's National Guard deployment in California.

Large-scale immigration raids

Other Democratic cities such as Chicago, LA and Boston have seen sweeping immigration raids on streets, construction sites and businesses.

New York had highly publicized immigration enforcement operations shortly after Trump's return to office, but has not had the same scale of enforcement. There was a recent chaotic immigration raid by federal agents on street vendors allegedly selling counterfeit merchandise in lower Manhattan.

Federal agents have targeted people attending immigration court or Immigration and Customs Enforcement check-ins at a Manhattan federal building. The federal actions have sometimes resulted in violence against migrants, including one woman thrown to the ground by an agent.

Mamdani said he’d hold federal agents carrying out Trump’s immigration enforcement to the same legal standard as anyone else, implying that ICE agents could be arrested for assaulting New Yorkers.

“If you violate the law, you must be held accountable,” he said. “And there is sadly a sense that is growing across this country that certain people are allowed to violate that law, whether they be the president or whether they be the agents themselves.”

Mamdani has vowed to make New York the nation’s strongest sanctuary city, which broadly means limiting local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

Mamdani has also called to invest $165 million to fund immigration legal defense services. He’s said his administration would survey every city system to protect sensitive data of undocumented people and others.

Behind the scenes, state officials and business leaders are reportedly trying to prevent raids. San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie in October successfully persuaded the Trump administration not to conduct enforcement in the California city.

Cut federal funds to NYC

Early in Trump’s second term, Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency revoked $80 million in Federal Emergency Management Agency funds. Adams’ City Hall has sued the administration for the funding.

Months later, the federal Department of Transportation said it was halting funds to the nation’s largest infrastructure project, which would bolster the busiest U.S. rail corridor underneath the Hudson River between New Jersey and Manhattan, as well as the Second Avenue Subway, also in Manhattan. Withholding about $18 billion, federal officials cited the New York City’s Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program, an equity initiative meant to expand participation by racial minorities in federally assisted contracts.

Trump has threatened to slash even more federal funds to the city if Mamdani was elected. In a Nov. 3 Truth Social post, Trump said, ""it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required, to my beloved first home.""

Like other Democratic cities and states that have faced cuts to federal benefits, Mamdani has said the city could mount legal challenges to the cuts to recoup lost funds. Some cities and states have seen some success, such as Fresno, California, and North Carolina.

Arrest America’s mayor

Even before Mamdani won the mayoralty, Trump suggested arresting Mamdani and stripping him of his citizenship if Mamdani didn't assist on federal immigration enforcement. Mamdani, born in Uganda, moved to the United States as a child and was raised in Manhattan’s Morningside Heights. He became a naturalized citizen in 2018.

Some right-wing members of Trump's party have called to review Mamdani’s citizenship process in an effort to denaturalize and deport him. Trump has threatened to arrest Democratic elected officials before.

After Mamdani won the election on Nov. 4, he spoke directly to Trump.

""New York will remain a city of immigrants, a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants, and as of tonight, led by an immigrant,"" he said. ""So, hear me, President Trump, when I say this: To get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us.""

Mamdani's line drew perhaps the loudest roar throughout the night.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/03/USAT/87065195007-mamdani-trump.jpg?crop=3577,2012,x0,y335&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-08 18:56:54.343487

Issued via State Department cable, the rules dramatically expand longstanding public charge criteria and have prompted concern over fairness, discrimination, and broader impacts on global mobility.

Advocates and health experts warn that the move risks bias while supporters argue it protects American taxpayers and ensures self-sufficiency among newcomers.​

Broader Health Scrutiny Fuels New Exclusions

The new guidance, circulated by the State Department to US embassies and consulates worldwide in early November 2025, directs consular officers to consider whether chronic medical conditions-ranging from cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers, neurological and mental health issues, and obesity-would require “hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth” of care, potentially justifying denial of US visas.

The directive lists specific conditions, yet signals that the list is not exhaustive, paving the way for even wider officer discretion. Obesity is flagged, with the memo noting its potential complications such as asthma, sleep apnea, and hypertension.

Dependents’ health status now receives scrutiny as well, with visa officers urged to evaluate family members’ likelihood of creating future financial burden for US healthcare systems.​

Officials maintain the change is meant to “safeguard US resources,” targeting applicants deemed at risk of becoming a “public charge”-a historic category under American immigration law for those who may rely on government-funded support.

A Department of State spokesperson, speaking to Fox News, said, “The Trump administration has brought an end to the era of mass immigration… We continue to prioritise applicants who can demonstrate self-sufficiency.” Visa officers must now evaluate whether applicants have adequate means to pay for any future medical care over their expected lifetimes, without recourse to US public assistance.​

Expert, Advocacy, and Community Concerns

While health screening has always formed part of immigration processing-screening for communicable diseases and vaccination records-the new guidance marks a significant expansion. Immigration attorneys, including Charles Wheeler at the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, question the subjective power given to individual officers, stating, “These decisions shouldn’t be based on personal bias or speculation, especially when officers aren’t medically trained.”

Wheeler also highlights a contradiction with the State Department’s own Foreign Affairs Manual, which prohibits denials based on hypothetical scenarios.​

Sophia Genovese, an attorney at Georgetown University, argues this “goes well beyond the traditional medical exam,” and that such criteria could exclude millions globally living with common chronic illnesses.

About one in ten people worldwide has diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases remain leading causes of death-a context that the new policy fails to address equitably.

Public health experts assert that many such conditions are treatable and should not justify immigration exclusion. Instead, the rules appear to favour young, wealthy, and healthy immigrants, threatening the US’s position as a destination for diverse talent, including international students, professionals, and family reunification.​

Immigration advocates, such as United We Dream and the American Immigration Council, have warned that the expanded “public charge” exclusion will disproportionately impact older applicants and those from lower-income backgrounds.

The cable encourages officers to consider projected medical costs and an applicant’s ability to pay these privately, further raising the bar for entry.

Critics also point to risks of discrimination unrelated to applicants’ actual ability to contribute to society, and challenge the ethical basis of denying entry for treatable health issues.​

Recent news reports and fact-checkers emphasise that while the US government retains authority to set entry conditions, abrupt expansion of these criteria under Trump could result in more rejections for reasons that intersect health, age, and financial status, not just merit or security.​

Immigration Context Under Trump: The Crackdown Deepens

This directive is only the latest in a series of immigration restrictions issued since Donald Trump’s second term began. The administration has tightened refugee admissions, raised H-1B and Green Card fees, and expanded enforcement actions targeting undocumented migrants.

Trump’s stated policy priority has included “restoring law and order” and “putting Americans first,” with a renewed push to reduce legal migration and overhaul pathways to citizenship.​

Prior measures include aggressive deportations, the infamous family separation policy at the Mexican border, bans on refugees from several countries, and substantial slowdowns or increases in scrutiny for highly skilled worker visas.

The expansion of public charge-related exclusions echoes previous attempts by Trump officials between 2018 and 2020 to amend how health, income, and reliance on public programs were evaluated in visa and Green Card cases.

Those earlier rules-which faced heavy legal challenges and public pushback-were subject to ongoing court battles and partial rollbacks, but the 2025 directive signals a fresh, more comprehensive crackdown.​

Legal experts note that while health has always been a component in visa processing, including communicable and vaccine-preventable diseases, no prior administration gave this level of discretionary power to consular staff, nor explicitly listed chronic, non-infectious conditions as grounds for visa denial.

The broader context reveals a systematic trend towards “merit-based” immigration and prioritising applicants who can demonstrate both immediate economic value and minimal long-term risk to welfare systems.​

The Logical Indian’s Perspective

The Logical Indian believes that nations have a legitimate interest in protecting public health and managing resources, but blanket exclusions for treatable or common conditions undermine core values of fairness, empathy, and diversity.

Such policy risks stigmatizing those with chronic or age-related health issues, and could erode the principle of equal opportunity long associated with the American dream. Instead, immigration reform should balance fiscal responsibility with compassion and inclusion.

We urge policymakers to seek innovative solutions-such as insurance requirements, healthcare cooperation agreements, or tailored screening protocols-that allow for public interest protection without resorting to outright exclusion and bias.",https://thelogicalindian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Copy-of-Social-Thumbnail-Template-20-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 03:17:16.413603

The incident took place during protests on Nov 8 in the Little Village neighbourhood of Chicago following immigration raids by federal agents. A Reuters witness saw police detaining a man during an argument with residents after an immigration raid.

DHS said “agitators” threw a paint can and bricks at Border Patrol vehicles on the same day during operations.

“Over the past two months, we’ve seen an increase in assaults and obstruction targeting federal law enforcement,” DHS said in a statement, which was posted on X.

Raids across Chicago and the surrounding suburbs, including one at a daycare centre this week, have led to protests and violent arrests.

More than a dozen suburban Chicago mothers were arrested on Nov 7 outside an immigration detention facility in Broadview, a suburb west of Chicago which has been a flashpoint for anger around Trump’s “Operation Midway Blitz”.

The immigration crackdown in Chicago began in September, with the stated purpose of pursuing dangerous criminals without the legal right to reside in the US. It has resulted in more than 3,000 arrests, according to the DHS. Those arrests have included US citizens and people with no criminal history.

What we know:

The incident happened near the intersection of 26th Street and Pulaski when agents appeared to detain at least one person.

The Department of Homeland Security told Fox News in a statement that U.S. Border Patrol was conducting ""immigration enforcement operations"" near 26th Street and Kedzie Avenue when an unknown male driving a black Jeep fired shots at agents and fled the scene.

DHS also claimed a number of ""agitators"" threw a paint can and bricks at Border Patrol vehicles.

The gunman remains at large, DHS said.

Chicago Police said they responded to a call of shots fired at federal agents in the 2500 block of S. Kedzie. No one was struck by gunfire, according to police.

Chicago Ald. Michael Rodriguez (22nd Ward) said in a video posted on his Facebook page that agents were ""causing all sorts of mayhem."" He said agents used a flash bang against a gathered crowd.

""They’re doing things that are unconstitutional, that are illegal,"" Rodriguez said. ""They are causing fear and mayhem in our communities and that's unacceptable.""

A video posted on Instagram appeared to show federal agents arresting someone in front of the Los Comales restaurant in the 3100 block of 26th Street.

The incident happened in the Little Village neighborhood, which is known as a largely Mexican-American community.

Chicago police officers were also seen in the area, appearing to be helping with crowd control.

A Fox 32 camera also followed as large crowds appeared to surround federal agents for multiple blocks. Several Chicago police officers were also seen trying to control the crowds. At least one other person was seen handcuffed by CPD officers.

Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th Ward) was also broadcasting live on social media near 26th Street and Sawyer Avenue as he appeared to confront immigration agents and questioned what they were doing in the community.

In a statement posted to X, DHS said agents were conducting operations near 26th Street and Kedzie Avenue in the Little Village neighborhood when the shooting happened.

An angry crowd gathered after federal officer allegedly detained a young woman near 26th and Kedzie.

Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino was there. He could be seen in cellphone video with an apparent tear gas canister in his hand.

Residents demanded the detained woman's release while in pursuit of their caravan.

Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez says cellphone video recorded by a resident shows something different.

""It's very clear. They came out of the vehicles pointing their weapons and they used tear gas on people,"" Sigcho-Lopez said.

Moments later, a Chicago police officer who had been called to the intersection for crowd control was hit by a car, another officer at the scene told ABC7. He was taken to the hospital. CPD has not confirmed the injury or the condition of the officer who was apparently struck.

CPD officials confirmed to ABC7 that Chicago police officers responded to the scene for a report of shots fired, and ""there are no reports of anyone struck by gunfire.""

More chaos ensued when CBP agents appeared to use tear gas as they took another person into custody near 26th and Pulaksi, all under the watchful eye of the agency's helicopter.

""It's just been terrible to see what ICE is doing to our communities,"" resident Hubertine Henzler said. 'We're scared for our neighbors. We're scared for our friends.""

Saturday afternoon, warning whistles and vehicle horns once again blared as neighbors say federal agents attempted, unsuccessfully, to detain a man and his 11-year-old niece near 25th and Sawyers.

Tensions flared after CPD was once again called for crowd control when federal agents left after claiming a vehicle rammed their SUV.

It's unclear where those who were detained were taken or if they were charged with any crime. ABC7 has reached out to DHS for comment.

The person who allegedly fired shots at agents remains at large, DHS said.

DHS added, ""This incident is not isolated and reflects a growing and dangerous trend of violence and obstruction.

Department of Homeland Security officials accused him of faking the medical emergency to keep agents from arresting his wife, who was wanted for allegedly stabbing a co-worker with scissors.

“I wasn’t letting go of my wife because they wanted to take her away,” Carlos Zapata, 24, told The Boston Globe in Spanish. He spoke to the newspaper on Friday, a day after his wife was detained in a chaotic traffic stop.

Bystanders shouted and recorded the confrontation as Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers surrounded the family's car Thursday morning in Fitchburg, a city about 40 miles (65 kilometers) northwest of Boston. Agents were seeking Juliana Milena Ojeda-Montoya, who was inside the vehicle with her husband and 1 ½-year-old daughter, according to a Homeland Security news release.

Widely circulated video shows Zapata behind the wheel, his body shaking and the whites of his eyes visible as masked agents reach into the car.

“He's having a seizure!” bystanders can be heard shouting.

Zapata told the newspaper that agents were pushing him and his wife together with the child between them, and that he blacked out after agents pressed on his neck.

“I had convulsions or something. I don’t know what they did to me,” he said. When he regained consciousness, he said, agents were handcuffing him.

Zapata said he and his wife are from Ecuador and entered the country unlawfully several years ago. They have since applied for asylum in a case that is pending and are authorized to work, he said. He was driving his wife to her job at Burger King when they were stopped, he said.

Homeland Security responded to the video Friday, saying: “Imagine FAKING a seizure to help a criminal escape justice,” in a post on social media.

“Medical personnel found there was no legitimate medical emergency,” Tricia McLaughlin, the department's assistant secretary, said in a news release. “He was even caught on video on his feet and coherent moments later.”

The department said officers were conducting a targeted operation to arrest Ojeda-Montoya for the alleged scissor stabbing and for throwing a trash can at her coworker in August. She was charged with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, the Globe reported.

Korean Americans, like other Asian Americans, often deal with what he calls ""perpetual foreigner syndrome"" – the creeping feeling that, no matter their citizenship or background, they'll always be perceived by other Americans as foreign.","POOLER, Georgia – Daniel Lee's fried chicken, with its spicey-sweet glaze, regularly drew hungry Korean workers from a nearby Hyundai plant into his restaurant, 92 Chicken.

That was, until a massive immigration raid at the battery plant two months ago left Lee stunned and his business reeling. Federal agents handcuffed, chained and detained more than 300 Korean workers in an operation President Donald Trump later said he fully opposed.

The workers were flown home after a few days in immigration detention, but the effects of the raid continue to ripple out – from the tables at Lee's restaurant, to Hyundai headquarters in Seoul, South Korea, to Trump's White House.

The high-profile raid of a major global Fortune 500 company that had been aggressively recruited to Georgia infuriated many Korean Americans. According to Pew Research, some 1.8 million people in the United States trace their roots to South Korea, a nation that had long thought of itself as America's equal.

And it raised existential questions for Lee's business and for Korean Americans nationwide who didn't imagine that people here lawfully would be targeted by ICE, or that the Trump administration would pick a fight with a country that had invested billions in the U.S. economy.

Born in Philadelphia to Korean parents, Lee himself had worked 15 years for Hyundai before he launched his eatery, one of a dozen businesses in this Savannah suburb that opened to serve the Koreans and Korean Americans who came to work at the plant.

""I thought America was like my mother country, and Korea was like my father country,"" Lee said. ""So it's like my parents are fighting.""

Biggest raid in ICE history

A majority of the 300 Korean workers were present legally, on B-1 visas or under a visa waiver, that allowed them to perform equipment installation and to train American workers, said Charles Kuck, an Atlanta-based immigration attorney who represented a dozen of the workers.

However, some workers had worried their visas might not allow them to do the jobs they were assigned, given the increased enforcement under Trump, according to the Reuters news agency.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement raided the plant on a warrant to target four Hispanic workers they suspected might be in the United States illegally. They detained 475 people there on September 4, in what officials initially touted as the largest single-site raid in ICE history.

ICE had a judge's permission to search the plant for records related to employing or harboring undocumented immigrants, according to the warrant obtained by USA TODAY. Prosecutors have yet to bring criminal charges in connection with the raid, according to a search of federal court records.

""ICE knew they screwed up,"" Kuck said. ""Within 24 hours ICE stopped speaking to the press about the biggest raid in its history. It definitely is still roiling the companies because I've been told none of (the workers) want to come back.""

The Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America is the company's first mass-production plant for electric vehicles and is slated to produce half a million vehicles annually. It's an $8 billion campus that is expected to generate 8,500 jobs in the region.

The raid specifically hit a Hyundai-LG Energy Solutions partnership: a plant under construction to make EV batteries for the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9 electric SUVs.

That plant was scheduled to open by early 2026, but the arrests of hundreds of workers will delay its opening at least two to three months, Hyundai Chief Executive José Muñoz has said.

In late October, Trump traveled to Asia, looking to negotiate new trade deals and mend fences with the Koreans. Speaking from Air Force One en route, Trump said he was ""very much opposed"" to the Hyundai raid.

""Some of these factories make very, very complex, very highly sophisticated equipment,"" he told reporters. ""They've got to bring people in with them for a period of time.""

After the raid, Trump offered to let the workers remain in the U.S., but only one accepted.

A longtime strategic relationship

Trump has good reason to want to smooth over relations with South Korea. Decades of business and cultural ties are at stake, along with billions of dollars in investment and tens of thousands of jobs.

Korea ranks as the United States' eighth-largest trading partner, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

""South Korea has been a rising global power over the last two or three decades,"" said Chris Suh, associate professor of history at Emory University in Atlanta. ""Korean Americans feel that Korea finally made it.""

Seoul-based Hyundai was eager to show its commitment to the United States despite the raid.

Hyundai held its annual investor conference outside of Korea for the first time ever this year, opting for New York.

Muñoz, the CEO, opened Hyundai's September investor day with a message of ""sincere empathy"" for the workers who were detained. He underscored the company's investments and urged the United States and Korea to ""work on mutually beneficial solutions"" for foreign workers.

""Hyundai has been part of the fabric of the U.S. for nearly 40 years and has operated in Georgia for more than 15 years,"" he told investors, adding that the new battery plant ""is helping transform the region with long-term economic benefits for thousands of families.""

That's in part why the questioning and arrest of hundreds of workers who looked Asian dismayed many Korean Americans, said Mark Keam, president of the Korean American Institute.

""To say there is a sense of betrayal is an understatement,"" he said.

Keam, a naturalized U.S. citizen, has lived in the United States for 45 years, served as an elected state representative in Virginia and worked for the Biden and Clinton administrations. Korean Americans, like other Asian Americans, often deal with what he calls ""perpetual foreigner syndrome"" – the creeping feeling that, no matter their citizenship or background, they'll always be perceived by other Americans as foreign.

The raid ""has become the trigger that raised concerns that were just below the surface,"" said Keam, who travels the country in his role and recently visited Seattle, Chicago and New York City. ""In every one of those places, when I was with Korean American people, it was the biggest topic that comes up.""

Business is 'not recovering at all'

Tables at Lee's 92 Chicken franchise are emptier than they were before the raid. Lee estimates he lost a fifth of his business in its wake.

""It dropped dramatically,"" said Lee. ""It's not recovering at all.""

The city of Pooler lies between artsy Savannah and rural Ellabell, where Hyundai built its Metaplant campus. The fast-growing suburb sprawls over roughly 30 square miles, bursting with traffic and development.

""To be in the midst of Pooler to see all this growth, I was the only Korean woman and now I go to Costco and Publix and I hear my own language,"" said Kay Heritage, a longtime Korean American resident and owner of Big Bon Bodega restaurant in Pooler, which, among other things, serves a pizza topped with pickled Korean kimchi.

As Koreans and Korean-Americans flocked to the suburb, new restaurants blossomed to serve them, as did other businesses from estheticians and physical therapists to grocers and realtors, she said.

The community's loss of so many Koreans at once has hit hard.

""Especially the Korean restaurants felt the impact,"" she said.

The Hyundai campus promised a continuous flow of people and capital from Korea, said Suh, the professor at Emory.

""If these folks stop coming or are hesitant to come, that means less business, fewer people to participate in the Korean American community, fewer people going to church, buying food,"" he said. ""I think it's going to take awhile for people to feel the same way they did before the raid.""

In the kitchen of his restaurant, Lee makes Korean-style fried chicken by battering thighs and drumsticks, then brushing on a soy-garlic, sweet chili or spicy gochujang sauce, topped with green onions. He leaves plastic gloves on the tables for diners who don't want to get messy.

Now Lee is revamping his menu, looking to Americanize his fried chicken to mimic the Southern recipe, he said.

""Local people like it more, a little more saltier, and a little more sweeter,"" Lee said. ""We're gonna have to make things a little less spicy on the menu.""

He isn't angry about the raid, he said; but he is resolved.

""I can't do anything [about] the decision makers,"" he said. ""I've got to diversify my menus.""

""I stick up for Viktor Orban. Not a lot of people do, because they're, in many cases they're jealous. They wish they did what he did. They would have no problems if they did what he did,"" Trump said at a Nov. 7 White House meeting.

Trump said he's told European leaders they can learn from Orban's approach. Orban is a hero in the MAGA movement and Trump's critics have compared his second-term agenda to the playbook the Hungarian leader has used consolidate power in his country.

Orban has fought with the European Union over its support for Ukraine and his crackdown on independent institutions, in addition to the issue of immigration.

Trump said he gets along well with European leaders, but when it comes to border controls he agrees with Orban. European nations have made ""tremendous mistakes"" when it comes to taking in foreign nationals, he said.

""I happen to think he was right, because their whole fabric has changed,"" Trump said. ""I mean you go to some of the countries, they're unrecognizable now, because of what they've done. And Hungary is very recognizable.""

Trump said the autocrat had done a ""fantastic job"" and was a ""very powerful man within his country"" who's ""beloved"" by people who know him.

“Hungary’s government is systematically dismantling the rule of law and suppressing dissent under the guise of protecting national sovereignty,” Iskra Kirova, Europe and Central Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, wrote last month.

Orban said he was at the White House to ""open a new chapter"" and repair chilly relations. The Hungarian hard-liner spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2022 and attended the NATO summit in Washington in 2024 but was never received at the White House by former President Joe Biden.

Trump acknowledged that Orban is a controversial figure, as he hosted the leader who's taken steps to limit press freedom and political opposition.

""He's respected by everybody, he's liked by some,"" Trump said.

Trump said he was considering an exemption for Orban's government to the sanctions the United States has put on Russian energy companies and that the war with Ukraine would be a topic of their discussion. Hungary is one of the largest remaining importers of Russian oil and gas in Europe and has come under fierce criticism by backers of Ukraine for his relationship with Vladimir Putin.

The Hungarian capital had been expected to host Trump's next meeting with Putin until the summit was called off last month.

So once they are brought to South Sudan, that means that criminal activities will also increase,"" Martin Mawut Ochalla, a 28-year-old from Juba, told AP.","Deeply insecure and teetering on the brink of another civil war, South Sudan is frequently described as the most fragile state in the world.

Now the US, a global superpower, has tapped this young state as a destination for expelled foreign migrants, some of whom are violent criminals.

Washington began third-country deportations earlier this year, sending undocumented migrants to countries they are neither citizens of nor have any connections to.

While Central and South America have taken in the vast majority of those deportees, the program was also expanded to Africa, where some say Donald Trump is ""dumping"" people.

Experts now warn South Sudan, whose inability to deliver basic services as a state has already been compounded by sweeping USAID cuts, may be ""importing instability"" in a bid to appease its powerful ally.

World's poorest carrying burden

South Sudan, which is among five African nations taking in US deportees, was the poorest country in the world as of November in terms of GDP per capita.

Measured in net household wealth, the United States is the richest in 2025.

In July, South Sudan took in eight deportees from the US, saying it had ""responded positively"" to Washington's request as a ""gesture of goodwill, humanitarian cooperation and commitment to mutual interests"".

South Sudan's government, based in Juba, did not divulge details about what it would receive in return.

However, it has been reported that political concessions, including the removal of sanctions on ruling party members, and a chance to improve ties with the US were on offer.

Daniel Akech, a senior analyst for South Sudan at the International Crisis Group, said being in a protracted state of humanitarian and financial distress made the country particularly vulnerable to strong-arming by foreign actors.

""However, Juba's leadership also made a pragmatic, if reluctant, choice to use the deal as a potential pathway to ease crippling sanctions and begin rebuilding diplomatic relationship with the US,"" he told the ABC.

Since its formation in 2011, South Sudan has continually grappled with internal unrest, economic breakdown, and the spillover effect of the war in Sudan.

With more than 90 per cent of its 12 million population living in extreme poverty, it is heavily dependent on international partners for its developmental and humanitarian needs.

""By accepting this deal, the South Sudan government risks trading a potential diplomatic gain for a definite social loss,"" Mr Akech said.

""This situation adds further complexity to South Sudan's already fragile status, illustrating how external powers may exploit the country's internal vulnerabilities to advance their strategic objectives.""

Due to the large outflow of people from war-stricken neighbouring Sudan, South Sudan already hosts more refugees than it can handle, in addition to the 2.6 million of its own people who remain internally displaced.

According to the World Bank Group, South Sudan was hosting an estimated 900,000 refugees and asylum seekers from Sudan as of October, with 337,000 more expected to arrive before the end of the year.

Conditions in the refugee camps are squalid, with poor sanitation, outbreaks of diseases and severe malnutrition rife.

An 'equally agenda-motivated' government

Corruption is entrenched in the South Sudanese political sphere and has been a significant driver of the country's humanitarian challenges.

The Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) ranked South Sudan as the most corrupt country in the world in 2025.

A recent United Nations investigation documented how government-affiliated elitists had plundered its resources in an ongoing pursuit of ""partisan political ends"".

""The country has been captured by a predatory elite that has institutionalised the systematic looting of the nation's wealth for private gain,"" the report said.

Juba's acceptance of the US's third-country deportations is also likely to have been ""agenda-motivated"", Edmund Yakani, head of the civil society organisation CEPO, told the ABC.

""They viewed the deal on the deportees as a means to give them the opportunity of winning some gains from the US government.""

Unlike other African nations, such as Rwanda and Eswatini, the US did not make South Sudan a cash proposal — money, which if offered, could have been used to bolster the local economy and improve living standards.

Instead, Juba's chief demands included lifting US-imposed sanctions on South Sudan's Vice President Benjamin Bol Mel and his companies, sources have told Reuters.

Mr Bol Mel was planted into the vice-presidency this year after his predecessor, Riek Machar, was placed under house arrest by the government of Salva Kiir, the only president South Sudan has had.

""Interest in accepting the deportees [forms part of South Sudan's efforts] to drive the US administration on non-interference in Riek Machar's trial,"" Mr Yakani said.

In April, Washington also announced it was revoking US visas for all South Sudanese passport holders.

Reversing those visa revocations, reactivating a bank account at the New York Federal Reserve, and support for Mr Machar's prosecution were Juba's other demands, according to POLITICO, though the US has not agreed to any of them on paper.

Longer-term repercussions

The Trump administration has stated it aims to deport 1 million people annually, but analysis from the Migration Policy Institute suggests it will meet just half that target.

Mr Yakani said efforts to cover that shortfall could likely see Africa become more of a ""dropping ground"" for US deportees if African governments saw even part of their demands being met.

While South Sudan has so far taken in just eight migrants — one of whom is its own national — an influx of people would increase pressure on state institutions and essential services sectors.

Recent bilateral engagements between the White House and African leaders have hinged on the migration issue, reflecting what observers say is an attempt to transform Africa into a regional network for offloading people.

Increasing migrant numbers could have ramifications for African host countries' security, social stability and international reputation, according to Iman Al-Shaarawy from the UAE-based think tank the Future for Advanced Research and Studies (FARS).

Those include the ""division of the African stance"", deepening public anger, more resource scarcity, criminality, the perception that national sovereignty is being infringed upon, human rights criticism, and a ""re-creation of the narrative of Western dominance"" in a form akin to neocolonialism, she said.

Ms Al-Shaarawy also noted the White House's immigration-heavy focus on Africa risked creating an unequal relationship where ""certain nations serve as mere instruments to implement US domestic policy, with little regard for their local situations or their people's interests"".

Those deported to South Sudan so far have been described by the US as ""uniquely barbaric monsters"" and the ""worst of the worst"" criminals, including murderers, rapists and paedophiles.

""Some of them are criminals, they have been involved in crimes. So once they are brought to South Sudan, that means that criminal activities will also increase,"" Martin Mawut Ochalla, a 28-year-old from Juba, told AP.

Some could 'afford to' turn down overtures

The African nations of Ghana, Uganda, Rwanda and Eswatini have also agreed to take in US deportees, but some others have rejected the Trump administration's overtures.

Burkina Faso, a country long marred by terrorism and insurgency, as well as a close Russian ally, said last month it had refused the ""indecent"" request, which it called ""completely contrary to the principle of dignity"".

""Is this a way to put pressure on us? Is this blackmail? Whatever it is … Burkina Faso is a place of dignity, a destination, not a place of expulsion,"" its foreign minister then told local media.

Similarly, Nigeria said in July it would not cave in to pressure to accept undocumented foreign nationals, saying: ""We have enough problems of our own … we already have 230 million people.""

The US has reportedly also courted Liberia, Senegal, Mauritania, Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Benin, Libya, Angola and Equatorial Guinea.

""Some countries can afford to say no more easily than others,"" Mr Akech said.

The motivations of the five countries that have agreed to receive deportees vary.

While details of the individual deals the US has struck with them remain shrouded in secrecy and legally ambiguous, here is what we know:

The human cost

The welfare of those being deported has also been raised as a key concern by international organisations and rights groups.

In September, a coalition of more than 50 organisations penned a letter to the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights calling for urgent action to protect migrants' rights:

""Forcible expulsions from the United States and transfer of migrants to countries in which they are not citizens or nationals, nor habitual residents, particularly without adequate due process or consideration of international protection claims, and including in circumstances in which they are transferred to situations of prolonged detention on unclear legal bases and in poor conditions, all constitute serious violations of international and African law and standards.""

The UN has said deportations of foreign nationals to third countries — many with troubling rights records, such as Eswatini — put them at risk of violations, including torture, arbitrary deprivation of life, and enforced disappearances, in the absence of legal avenues for those in need to seek.

While some African host nations have successfully negotiated the repatriation of migrants, Mr Akech said the main focus for weaker states such as South Sudan was fulfilling their diplomatic bargains with the US.

""What happens to [the migrants] afterward is largely a secondary concern that the state is unequipped to manage effectively.""",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/5dc4b1413ee81c3212dfc78ce0a53a0a?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=1901&cropW=3380&xPos=0&yPos=176&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-11-08 15:17:40.547836

(Amaya Edwards — Santa Cruz Local/CatchLight Local)

CAPITOLA>> Throughout 2024 and early 2025, federal and out-of-state law enforcement agencies searched Capitola Police Department’s database of automatic license plate readers more than three million times, violating multiple laws. At least 190 were done by sheriffs offices and police departments running searches on behalf of U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.

Capitola Police have confirmed that they violated state law in sharing data with out-of-state agencies, and said the violations were unintentional. Now, the department is increasing its oversight into how other agencies use its data.

“The City remains committed to transparency, accountability, and maintaining the trust of our community,” Capitola Police Chief Sarah Ryan wrote in a Nov. 7 email.

Capitola Police “does not assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials in enforcing civil immigration law violations,” she said.

Capitola police lease 10 cameras from security company Flock Safety that capture license plates of passing vehicles. The data is stored on a Flock-administrated online database for 30 days. That database can be searched by Capitola Police officers and other law enforcement agencies, primarily to locate stolen cars or track down suspects.

Legally, Capitola Police can only share data with other law enforcement agencies within California. But the department had opted into a tool offered by Flock that allowed Capitola Police to search license plate data nationwide —- and allowed out-of-state searches of Capitola’s own data, a Flock spokesperson said in a Nov. 7 email.

Those searches violated California laws that forbid local and state law enforcement from sharing license plate camera data information with any out-of-state agency. Although ICE officials did not directly search Capitola’s data, public records suggest that out-of-state agencies performed searches on behalf of ICE.

Flock disabled nationwide sharing for public agencies in California in February to ensure compliance with state law, the Flock spokesperson said. But Capitola Police didn’t realize the data had been available to out-of-state agencies until a whistleblower alerted them in late October.

The violations of state law “were inadvertent and were not the result of any deliberate attempt by City staff to circumvent California law,” Ryan said by email. Ryan was sworn in as chief in December 2024, nine months after the Capitola City Council voted to lease the license plate cameras.

To ensure ongoing compliance with state law, Ryan has ordered a monthly audit of searches other agencies have conducted of Capitola’s data, she wrote.

Search records

The out-of-state searches were first identified by a retired security network analyst who lives in Santa Cruz County, after he started noticing the cameras around the area in April. “I was then immediately concerned about, okay, how are they storing the data?” recalled D., the security analyst, who asked only to be identified by his last initial out of fear of retaliation from law enforcement or Flock. He has worked in network security for 10 years.

“Especially given that they are a startup,” he added. “I’ve done security for startups, and I know that a lot of times, security is not as strong as it should be.”

The Atlanta, Georgia-based surveillance company Flock Safety says over 5,000 agencies in 49 states use its automated license plate reader. The cities of Capitola, Santa Cruz and Watsonville all operate Flock license plate cameras. Police chiefs have praised the cameras as an effective way to track down suspects of serious crimes and recover stolen vehicles.

But amid the increasing surveillance, arrest and deportation of unauthorized immigrants, city contracts with Flock have sparked pushback from activists, academics and state legislators.

In October, D. submitted a public records request to the Capitola Police for its network audit, a document that logs times other agencies have searched Capitola’s data, for 2024 and 2025. Those searches scoured databases of thousands of agencies across the country.

The logs Capitola provided D. left off the reasons out-of-state officers conducted each license plate search. But by looking at unredacted search logs from other police departments, D. was able to identify dozens of cases where out-of-state agencies searched Capitola data for immigration enforcement purposes.

For example, on Dec. 19, 2024, the Lowndes County Sheriff’s Office in Georgia searched data from 5,770 agencies, including Capitola Police Department, and listed the reason as “ICE.” U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has tapped local law enforcement agencies to search license plate data in pursuit of unauthorized immigrants, 404 Media reported in May. 404 Media is a digital publication reporting primarily on cybersecurity, technology and surveillance.

A Santa Cruz Local analysis of data from the City of Capitola and two other cities showed more than 200 immigration-related searches of Capitola’s data from dozens of state agencies from January 2024 to February 2025.

On at least one occasion, a federal agency — the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms — searched Capitola’s license plate camera data from a field division in Nashville, Tenn. The reason was listed at “Federal ERO Assist” — ERO likely referring to ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations.

California’s SB 54, the 2018 California Values Act, prohibits local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. Another law, SB 34, places limits on data collection from license plate cameras, and requires agencies to notify the public if their data has been breached.

License plate camera data may only be shared with other public agencies within California, according to legal guidance from California Attorney General Rob Bonta published October 2023.

But some law enforcement agencies, including the Los Angeles Police Department, continued to conduct searches on behalf of ICE, Calmatters reported in June 2025.

For members of Get the Flock Out, a local anti-Flock group, the records from Capitola underscore long-running concerns about local use of license plate cameras.

Local police “may be trying to handle the data well, but we’re seeing from these public releases that actually they’re not handling the data well,” said Get the Flock Out member Ami Chen Mills. “I think this is beyond the capacity of our small communities to handle.”

Even if California police departments are prohibited from sharing data out of state, Get the Flock Out has ongoing concerns about Flock’s ability to access the data and its history of collaboration with immigration enforcement. When determining the trustworthiness of license plate camera programs, “we can’t just look at our communities and our police departments,” Chen Mills said.

Local police say the cameras help public safety. But as people are “being abducted and detained against our Constitution,” Chen Mills said, “who do we want to keep safe?”",https://santacruzlocal.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/251106flockcapJK_0001.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 17:17:20.188613

The recent ICE raids across the country and in Southwestern Pennsylvania, along with immigration enforcement agents in the city of Washington in recent weeks, have sparked fear among immigrants in the area.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Philadelphia office confirmed in an email on Friday that ICE operations have been taking place in the city of Washington.
City of Washington police and Washington County Sheriff’s office said they were not notified of ICE presence.
“Then he called Saturday to tell her he was detained by ICE,” said Karamcheti.","UPDATE: This story was updated on Nov. 8 to reflect confirmation of ICE raids.

The recent ICE raids across the country and in Southwestern Pennsylvania, along with immigration enforcement agents in the city of Washington in recent weeks, have sparked fear among immigrants in the area.

“Around last October, the fear level from 0 to 10 was at a 2. I’d say it’s now at an 8 or 9. It’s awful. People are frightened,” said the Rev. Jay Donahue, parochial vicar at St. Oscar Romero Parish in Washington. The parish includes Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal Church in Meadow Lands, where Donahue conducts a weekly Mass in Spanish for the church’s large Latino community.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Philadelphia office confirmed in an email on Friday that ICE operations have been taking place in the city of Washington.

Since Oct. 20, as many as 23 immigrants have been detained in the city of Washington and nearby communities, according to Erenia Karamcheti, director of social services at St. Oscar Romero Parish.

In one incident, three immigrants who work in construction were detained last week while stopping for breakfast at a restaurant on Jefferson Avenue.

Families of those who have been detained have turned to Karamcheti for help to locate where their loved ones are being detained, and when and if they will be given a fair hearing.

Karamcheti said a brother of one of the construction workers who was detained told her his brother, who speaks limited English, unintentionally signed a self-deportation letter and is being sent back to Guatemala.

“There’s been a very, very sharp uptick in enforcement around Pittsburgh,” said Joe Murphy, an immigration attorney with Allegheny Immigration Group. “People are being grabbed at courthouses – in one case, right in front of me – and you see people detained going to hearings, to Social Security offices and other government offices.”

ICE arrests have soared across the country since President Donald Trump’s second term began in January and the government launched a massive crackdown on immigrants.

Nationwide, ICE raids have occurred at farms, construction sites and other businesses, and near schools and other “sensitive locations” that, Murphy said, “has intentionally created an atmosphere of fear.”

Karamcheti has been using ICE’s online detainee locator system in an attempt to find where local detainees have been transported. She has tracked some to locations including Cambria County Prison and Moshannon Valley Processing Center.

City of Washington police and Washington County Sheriff’s office said they were not notified of ICE presence.

ICE operations are federal, and the agency isn’t required to notify local police of enforcement actions.

The sheriff’s office – which has a 287(g) agreement with ICE to perform some immigration enforcement duties – said its agency has received no request for assistance from ICE.

Concern over ICE activity has left families afraid to do everyday activities, said Monica Ruiz, executive director of Casa San Jose, a nonprofit support organization for Latino immigrants that has built a Rapid Response Network of trained volunteers who monitor and document ICE activity across Allegheny County and neighboring areas.

“They’re afraid to go to work, they’re afraid to send their kids to school or take them to school, and they’re scared to go to the store,” said Ruiz, noting detainments in Southwestern Pennsylvania have increased 250% since this time last year. “It has made it difficult for people to function and it obviously takes a toll on their financial stability, but it also takes a toll on their mental health.”

Karamcheti has shopped for groceries, cooked meals, and picked up prescriptions for those who prefer not to leave home, and she and others have arranged transportation for school students whose parents are afraid to drive them.

On a recent morning, Karamcheti stopped by the home of a woman whose husband, from Guatemala, has been detained at Cambria County Prison. The couple have a toddler, and she is fearful that her husband will be deported.

Earlier that week, she got a phone call from a mother whose son left for work on a Friday but didn’t show up.

“Then he called Saturday to tell her he was detained by ICE,” said Karamcheti.

Attendance at the church’s regular health, dental, and legal clinics has dropped. Donahue said 15 people had signed up to attend a health clinic operated by volunteer doctors earlier this week, but only three showed up.

Karamcheti said she had thought the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement policies would be aimed at violent criminals, and is alarmed that people without criminal records are being swept up.

“They are not taking criminals. They are taking hard-working people,” said Karamcheti. “These are good people, without any criminal record, who just want to work and take care of their families.”

Ruiz agreed.

“What’s important for people to understand is that this was supposed to be about detaining criminals, and what we’re seeing is that’s not what’s happening,” she said.

According to statistics from the Cato Institute, about 65% of those detained had no criminal convictions and 93% had no violent convictions, and most convictions among those with a record fell into minor offenses such as immigration or traffic violations.

Donahue said attendance at Mass at Miraculous Medal has remained steady, but noted it has dropped at other churches in the Diocese of Pittsburgh and other congregations serving the Latino community.

On Sunday, about 200 people filled the pews at a Mass that acknowledged Dia de los Muertos, a celebration of life that honors and remembers deceased loved ones.

“It was one of the biggest church services we’ve ever had,” said Donahue, who was delighted at the turnout and a celebration held later, where church members filled an altar with photos of deceased loved ones, marigolds, glowing candles, salt, and offerings of favorite food and drink. “Luckily, Mass attendance has not died down, but people are not showing up at events like they used to.”

The Catholic Church steadfastly defends the rights of immigrants.

In an email statement, Bishop Mark Eckman, bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, said

“As the Catholic Church teaches, every person has dignity and worth as a child of God. The Church supports the right of nations to protect their borders while also affirming the fundamental rights of migrants and refugees to safety, family unity, and the opportunity for a dignified life. Our parishes continue to accompany those in need through prayer, pastoral care, and acts of compassion.”

Donahue, who regularly writes letters to congressional representatives and senators decrying the current U.S. anti-immigration policies, has accompanied congregants to immigration court and lobbied for the release of a church member who had been detained in Moshannon for 3 1⁄2 months before he was released.

Earlier this week, Donahue served as a translator at the immigration hearing of a parishioner from Mexico who faced deportation and a re-entry ban after her visa expired. The woman, who is engaged to a U.S. citizen and is planning a 2026 wedding, won her case.

The parish also is serving as caregiver for two children whose mother was detained and deported to Mexico, he said.

At St. Oscar Romero, a parish group launched a GoFundMe this summer to raise money for rent, food and bills for families who have lost financial resources, including its immigrant church members.

Donahue worries that the human rights and dignity of immigrants are being ignored.

“What are we doing here? The key is to see that these are human faces, not bunk bed numbers,” said Donahue, referring to a church member who was detained at Moshannon and was called “Up 25” for 3 ½ months because he occupied the top bunk of bed 25 in a 38-bed unit. “It’s dehumanizing.”

Ruiz said immigrants, who pay taxes, “bring a lot of economic value to our community.”

“Think about places in Washington County where immigrants have worked on farms and in other occupations. They’re ingrained into that community. Let’s be honest, they’re not getting any free things, they’re contributing,” she said.

Ruiz, too, is dismayed by what she calls the “inhumane” treatment of documented and undocumented immigrants who are being picked up every day in Southwestern Pennsylvania.

“This is not who we are. I don’t want this to be who we are,” said Ruiz. “We have to be better than this.”",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/washington.ogdennews.com/images/sites/3/2025/11/08073437/Image-5-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 17:17:12.236907

The Department of Homeland Security says agents have arrested more than 3,000 people in Chicago since immigration enforcement actions began there in early September. Immigrants have been changing their routines because of the crackdown, sometimes missing work or school. And as Adora Namigadde and Aleja Hertzler-McCain of Religion News Service report, some people are also staying home from church.

ALEJA HERTZLER-MCCAIN: Three men sit on plastic chairs in a basement in Chicago.

ADORA NAMIGADDE: They say Mass at their parish feels like home in Guatemala, but now they're too afraid of being detained by ICE if they go to church.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Through interpreter) We decided to stay home, go to work and rest. And on Sundays, it's better to stay at home because we have these dreams.

NAMIGADDE: Dreams of making sure his daughter back home gets a good education.

HERTZLER-MCCAIN: These men agreed to be interviewed as long as we don't give their names because they fear deportation. And we agreed not to name their parish because they worry it could be targeted.

NAMIGADDE: About a year ago, the men were in a severe car accident. One family member died.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Through interpreter) When we needed it most, they helped us a lot. And many, many sisters here from this parish came to us to lift our spirits when we were in bed.

NAMIGADDE: The men tell us Mass is the one place they found community since coming to the U.S.

HERTZLER-MCCAIN: And not feeling safe enough to go weighs heavy.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Through interpreter) It hits close to your heart. Well, it feels like - it feels horrible.

HERTZLER-MCCAIN: After the accident, the parish's migration ministry helped them pay rent and living expenses until they could go back to work as roofers.

NAMIGADDE: The volunteer who helped make that happen doesn't have legal status, either. He came to the U.S. from Mexico 28 years ago.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Through interpreter) Many of us are afraid to go to work, to go to a restaurant, to go to church because everyone, everybody is afraid of encountering ICE.

BLASE CUPICH: We need to be honest, as a country, about why people are here and why they do not have documents.

NAMIGADDE: Cardinal Blase Cupich is the Archbishop of Chicago.

CUPICH: It's because we have failed, and our legislators on both sides of the aisle have failed to enact comprehensive immigration reform.

NAMIGADDE: The Department of Homeland Security tells NPR that agents use discretion when enforcing immigration law at houses of worship, and agents need approval from a supervisor before taking action in locations such as churches.

UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Singing in Spanish).

HERTZLER-MCCAIN: In September, St. Oscar Romero Catholic Parish on Chicago's South Side dedicated its three-mile jubilee pilgrimage to praying for migrants. Fr. Carmelo Mendez says Mass attendance there is down about 40%.

CARMELO MENDEZ: We give them the opportunity to come to church, but if they don't feel comfortable, I believe God understands their concerns and their fears.

NAMIGADDE: At the Mass after the event, Mendez preached that all people are equally loved by God.

MENDEZ: (Through interpreter) May God Almighty, Jesus, the immigrant, Mary of the journey inspire us to recognize that we are only passing through here. No matter where you were born, no matter when you migrated, our citizenship is not here but in the presence of the lord.

HERTZLER-MCCAIN: At a different parish in one of Chicago's northern suburbs, church attendance is down by about 25%.

NAMIGADDE: The deacon there says the surge of federal agents has made many people scared to go.

UNIDENTIFIED DEACON: We have a group of people bringing the Holy Communion to those people who are in fear for any deportation or any detention.

NAMIGADDE: He's trying to fill in the spiritual gaps by ministering to people online and in their homes. Now, there's a ministry for people to pray the rosary on Zoom, and he brings food to some parishioners several days a week.

HERTZLER-MCCAIN: The church remains on high alert.

UNIDENTIFIED DEACON: Before they start the Masses, people watch outside the parking lot, the street if they see any movement or any immigration officer. And before the Mass ended, also, they do the routine walking in the street to protect our community.

HERTZLER-MCCAIN: Despite these understandable fears, some immigrants are going to Mass anyway.

NAMIGADDE: Back at the Guatemalan men's parish in Chicago, we also spoke with a woman whose adult children have been begging her to stay home.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: (Through interpreter) I told them they weren't going to take that away from me.

NAMIGADDE: She also asked that we withhold her name.

HERTZLER-MCCAIN: She used to attend Mass every day, but now she only goes once or twice a week.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: (Through interpreter) Seeking God is the most important thing for me. They know that because they say that the church is my second home.

HERTZLER-MCCAIN: This grandmother came to Chicago 38 years ago and serves her parish with care, washing linens used at Mass.

NAMIGADDE: She wants her kids to trust that God will keep their parents safe from deportation.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: (Through interpreter) I tell them that's not going to happen. God is with us. Go to church more, seek God that you may feel more comforted by Him.

NAMIGADDE: She survived cancer and the loss of her home. She says she can't show weakness because she'll make her kids weak.

HERTZLER-MCCAIN: But sometimes she feels the weight of it all.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: (Through interpreter, crying) I have my children, and I don't see myself separated from them. No. No, I don't think I could endure that. I've endured a lot that has happened to me because I say my God has given me strength. But they don't have the strength that I have, and maybe not the faith.

HERTZLER-MCCAIN: God, she says, is her strength. For her, going to church is worth the risk. For NPR News, I'm Aleja Hertzler-McCain.

NAMIGADDE: And I'm Adora Namigadde in Chicago.

People familiar with the situation told the paper that the two intended to use the jets to expand deportation flights – and for personal travel.
Those sources also claimed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials had cautioned them that buying planes would be far more expensive than simply expanding existing flight contracts.
Meanwhile, Democrats on the House appropriations committee said in October that during this fall’s record-long government shutdown, the DHS had already acquired two Gulfstream jets for $200m.
A DHS spokesperson told the Journal that parts of its reporting about the plane purchases were inaccurate but declined to provide additional clarification.","The secretary of the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Kristi Noem, reportedly authorized the purchase of Spirit Airlines jets before discovering the airline didn’t actually own the planes – and that the aircraft lacked engines.

The bizarre anecdote was contained in a Wall Street Journal report released on Friday, which recounted how Noem and Corey Lewandowski – who managed Donald Trump’s first winning presidential campaign – had recently arranged to buy 10 Boeing 737 aircraft from Spirit Airlines. People familiar with the situation told the paper that the two intended to use the jets to expand deportation flights – and for personal travel.

Those sources also claimed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials had cautioned them that buying planes would be far more expensive than simply expanding existing flight contracts.

Complicating matters further, Spirit, which filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time, in August, did not own the jets and their engines would have had to be bought separately. The plan has since been paused, according to the Journal.

Meanwhile, Democrats on the House appropriations committee said in October that during this fall’s record-long government shutdown, the DHS had already acquired two Gulfstream jets for $200m.

“It has come to our attention that, in the midst of a government shutdown, the United States Coast Guard entered into a sole source contract with Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation to procure two new G700 luxury jets to support travel for you and the deputy secretary, at a cost to the taxpayer of $200m,” Democratic representatives Rosa DeLauro and Lauren Underwood wrote in a letter to the DHS.

A DHS spokesperson told the Journal that parts of its reporting about the plane purchases were inaccurate but declined to provide additional clarification.

Congress had previously approved Trump’s so-called “big, beautiful bill” in July, which dedicates roughly $170bn for immigration and border-related operations, a sum that makes ICE the most heavily funded law enforcement agency in the federal government.

In September, the Guardian reported that the Trump administration was moving immigrants detained as part of its deportation agenda in ways that violated their constitutionally protected rights, often by plane.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e438f496ef1aa3d27bab5fca03ba26f0d7485178/423_0_2695_2157/master/2695.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=39dd7b1bb501da9b43cab15213406191",N,,2025-11-08 14:17:03.131540

The other major operator of private jails is CoreCivic. Earlier this year Scripps News visited a CoreCivic jail in Kansas that is ramping up operations to eventually begin housing immigrants.

But the company has other detention centers already open, leading to a jump in revenue of 18% last quarter. The company's earnings have sharply increased since 2020.

With the Trump administation aiming to detain thousands more immigrants, both companies see room to bring in even more money from the deportation push.

“Perhaps the United Nations should investigate the ‘human rights crisis’ that is Chicago’s crime rate.” The White House echoed McLaughlin’s criticisms of Chicago’s crime rate in its own statement.

In February, Trump signed an executive order withdrawing the U.S. from the U.N. Human Rights Council, accusing the body of not living up to its potential.
Established in 2006, the UNHRC is a 47-member body that meets in Geneva each year to discuss human rights issues and adopt resolutions compelling governments to take action.","The mayor of Chicago on Friday invited a panel of independent United Nations experts to examine what he called the federal government’s “abusive immigration crackdowns” in the nation’s third-largest city.

Speaking before members of the U.N. Human Rights Council on Friday, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson accused President Donald Trump’s administration and federal immigration officials of violating the “dignity of all Chicagoans” with violent raids, and he asked the human rights council to hold a special session to discuss “the worsening human rights crisis in the United States.”

“I call on this council to hold the federal government of the United States to the same standards of accountability you apply elsewhere in the world,” Johnson said in the virtual address. “No country should be above international law. Human rights are universal – or they are meaningless.”

Since the Department of Homeland Security launched its “Operation Midway Blitz” enforcement operation in the Chicago area in early September, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have descended on worksites, dragged residents through neighborhood streets and used chemical irritants to disperse protesters – tactics that a federal judge said “shocks the conscience.”

On Wednesday, immigration officers arrested a teacher after chasing her onto the grounds of a private preschool. The incident appears to be one of the first instances during Trump’s second administration in which immigration officers entered and made an arrest on school grounds – once considered off limits to enforcement actions. DHS disputed that the woman was arrested inside the school, saying she was detained in a “vestibule.”

In his remarks, Johnson characterized these kinds of incidents as stemming from a “moral failure” on the part of the Trump administration.

In a statement to the Washington Post, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin blasted Johnson for “demonizing ICE and CBP law enforcement,” adding that federal officers are facing increasing assaults as they use more aggressive tactics to meet Trump’s deportation goals.

“Mayor Johnson has shown time and time again he does not care about the innocent American lives taken at the hands of gang members, murderers, drug traffickers, and rapists who have no right to be in this country,” McLaughlin said. “Perhaps the United Nations should investigate the ‘human rights crisis’ that is Chicago’s crime rate.”

The White House echoed McLaughlin’s criticisms of Chicago’s crime rate in its own statement.

The enforcement operation is part of the administration’s broader crackdown on “sanctuary cities,” which have long drawn Trump’s ire. Sanctuary city policies limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

“Operation Midway Blitz” has resulted in the arrests of 3,000 undocumented immigrants throughout Illinois and northern Indiana, according to DHS.

Johnson said the deportation campaign has had a destabilizing effect on the city, and the harms extended beyond immigrant communities.

“In Chicago’s South Shore neighborhood – a proud, predominantly Black community – federal agents carried out what can only be described as a military-style raid designed for social media spectacle,” Johnson said. After the raid, DHS published to social media a video, set to cinematic music, of the operation.

“Helicopters circled overhead. Doors were kicked in. Homes were destroyed. Immigrant residents were detained in one van, while Black families – including young children – were held in another,” Johnson added.

Authorities said that they were targeting the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Two of the 37 immigrants arrested in that raid were gang members, and dozens of U.S. citizens’ apartments were targeted.

On the city’s West Side, federal agents placed a Black man in a chokehold and forced him to the ground just steps from the doors of the legal nonprofit Westside Center for Justice, Johnson said. Earlier this week, federal agents rammed into the vehicle of Dayanne Figueroa before taking her into custody “for no apparent reason,” he added.

“These are not isolated incidents. They are reminders that the fate of our communities – Black, Brown, immigrant – is bound together,” Johnson said. “An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us. And in Chicago, we will stand united in defense of our shared dignity, safety and freedom.”

Johnson also sought to draw the U.N. body’s attention to the lapse in federal funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP or food stamps. In Chicago, roughly 1 in 5 households receive food assistance, according to official state data.

“As someone with first-hand experience, I can tell you how humiliating it is when you open the refrigerator and you have nothing to eat,” Johnson said. “In the wealthiest country in the world, there is no reason why our federal government should allow hundreds of thousands of Chicagoans to go hungry.”

Friday’s address comes after the Trump administration skipped a review of its human rights record, known as the Universal Periodic Review. In February, Trump signed an executive order withdrawing the U.S. from the U.N. Human Rights Council, accusing the body of not living up to its potential.

Established in 2006, the UNHRC is a 47-member body that meets in Geneva each year to discuss human rights issues and adopt resolutions compelling governments to take action. Members can also hold crisis meetings, known as “special sessions.”

In his remarks Friday, Johnson slammed the Trump administration for “fail[ing] to meet even the most basic expectations of transparency and accountability before this council.”

“By refusing to submit its Universal Periodic Review report and declining to appear for its review, this administration seeks to evade scrutiny for its violations of human rights – just as it has sought to evade accountability for its actions in cities like mine,” he said.",https://thumb.spokesman.com/l2sMHX5ZvY-IivJJOF8GNS33NSY=/600x0/media.spokesman.com/graphics/2020/08/sr_placeholder.png,N,,2025-11-08 22:16:50.048296

Baum",,,,,https://truthout.org/articles/rights-groups-sue-trump-admin-over-use-of-israeli-spyware-to-target-immigrants/,"Civil rights attorneys are suing the Trump administration to force the release of records detailing whether federal immigration agencies are using sophisticated Israeli spyware to track, monitor, and target immigrants and activists across the country.
Both companies have been linked to government surveillance of journalists, human rights defenders, and protesters around the world.
“Like other law enforcement agencies, ICE employs various forms of technology to investigate violations of the law, while appropriately respecting civil liberties and privacy interests,” an ICE spokesperson said in response to a request for comment.
Rights advocates fear the same tactics are now being adopted within U.S. borders and directed at already-vulnerable groups.
“Increasingly, local law enforcement agencies recognized these data could be useful for their own quotidian surveillance.”","Civil rights attorneys are suing the Trump administration to force the release of records detailing whether federal immigration agencies are using sophisticated Israeli spyware to track, monitor, and target immigrants and activists across the country.

The lawsuit, filed on Oct. 30 in federal court by Just Futures Law and the Center for Constitutional Rights, demands that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) comply with Freedom of Information Act requests related to their contracts with tech companies Cellebrite and Paragon Solutions. Both companies have been linked to government surveillance of journalists, human rights defenders, and protesters around the world.

Attorneys say immigrant rights are at urgent risk as the administration escalates arrests, detentions, and protest-related charges under President Donald Trump’s second term.

“The public has the right to know whether and to what extent the U.S. government deploys powerful spyware to infect people’s phones, extract data, and surveil people’s daily communications,” Julie Mao, an attorney at Just Futures Law, said in a press release.

“Like other law enforcement agencies, ICE employs various forms of technology to investigate violations of the law, while appropriately respecting civil liberties and privacy interests,” an ICE spokesperson said in response to a request for comment.

CBP did not respond to Prism’s request for comment.

ICE has worked with Israeli spyware company Cellebrite for more than a decade. The agency currently holds two active contracts totaling $11 million with the company, which markets phone-cracking tools that allow law enforcement to extract data from locked devices, according to the attorneys’ press release. CBP, which also holds at least 20 Cellebrite software licenses, has partnered with the firm since 2008, the press release states.

Spyware from the Israel-based Paragon Solutions, known as Graphite, is considered even more invasive. According to technical researchers, the tool can hack into smartphones, including encrypted messaging apps, without the user’s knowledge. ICE entered into a contract with Paragon in September 2024, but the Biden administration paused the agreement due to national security concerns after issuing an executive order limiting the use of spyware by federal agencies. Trump reversed that decision in August, clearing ICE to resume the contract.

Members of Congress sent a letter last month demanding answers from ICE about its use of Graphite, calling the secrecy surrounding the program “deeply alarming.”

Immigrant communities fear these tools could supercharge longstanding surveillance and criminalization. Advocates say the technologies fit into a broader landscape in which immigrants and their supporters have been increasingly treated as threats to public order. Organizers from Dallas to Los Angeles report that social media posts about protests have drawn ICE attention. Family members have had their devices searched during home raids. Community defense networks believe the government is monitoring WhatsApp chats used to coordinate court support and legal aid.

The level of intrusion remains unclear, which is precisely what the lawsuit seeks to change.

“We should not have to go to federal court to force the government to hand over these records,” Ian Head, manager of the Open Records Project at the Center for Constitutional Rights, said in the press release. “This administration wants to hide its abusive, Orwellian behavior, but we are fighting back.”

Earlier this year, the Canadian digital watchdog group Citizen Lab published a report tracing Paragon spyware deployments targeting political activists and journalists in Italy, Australia, Canada, and Denmark. Rights advocates fear the same tactics are now being adopted within U.S. borders and directed at already-vulnerable groups.

Surveillance researchers say the expansion reflects a deepening trend: Domestic policing agencies are increasingly using military-grade technology developed for foreign intelligence operations.

“In the wake of 9/11, federal agencies provided considerable funding to state and local law enforcement agencies to collect, analyze, share, and deploy a wide range of new data,” researcher Sarah Brayne told the research organization Data & Society. “Increasingly, local law enforcement agencies recognized these data could be useful for their own quotidian surveillance.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2241666688-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 15:17:44.833662

The Cook County Sheriff’s Office said at least 14 people were arrested Friday.

Witnesses said the group of moms staged a sit in outside of the designated protest zone.

They formed a circle and joined hands in the middle of the street. That’s when witnesses say police surrounded them and took them into custody.

New video shows several women being taken away by the Cook County Sheriff’s Office moments after witnesses said they were demonstrating peacefully in the middle of the street.

“Nobody was causing any damage, nobody was causing any harm, there was no traffic being impeded now these very well-meaning mothers who were here to speak up for the voices of children who can’t speak up for themselves were carried away,” said Reverend Carol Hill, who is the senior minister of Park Ridge Community Church.

Interfaith leaders gathered for a prayer service in front of the ICE processing facility shortly after the women were detained. They were joined by protesters who have been demonstrating in Broadview for weeks against the Trump administration.

“We believe that our faith is stronger than fear in any chaos that they can create so we’re here standing in solidarity letting people know we’re going to continue to fight for our people because we believe that we have the power to conquer,” said Reverend Ciera Bates Chamberlain, Live Free Illinois Executive Director.

They oppose federal agents’ use of force including deploying tear gas during Operation Midway Blitz. Some members of the Live Free Illinois group also attempted to hand a letter requesting access inside the facility.

“Our goal is continue to request and demand that people get the type of spiritual care that they need especially under these extreme circumstances while they’re under duress,” said Rev. Chamberlain.

Protesters said they want to send a message and defend the actions of the group of suburban moms who were taken into custody.

“Nothing is more important than the harm that is happening to people we have to get people’s attention to notice what’s actually going on,” said Meg Thomas-Cary, witness. “Someone sitting in the road is not doing harm, people being apprehended harmful.”

The Cook County Sheriff’s Office said the people arrested ranged in age from 23 to 59 years old.

McInerney said Joseph created that impression during her interactions with attorneys at the arraignment and by unintentionally violating a court rule when she allowed an off-the-record discussion about ICE’s plans to detain the defendant.

“I therefore recommend that she receive a reprimand,” wrote McInerney. “Moreover, because this proceeding has been public, and to ensure that there is no misunderstanding as to what Judge Joseph is — and is not — being reprimanded for, I recommend that the reprimand be public.”

In 2019, Joseph and a court officer were federally charged with obstruction of justice on allegations that they let Jose Medina-Perez, a Dominican national who has been deported twice, sneak out a back door of Newton District Courthouse after a hearing on drug and fugitive from justice charges.

At the time, the charges led to her suspension from the bench. Federal prosecutors dropped the charges in 2022 when Joseph agreed to refer herself to the state agency for an investigation of misconduct.

At the end of his report, McInerney wrote that Joseph “is a thoughtful, diligent, and conscientious judge undeserving of the harsh public criticism she has received in connection with this matter, and entirely worthy of the opportunity to finally move on from it.”",https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/BDC_Logo_2020_256x256-60d0abc34135e.png,N,,2025-11-08 15:17:52.305449

The sides argued over whether protests at the city’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building met the conditions set out by Congress for using the military domestically. A higher appellate court order under which the National Guard is federalized but not deployed remains in effect. Legal experts say that order would have barred troops from being deployed anyway.

PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — A federal judge in Oregon ruled Friday that President Donald Trump’s administration failed to meet the legal requirements for deploying the National Guard to Portland after the city and state sued in September to block the deployment.

The ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, followed a three-day trial last week in which both sides argued over whether protests at the city’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building met the conditions for using the military domestically under federal law.

The administration said the troops were needed to protect federal personnel and property in a city that Trump described as “war ravaged” with “fires all over the place.”

In a 106-page opinion, Immergut found that even though the president is entitled to “great deference” in his decision on whether to call up the Guard, he did not have a legal basis for doing so because he did not establish that there was a rebellion or danger of rebellion, or that he was unable to enforce the law with regular forces.

“The trial record showed that although protests outside the Portland ICE building occurred nightly between June and October 2025, ever since a few particularly disruptive days in mid-June, protests have remained peaceful with only isolated and sporadic instances of violence,"" Immergut wrote. “The occasional interference to federal officers has been minimal, and there is no evidence that these small-scale protests have significantly impeded the execution of any immigration laws.”

The Trump administration criticized the judge's ruling.

“The facts haven’t changed. Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets. President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities and we expect to be vindicated by a higher court,” said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman.

“The courts are holding this administration accountable to the truth and the rule of law,” Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in an e-mailed statement. ""From the beginning, this case has been about making sure that facts, not political whims, guide how the law is applied. Today’s decision protects that principle.”

Democratic cities fight back

Democratic cities targeted by Trump for military involvement — including Chicago, which has filed a separate lawsuit on the issue — have been pushing back. They argue the president has not satisfied the legal threshold for deploying troops and that doing so would violate states’ sovereignty.

Immergut issued two orders in early October that had blocked the deployment of the troops leading up to the trial. The first order blocked Trump from deploying 200 members of the Oregon National Guard; the second, issued a day later, blocked him from deploying members of any state's National Guard to Oregon, after he tried to evade the first order by sending California troops instead.

Immergut has called Trump's apocalyptic descriptions of Portland “simply untethered to the facts.”

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has already ordered that the troops not be deployed pending further action by the appeals court. The trial Immergut held further developed the factual record in the case, which could serve as the basis for further appellate rulings.

Demonstrations at ICE building peaked in June

Witnesses including local police and federal officials were questioned about the law enforcement response to the nightly protests at the city’s ICE building. The demonstrations peaked in June, when Portland police declared one a riot. The demonstrations typically drew a couple dozen people in the weeks leading up to Trump’s National Guard announcement.

The Trump administration said it has had to shuffle federal agents from elsewhere around the country to respond to the Portland protests, which it has characterized as a “rebellion” or “danger of rebellion.”

Federal officials working in the region testified about staffing shortages and requests for more personnel that have yet to be fulfilled. Among them was an official with the Federal Protective Service, the agency within the Department of Homeland Security that provides security at federal buildings, whom the judge allowed to be sworn in as a witness under his initials, R.C., because of safety concerns.

R.C., who said he would be one of the most knowledgeable people in DHS about security at Portland’s ICE building, testified that a troop deployment would alleviate the strain on staff. When cross-examined, however, he said he did not request troops and that he was not consulted on the matter by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem or Trump. He also said he was “surprised” to learn about the deployment and that he did not agree with statements about Portland burning down.

Attorneys for Portland and Oregon said city police have been able to respond to the protests. After the police department declared a riot on June 14, it changed its strategy to direct officers to intervene when person and property crime occurs, and crowd numbers have largely diminished since the end of that month, police officials testified.

The ICE building closed for three weeks over the summer because of property damage, according to court documents and testimony. The regional field office director for ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, Cammilla Wamsley, said her employees worked from another building during that period. The plaintiffs argued that was evidence that they were able to continue their work functions.

No protection from deportation Migrant rights organizations denounce that expulsions are being carried out without granting detainees due process.","Donald Trump is not satisfied with the results of the immigration crackdown he launched as soon as he moved into the White House after winning the election a year ago. The raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) “haven’t gone far enough,” he said in a recent interview on CBS’s 60 Minutes, where he defended ICE agents’ aggressive tactics, which have sparked protests across the country. The Trump administration claims to have deported more than 400,000 people since taking office — a high number, but still short of the one million deportations the Republican had promised, and harder to achieve than he expected.

Trump had already made it clear on the campaign trail: if he won, he would carry out the largest deportation effort in history. In his first 100 days, the Republican approved 175 immigration-related measures. Most of those actions were aimed at increasing deportations, but they also shut down borders and weakened asylum and refugee programs. The government has turned documented residents into undocumented ones, expelled workers who had committed no crime, separated families, and even detained U.S. citizens.

“He has been far more aggressive than anyone expected, more brutal,” says Matt Barreto, a professor of political science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). “He has acted with virtually no regard for the law, violating people’s rights and receiving almost weekly warnings from the courts, including from judges he himself appointed, that his actions are illegal.”

Many of his actions are being challenged in the courts, and after his first 10 months in office, it is almost impossible to keep track of all the rulings issued by district judges and appellate courts. Some of those cases have reached the Supreme Court, which — with its conservative majority — has upheld several of Trump’s initiatives, such as allowing the use of racial profiling (whether based on appearance or place of work) to justify an arrest.

The president’s determination to achieve deportations on a historic scale has led him to allocate an enormous sum — $170 billion — for immigration enforcement as part of his “big, beautiful” tax reform, approved in July. The funds will go toward expanding the raids that have multiplied across the country, as well as increasing detention capacity through the construction of new immigration centers.

“One of the biggest changes under the Trump administration has been the shift of immigration enforcement into the interior of the United States,” notes Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute (MPI). ”Under the previous administration, the primary goal was to reduce the number of arrivals at the border.”

As early as January, Trump shut down entry points, and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) recorded just 279 daily apprehensions in September — a 95% drop compared to the daily average during Joe Biden’s presidency, according to official data. By deploying immigration agents inland, Trump has effectively opened the door to a full-scale hunt for migrants.

During the previous administration, the priority was detaining undocumented immigrants who had committed crimes. Trump also vowed to focus on deporting criminals — “the worst of the worst” — but in practice, being undocumented has become synonymous with being a criminal. Only 35% of those detained by ICE have criminal records, compared to 65% in October 2024.

The numbers may not satisfy the president, but they are at record highs. When Trump returned to the White House in January 2025, there were 39,000 detainees in ICE custody. By the end of August, that number had risen to 61,000 and could reach 107,000 by January 2026, according to MPI data. The September average — the most recent month available — stood at 1,178 arrests per day, still below the 3,000 daily target set by Stephen Miller, the White House architect of immigration policy.

The surge in ICE raids has spread fear throughout migrant communities, which have seen once-sensitive locations — churches, schools, and hospitals — lose their protected status. Videos showing agents arresting parents as they drop their children off at school have gone viral, sparking panic among students.

One of the most heavily targeted places is immigration courts. Officials take advantage of migrants’ scheduled check-ins — meant to comply with government requirements — to detain them, turning what should be a routine appointment into a trap.

Targeting Democratic cities

Cities governed by Democrats have been the target of the largest anti-immigration operations. Trump has sent National Guard troops to reinforce what he claims is a crime crisis caused by undocumented immigrants in Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Memphis.

In Chicago, citizens staged a mass protests against Operation Midway Blitz, an aggressive ICE operation in which Blackhawk helicopters were used for arrests. Federal agents fired pepper bullets and tear gas at demonstrators who had gathered outside the Broadview detention center, in a predominantly Black and Latino suburb, to protest the treatment of detainees.

In detention centers like Broadview, children, pregnant women, abuse victims, and migrants with no criminal record are crammed together. Detainees and the organizations that defend them denounce unsanitary conditions, malnutrition, and the lack of access to medicine and medical care. Many sleep on the floor, with barely any warm clothing, under bright lights that remain on through the night, making rest impossible. They are also denied communication with their lawyers or families, according to the complaints.

The poor conditions in which detainees are held have been cited as a possible reason why, during fiscal year 2025, 23 people have died in ICE custody — the highest number in 20 years. Several family members reported that the deceased had no known illnesses at the time of their arrest.

ICE detention centers can no longer keep up with the number of detainees, leading to the reopening of closed prisons and the construction of new ones — such as the controversial Alligator Alcatraz facility in Florida, which faces lawsuits for holding inmates in inhumane conditions and for having been built without environmental studies in a protected wetland area. Despite the criticism, the administration plans to create more such centers, allocating $45 billion for the effort.

The lack of space to handle the surge in arrests has led the government to turn to the two largest private prison companies, CoreCivic and GEO Group — both major donors to Trump’s presidential campaign — to manage facilities for housing detainees.

Detention is now the standard prelude to deportation. Once detained, migrants are increasingly unlikely to be released. The percentage of people freed on bail, parole, or supervision fell from 26% in October 2024 to just 3% in September 2025, according to MPI data. In fact, 90% of those detained by ICE in September 2025 were deported directly from detention centers, compared with 63% a year earlier.

No protection from deportation

Migrant rights organizations denounce that expulsions are being carried out without granting detainees due process. Back in March, Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1889 to deport more than 200 migrants to El Salvador without trial, accusing them of belonging to the Latin American criminal gangs Tren de Aragua and MS-13.

No evidence was ever presented, and many of those deported — who were imprisoned in the notorious Terrorist Confinement Center (CECOT) — had no criminal record. Some, such as the now well-known Kilmar Abrego García, a Salvadoran who is fighting a legal battle against the government and has become a symbol of unjust deportations, even had court orders protecting them from removal.

“This has become a matter of democracy. [Trump] is using his immigration policies to undermine democracy in the United States, defying court orders and ignoring laws passed by Congress,” argues Barreto.

What’s more, to broaden the spectrum of those who can be deported, the government has eliminated legislation granting legal permanent resident status and work permits to millions of people. Among other actions, it has canceled programs like humanitarian parole and Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which were created to shelter citizens fleeing their countries due to armed conflicts, natural disasters, poverty, and political crises. Hundreds of thousands of Nicaraguans, Haitians, Cubans, and Venezuelans have suddenly lost protection from deportation.

For those who cannot be returned to their home countries because the latter refuse to accept them, the administration — with the Supreme Court’s approval — is sending them to third countries such as Rwanda, South Sudan, and Eswatini, where human rights are not respected and governments offer no guarantees about the fate of deportees.

The aggressiveness of the immigration policy that has marked Trump’s first 10 months in office has completely transformed the lives of millions of migrants, as well as those of U.S. citizens. “The Trump administration’s immigration enforcement policy is affecting the rights of Americans, as we’ve seen with the detentions, but it has also changed their way of life: now they carry identification documents for fear of being arrested or detained,” says Bush-Joseph. “That wasn’t what people expected.”",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/TMCJW77JO5OHNK5HEPVHGFNOS4.jpg?auth=72a687105204b0e44111856f9c61c2ea7176491ae7959a1fb77120c25f0bad27&width=1200,N,,2025-11-08 11:01:26.915347

https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/08/arts/design/as-trump-recasts-history-a-civil-rights-museum-sticks-to-a-messy-past.html

Workers at the newly reimagined National Center for Civil and Human Rights were busy on a recent afternoon assembling an exhibit that begins with a rush of progress: The Civil War has ended and slavery is abolished. Black candidates are elected to public office. Institutions of higher learning, like Morehouse College and Atlanta University, are established to serve Black students. The Greenwood District of Tulsa, Okla., emerges as a hub of prosperity known as Black Wall Street.

Then, the exhibit abruptly shifts.

Greenwood is shown ravaged by fire and bloodshed in an outbreak of racial violence. Across the South, white leaders orchestrate a web of laws that enforce segregation, block access to the polls and keep would-be Black politicians out of positions of power for generations.

“It’s the story of Black progress and white backlash,” said Kama Pierce, the chief program officer and curator of the exhibit at the center in Atlanta, which is reopening on Saturday after a $58 million overhaul and expansion. “We feel like we’re still in this cycle in this country.”

It is not lost on the center’s leaders that a museum devoted to the push and pull of the country’s fitful civil rights history is reopening at a moment when President Trump has used the force of the federal government to dismantle diversity programs and promote a sunnier version of America’s story.

For several years there had been widespread pressure for cultural institutions to wrestle with the enduring reach of racism after the murder of George Floyd. The pendulum has now swung in the other direction.

This year the president issued an executive order assailing a “revisionist movement” that “deepens societal divides and fosters a sense of national shame.” His administration has sought to scrub the Smithsonian Institution of “divisive or ideologically driven language” and replace it with “unifying” descriptions. The leader of the National Portrait Gallery stepped down after the president attacked her public comments about racial and gender inequality.

The work of preserving and amplifying civil rights history in the Deep South has always been fraught. But museum officials and civic leaders in Atlanta said providing an unvarnished depiction of the movement required a renewed level of perseverance in the current climate.

“We learn from our history — some of it we celebrate, some of it we grieve over,” said Shirley Franklin, a former mayor of Atlanta and longtime champion of the center, which first opened in 2014. “The stories always needed to be told,” she said, adding that now “the challenge of telling these stories might be greater, but institutions like the center have an opportunity to fill the gap.”

The museum’s curators said their intention was to neither sensationalize nor sanitize history, but to still have it resonate in a visceral way. To achieve that, they have relied heavily on documentary evidence including photographs and video, statements from participants in important events, and contemporaneous accounts from journalists.

Among the changes is an update to one of the museum’s most popular, and most emotionally taxing, exhibits: a simulation of a sit-in protest at a diner. Visitors perch themselves on stools, put on headphones and place their hands on the counter while listening to taunting and threatening voices.

Now visitors are introduced to the intensive training that demonstrators went through, instilling the need to stick together and remain unflappable. Built-in tissue dispensers were also added, in recognition of how many people walk away shaken and tearful — often before the one-minute, 25-second recording ends.

The museum also created a larger space dedicated to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., whose papers the museum has exclusive rights to display. King’s daughter Bernice curated the first of the rotating exhibits. It includes some handwritten correspondence and is focused on lessons on civil disobedience and her father’s broader activism on improving economic opportunity and working conditions and challenging the Vietnam War.

Museum leaders said they refrained from too much interpretation in the exhibits to encourage visitors to draw their own conclusions.

“We don’t exaggerate the sins any more than we exaggerate the triumphs,” said Jill Savitt, the center’s chief executive.

“We’re not putting our thumb on the scale,” she added. “But we’re telling you what the rights are. We’re telling you where in the world people have felt those rights weren’t being respected, and how they mobilized around it.”

The funding for the renovation came largely from private sources, including the foundations of wealthy patrons and large corporations, as well as from the city of Atlanta. With the new offerings, including vastly expanded event space, the center is seeking new revenue streams to insulate it from a harsher landscape.

It does not directly rely on federal support, yet it has still felt the squeeze as the Trump administration slashed funding for arts and humanities. As nonprofits scramble to replace money from lost grants, there is more competition for financial help from independent foundations.

Some have argued that Atlanta’s history, as King’s home base and a nucleus for the civil rights movement, demands it maintain a certain steadfastness, even if it comes at a cost. Mayor Andre Dickens has continued with diversity, equity and inclusion programs despite a federal imperative to disavow them.

Choices such as those have been cast as an extension of an unwritten compact reached generations ago by Atlanta’s political, business and religious leaders to prioritize the pursuit of shared prosperity over racial divisions.

The “Atlanta Way,” as it is known, has been an imperfect bargain. It did not entirely spare the city from deep imbalances rooted in racism and could be deployed as a shiny veneer to paper over entrenched problems. Still, it is widely credited as fueling Atlanta’s success as a capital of commerce and culture.

The National Center for Civil and Human Rights is a manifestation of that mind-set.

The museum shares a parking deck with the World of Coca-Cola and the Georgia Aquarium, two of the city’s most popular attractions. It was built on land donated by the Coca-Cola Company, and other major corporations and philanthropies in Atlanta have been consistent backers, including the family foundation of Arthur M. Blank, the billionaire co-founder of Home Depot.

The center was also designed to join a cluster of offerings that have made Atlanta a destination for soaking up civil rights history, including the national park encompassing King’s birthplace and the old sanctuary of Ebenezer Baptist Church, where he was pastor.

“We see ourselves as a beacon for those kinds of values,” said Fay Twersky, the president of the Blank Family Foundation.

Museum leaders wanted the exhibits to make clear that their themes are not distant history, but also part of the present.

The center’s mandate covers the broader umbrella of human rights, including disability rights, L.G.B.T.Q. issues and the work to ensure access to basic human needs, like food and water. More attention has been paid to women and gay people, namely the pioneering activists Dorothy Height and Bayard Rustin.

Curators have also dedicated more space to Black empowerment. A modern take on a jukebox was installed to play songs reflecting that collective pride, like James Brown’s “Say It Loud — I’m Black and I’m Proud.”

An elaborate interactive section is being added for children, who had been unserved by past iterations. A secret passage behind a bookcase leads them to a lair for “change agents,” where they learn about the influence of young people in activist movements.

Much of the history the museum covers is despairing, but its leaders want it to be threaded with hope. After all, unsteady progress is still progress. One display has small cards highlighting ways for visitors to become more civically involved, like volunteering with groups helping refugees or supporting local news organizations.

For those unhappy with how things are, the museum has a message: Be engaged, but also be patient. Something different will emerge soon enough.

“No matter where you stand, it’s reform and resistance,” Savitt said.

“You can believe the reforms are positive reforms or negative, but we’re telling a story about that forward march and push back,” she added. “That’s the story of America.”

ICE has a mobile facial recognition app known as Mobile Fortify that uses images of people's faces and fingerprints to try to identify people in the field.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is acquiring powerful new surveillance tools to identify and monitor people.

They include apps that let federal agents point a cell phone at someone's face to potentially identify them and determine their immigration status in the field, and another that can scan irises. Newly licensed software can give ""access to vast amounts of location-based data,"" according to an archive of the website of the company that developed it, and ICE recently revived a previously frozen contract with a company that makes spyware that can hack into cell phones.

The federal agency is also ramping up its social media surveillance, with new AI-driven software contracts, and is considering hiring 24/7 teams of contractors assigned to scouring various databases and platforms like Facebook and TikTok and creating dossiers on users.

The Trump administration is seeking to employ new technology as it tries to boost deportations to a million a year, a target that could be helped with tech to identify and locate noncitizens subject to removal.

Some Democratic members of Congress are raising legal concerns about the new technologies and are asking questions of ICE that are going unanswered. A group of U.S. senators have called on ICE to stop using a mobile facial recognition app.

""Americans have a right to walk through public spaces without being surveilled,"" Democratic Sen. Edward Markey of Mass. told NPR.

Privacy and civil liberties advocates also warn these surveillance tools represent a grave threat and say there is not a sufficient regulatory framework in place or oversight to ensure federal agents are using new technologies in a way that protects privacy and constitutional rights.

""Immigration powers are being used to justify mass surveillance of everybody,"" said Emily Tucker, the executive director of the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law.

""The purpose of this is to build up a massive surveillance apparatus that can be used for whatever kind of policing the people in power decide that they want to undertake,"" she said.

Scanning Teens' Faces

The way ICE and Border Patrol agents use these technologies was on display in a video posted to TikTok last month by an account in Aurora, Ill. The video appears to show a group of masked Border Patrol agents as they jump out of an SUV and approach two young people on bikes on the sidewalk near East Aurora High School. The agents ask them their citizenship and to show ID.

One of the young men, who is filming the incident and does not appear on camera, says he is 16 and is a U.S. citizen but does not have an ID.

""Can you do facial?"" an officer is heard asking. Another officer then takes out a cell phone and points it as if taking a photo. He then asks the young person's name and the video ends shortly after that.

The person who posted the video did not respond to a message but said in comments on the post that the video was of their cousins. NPR was able to verify the location where the video was shot.

It is not clear which app the officer used. ICE has a mobile facial recognition app known as Mobile Fortify that uses images of people's faces and fingerprints to try to identify people in the field. A Department of Homeland Security document says the app searches for matches against Customs and Border Protection databases, including photos taken when people enter and exit the U.S., and can return information like a subject's name, birth date, alien number, possible citizenship status and ""Possible Overstay Status.""

In another section of the document, it says ICE will receive ""limited biographic data"" if the individual matches a photo from a specific list of targets, called the ""Fortify the Border Hotlist,"" and non-matches ""will not return any additional information.""

It also says individuals cannot decline to be photographed, and that photos are stored for 15 years, even if there is no match.

The existence of the app and documentation on how it works were both first reported by 404 Media, which obtained the DHS document through a Freedom of Information Act request.

This week, the outlet also reported that Customs and Border Protection made a different facial recognition app, Mobile Identify, available on Google's app store for state and local law enforcement agencies that are deputized to work with ICE.

David Bier, director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, called it a ""big leap"" that DHS now can have agents in the field simply point their phone at someone's face and instantly learn details about them.

""The whole idea of anonymity in public, it's really gone when the administration or the government can immediately identify who you are,"" Bier said, adding that this technology could have a chilling effect on people's willingness to attend public protests.

A group of Democratic senators, led by Markey, called on ICE in September to stop using the technology and answer questions about its use. ICE did not respond to their questions and the senators renewed their demand on Monday.

""This type of on-demand surveillance is harrowing and it should put all of us on guard,"" Markey told NPR. ""It chills speech and erodes privacy. It ultimately undermines our democracy.""

In their letter, the senators ask a long list of questions, including the legal basis to use the app, how it was developed, whether U.S. citizens are included in the database of photos the app matches to, whether there are policies for using it to identify U.S. citizens and if it has been used to identify protesters and minors.

Markey told NPR facial recognition is unreliable, especially for people of color, and expressed concern the Trump administration would ""weaponize that technology against anyone who disagrees with the government.""

Neither ICE or DHS responded to NPR's specific questions about mobile facial recognition apps.

An ICE spokesperson said in a statement, ""Nothing new here. For years law enforcement across the nation has leveraged technological innovation to fight crime. ICE is no different. Employing various forms of technology in support of investigations and law enforcement activities aids in the arrest of criminal gang members, child sex offenders, murderers, drug dealers, identity thieves and more, all while respecting civil liberties and privacy interests.""

DHS sent a statement that said, ""While the Department does not discuss specific vendors or operational tools, any technology used by DHS Components must comply with the requirements and oversight framework.""

The growing use of facial recognition technology comes as DHS published a proposed rule that would expand the agency's ability to ask for biometric data from noncitizens and their U.S. citizen relatives when they apply to adjust their immigration status, such as to obtain a green card or citizenship. Under the rule, the agency could ask for facial images, iris scans, finger and palm prints, voice prints and even DNA.

The public has an opportunity to comment on the rule until early January.

Spyware delivered by text

In August, the Trump administration revived a previously paused contract with Paragon Solutions, an Israeli-founded company that makes spyware. A Paragon tool called Graphite was used in Europe earlier this year to target journalists and civil society members, according to The Citizen Lab, a research group based at the University of Toronto with expertise in spyware.

Little is known about how ICE is using Paragon Solutions technology and legal groups recently sued DHS for records about it and tools made by the company Cellebrite. ICE did not respond to NPR's questions about its Paragon Solutions contract and whether it is for Graphite or another tool.

Graphite can start monitoring a phone — including encrypted messages — just by sending a message to the number. The user doesn't have to click on a link or a message.

""It has essentially complete access to your phone,"" said Jeramie Scott, senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), a legal and policy group focused on privacy. ""It's an extremely dangerous surveillance tech that really goes against our Fourth Amendment protections.""

Adding to an already robust surveillance infrastructure

DHS has been steadily expanding its surveillance capabilities under both Republican and Democratic administrations since its founding in the wake of 9/11.

As of 2022, a report by Georgetown Law's Center on Privacy and Technology found ICE could locate three out of four U.S. adults through utility records and had scanned a third of adult Americans' driver's license photos.

But Georgetown's Tucker, who co-authored the report, said the situation is more dramatic now because of the Trump administration's aggressive posture on immigration enforcement and willingness to push legal boundaries.

""Even if there weren't robust laws and regulations for rights protection, there were some norms that were seen as not really transgressible basically by all the presidential administrations up until that point,"" Tucker said of the situation a few years ago. ""Not only are the norms gone, but this administration is willing to break whatever laws do exist.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5000x2813+0+100/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F99%2F76%2F264d263d4bd29d1878dd78156f44%2Fgettyimages-2224533016-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 11:01:08.703368

Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets.
President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities and we expect to be vindicated by a higher court,” said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman.
They argue the president has not satisfied the legal threshold for deploying troops and that doing so would violate states’ sovereignty.
Immergut issued two orders in early October that had blocked the deployment of the troops leading up to the trial.","PORTLAND, Ore. — A federal judge in Oregon ruled Friday that President Donald Trump’s administration failed to meet the legal requirements for deploying the National Guard to Portland after the city and state sued in September to block the deployment.

The ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, followed a three-day trial last week in which both sides argued over whether protests at the city’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building met the conditions for using the military domestically under federal law.

The administration said the troops were needed to protect federal personnel and property in a city that Trump described as “war ravaged” with “fires all over the place.”

In a 106-page opinion, Immergut found that even though the president is entitled to “great deference” in his decision on whether to call up the Guard, he did not have a legal basis for doing so because he did not establish that there was a rebellion or danger of rebellion, or that he was unable to enforce the law with regular forces.

“The trial record showed that although protests outside the Portland ICE building occurred nightly between June and October 2025, ever since a few particularly disruptive days in mid-June, protests have remained peaceful with only isolated and sporadic instances of violence,"" Immergut wrote. “The occasional interference to federal officers has been minimal, and there is no evidence that these small-scale protests have significantly impeded the execution of any immigration laws.”

The Trump administration criticized the judge's ruling.

“The facts haven’t changed. Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets. President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities and we expect to be vindicated by a higher court,” said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman.

“The courts are holding this administration accountable to the truth and the rule of law,” Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in an e-mailed statement. ""From the beginning, this case has been about making sure that facts, not political whims, guide how the law is applied. Today’s decision protects that principle.”

Democratic cities fight back

Democratic cities targeted by Trump for military involvement — including Chicago, which has filed a separate lawsuit on the issue — have been pushing back. They argue the president has not satisfied the legal threshold for deploying troops and that doing so would violate states’ sovereignty.

Immergut issued two orders in early October that had blocked the deployment of the troops leading up to the trial. The first order blocked Trump from deploying 200 members of the Oregon National Guard; the second, issued a day later, blocked him from deploying members of any state's National Guard to Oregon, after he tried to evade the first order by sending California troops instead.

Immergut has called Trump's apocalyptic descriptions of Portland “simply untethered to the facts.”

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has already ordered that the troops not be deployed pending further action by the appeals court. The trial Immergut held further developed the factual record in the case, which could serve as the basis for further appellate rulings.

Demonstrations at ICE building peaked in June

Witnesses including local police and federal officials were questioned about the law enforcement response to the nightly protests at the city’s ICE building. The demonstrations peaked in June, when Portland police declared one a riot. The demonstrations typically drew a couple dozen people in the weeks leading up to Trump’s National Guard announcement.

The Trump administration said it has had to shuffle federal agents from elsewhere around the country to respond to the Portland protests, which it has characterized as a “rebellion” or “danger of rebellion.”

Federal officials working in the region testified about staffing shortages and requests for more personnel that have yet to be fulfilled. Among them was an official with the Federal Protective Service, the agency within the Department of Homeland Security that provides security at federal buildings, whom the judge allowed to be sworn in as a witness under his initials, R.C., because of safety concerns.

R.C., who said he would be one of the most knowledgeable people in DHS about security at Portland’s ICE building, testified that a troop deployment would alleviate the strain on staff. When cross-examined, however, he said he did not request troops and that he was not consulted on the matter by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem or Trump. He also said he was “surprised” to learn about the deployment and that he did not agree with statements about Portland burning down.

Attorneys for Portland and Oregon said city police have been able to respond to the protests. After the police department declared a riot on June 14, it changed its strategy to direct officers to intervene when person and property crime occurs, and crowd numbers have largely diminished since the end of that month, police officials testified.

The ICE building closed for three weeks over the summer because of property damage, according to court documents and testimony. The regional field office director for ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, Cammilla Wamsley, said her employees worked from another building during that period. The plaintiffs argued that was evidence that they were able to continue their work functions.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/Portland_AP_25312059757662_NAT_1108,N,,2025-11-08 09:56:31.877186

“I think Marylanders recognize that their attorney general ought to, and we are in fact, stepping up to defend the interests of the state.
“Suing the Trump administration over and over again is a total waste of Maryland taxpayer money,” Arikan said Oct. 23.
He cited the “Just Security” website, a litigation tracker of legal challenges to the Trump administration, maintained by the Reiss Center on Law and Security at New York University School of Law.
As of Friday, Just Security was tracking 515 cases pending against the administration.. “It’s clear the Trump administration is pushing on the borders of the existing understandings of constitutionalism.","When Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) walked to the podium Thursday to announce a lawsuit against the Trump administration’s plans to keep the new FBI headquarters out of Maryland, he might have had a sense of déjà vu.

Since President Donald Trump (R returned to office on Jan. 20, Brown has walked up to a lot of podiums to announce a lot of legal actions against the administration.

In less than 10 months, Brown’s office has filed or joined other Democrat-led states, in 43 lawsuits against administration actions and has filed or joined in about 70 legal briefs in support of lawsuits by others challenging administration policies — including one on Friday, when Maryland joined 25 states challenging an administration plan to cut food assistance during the government shutdow..

That’s more in less than a year than the 95 lawsuits that former Attorney General Brian Frosh (D) led or joined during fur years of the first Trump term, from 2017 to 2021.

“It’s voluminous. There’s no doubt about that,” Brown said during an interview last month in his Baltimore office.

“I committed to Marylanders I would only bring actions that I think directly impact their rights, their privileges, their benefits, their well-being, and that I would protect the sovereignty of Maryland when challenged by the administration,” he said.

Apparently, he sees a lot of those challenges.

The lawsuits started coming the day after Trump’s inauguration, when Maryland joined New Jersey and 16 other states to block Trump’s executive order ending birthright citizenship. The latest was an Oct. 1 lawsuit challenging a policy that would have denied victim assistance funds to anyone who cannot prove their citizenship status.

Maryland sues Trump administration for ‘illegal’ action to keep FBI headquarters in D.C.

They have continued in between, sometimes at a pace of several per week, with lawsuits that challenge the White House’s efforts to rescind previously approved money for schools, to share personal health care informaton with the Department of Homeland Security and to deploy National Guard troops in Illinois.

Maryland has been a supporting player in many of the actions, but he led in others, including lawsuits to restore funding for the AmeriCorps program and to block the mass layoffs of probationary federal workers, and a brief in support of other groups seeking to protect transgender rights.

Brown stresses that his office is not “attacking the president. We’re challenging the actions that he takes.” For instance, he pointed to a suit in May against the U.S. Department of Transportation and Secretary Sean Duffy who wanted to withhold funds from states that don’t comply with White House immigration policy.

“When the president says that he’s going to attach conditions to transportation funding that could jeopardize important projects like the Key Bridge, like the completion of the Purple Line … he’s tying conditions entirely unrelated to transportation, but pursuing his own agenda,” Brown said. “I think Marylanders recognize that their attorney general ought to, and we are in fact, stepping up to defend the interests of the state.

“I invite anyone to come and point out to me something that this [a legal action] is nothing more than a political attack. I think you’d be hard pressed to find one.”

Not everyone agrees.

Del. Lauren Arikan (R-Harford) said the actions of the attorney general’s office against the Trump administration are “politically motivated more than policy motivated.”

“We’ve dumped a lot of extra money into the AG’s office for all kinds of things. And what is the taxpayer seeing for it?” she asked. “We’re getting higher taxes. Housing crisis, an energy crisis. We’re not seeing the fruits of our taxpayer dollars being used efficiently,.

“Suing the Trump administration over and over again is a total waste of Maryland taxpayer money,” Arikan said Oct. 23.

‘Constitutional revolution’

Mark Graber, a constitutional law professor at the University of Maryland’s Francis King Carey Law School in Baltimore, said the lawsuits are political in the sense that only Democratic attorneys general are suing the Trump administration. On the other hand, Graber said those prosecutors are opposing certain actions by the administration.

Graber said some decisions in lower federal courts have favored the Democratic prosecutors in cases heard by judges appointed by Republican presidents. Some federal judges “are supporting these lawsuits in the sense that they’re finding the lawsuits are valid, have solid grounds,” he said.

He said the U.S. Supreme Court has been much more supportive of the president so far. “It’s rather interesting that the Supreme Court appears to be more partisan than the lower federal courts,” Graber said.

He cited the “Just Security” website, a litigation tracker of legal challenges to the Trump administration, maintained by the Reiss Center on Law and Security at New York University School of Law. As of Friday, Just Security was tracking 515 cases pending against the administration..

“It’s clear the Trump administration is pushing on the borders of the existing understandings of constitutionalism. It is attempting a constitutional revolution every bit as revolutionary as the revolution that led to the New Deal and the post-Civil War amendments,” Graber said. “It simply has a very different understanding of the Constitution than has existed previously.”

When asked what can be done to ensure the constitution is adhered to, Graber summarized three actions: file lawsuits, hold peaceful protests “in the streets” and “most importantly, when the time comes, vote.”

‘Political publication’

Not all of the opposition to federal policy has come in the form of a lawsuit or a brief. The attorney general’s office, for example, released a guidance memo Oct. 15 to remind Maryland law enforcement agencies that they must adhere to state law when working with federal authorities.

The guidance was required in legislation approved on the last day of the 2025 General Assembly session dealing with immigration enforcement. Part of the law requires the attorney general to “develop and publish guidance that informs the public and relevant state agencies” about immigration enforcement.

The 11-page document lists what local police “must do, may do and must not do” in a range of interactions with federal authorities, from simple backup to formal joint task force agreements. More specifically, it states Maryland officers “may not enforce civil immigration laws or assist federal agents in enforcing such laws.”

Maryland leads multistate brief calling Trump deployment of Guard ‘unlawful’

The memo highlights the 287(g) agreements that some Maryland sheriff’s department have made with Immigration and Customs Enforcement that let the local law enforcement officials take on certain immigration enforcement abilities. In Maryland, those agreements are largely restricted to the jail-based model of the agreement, where jails can execute administrative immigration warrants on people already in their custody.

But the guidance from the attorney general’s office cautions that “prohibitions on participating in civil immigration enforcement apply even when Maryland officers are operating under an agreement with federal authorities, including an agreement with ICE under Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.”

Del. J. Sandy Bartlett (D-Anne Arundel), vice chair of the House Judiciary Committee, said the guidance was “well written” and “well researched,” and will not only benefit law enforcement agencies, but the immigrant community as well.

“I think that is exactly why we [General Assembly] asked for such guidance,” she said. “I’m very glad that the attorney general has been so explicit in explaining to us, or to the officers, and giving them the guidance that they need.”

But Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler, whose department has participated in a 287(g) agreement since 2016, called the attorney general’s guidance “more of a political publication tied to the national immigration debate than a practical law enforcement directive.”

“My concern is that it could be misinterpreted in a way that discourages law enforcement from sending aid to federal partners during real criminal emergencies, such as the assaults on federal officers and other acts of violence we have witnessed across the United States,” Gahelr said in a statement last month. “I hope that was not the intent, because the Harford County Sheriff’s Office will always respond when a crime is being committed or when anyone, to include local, state, or federal law enforcement, is under attack while doing their job.”

Brown said the guidance is nothing more than what it claims to be: A guide to help law enforcement agencies and to remind them of what the restrictions are, even with 287(g) programs.

“If you’re undocumented and you are a violent offender, you should be held accountable. And if that accountability means removal from this country, then that’s what it means,” he said. “What I don’t think is prudent with limited law enforcement resources available to any agency is to begin focusing on the enforcement of immigration law.”

On the question of politics vs. policy in the actions the attorney general chooses to take, Sen. Chris West (R-Baltimore County and Carroll), agrees with Arikan that at times it does “seem like a broken record, just day after day” suing the Trump administration.

But West, an attorney, said last month the Democratic attorneys general are not the only ones who play that game. He would like to see attorneys general, both Democratic and Republican, focus more on their constituents and less on the politics.

“Are they really spending their time and the money and the resources at their disposal effectively to represent their constituents? Or are they engaging in efforts which will benefit them politically, but won’t have much real impact on the people of their states?” he asked. “My feeling is what’s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. My message to both groups is stop it.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-101/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/anthony-brown-10-22-2025-1024x8711762608051.jpg?h=b0975d13&itok=DQUJ9Nlj,N,,2025-11-08 09:17:24.331259

Marimar Martinez, who is charged with assaulting a federal officer, was treated at a hospital for gunshot wounds after the confrontation last month.

In a Signal chat, agent Charles Exum shared with other agents a news story that quoted Christopher Parente, Martinez’s lawyer, as saying she “has seven holes in her body from five shots from this agent, who fired within seconds of getting out of this vehicle.”

“I fired 5 rounds, and she had 7 holes. Put that in your book boys,” Exum wrote in his Signal message, which was shared during a court hearing this week.

“Read it. 5 shots, 7 holes,” Exum wrote.

In a text to his brother about the shooting, the agent wrote, “Sweet. My 15 minutes of fame. Lmao.”

In another text a day after the shooting, Exum wrote, “Cool. I’m for another round of f--- around and find out. Lmao.”

Questioned on the witness stand by Parente about the tone of his messages, Exum citied his background as a firearms instructor.

“I take pride in my shooting skills,” he said.

Martinez and her co-defendant, Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz, have pleaded not guilty to identical charges and are challenging evidence in the case.

The Department of Homeland Security claimed Exum was acting in self-defense when he shot Martinez, a U.S. citizen, on the morning of Oct. 4. An agency statement posted shortly afterward said Border Patrol agents on the scene were “rammed by vehicles and boxed in by 10 cars.”

Parente has said body cam footage shows the agent initiated the contact between his vehicle and Martinez’s.

An updated DHS statement referred to Martinez and Santos as “domestic terrorists.” They have not been charged with terrorism.

The agency’s statement further described Martinez as having been armed during the altercation. A prosecutor informed the judge that she had a concealed carry permit for a pistol that was in her purse but that she did not brandish it. Martinez is not facing firearms charges.

Sen. Chris Murphy decried the DHS narrative as “propaganda” on social media, saying the agency’s version of events doesn’t align with the evidence.

Parente questioned Exum about why he had repairs done on his government vehicle instead of preserving it as evidence, as was done with Martinez’s car. A federal prosecutor acknowledged to U.S. District Judge Georgia Alexakis that a Border Patrol mechanic removed scuff marks and made other repairs to Exum’s Chevy Tahoe.

A trial for Martinez and Santos is set for February.

Let him keep doubling down on his madness, and Latinos will continue to flip on ustedes like a tortilla.
Trump’s 2024 victory was the culmination of an extraordinary shift in the Latino electorate that few saw coming — but I did.
If he did the former, Latinos would have been largely supportive of the latter, as long as deportations focused on newcomers.
I grabbed one as a memento of my time here and also as a reminder of what’s happening with Latinos right now.","When I turned on my phone after landing at O’Hare Airport on Wednesday, texts poured in from friends and colleagues warning that I was about to enter a region under siege.

Many sent a video from that morning of immigration agents running into a day care facility in Chicago’s Roscoe Village neighborhood to pull out a teacher. It was the latest attack against the metropolis by President Trump’s deportation Leviathan, whose so-called Operation Midway Blitz this fall has made its earlier occupation of Los Angeles look like a play date.

Armed agents have sauntered through downtown and manned a flotilla of boats on the Chicago River. They shot and killed a fleeing immigrant and raided an apartment building with the help of a Black Hawk helicopter. In nearby Broadview, home to the region’s main ICE detention facility, rooftop migra shot pepper balls at protesters below, including a pastor. They even tear-gassed a neighborhood that was about to host a Halloween children’s parade, for chrissakes.

From Back of the Yards to Cicero, Brighton Park to Evanston, immigration agents have sown terror throughout Chicagoland with such glee that a federal judge declared that it “shocks the conscience” and issued an injunction limiting their use of force — which they no doubt will ignore.

I was in town to speak to students at the University of Chicago about the importance of reporting on things one may not like. Heaven knows that’s been my 2025. But as I waited to deplane, I checked my email and found something I’ve sorely needed this year:

Hope.

On Tuesday, Democrats won governor’s races in New Jersey and Virginia by wide margins. Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani was elected mayor of New York, telling Trump to “Turn. The. Volume. Up” during a soaring victory speech.

Back home in California, 64% of voters favored Proposition 50, the ballot initiative crafted by Gov. Gavin Newsom to create up to five Democratic-leaning congressional districts in response to Trump’s gerrymandering in Texas.

It was a humiliating rebuke of Trumpism. And the tip of the Democratic spear? Latinos.

In New Jersey, where Trump received 46% of the Latino vote in 2024, a CNN exit poll showed just 31% of Latinos siding with the losing GOP candidate for governor. Nearly two-thirds of Latinos in Virginia went against Cuban American Atty. General Jason Miyares, a Republican who also lost. The CNN poll also found that more than 70% of California Latinos voted for Proposition 50, a year after GOP Latino legislators made historic gains in Sacramento.

At the same time, support for Trump has dropped among Latinos. Only 25% of Latinos surveyed in October by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research viewed Trump favorably — a cratering from the 45% who liked him in April. Even more telling, two-thirds of Latino men thought negatively of Trump — despite 51% of that demographic choosing him in 2024.

Latinos’ leftward shift on election night already set off as many thought pieces as Trump did when he captured 48% of the Latino vote — the most a Republican presidential candidate has earned, despite his long history of slurring, maligning and insulting America’s largest minority. Democrats, who have long depended on Latino voters, were shocked, and GOP leaders were delighted, feeling that a demographic that had long eluded them was finally, truly within reach.

This week Latinos sent a loud message: You had your chance, y nada.

House Speaker Mike Johnson tried to play off his party’s collapse among Latinos to NBC News, sniffling, “I do believe that the demographic shift that we were able to see and experience in the 2024 election will hold.”

Mike: time to bring the Republican Party out of its Stockholm syndrome. Your guy has blown it with Latinos. Let him keep doubling down on his madness, and Latinos will continue to flip on ustedes like a tortilla.

Trump’s 2024 victory was the culmination of an extraordinary shift in the Latino electorate that few saw coming — but I did. As I’ve written ad nauseam since 2016, Latinos were beginning to favor the GOP on issues like limited government, immigration restrictions and transgender athletes in high school sports because Democrats were taking them for granted, obsessing over woke shibboleths while neglecting blue-collar issues like gas prices and high taxes.

All this was was happening as the Biden administration made it easier for newly arrived undocumented immigrants to remain, angering those who have been here for decades without similar help. The long-standing tendency for Latinos to sympathize with the latest Latin Americans to cross over eroded, and some became more receptive to Trump’s apocalyptic words against open borders.

Last year 63% of Latinos in California considered undocumented immigrants to be a “burden,” according to a poll by UC Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies and co-sponsored by The Times.

That happened to be the same percentage of California voters who favored Prop. 187, the infamous 1994 initiative that sought to make life miserable for undocumented immigrants and showed the GOP that xenophobic politics can work.

After the 2024 election, Latinos seemed to be joining earlier Catholic immigrants who were once cast as invaders — Irish, Italians, Poles, Germans — on the road to assimilation and the waiting arms of the Republican party. All Trump had to do was improve the economy and clamp down on the border. If he did the former, Latinos would have been largely supportive of the latter, as long as deportations focused on newcomers.

Instead, Trump wasted his opportunity.

The economy remains stagnant. Trump effectively declared war on Latin America with tariffs real and threatened and by bombing Venezuelan and Colombian boats suspected of carrying drugs without asking permission from Congress.

Trump officials keep issuing punitive policies that crush the dreams of Latinos, like a crackdown on English fluency in the trucking industry and ending federal grants that helped colleges and universities recruit and retain Latino students.

But Trump’s biggest mistake has been his indiscriminate deportation raids. His toxic alphabet soup of immigration enforcement agencies — HSI, ERO, CPB, ICE — largely has ignored the so-called “worst of the worst” in favor of tamale ladies, fruteros and longtime residents. Nearly three-quarters of immigrants in ICE detention as of September have no criminal convictions, according to Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.

Trump’s deportation deluge has rained down across the country as his administration repeatedly has exhibited white supremacist tendencies, from effectively blocking all new refugees except South African Boers to pumping out social media garbage extolling a mythical America where white makes right and Latinos exist only as blurry mug shots of alleged illegal immigrants.

No wonder 65% of Latinos feel it’s a “bad time” to be Latino in the U.S. — a 25-percentage-point drop in optimism from March of last year, according to an Axios-Ipsos poll done with Telemundo and released this week.

Trump even is losing credibility among Latino Republicans, with a September 2024 AP-NORC poll finding that 83% of them had a “very” or “somewhat” positive view of the president last year.

Now? Sixty-six percent.

Trump very well can win back some of those Latinos in 2026 if the economy improves. But every time his migra goons tackle innocents, another Latino will turn on him and get ready to fight back.

At the University of Chicago, orange whistles hung around a bronze bust just outside the room where I spoke. They’ve become a symbol of resistance to Trump’s invasion of the City of Strong Shoulders, blown by activists to alert everyone that la migra is on the prowl.

I grabbed one as a memento of my time here and also as a reminder of what’s happening with Latinos right now. Nationwide, we’re warning everyone from the front lines — the streets, the ballot box, the courtroom, everywhere — about the excesses of Trump and warning him what happens if he doesn’t listen.

The platform outlines a series of reforms the group says are necessary to protect civil rights and prevent further harm to vulnerable communities.

The ACLU of New York reports that the Trump administration has “mused about taking over New York” and increasing federal policing, ICE activity, and surveillance, placing immigrant communities at heightened risk. According to the platform, ICE has already used Manhattan’s immigration courts as “the epicenter” of arrests, while federal officials attempt to undermine the city’s sanctuary laws through lawsuits and political pressure.

Advocates argue the next mayor must “defend and strengthen” New York’s sanctuary commitments, as detailed in the platform. Recommendations include passing the New York City Trust Act to allow residents to seek court relief if city agencies violate sanctuary rules, removing carveouts that allow the NYPD and Department of Correction to honor ICE detainers, and expanding legal services such as the New York Immigrant Family Unity Project.

The platform also critiques the NYPD’s renewed use of broken windows policing, citing “racial bias” and an increase in stop-and-frisk, low-level arrests, and misconduct complaints. It was suggested that units like the Neighborhood Safety Teams and Community Response Teams should be disbanded because they are “the worst offenders” in abusive tactics. Advocates also note that immigrant delivery cyclists face criminal penalties for traffic infractions that drivers only receive civil fines for, a disparity the platform attributes to harmful enforcement priorities.

Regarding protest rights, the ACLU states the NYPD has a “history of violently responding to protests” and urges the mayor to implement safeguards outlined in the Payne settlement. Recommendations include ending kettling, limiting drones, curtailing chemical and acoustic weapons, and eliminating the Strategic Response Group, according to the platform.

On surveillance, the report warns the federal government is expanding “invasive, unregulated” technology to monitor immigrants and marginalized communities. The platform calls on the next mayor to regulate facial recognition, license plate readers, and police drones, and to increase transparency around city algorithms so New Yorkers “know when AI tools are making decisions impacting their lives.”

Additionally, the crisis at Rikers Island, which the jail’s conditions call a “humanitarian disaster,” was noted as deaths continue “month after month.” According to the report, the jail population rose above 7,000 due to excessive bail, criminalization of mental illness, and delays transferring people to state prisons. Advocates asked Mamdani to expand early release programs, coordinate with state corrections to accelerate transfers, and commit to closing Rikers as required by city law.

The ACLU also demands the elimination of solitary confinement, withdrawal of any plans to allow ICE to operate on Rikers, and restoration of gender-affirming housing for transgender and nonbinary people. According to the report, the mayor must “protect the rights of every person detained in New York jails.”

In education, the report warns that LGBTQ and immigrant students face increased federal hostility. The platform calls on the mayor to strengthen NYC Public Schools’ protections against ICE access, require all school personnel to receive training on protections for vulnerable students, and reinvest funding from school policing into counselors, nurses, and extracurricular programs. According to the platform, heavy reliance on metal detectors and harsh discipline contributes to the school-to-prison pipeline.

Finally, the platform highlights threats to reproductive and gender justice, urging the mayor to increase investment in abortion access, expand gender-affirming care, and ensure all city agencies offer an X gender marker on identity documents.

The ACLU of New York concludes that the next mayor must “steer New York toward a stronger democracy” by resisting federal crackdowns and protecting the rights of immigrants, incarcerated people, students, and other impacted groups.

WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court on Friday refused to lift a judge’s order requiring U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration to fully fund this month’s food aid benefits for 42 million low-income Americans during the ongoing U.S. government shutdown.

The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals delivered its ruling hours after the U.S. Department of Agriculture informed states it would be making funds available to fully fund Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits, as ordered in a Thursday ruling by a Rhode Island judge.

USDA sent the memo to states even as the U.S. Department of Justice urged the federal appeals court to block the judge’s order that USDA by Friday use $4 billion set aside for other purposes to ensure Americans receive full rather than reduced SNAP benefits in November.

SNAP benefits lapsed at the start of November for the first time in the program’s 60-year history. Recipients have turned to already strained food pantries and made sacrifices like foregoing medications to stretch tight budgets.

SNAP benefits are paid monthly to eligible Americans whose income is less than 130% of the federal poverty line. The maximum monthly benefit for the 2026 fiscal year is $298 for a one-person household and $546 for a two-person household.

States Begin to Issue Aid

Several states including New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts announced after the USDA issued its memo that they had directed state agencies to issue full federal SNAP benefits for November.

“President Trump should never have put the American people in this position,” Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey, a Democrat, said in a statement.”

The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston on Friday afternoon had not yet ruled on the administration’s appeal, despite a request by the Justice Department for it to do so by 4 p.m. EST.

McConnell and another judge had ruled last week that the administration must at least tap $5.25 billion in emergency funding to partially fund SNAP benefits, which cost $8.5 billion to $9 billion per month.

On Saturday, McConnell said the USDA could either use agency contingency funding once it resolved the “administrative and clerical burdens” of paying reduced benefits, or tap additional funding to fully pay out November’s SNAP benefits.

The USDA opted on Monday to use only contingency funding, which after subtracting $600 million for states’ administrative costs would leave $4.65 billion to cover benefits.

On Thursday, McConnell agreed with a coalition of cities and nonprofits represented by the liberal legal group Democracy Forward that the USDA failed to consider it could take weeks or months for some states to change their systems to process reduced benefits, prolonging delays.

The judge, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, accused the Trump administration of withholding SNAP benefits for “political reasons.”

The plaintiffs said in a Friday brief that the administration showed disregard for the harm that would befall nearly one in eight Americans if the 1st Circuit agreed to halt McConnell’s decision and allow anything short of full benefit payments to proceed.

“The Court should deny Defendants’ motion and not allow them to further delay getting vital food assistance to individuals and families who need it now,” the lawyers wrote.

FIRST ON FOX: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said that more than 200,000 Americans have applied to be U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents as the agency continues its hiring campaign.

The surge in applications comes despite a substantial 8000% increase in death threats toward the agents, as first reported by Fox News.

""ICE has received more than 200,000 applications from patriotic Americans who want to defend the homeland by removing the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens from the U.S.,"" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""Americans are answering their country's call to serve and help remove murderers, pedophiles, rapists, terrorists, and gang members from our country.""

In August, Noem cited a more than 1000% increase in assaults on immigration law enforcement officers — an uptick she noted came amid anti-ICE protests across the country and Democratic rhetoric surrounding ICE's mission.

ICE APPLICANTS SAY THEY WANT TO JOIN TRUMP'S DEPORTATION CAMPAIGN TO DELIVER 'JUSTICE' IN US

Agents have been busy around the country seeking out illegal migrants who have committed crimes in the U.S. and abroad, recently taking to the streets of New York City to make arrests on the city’s infamous Canal Street partially known for selling counterfeit luxury and designer products.

New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani sent a message to ICE agents during a speech in Queens the morning after his election victory.

""My message to ICE agents and to everyone across this city is that everyone will be held to the same standard of the law,"" Mamdani told the crowd. ""And there is, sadly, a sense that is growing across this country that certain people are allowed to violate that law, whether they be the president or whether they be the agents themselves.""

OVER 100K AMERICANS RUSH TO JOIN TRUMP'S MASSIVE ICE HIRING SPREE NATIONWIDE, DHS SAYS

New York’s newly-elected mayor isn’t the only Democrat to criticize the administration's deportation efforts. In late October, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said that agents were intentionally targeting ""Brown and Black"" individuals.

""They are literally targeting people who are Brown and Black, whether you are undocumented or not,"" Pritzker told reporters in River City, Ill. ""They’re indiscriminately grabbing people who don’t look like the ICE agents typically and holding them or mistreating them.""

Despite the criticism, agents have carried out mostly successful arrests of illegal migrants, many of whom have committed serious crimes, as part of President Donald Trump’s pledge to deport the estimated millions of individuals who crossed the border illegally under President Joe Biden.

DHS and Secretary Noem’s hiring blitz utilized social media platforms to promote the open positions, implementing a strategy of traditional American imagery to garner interest in the role.

The agency’s various social media outlets even outpaced viewership and impressions from media giants CNN and MSNBC over the summer, as first reported by Fox News Digital.

“Americans plagued by high costs fired a political torpedo this week at Donald Trump and Republicans,”Schumer, said on Thursday.
Trump appeared to acknowledge that dynamic, telling senators from his party on Wednesday that the shutdown was “negative for Republicans”.","Republicans rejected a proposal made on Friday by the Senate’s Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, which would end the longest government shutdown in US history by offering Republicans a deal to reauthorize funding in exchange for a one-year extension of tax credits that lower costs for Affordable Care Act (ACA) health plans.

“Democrats are ready to clear the way to quickly pass a government funding bill that includes healthcare affordability,” Schumer said on the Senate floor. “Leader Thune just needs to add a clean, one-year extension of the ACA tax credits to the CR so that we can immediately address rising healthcare costs.”

He also proposed “a bipartisan committee that will continue negotiations after the government reopens on reforms ahead of next year’s enrollment period to provide long-term certainty that healthcare costs will be more affordable”.

“Now, the ball is in Republicans’ court. We need Republicans to just say yes,” Schumer said.

John Thune, the Senate majority leader, was unmoved by the offer, with his spokesperson Ryan Wrasse reiterating the demand that the government be reopened before the tax credit issue will be discussed.

“Extending the Covid bonuses *is* the negotiation – something that can only take place after the government reopens. Release the hostage. End the pain,” Wrasse said.

Senate Republicans were more blunt on X: “Hard no, Chuck.”

Thune has moved to keep the Senate in session this weekend, though a deal to end the shutdown remains elusive.

Any compromise would also need to be approved by the House of Representatives, which Republican speaker Mike Johnson has kept on recess since 19 September. That means the 38-day shutdown would not end immediately.

Democrats made the offer as Americans faced unprecedented disruptions blamed by Donald Trump on the funding lapse, which began on 1 October.

The Trump administration has attempted to pause payments under the government’s food aid program for the first time in history, but has been blocked by a court order. The Federal Aviation Administration also slashed commercial air travel, saying weeks of unpaid work by controllers had undermined capacity. About 800 US-linked flights had been canceled as of Friday morning, according to the tracking website FlightAware.

Though Republicans control both chambers of Congress, any spending legislation needs at least some bipartisan support to clear the 60-vote threshold for advancement in the Senate. The Senate majority leader, John Thune, has tried 14 times to get Democrats to support a House-approved bill to continue funding through 21 November, butonly three minority lawmakers voted for it.

Democrats had for weeks insisted that any funding bill include an extension of the tax credits, which were created during Joe Biden’s presidency and will expire at the end of the year. People on ACA plans are expected to soon see their costs jump by an average of 26%, the Kaiser Family Foundation found.

Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told reporters at the White House that he expected the shutdown to cut GDP growth by approximately half in the current quarter, though much of that will be made up in the following quarter, assuming the shutdown ends and federal workers receive backpay.

Trump has publicly mulled not giving federal workers, many of whom his administration has maligned, pay for the time the government was shut down.

Later on Friday, Senate Democrats blocked a procedural motion to advance a Republican bill that sought to pay some of the federal workers who had stayed on the job without pay during the shutdown and active-duty troops. The 53-43 tally, which was mostly along party lines, fell well below the 60 vote threshold needed for passage.

Democrats said they were concerned the legislation would allow Trump to selectively choose which federal workers received pay.

Democrats’ resolve to hold strong against the Republican funding proposal was boosted on Tuesday when the party’s candidates swept off-year elections in a number of states, which party leaders attributed to voters being on board with their demands.

“Americans plagued by high costs fired a political torpedo this week at Donald Trump and Republicans,”Schumer, said on Thursday.

“If Republicans were smart, they would get the message after Tuesday that their do-nothing strategy isn’t working. Even Donald Trump knows Americans hold Republicans responsible for this mess.”

Recent polls have shown the GOP taking more of the blame for the shutdown than Democrats, and some in the party have warned that backing down from their demands now would turn off newly reenergized voters.

“I think there will be some pretty substantial damage done to a Democratic brand that has been rehabilitated, if, on the heels of an election in which the people told us to keep fighting, we immediately stop fighting, if we surrender without having gotten anything,” the Democratic senator Chris Murphy told Punchbowl News.

Trump appeared to acknowledge that dynamic, telling senators from his party on Wednesday that the shutdown was “negative for Republicans”.

He has called for them to vote for scrapping the Senate’s filibuster, which allows the minority party to hold up most legislation that does not receive 60 votes. “If Republicans kill the Filibuster, they sail to Victory for many years to come. If they don’t, DISASTER waiting to happen!” Trump wrote on Truth Social Friday.

Thune has said his lawmakers do not support doing that.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22d92e4fb72d1f8761e45b2e32d4c2492c338ac9/0_0_3334_2667/master/3334.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fccf9aabb9969cd781bf4616edddd775",N,,2025-11-08 09:56:35.360912

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is speeding up the implementation of new rules that would give the agency tasked with protecting federal government facilities greater authority to charge people for a broader array of offenses on or off those properties.

The changes outlining the powers of the Federal Protective Service, an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, were put forward in early January under the Biden administration and were slated to take effect on Jan. 1 of next year but instead went into effect Wednesday. The administration said the rules were being changed ahead of time so they could address a “recent surge in violence.”

They come as protests have surged against President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda, especially near buildings associated with immigration enforcement, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement offices or facilities. They also come as the Trump administration is facing lawsuits in both Chicago and Portland against what critics say is the excessive use of force by federal officers against protesters and others or unjustified attempts to bring in federal forces to protect facilities.

Activists and many political leaders have accused Homeland Security of aggressively suppressing peaceful protests and targeting activists trying to hold them accountable. Critics said the new rules could be used to target protesters.

“DHS is using every tool possible to protect the lives of our law enforcement as they face a surge in violence and lawlessness at many of our federal facilities,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a news release announcing the sped-up schedule. The release cited a shooting at a Dallas ICE facility, an incident that killed two detainees.

The new rules empower officers from the Federal Protective Service to make arrests and charge people for actions near the federal property, and they include new rules regulating unauthorized use of drones and tampering with digital networks.

The Homeland Security news release gave some examples of conduct that the Federal Protective Service could now charge someone for, both on federal property and off, including wearing a mask while committing a crime, obstructing access to federal property and tampering with government IT systems like card readers.

Spencer Reynolds, a former intelligence and counterintelligence lawyer at the Department of Homeland Security who’s now with the Brennan Center for Justice, a think tank, said Congress gave the Federal Protective Service the ability to work and carry out arrests off of federal property as necessary. But he’s concerned that the new regulations codifying these powers will be used as a way to target protesters.

“I see this as being guidance to go after peaceful protests where they are happening in the vicinity or even not in the vicinity of federal property,” he said.

In a report last year issued by the Brennan Center, Reynolds said the FPS expanded dramatically after Sept. 11 and that’s led to “overreach under political pressure.”

In Chicago, a federal judge overseeing a case alleging federal agents carrying out an immigration crackdown there are using excessive force against journalists and protesters said Thursday that she’s going to restrict federal agents’ use of force to prevent the “chilling of First Amendment rights.” U.S. District Court Judge Sara Ellis said she didn’t feel federal agents’ use of force was justified and that she didn’t find their “version of events credible.”

In Portland, the Trump administration has argued that protests at the city’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building have gotten so out of control that it justifies sending in National Guard troops to protect federal personnel and property where protests are occurring or likely to occur.

U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut Sunday barred the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, until at least Friday, saying she “found no credible evidence” that protests in the city grew out of control before the president federalized the troops earlier this fall.

The Federal Protective Service is tasked with protecting federal properties. The agency used to fall under the U.S. General Services Administration, which is responsible for purchasing and managing federal real estate, but when the Department of Homeland Security was created in the aftermath of Sept. 11, the FPS was transferred to Homeland Security.",https://firstamendmentwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-07T155438Z_639551886_RC2RRHA8V9YP_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-IMMIGRATION-CHICAGO.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 12:57:37.485361

There was affordability, the 34-year-old democratic socialist said in his first news conference since winning the election the night before. Then there was what he called “an authoritarian administration” under President Donald Trump.

""It'll be my job to deliver on both,"" Mamdani said. ""It will be my job to stand up for the city.""

Trump, a Queens native, has loomed over the election in his hometown, and he has threatened to punish New York with measures such as cutting the city's funds if voters elected Mamdani, a state assemblyman from Queens. If Mamdani became mayor, Trump recently said it would be hard for him to give ""a lot of money"" to New York, adding Mamdani would waste the money with his left-leaning politics.

Mamdani has vowed to fight back in court when he takes office in January.

Here’s a rundown of what Trump could do to the nation’s largest city, and what Mamdani can do in response to − as his campaign platform promised − “Trump-proof” New York.

Deploy National Guard

In contrast to some of the other largest cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, New York has been untouched by the Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard. Trump could try deploying troops to city streets.

Gov. Kathy Hochul, a moderate Democrat, has had National Guard at subway stations to reduce transit crime, but has reportedly been preparing to push back on Trump deploying troops into the city.

Lame-duck Mayor Eric Adams forged a bond with Trump after the Justice Department dropped federal corruption charges against Adams so he could help with Trump’s immigration crackdown.

In contrast, Mamdani has discussed forming a coalition with state officials, including Trump’s nemesis, New York Attorney General Letitia James, to sue the federal government if troops get sent. He’s cited the success by LA Mayor Karen Bass and Gov. Gavin Newsom in lawsuits that blocked Trump's National Guard deployment in California.

Large-scale immigration raids

Other Democratic cities such as Chicago, LA and Boston have seen sweeping immigration raids on streets, construction sites and businesses.

New York had highly publicized immigration enforcement operations shortly after Trump's return to office, but has not had the same scale of enforcement. There was a recent chaotic immigration raid by federal agents on street vendors allegedly selling counterfeit merchandise in lower Manhattan.

Federal agents have targeted people attending immigration court or Immigration and Customs Enforcement check-ins at a Manhattan federal building. The federal actions have sometimes resulted in violence against migrants, including one woman thrown to the ground by an agent.

Mamdani said he’d hold federal agents carrying out Trump’s immigration enforcement to the same legal standard as anyone else, implying that ICE agents could be arrested for assaulting New Yorkers.

“If you violate the law, you must be held accountable,” he said. “And there is sadly a sense that is growing across this country that certain people are allowed to violate that law, whether they be the president or whether they be the agents themselves.”

Mamdani has vowed to make New York the nation’s strongest sanctuary city, which broadly means limiting local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

Mamdani has also called to invest $165 million to fund immigration legal defense services. He’s said his administration would survey every city system to protect sensitive data of undocumented people and others.

Behind the scenes, state officials and business leaders are reportedly trying to prevent raids. San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie in October successfully persuaded the Trump administration not to conduct enforcement in the California city.

Cut federal funds to NYC

Early in Trump’s second term, Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency revoked $80 million in Federal Emergency Management Agency funds. Adams’ City Hall has sued the administration for the funding.

Months later, the federal Department of Transportation said it was halting funds to the nation’s largest infrastructure project, which would bolster the busiest U.S. rail corridor underneath the Hudson River between New Jersey and Manhattan, as well as the Second Avenue Subway, also in Manhattan. Withholding about $18 billion, federal officials cited the New York City’s Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program, an equity initiative meant to expand participation by racial minorities in federally assisted contracts.

Trump has threatened to slash even more federal funds to the city if Mamdani was elected. In a Nov. 3 Truth Social post, Trump said, ""it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required, to my beloved first home.""

Like other Democratic cities and states that have faced cuts to federal benefits, Mamdani has said the city could mount legal challenges to the cuts to recoup lost funds. Some cities and states have seen some success, such as Fresno, California, and North Carolina.

Arrest America’s mayor

Even before Mamdani won the mayoralty, Trump suggested arresting Mamdani and stripping him of his citizenship if Mamdani didn't assist on federal immigration enforcement. Mamdani, born in Uganda, moved to the United States as a child and was raised in Manhattan’s Morningside Heights. He became a naturalized citizen in 2018.

Some right-wing members of Trump's party have called to review Mamdani’s citizenship process in an effort to denaturalize and deport him. Trump has threatened to arrest Democratic elected officials before.

After Mamdani won the election on Nov. 4, he spoke directly to Trump.

""New York will remain a city of immigrants, a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants, and as of tonight, led by an immigrant,"" he said. ""So, hear me, President Trump, when I say this: To get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us.""

Mamdani's line drew perhaps the loudest roar throughout the night.","https://www.southbendtribune.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/03/USAT/87065195007-mamdani-trump.jpg?crop=3577,2012,x0,y335&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-08 17:56:30.935248

Earlier this week, ICE announced that a two-day operation in Oklahoma that yielded 70 arrests, including 34 truck drivers. According to ICE, 26 of the truck drivers had been improperly issued CDLs while the other eight were operating a commercial motor vehicle without a license.

The latest raid was conducted Oct. 28-29 in Oklahoma. In late September, Oklahoma partnered with ICE to arrest about 125 illegal immigrants.

“For the second time in just the past month, the state of Oklahoma and ICE have banded together to bolster public safety along Oklahoma’s highways, identifying and apprehending illegal aliens who are in the country illegally and have been recklessly issued a commercial driver’s license by states like California, Illinois, and New Jersey,” ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Executive Associate Director Marcos Charles said. “Many of the illegal aliens arrested behind the wheel of an 80,000-pound tractor-trailer can’t even read basic English, endangering everyone they encounter on the roads.”

According to ICE, those arrested originated from 15 different countries, including China, Colombia, Georgia, Guatemala, India, Kyrgyzstan, Mexico, Turkey, Uzbekistan and Venezuela. Additionally, ICE said 36 of the 70 arrested have been convicted of violent crimes and other criminal offenses, including assault and battery, soliciting prostitution and driving under the influence.

“Operation Guardian continues to successfully keep Oklahomans safe,” Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt said. “To lawfully operate a commercial motor vehicle in Oklahoma, you must be here legally, and you must be able to understand English. These are common sense standards that we will continue to enforce.”

ICE also cooperated with Indiana in October to arrest 223 illegal aliens. According to DHS, those arrests included 146 truck drivers.

DOT issues emergency interim final rule

The raids come at a time when the Department of Transportation is cracking down on the issuance of non-domiciled CDLs.

On Sept. 26, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration was issuing an emergency interim final rule to prevent unqualified drivers from operating 80,000-pound trucks on the nation’s highways.

“The process for issuing these licenses is absolutely 100% broken,” he said. “It has become a threat to public safety, and it is a national emergency that requires action right now.”",https://landline.media/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11-07-25-Oklahoma-ICE-pic.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 12:02:42.859739

“From the discrimination and violence inflicted in the ICE raids, to the attacks on free speech of protesters and journalists, to the deployment of the National Guard in American cities when no crisis exists, the world is watching the United States government attacking the constitutional and human rights of its own people,” said Chandra Bhatnagar, executive director of the ACLU of Southern California, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

In a virtual appearance before the panel’s members meeting in Switzerland, Johnson invited U.N. experts to come to Chicago to witness firsthand abuses committed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents during raids he said have wreaked havoc in neighborhoods across the city and suburbs.

“That is why I call on this council to hold the federal government of the United States to the same standards of accountability you apply elsewhere in the world,” Johnson said, urging the group to consider holding a special session on the matter. “Human rights are universal — or they are meaningless.”

Earlier this week, Johnson condemned ICE agents for going inside a North Center preschool and “tearing a teacher out of a classroom in front of” toddlers.

The mayor said video of the incident “shocked the conscience of every single Chicagoan,” adding, “This is not who we are. We … cannot have this in our city or our country.”

Johnson vowed to hold U.S. Border Patrol Commander-at-Large Gregory Bovino “accountable for the crimes you have committed against our people.”

During his speech, Johnson accused the Trump administration of seeking to “evade scrutiny for its violations of human rights, just as it has sought to evade accountability for its actions in cities like mine” by refusing to either submit to the U.N. Human Rights Council a Universal Periodic Review Report or appear before the panel.

“This refusal to engage in good faith with international mechanisms for accountability and oversight is a moral failure,” the mayor said. “In Chicago, we live with that moral failure every day. Families torn apart by immigration raids. Raids that have targeted daycare teachers, ride-share drivers and restaurant cooks.”

Johnson went on to describe in detail an immigration enforcement campaign in Chicago that he said has been “marked by violence” and is an “assault on the dignity of all Chicagoans.”

This news should be far more heartening than it is. In any normal version of the United States, it might have been. The administration’s willingness to perpetrate immoral and illegal evil on a daily basis has outpaced efforts by citizens and the judicial branch to stem the tide.

Still, maybe this is hopeful? I mean, if mandatory detention of people suspected of immigration violations is this obviously (and almost unanimously) illegal, doesn’t that mean it eventually has to end?

More than 100 federal judges have now ruled at least 200 times that the Trump administration’s effort to systematically detain immigrants facing possible deportation appeared to violate their rights or was just flatly illegal, according to a POLITICO review.

The rulings come from judges appointed by every president since Ronald Reagan, including 12 appointed by President Donald Trump. One of those appointees took the bench just last month.

Any ruling against Trump and his policies receives the same response: “activist” judges are ruining America and probably love crime. That some of these “activist” judges were appointed by Trump tends to go ignored by the loudmouths engaged in PR work for the nation’s leading producer of unlawful bullshit.

And that’s the case here as well.

“President Trump and Secretary Noem are now enforcing this law as it was actually written to keep America safe,” said Tricia McLaughlin, who predicted appellate courts would side with the administration.

The Justice Department echoed DHS, saying “President Trump’s immigration enforcement agenda is a top national security priority that this Department of Justice will continue to vigorously defend whenever challenged in court.”

But mandatory detention of migrants isn’t something that’s ever been considered legal, much less normal. People accused of criminal acts (rather than the civil violations most immigration offenses are) are generally able to avail themselves of their due process rights, as well as being able to return home until their cases are presented to the court.

That’s not what’s happening to migrants under Trump. Nearly everyone picked up by ICE, CBP, or any number of federal officers now expected to concentrate on civil violations rather than actual crime gets sent to a detention center, reversing three decades of immigration enforcement practice that allowed migrants without prior criminal records or who had longstanding ties to this country to remain free until their cases were called. It’s even worse than that now: ICE is using the same policy revision to deny detained migrants access to legal assistance or to ask judges to release them on bond.

This stems from the administration’s willful misreading of prior policies and previous case law. It applies the term “applicants for admission” (who can be detained until cases are heard) to any migrant its roving goon squads come across, even if they’ve already been in this nation for years and/or are already engaged in asylum requests or nationalization efforts. That’s why the DHS and DOJ are dismissing pending immigration violation hearings: to convert those seeking to remain in this country into indefinite detainees… and then into deportees to whatever country the US government feels like sending them to.

Sure, there’s still an argument to be made (albeit in extremely bad faith) that “liberal” judges are going after Trump just because they don’t like Trump. 87 of these judges were appointed by Joe Biden, Barack Obama, or Bill Clinton. But 27 judges appointed by GOP presidents have reached the same conclusions, including 12 appointed by Trump himself.

The ultimate question is whether or not this will ever matter. The Trump administration seems to feel it won’t. It’s not changing its policies and it is certainly aware that a majority of Supreme Court justices are activists who play for the “right” team. All it has to do is keep the appeals process rolling until the Supreme Court takes up the case. If it loses that one, it might be shocked. But it may also be that the clock runs out on this administration before it manages to generate precedent it doesn’t like. It still has more than three years to go. And until the upper levels of the court system step up to shut this down, its presumptively illegal actions will continue uninterrupted.",https://www.techdirt.com/wp-content/themes/techdirt/assets/images/td-rect-logo-white.png,N,,2025-11-08 02:01:50.861742

To the chagrin of U.S. allies and rights advocates alike, the U.S. seat sat empty as the council president sought input from the United States — once a stalwart participant and defender of human rights worldwide — as it came up for its turn part of regular review of all U.N. member states.

Council members expressed regret that the United States didn’t take part, called on the council president to urge the U.S. to resume its cooperation, and moved to reschedule the U.S. review next year: Such a review can’t take place without the “concerned country” taking part. Honduras faced its review earlier in the day Friday.

There’s no indication whether the Trump administration would take part next year either. The U.S. already announced in September that it would sit out Friday’s review.

The American Civil Liberties Union, an advocacy group, said the Trump administration was “setting a dangerous example that will further weaken universal human rights at home and abroad,” and pointed to rights concerns in the United States.

“From the discrimination and violence inflicted in the ICE raids, to the attacks on free speech of protesters and journalists, to the deployment of the National Guard in American cities when no crisis exists, the world is watching the United States government attacking the constitutional and human rights of its own people,” said Chandra Bhatnagar, executive director of the ACLU of Southern California, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The council examines the rights records of all 193 U.N. member countries about every four or five years. This was to be the fourth such review of the United States since the 47-member country council was created two decades ago.

Israel, in 2013, became the only other country to reject the council’s review process — but ended up taking part nine months later, council officials have said.

U.S. President Donald Trump in February issued an executive order announcing that the United States was withdrawing from the council.

Local police have become increasingly reliant on license plate tracking cameras to solve crimes, and federal investigators have noticed. There's been a recent spike in federal searches of local data, which means police departments in some sanctuary states may find themselves illegally sharing information for immigration enforcement. NPR's Martin Kaste has the story.

MARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: This isn't new tech. For years now, police have used automatic license plate readers to log when and where random passing cars are seen in traffic. But what is new is how common the cameras have become.

PHIL NEFF: Some of the comments you see are, well, these are only tracking criminals. But that's not true. It's everyone.

KASTE: Phil Neff is the research coordinator at the University of Washington's Center for Human Rights. He's been looking at the internal audits from police departments that store those license plate records in the cloud. The audits show which other law enforcement agencies have looked at their records, and Neff was shocked by how often the inquiries seemed to be coming from the feds.

NEFF: Over the summer, hundreds if not thousands of searches by U.S. Border Patrol - and it would have keywords that were sometimes as vague as, like, investigation or targeting.

KASTE: This could be a problem in a state like Washington, which limits the information that local police can share with immigration enforcement.

RYAN RUTLEDGE: Yeah, it was alarming to hear that, and we wanted to dig in right away and find out what we need to do.

KASTE: Ryan Rutledge is deputy chief of police in Renton, a suburb of Seattle. It was one of the departments singled out by Neff's research. Like other departments, Renton says it didn't mean to share data with immigration authorities, and Rutledge says the city temporarily locked down outside access to its data while it took a closer look at its settings.

RUTLEDGE: You know, did we go in and click a box to give access to these federal agencies? No, we did not.

KASTE: The police departments pointed to what they saw as a lack of clarity about who had access through a setting called national lookup. The data system they're using is run by Flock Safety. That's the company that supplies the license plate readers.

HOLLY BALIN: Flock has never opted any agencies into sharing relationships that they did not opt themselves into.

KASTE: Flock Safety spokesperson Holly Balin says these departments chose to allow access to federal agencies, which is normal and legal in Washington when it's a criminal matter, such as human trafficking.

BALIN: We see agencies cooperate with federal agencies for these complex cases that are very much within the purview of their laws. But again, that's not Flock, to determine whether agencies cooperate with federal agencies or they don't. That is entirely up to them.

KASTE: The problem is the uncertainty over how often the feds are looking at plates for immigration cases. ICE didn't respond to NPR's request for comment, but the Trump administration has strongly and repeatedly criticized sanctuary states, accusing them of illegally obstructing immigration enforcement.

Another sanctuary state, California, bans police from sending license plate data outside its borders, and Attorney General Rob Bonta recently sent letters to 20 local police departments, warning them that their systems were open to law enforcement outside California. He says most of them seemed surprised.

ROB BONTA: It seemed like it wasn't voluntary. It was unwittingly. And they changed the permissions and the sharing, and that was that from 19 of the 20. They fixed the problem.

KASTE: In the case of the 20th, though, the city of El Cajon, Bonta got pushback. City manager Graham Mitchell tells NPR that they're not sharing data with the feds, but they do believe they're allowed to share with police departments in other states. AG Bonta is now suing the city, and he suspects it's funneling data to the feds indirectly through requests from local police in places like Texas, which work closely with ICE.

BONTA: There's search terms that were used, including immigration, immigration enforcement, immigration violation, ICE assist.

KASTE: Some privacy groups say this whole situation shows the larger risk of surveillance when police keep records of average Americans' comings and goings. Bonta acknowledges that risk, but he doesn't go so far as to say the databases aren't worth having, as long as his state enforces clear guardrails on who gets the data. Martin Kaste, NPR News.

Manually archiving electronic communications is not an unprecedented measure for DHS officials, Weissman added.
“After further review, PRIV acknowledged that OCIO could still conduct searches for electronic messages consistent with existing DHS records management policy, which requires custodians to manually save screen shots of electronic messages that contain federal records to DHS systems,” she added.
According to Weissman, DHS is currently exploring new processes for archiving electronic messages from senior agency and Capstone officials.
“Although DHS is working to identify new, secure, technical solutions to allow automatic archiving of electronic messages, DHS has always maintained Department-wide policies requiring all federal records to be preserved, including those sent by electronic message.”","The Department of Homeland Security in April disabled third-party software that automatically archived SMS, Signal and WhatsApp messages sent by senior agency officials, according to court filings made public this week, raising questions about DHS compliance with federal recordkeeping laws.

The revelation of DHS’s move to ditch the TeleMessage archival tool was revealed in sworn testimony by Michael Weissman, the executive director of the Chief Data Officer Directorate within the agency’s Office of the Chief Information Officer, in the case American Oversight v. DHS in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

According to Weissman, use of TeleMessage — which DHS deployed from Sept. 29, 2023, to April 9, 2025 — was halted because of “cybersecurity failures.” The software had lessened the burden on agency officials to archive their communications, in addition to easing the work of responding to discovery and Freedom of Information Act requests.

But TeleMessage was not replaced with a similar archival tool, per Weissman. Since April, DHS employees who had been covered by that system were “again obligated to manually archive their messages in accordance with existing DHS policy,” he wrote.

Those officials were presented with two options for preserving their electronic messages: screenshot and archive a copy of their communications to shared drive work folders, or have DHS’s OCIO assign a technician to manually access their devices and use forensic tools to create a searchable copy of them. The latter method, Weissman noted, is only available to high-ranking DHS officials, such as the secretary and deputy secretary.

Manually archiving electronic communications is not an unprecedented measure for DHS officials, Weissman added. The agency has “never had the ability to archive iMessages due to the technical implementation of Apple’s encryption technology,” he wrote, meaning officials have “always been responsible” for manually archiving those records. iMessages were disabled on DHS-issued iPhones on March 1, 2023, but then reinstated Feb. 20, 2025, per the court filings.

Chioma Chukwu, executive director of American Oversight, said in a statement that the testimony is essentially an admission that the agency “provided inaccurate information about whether Secretary [Kristi] Noem’s and other top agency officials’ text messages were properly preserved.”

“We’re talking about messages exchanged amid major national controversies — from the deployment of military forces on American streets to inhumane immigration crackdowns and deportations carried out in defiance of court orders,” Chukwu said. “The public deserves to know whether these records still exist, and whether officials destroyed evidence of how those decisions were made. After misleading us for months, DHS wants us to trust that the law is being followed. But the agency has not turned over the records we requested nor has it provided details about whether senior officials’ text messages have been preserved in accordance with the law. It’s time for transparency — not more empty assurances.”

American Oversight’s interpretation appears to refer in part to sworn testimony from Catrina M. Pavlik-Keenan, deputy chief FOIA officer for DHS’s Privacy Office (PRIV), who said the agency’s OCIO initially told her office in late August that because of the move away from TeleMessage, it was unable to search for records requested by the nonprofit.

Based on OCIO’s response, PRIV wrote back to American Oversight and “mistakenly” informed the group that “it was unable to locate or identify any responsive records as DHS no longer had the capability to conduct a search of electronic messages,” Pavlik-Keenan wrote.

“After further review, PRIV acknowledged that OCIO could still conduct searches for electronic messages consistent with existing DHS records management policy, which requires custodians to manually save screen shots of electronic messages that contain federal records to DHS systems,” she added.

William Fischer, the acting chief records officer for the National Archives and Records Administration, meanwhile, said in sworn testimony that NARA became aware of media reports in late August that DHS officials were “unlawfully disposing of electronic federal records.” NARA then sent DHS a letter requesting an investigation into the allegations and a report sent back within 30 days.

“To the best of my knowledge, as of the date of this Declaration, NARA has not received a response to the letter,” Fischer wrote.

According to Weissman, DHS is currently exploring new processes for archiving electronic messages from senior agency and Capstone officials. So far, the agency has “uncovered no evidence” that any federal records have been destroyed or that specific officials have skirted recordkeeping policies.

“DHS policies have never authorized employees to destroy records,” Weissman wrote. “Although DHS is working to identify new, secure, technical solutions to allow automatic archiving of electronic messages, DHS has always maintained Department-wide policies requiring all federal records to be preserved, including those sent by electronic message.”",https://fedscoop.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/GettyImages-2244974791.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 22:56:34.206170

The Supreme Court is weighing an emergency application from the administration to let it deploy the National Guard to the Chicago area but has not yet ruled.","A federal judge on Friday ruled President Trump unlawfully called up and planned to deploy Oregon’s National Guard to Portland, the most decisive blow yet to his bid to send troops into Democratic-led cities where protests have centered on federal immigration facilities.

U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, permanently blocked the president from sending Oregon’s soldiers into the city after determining that the president ran afoul of federal law and stepped on the state’s sovereignty in his bid to send the troops into Portland streets.

It marks the first time a judge has ruled on the underlying legal merits of Trump’s aggressive use of the National Guard, as challenges to his efforts in Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington, D.C., continue to move through the courts.

“To be clear, today this Court does not rule that the President can never deploy the National Guard to Oregon, or to any other location, if conditions on the ground justify the Guard’s intervention,” Immergut wrote. “But under the U.S. Constitution, Congress possesses the power to call up the National Guard ‘to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections, and repel Invasions,’ and Congress’s delegation of its power to the President is by statute.

“Unless and until the President lawfully federalizes National Guardsmen…‘National Guard members serve solely as members of the State militia under the command of a state governor,'” she said.

The decision comes on the heels of a three-day trial, which featured testimony from local and federal law enforcement — often in tension — about the nature of the protests at the heart of the case.

Trump called up Oregon’s National Guard in September, promising to protect “war-ravaged” Portland and its U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility. State and city officials quickly sued to block his efforts.

The president initially federalized and moved to deploy 200 Oregon troops, but after Immergut temporarily blocked the effort, he sought to send troops from California and Texas into the city, prompting the judge to bar any troops from being deployed. The administration has appealed.

At trial, Justice Department (DOJ) lawyers argued that Trump lawfully federalized the National Guard under a provision of Title 10 that lists three circumstances where the president may do so: an invasion, a rebellion or an inability to execute the law with regular forces.

They claimed that the protests outside Portland’s ICE facility have thwarted federal officers’ ability to do their jobs without help and amounted to rebellion against the government, while maintaining that courts should not review Trump’s determination.

“Congress, in Section 12406, made those decisions for the president to make,” said DOJ lawyer Eric Hamilton, referencing the provision.

Two Federal Protective Service supervisors testified anonymously that the National Guard would alleviate strains, though they conceded that neither requested military assistance.

Immergut noted their testimony in her ruling, in addition to the testimony of Maj. Gen. Timothy Rieger, acting vice chief of the National Guard Bureau, who said he had no personal knowledge of the situation on the ground in Portland when issuing the memo proposing the troops’ assistance.

Portland police provided a different picture of the scene on the ground in testimony.

They said that largely peaceful protests have already been inflamed by the few federal officers on site and pointed to the riots that consumed the city in 2020 to exemplify how tactless policing can rile up crowds.

The officers also used the 2020 demonstrations — which began as peaceful demonstrations after George Floyd’s police killing in Minneapolis but devolved into 200 days of sustained protest and sometimes violent clashes — to undermine the administration’s contention that the city is now under siege.

“It was just an entirely different type of disorder,” Portland Police Bureau Cmdr. Franz Schoening said of the protests five years ago.

A three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit paused one of Immergut’s orders last month, but the appeals court vacated that decision and said the full court would rehear the case.

Trump’s efforts to deploy the National Guard to major cities have seen varying success.

Troops are on the ground in California and D.C., but courts have so far blocked deployment in Illinois — though the situation could rapidly change.

The Supreme Court is weighing an emergency application from the administration to let it deploy the National Guard to the Chicago area but has not yet ruled.

The judge temporarily paused a portion of her final judgment for 14 days, so Trump may maintain control of Oregon’s National Guard but not deploy any troops as the administration appeals.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/Top-National-Guard-battle_100325_AP_Jenny-Kane.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-07 23:16:59.354967

With the declaration of a national emergency at the U.S. southern border and the classification of migration as “an invasion,” U.S. President Donald Trump made his focus on immigration clear on the first day of his second term, taking action on an issue that was a focal point in his 2024 presidential campaign. Since then, immigration enforcement authorities have received a significant budget boost as they make record numbers of arrests and pursue the president’s goal of 1 million deportations in 2025.

No doubt, Trump’s migration policy over the course of his term will touch upon Latin America. Just over half of the U.S. foreign-born population comes from the region, per 2023 census data—almost 24.5 million people. According to statistics from Pew Research Center, Latin Americans also make up around 74 percent of an estimated 14 million immigrants lacking full legal status in the United States. This includes people with temporary protections from deportation, such as a pending asylum claim, Temporary Protected Status (TPS), or humanitarian parole. The Trump White House has already moved to strip these protections from hundreds of thousands of immigrants from the region, many of whom either have been or can be deported even while these measures make their way through the courts.

During his first term (2017–2021), Trump passed policies that pressured Latin American governments to take more responsibility to deter migration and accept deportees. This term, Trump is resurrecting—or intensifying—several of those policies. Trump is also attempting to end birthright citizenship by reinterpreting the 14th Amendment and threatening a wider set of countries with punitive measures if they don’t comply with his requests around deportation.

Recent Developments

November 7: Temporary Protected Status ends for 250,000 Venezuelans

About a quarter of a million Venezuelan immigrants in the United States are set to lose TPS on November 7. This follows a Supreme Court ruling on October 3 that allowed the Department of Homeland Security to cut short a Biden-era extension to this program that would have provided Venezuelan recipients protection from deportation until October 2026 (see October 3 entry).

This group of Venezuelan TPS holders join another 350,000 Venezuelans under a distinct TPS designation who lost their legal right to live in the United States immediately following the October 3 Supreme Court decision. They are at risk of deportation, unless they can acquire another immigrant status.

October 31: Trump administration sets record low cap on refugee admissions

In a Presidential Determination published on October 31, the Trump White House limited refugee admissions for fiscal year 2026 to 7,500 people. It is the lowest admissions cap since the U.S. refugee resettlement program began in 1980. The cap for fiscal year 2025, set by the Biden administration, was 125,000.

For much of the program’s history, refugees from Latin American and the Caribbean rarely represented more than 10 percent of overall admissions to the United States. However, the number of refugees from the region grew tenfold between 2022 and 2024, an increase largely driven by Venezuelan displacement. In 2024, a record 25,348 Latin American and Caribbean citizens made up around one-quarter of refugees resettled in the United States. Venezuelans represented around half of refugees from the region in 2024, with Guatemalans and Nicaraguans being the second- and third-largest Latin American refugee populations resettled in the United States last year.

The Presidential Determination states that Afrikaners from South Africa will be given priority in admissions, as well as “other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands.”

October 3: Supreme Court allows Trump administration to strip Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans

Ruling in favor of an emergency appeal from the Trump administration, a 6-3 Supreme Court majority allowed the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to end TPS for Venezuelans. The temporary order from the Supreme Court overrules a previous judgement by a lower court in San Francisco, which had reinstated this protection from deportation until October 2026 and ruled that the DHS did not have the authority to bring an early end to TPS designations (see September 5 entry).

The emergency ruling means that around 350,000 Venezuelans are at immediate risk of deportation. Another TPS designation held by an additional 250,000 Venezuelans is due to expire in November.

September 5: Federal court restores Temporary Protected Status for Haitians and Venezuelans

U.S. District Judge Edward Chen of San Francisco on September 5 ruled against the Trump administration’s early termination of TPS for Haitians and Venezuelans. The ruling restores the rights to live and work in the United States to around 350,000 Venezuelans whose TPS designation expired in April and safeguards this protection from deportation for another 250,000 whose status was due to expire on September 10. It also reaffirms a July order from a federal judge in New York that determined it was unlawful to cut TPS short for the more than 520,000 Haitian immigrants who either possess TPS or are eligible for it.

Chen’s 69-page opinion stated that the DHS decisions to cancel TPS extensions granted by the Biden administration were unprecedented and hasty, and that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem had exceeded her authority in doing so. A DHS response the order argued that “the TPS program has been abused, exploited, and politicized as a de facto amnesty program.” The Trump administration is expected to appeal the ruling.

In January 2025, shortly before leaving office, the Biden administration extended two TPS designations for Venezuelans until October 2026. Protections for Haitians had previously been extended to February 2026, but Noem’s DHS attempted to bring forward the expiration date to August 2025. Subject to appeal, the 2026 expiration dates for both nationalities remain in place.

September 2: Federal appeals court rules against use of Alien Enemies Act to speed deportations of Venezuelans

In a 2–1 majority decision on September 2, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit determined that the Trump administration cannot use the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to expedite the deportation of Venezuelan immigrants it alleges are members of the Tren de Aragua cartel. The ruling sided with arguments from lower courts and immigration advocates that the eighteenth-century wartime act was not intended to remove alleged gang members.

The 185-page ruling stated that “mass immigration” could not be equated to “sending an armed, organized force to occupy, to disrupt or to otherwise harm the United States,” and that there was “no invasion or predatory incursion” as defined in the AEA. The legal case is likely to return to the Supreme Court for a final ruling.

Earlier this year, in March, the Trump administration invoked the AEA to deport 137 Venezuelans to a megaprison in El Salvador. U.S. government allegations that these deportees belong to Tren de Aragua have been refuted in various investigations. Most of those imprisoned in El Salvador were returned to Venezuela in a July prisoner swap (see July 18 entry).

August 31: Judge blocks repatriation of Guatemalan migrant children

On August 31, a U.S. District Court judge in Washington, DC stopped the repatriation of Guatemalan children who had arrived unaccompanied to the United States. In her emergency ruling, issued while dozens of minors were aboard flights set to depart from Texas, Judge Sparkle Sooknanan ordered that the children could not be removed without a deportation order and that they must remain in the country for at least two weeks as legal challenges to their removal play out. Hundreds of unaccompanied Guatemalan migrant children under the custody of the U.S. government are said to be targets for removal, according to sources cited in a CNN report.

Representatives of the Trump administration claimed the children’s parents had requested their return. In a statement released on August 31, the Guatemalan government said that it is undertaking “coordinated actions” with the United States to reunite unaccompanied minors with their families in Guatemala, an agreement that came out of Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem’s trip to Central America in June. The press release added that these actions should be conducted “according to established protocols.”

August 29: Federal appeals court rules that expedited end of Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans is unlawful

A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on August 29 came to the unanimous decision that the Trump administration does not have the power to cut short Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designations for Venezuelan immigrants. In their opinion, the judges wrote that “no administration has attempted to vacate an existing temporary protection status designation in the 35 years in which the program has existed.” The decision reaffirmed a March ruling by a lower court in San Francisco, but it is unclear how it affects the Supreme Court order issued in May that allows the government to deport Venezuelans who already lost TPS protections due to earlier actions by the government (see previous entries).

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced in February the reversal of a Biden-era measure that extended TPS for some 600,000 Venezuelans until October 2026. Around 350,000 Venezuelans registered under a 2023 TPS designation began losing their protection from deportation in April and another 250,000 registered under a 2021 designation are set to lose their status in September.

August 20: Federal court allows termination of Temporary Protected Status for Hondurans and Nicaraguans

The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal for the Ninth Circuit voted on August 20 to permit the Trump administration to end TPS for tens of thousands of Honduran and Nicaraguan immigrants. The ruling is a response to an appeal from the administration to suspend a July 31 decision from U.S. District Judge Trina Thompson in California that had paused the government’s effort to withdraw this legal protection from deportation. Thompson had postponed the termination of TPS for these nationalities until at least November, when a hearing to determine the legality of the government’s action is scheduled to take place.

The Central American TPS holders are set to lose this legal status in September, in accordance with a pair of DHS notices published on July 8 (see July 7 entry). According to U.S. government data, there are around 72,000 Hondurans and 4,000 Nicaraguans residing in the country with TPS. Of these, approximately 21,000 Hondurans and 1,100 Nicaraguans are also green card holders. Those without another legal status will lose access to work permits and become eligible for deportation.

Thompson’s ruling stated that the DHS did not conduct an “objective review of the country conditions” before ending deportation protections and that certain statements from DHS Secretary Kristi Noem “may demonstrate discriminatory intent” toward immigrants. In a rebuttal, the DHS released a statement reiterating its stance that Honduras and Nicaragua are “safe for their nationals to return home.”

July 18: Venezuelan deportees released from El Salvador in exchange for U.S. nationals detained in Venezuela

The governments of El Salvador, the United States, and Venezuela announced on July 18 that around 250 Venezuelans were repatriated from El Salvador’s maximum-security Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, in exchange for the return of 10 U.S. nationals jailed in Venezuela. Also included in the three-country deal was the release of about 80 Venezuelan political prisoners from domestic jails.

Many of those returned to Venezuela were immigrant detainees that the U.S. government deported to El Salvador in March under an eighteenth-century wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act (AEA). It was reported at that time that Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele had agreed with the Trump administration to hold up to 300 third-country deportees in CECOT for a year for a fee of $6 million. A U.S. federal judge subsequently ruled the use of AEA illegal, barring further deportations under this law. However, that decision is subject to an ongoing appeals process.

The five U.S. citizens and five U.S. residents freed from Venezuelan prison were arrested on suspicion of plotting against the Maduro regime, according to Venezuelan authorities. Arrests took place between August 2024 and January 2025.

July 7: Hondurans and Nicaraguans will lose Temporary Protected Status after more than 25 years

In a pair of press releases issued on July 7, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced that Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Hondurans and Nicaraguans will come to an end in September 2025. According to DHS notices set to be published on July 8, around 72,000 Hondurans and 4,000 Nicaraguans have TPS, protecting them from deportation and providing a legal right to live and work in the United States. Those without another legal status will be vulnerable to deportation in two months' time.

The U.S. government first designated TPS for these two countries in 1999, following the destruction wrought by Hurricane Mitch, a category 5 hurricane that remains one of the deadliest Atlantic storms on record. Successive administrations—both Republican and Democrat—continually extended the designation. During the first Trump administration (2017–2021), DHS attempts to terminate TPS for Hondurans and Nicaraguans were held up by legal challenges and then reversed by the Biden administration (2021–2025).

In the press releases, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stated that these countries have displayed sufficient recovery from the damages of Hurricane Mitch and that conditions were safe for their respective citizens to return home. Both countries are currently under a level 3 travel advisory—the second-highest level issued by the State Department—which warn potential travelers of the risk of crime and, in the case of Nicaragua, the threat of “arbitrary enforcement of laws, the risk of wrongful detention, and limited healthcare availability.”

July 1: Judge blocks early termination of Temporary Protected Status for Haitians

U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan on July 1 ruled that the decision of the DHS to bring an early end to TPS for Haitians was unlawful. In his ruling, Cogan stated that the government had failed to provide sufficient notice to TPS holders and that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem ""cannot reconsider Haiti's TPS designation in a way that takes effect before February 3, 2026, the expiration of the most recent previous extension.""

Just days prior, in a statement released on June 27, the DHS announced that Haitian immigrants would no longer have TPS from September 2. Over 521,000 Haitians who either have or are eligible for this legal status in the United States would have been subject to deportation if they did not apply or were ineligible for other forms of legal stay.

According to that release, Secretary Noem “in consultation with the Department of State […] determined that, overall, country conditions have improved to the point where Haitians can return home in safety.” A current State Department travel advisory, however, highlights risks of “kidnapping, crime, [and] civil unrest” in Haiti. Recent UN reports note that up to 90 percent of Port-au-Prince is controlled by armed gangs and that violence is spreading to other parts of the country, while almost 1.3 million people face internal displacement amid record levels of malnutrition.

The attempted termination followed an effort earlier this year by the DHS to rollback a Biden-era extension to TPS for Haitians. A February notice had brought the expiration date forward to August 2025 from February 2026 (see prior entries).

June 9: Travel restrictions come into effect for 19 countries, including Cuba, Haiti, and Venezuela

Starting on June 9, the U.S. government will bar Haitian nationals from entering the United States as well as deny entry to Cubans and Venezuelans seeking to travel on common types of business, tourist, student, and academic visas. The restrictions do not apply to persons with a valid visa that was issued before June 9.

President Trump issued a proclamation on June 4 restricting the entry of citizens from a total of 19 countries. Of those, 12, including Haiti, are subject to an almost complete ban on travel and the issuance of any type of visa. The other seven, including Cuba and Venezuela, will not have access to many types of visitor and immigrant visas. However, the proclamation also instructs consular offices to limit the length of stay permitted on other types of non-immigrant visas, such as employment visas.

The Trump administration cited rates of overstay and perceived threats to national security as the reasons for restricting travel and immigration from citizens of these countries. In the case of Haiti, the administration noted that the country “lacks a central authority” able to properly screen potential travellers and immigrants to the United States, representing a national security risk. The U.S. embassy in Port-au-Prince has not processed visa requests for at least two years, according to the Miami Herald.

Likewise, the U.S. government stated that Venezuela lacks a “competent or cooperative authority” responsible for issuing travel documents and citeds difficulties in coordinating deportation arrangements. Despite a few disruptions, there have been regular deportation flights from the United States to Venezuela during the second Trump administration.

The proclamation used similar justifications for including Cuba, adding that it is a “state sponsor of terrorism.” The U.S. embassy in Havana has not issued visitor visas since 2017, resulting in Cubans often traveling to third countries to apply for these visas.

Exceptions to the restrictions for the 19 countries include green card holders, travelers with diplomatic and other types of official visas, certain categories of family reunification visas, and dual nationals who have a passport from a country not included on the list. The Departments of State and Homeland Security will review the list of countries after the first 90 days, then every six months.

June 6: Kilmar Abrego García returned from El Salvador to face charges in the United States

Kilmar Abrego García, a Salvadoran-born man who was deported from the United States to El Salvador’s CECOT prison in March alongside 260 other immigrants, was returned to the United States on June 6 to face criminal charges. He has been accused of two counts related to transporting undocumented migrants “for financial gain.”

Abrego García’s case has attracted attention from top U.S. politicians and international media, particularly after the White House admitted he was mistakenly deported. His deportation resulted in a legal back-and-forth between the Trump administration and federal courts about bringing him back to the country (see prior entries).

May 30: Supreme Court clears the way for deportation of Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan humanitarian parolees

In an emergency order issued on May 30, the Supreme Court overrode a lower-court decision that had suspended the Trump administration’s truncation of humanitarian parole protections for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans. This leaves parolees who have not acquired another legal status subject to deportation. Over 530,000 individuals benefited from this two-year protection since it was introduced by the Biden administration—first for Venezuelans in October 2022 and then expanded to the other three nationalities in January 2023, when it became known as the CHNV program.

The Supreme Court order was a response to the government’s emergency appeal of an April 14 ruling issued by Judge Indira Talwani of Massachusetts. Less than two weeks before a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) order ending the CHNV program was due to come into effect, Talwani ruled that early termination of a legal status given to noncitizens should not be carried out en masse, but on a case-by-case basis. In its appeal, the Department of Justice argued that this would place an undue administrative burden on the government and added that the DHS had the right to make these decisions without influence from the judiciary.

The Supreme Court ruling is not a final determination on the legality of the March DHS order that sought to bring the program to an end in April. However, CHNV parolees can still be deported while a lawsuit challenging the DHS order proceeds in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston.

April 30: Federal judge orders that migrant detainees at Guantánamo be given notice before third-country deportation

U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy in Boston issued an order on April 30 instructing the U.S. government to give immigrant detainees being held at the Guantánamo Naval Base in Cuba an opportunity to flag concerns about safety risks if deported to a country other than their own. The order followed the Trump administration’s March 30 deportation of four Venezuelan men—three of whom it alleged were Tren de Aragua members—from Guantánamo to El Salvador’s CECOT prison, despite an order Murphy issued on March 28 restricting expedited third-country deportations.

The Department of Justice had argued in an April 28 hearing that the removal did not violate the judge’s March order because it was conducted by the Department of Defense (DoD) and not the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the agency which Murphy cited in his order. Judge Murphy raised questions about the DoD’s authority to conduct deportations without input from DHS, the agency charged with carrying out immigration enforcement actions.

April 29: President Sheinbaum announces that Mexico has received almost 39,000 deportees since start of second Trump term

During her daily morning press conference on April 29, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum informed that her country had received 38,757 deportees from the United States since President Trump’s return to office on January 20. Sheinbaum added that 33,311 were Mexican nationals and the rest were non-Mexicans the country had accepted for “humanitarian reasons,” although she did not specify their nationalities. She noted that Mexico had not signed any agreement with the United States to act as a “safe third country,” a deal the U.S. government pushed for during the first Trump presidency.

This represents a drop in deportations to Mexico compared to a similar period last year under President Joe Biden. According to government figures cited by Reuters, the Biden administration deported around 52,000 persons to Mexico from February through March of 2024.

April 20: U.S. government informs that Abrego García is out of El Salvador’s CECOT prison

The State Department informed a federal judge on April 20 that a Salvadoran immigrant deported from the United States has been taken out of El Salvador’s high-security mega-prison, known by its Spanish acronym CECOT. In a filing submitted to a district judge in Maryland, the State Department said that Kilmar Abrego García had been transferred out of a CECOT cell a week prior to “a room of his own with a bed and furniture” in the “administrative building” of another detention facility in El Salvador.

Abrego García has become a high-profile case amid the ongoing legal battle between the judicial system and the Trump administration over his deportation. Abrego García—who had been living in the United States since 2011 and in 2019 received protection from deportation—was deported to El Salvador in March alongside 260 other immigrants the U.S. government claimed to be gang members. On April 10, the Supreme Court ruled that the government should make every effort to bring him back to the United States, but both the U.S. and Salvadoran administrations have said they are unable to do so. On the back of the Supreme Court order, District Judge Paula Xinis of Maryland requested that the government provide daily updates of Abrego García’s condition and whereabouts, and that it document what steps it had taken to facilitate his return. News of Abrego García being moved from CECOT came after Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) visited El Salvador from April 16 to 18 to petition for the Salvadoran’s return to the United States.

Media reports have indicated that many of those deported alongside Abrego García do not have criminal records in the United States. The majority of those removed to CECOT in March were Venezuelan nationals, prompting Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro to call for their release while chiding President Nayib Bukele's ""complicity."" On April 20, Bukele posted an open letter to Maduro on social media platform X offering a “humanitarian deal” to repatriate the 252 Venezuelan detainees in CECOT to Venezuela in exchange for the release of 252 political prisoners from Venezuela’s jails. In response, Venezuelan Attorney General Tarek William Saab called the proposal “cynical” and asked the Salvadoran governnment to identify each detainee and provide proof of life and medical records.

April 19: Supreme Court blocks use of Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants detained in Texas

In an emergency ruling issued just before 1 a.m. on April 19, the U.S. Supreme Court paused the deportation of a group of Venezuelan immigrants until a lower court had time to decide on the matter. The Trump administration alleges that the Venezuelan immigrants currently detained in Texas are members of Tren de Aragua and had intended to deport the men under the Alien Enemies Act, an eighteenth-century law that had previously only been invoked during active wars.

Lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union, who filed appeals on behalf of the immigrants, said that the detainees had not been given opportunity to challenge their removal orders before a judge. A Supreme Court ruling earlier in April, which did not prohibit the use of the Alien Enemies Act for expedited deportations, did however affirm that immigrant detainees should be given sufficient time to appeal a deportation order.

The U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer has requested the Court’s clarification on whether the Venezuelans detained in Texas could be removed using legal procedures other than the Alien Enemies Act.

April 14: Federal judge stops termination of CHNV parole program

U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani of Massachusetts ruled on April 14 that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) cannot shutter the humanitarian parole program that has granted over 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Venezuelans, and Nicaraguans temporary permission to live and work in the United States. The program, which has been available for these four nationalities since January 2023, was set to end on April 24 in accordance with a 30-day notice published on March 25 by DHS. Parolees whose two-year authorization had not yet expired would have lost their legal status and protection from deportation.

In her order, Judge Talwani wrote that the early termination of a legal status conferred on noncitizens should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. She added in a hearing that DHS had made the decision to end the program with an incorrect understanding of the process, framing parolees as persons who had crossed the border without authorization rather than people who had received permission to enter by air after a vetting process.

April 10: Supreme Court compels return of wrongfully deported Salvadoran migrant

The U.S. Supreme Court on April 10 affirmed a ruling by a district judge that the U.S. government should make all efforts to return Kilmar Abrego García from El Salvador's megaprison. The Trump administration had previously referred to the March 15 deportation of Abrego Garcia alongside 260 other Venezuelan and Salvadoran migrant detainees as an “administrative error.” Abrego García is a Salvadoran who arrived in the United States in 2011 and in 2019 received protection from deportation and permission to work.

The Justice Department (DoJ) argued that the United States has no authority to compel El Salvador to return anyone within its prison system. It also maintained that the U.S. judiciary has no jurisdiction in matters of foreign affairs.

During a visit to the White House on April 14, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said he would not return Abrego García to the United States. Responding to a reporter’s question, he said, “I don’t have the power to return him to the United States.” Both Bukele and the Trump administration have claimed that Abrego García is a member of MS-13, a U.S.-based gang with links to El Salvador that the White House recently designated a foreign terrorist organization. Abrego García’s lawyers have denied this claim and argued that the government has not provided evidence to support it.

Which Cartels and Groups Is Trump Designating as Foreign Terrorist Organizations?

The U.S. government named ten criminal groups FTOs—six from Mexico, two from Haiti, and two associated with Venezuela and El Salvador.

April 9: New York and Texas judges block use of Alien Enemies Act in their states

Judges in New York and Texas issued temporary blocks on the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport immigrants detained within their respective jurisdictions. The orders came despite an earlier Supreme Court ruling that permitted the Trump administration to continue using the eighteenth century wartime act to expedite the deportation of Venezuelan immigrants alleged to be gang members.

On April 7, the Supreme Court ruled against a DC appellate court who had upheld a ban on the deportation of Venezuelan detainees. In a 5-4 decision, the court argued that the case had been filed in the wrong court. However, all nine justices agreed that Venezuelan migrants had to receive advance notice before deportation and sufficient time to challenge the decision before removal.

April 8: Trump administration revokes legal status of CBP One users

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has informed immigrants who used the CBP One mobile application to gain legal entry into the United States that they no longer have permission to live and work in the country and must leave immediately or risk deportation.

In January 2023, the Biden administration expanded the functions of the CBP One app to allow potential migrants to schedule immigration appointments at authorized ports of entry before crossing the U.S.–Mexico border, as a means of discouraging irregular crossings. Those who obtained appointments were usually given a two-year parole to remain and work while applying for other immigration statuses. More than 935,000 immigrants entered the United States via the app, many of whom are Venezuelan, Cuban, and Mexican, according to a January 14 U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) press release.

On his first day in office, Trump cancelled appointments scheduled through the CBP One app. His administration has encouraged undocumented immigrants to notify authorities of “self-deportation” through the rebranded “CBP Home” app.

April 7: Two Supreme Court rulings affirm deportation actions

Kilmar Armando Abrego García, a Salvadoran migrant who had been living with protected legal status in Maryland, has been the subject of a judicial back-and-forth since his March 15 deportation in what the Trump administration admits was “an administrative error.”

On April 4, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis of Maryland ordered that Abrego García should be returned to the United States by midnight on April 5, citing his protection from deportation by a 2019 court order. The Trump administration requested a stay for Xinis’ order.

On April 7, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied that request for a stay. Hours later, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, acting on behalf of the entire court, issued an administrative order indefinitely lifting the deadline set by Judge Xinis, giving the Trump administration more time to comply with her order. Roberts’ order did not touch on the legal issues in Abrego Garcia’s deportation, though a decision whether the Trump administration acted lawfully is expected in the future. Abrego Garcia remains in El Salvador's ""mega-prison.""

In a separate ruling that same day, the Supreme Court said that the administration could continue to deport Venezuelan migrants under Trump's invocation of wartime powers granted under the Alien Enemies Act. However, it added that immigrant detainees must receive prior notice and be given the chance to appeal removal.

March 31: U.S. federal judge pauses end of TPS for Venezuelans

Days before around 350,000 Venezuelan immigrants in the United States were set to lose Temporary Protected Status (TPS), a U.S. judge ruled that the February decision by DHS to cancel the extension of this status was unlawful. The judge’s ruling means that, for now, protections for this group of Venezuelan TPS beneficiaries—as well as another 250,000 Venezuelan TPS holders whose status was set to expire in September—will extend to October 2026. This was the date set in an extension order issued on January 17 under the Biden administration (2021-2025). Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem had attempted to reverse that order.

The Trump administration had one week to appeal the judge’s decision.

March 25: DHS terminates humanitarian parole program for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans

In a notice published on March 25, DHS announced the end of a humanitarian parole program that granted temporary legal status to more than 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans over the less than three years it was active. The notice advises parolees without an alternative migration status to leave the United States before April 24—the date the program is due to expire—or risk deportation. President Trump had instructed the secretary of Homeland Security to end all parole programs “contrary to the policies of the United States” in an executive order signed on the first day of his second term.

Under the humanitarian parole program, persons applied for entry into the United States through a U.S.-based financial sponsor and were allowed to live and work for two years. The Biden administration introduced the program for Venezuelans in October 2022 and expanded it in January 2023 to include Cubans, Haitians, and Nicaraguans, after which it became known as the CHNV program. Before departing office, President Joe Biden announced in October 2024 intentions to sunset the CHNV program and asked parolees to apply for other immigration statuses for which they may have been eligible, including asylum and temporary protected status. It is unclear how many parolees have already obtained another status.

The March 2025 DHS notice states that parolees who have not applied for an alternative legal status will be targeted for deportation. It also notes that the decision to issue the notice just 30 days in advance serves to facilitate the use of expedited removal procedures—i.e. deportation without a hearing before an immigration judge—which can only be used for immigrants who have spent less than two years in the United States.

March 23: Deportation flights to Venezuela resume

A plane carrying 199 deportees arrived in Venezuela on March 23 on the back of an agreement to resume deportation flights from the United States that was announced the day before. The deportation happened in two stages: An ICE-chartered aircraft flew the Venezuelan nationals to a military base in Honduras, where they were then transferred to a plane operated by Venezuela’s state airline to complete the return journey.

This followed a similar agreement negotiated earlier in March by Richard Grenell, the Trump’s administration envoy for special missions, and came despite the Maduro administration’s rebuke of the expulsion of over 200 Venezuelan immigrant detainees to El Salvador’s mega-prison. Secretary of State Marco Rubio had also threatened on social media platform X to increase sanctions if Venezuela stopped accepting deportees.

In February, Venezuela sent three planes to collect around 370 of its nationals with deportation orders from the United States, some of whom had been detained in the U.S. Naval Base in Guantánamo Bay. This followed a meeting between Grenell and Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro on January 31, during which the two reportedly discussed sanctions, the release of U.S. citizens imprisoned in Venezuela, and the repatriation of undocumented Venezuelan immigrants.

However, on March 4, the Trump administration revoked oil company Chevron’s license to operate in Venezuela, an economic lifeline for the regime. In response, Maduro said that decision “damaged communication” between the administrations and stopped sending planes for Venezuelan deportees.

In November 2022, the administration of then-President Joe Biden granted Chevron special permission to operate in Venezuela as part of negotiations to facilitate “free and fair elections” in the South American country. Despite later reinstating several sanctions on the Maduro regime in April 2024, citing a lack of progress towards a return to democracy, the Biden administration did not suspend Chevron’s license.

March 15: Trump invokes 18th century law to deport hundreds of Venezuelan immigrant detainees to El Salvador

On March 15, the Trump administration deported 261 immigrant detainees—238 Venezuelans and 23 Salvadorans—to El Salvador via Honduras. Some of the deportations were enabled by the president’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which allows the U.S. government to apprehend, arrest, and deport without an immigration hearing any non-citizen above 14 years of age who comes from a “hostile nation or government.""

Although the United States is not formally at war with Venezuela, the Trump administration has claimed that many of the Venezuelan detainees are members of the Tren de Aragua gang, a criminal group the executive order described as “undertaking hostile actions and conducting irregular warfare against the territory of the United States both directly and at the direction, clandestine or otherwise, of the Maduro regime in Venezuela.” Tren de Aragua was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, or FTO, in February by the Trump administration.

Around 135 of the 261 flown out of the United States were deported under the Alien Enemies Act. The White House has yet to provide evidence of the deportees’ membership in the Venezuelan gang.

That same day, a federal judge ordered a 14-day block on deportations under this law in response to lawsuits filed by civil rights organizations. However, two deportation flights were already underway by the time of the ruling. The White House has denied allegations that it defied the judge’s ruling by not ordering the deportation flights to return to the United States before they landed on foreign territory.

Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele—who mocked the judge’s ruling on X—has struck a deal with the Trump administration to imprison 300 suspected Tren de Aragua members in El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center for one year for a fee of $6 million dollars. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X this would “save [U.S.] taxpayer dollars” and hailed Bukele as “the strongest security leader in out region [and] a great friend of the U.S.”

The Alien Enemies Act had previously only been invoked three times, each during an active war. It was last used during World War II to detain Japanese and German immigrants in the United States.

March 5: United States suspends military deportation flights

In the first week of March, the U.S. government suspended the use of military planes for deportation flights. In an attempt to fulfill his campaign promise of mass deportations, the Trump administration used military aircrafts to perform deportation operations in February in an unprecedented strategy. Military planes were used to transport migrants to Central American countries and to the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, as well as elsewhere in the world.

However, the strategy encountered various challenges. Countries, including Brazil and Colombia, objected to the use of military planes to return their citizens, while Mexico restricted access to its airspace for these aircrafts. Mexico’s restrictions lengthened flight times for military deportation planes destined for Central and South America, adding to the price of flights that reportedly cost around $28,500 per hour. Civilian flights chartered by ICE cost approximately $17,000 according to former ICE officials cited in The Wall Street Journal.

February 24: Homeland Security rolls back TPS for Haitians

Through a February 24 notice, DHS announced that a Biden-era extension of TPS for Haitian immigrants until February 3, 2026 would instead expire on August 3, 2025. This means that the approximately 521,000 Haitians in the United States who either have or are eligible for TPS are set to lose permission to work and protection from deportation. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem has until June 4, 2025 to decide whether to re-extend or end this legal status.

Among the justifications cited for the decision to shorten the time frame for these protections, DHS stated that the 2024 deployment of the U.S.-funded and Kenya-staffed Multinational Security Support mission to combat gang violence in Port-au-Prince, Haiti’s capital, represented a “real possibility of an improvement in conditions.” As such, Secretary Noem has committed to reviewing conditions in the country to determine whether it is safe to return Haitians. According to UN estimates, more than 5,600 persons were killed in Haiti in 2024, an increase of over 1,000 from the previous year, with hundreds more wounded and kidnapped. The notice also states that there will be consideration of “whether it is contrary to the U.S. national interest to continue to permit the Haitian nationals to remain temporarily in the United States.”

TPS was first made available to Haitian nationals in 2010 following a powerful earthquake that caused massive destruction in the capital and surrounding areas. Successive governments later extended and added new designations for TPS to protect an increasing number of Haitian immigrants in the United States. In 2018, during Trump’s first term in office, the administration’s attempt to terminate the program was successfully challenged in court.

February 23: New batch of Latin American migrants taken to Guantánamo Bay detention

After deporting the first batch of Venezuelan migrant detainees at the U.S. naval base in Guantánamo Bay, the military resumed flying immigrant detainees to the site on February 23. Among the nationalities taken to the base are Colombians, Ecuadorans, Guatemalans and Salvadorans. Those considered “high-threat” immigrants are reportedly being held in facilities previously used to imprison suspected terrorists.

Back on February 20, the U.S. administration flew 177 of the 178 Venezuelan migrants detained at the base to Honduras, where they were then picked up by a Venezuelan aircraft to complete the journey to their home country. One of the detainees was returned to the mainland United States.

February 17: Rubio’s Central America trip yields deportation deals

In his first trip as secretary of state, Marco Rubio ventured to Central America and the Caribbean with migration as a priority.

On Rubio’s first stop, Panama, President José Raúl Mulino offered the U.S. government use of a landing strip in a town near the Darién Gap as a base for deportation operations. In a press conference on February 2, Mulino suggested that U.S. deportation flights could depart from the Nicanor Air Base to return migrants to their respective countries of origin, including Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela, as well as further afield. This builds upon an agreement signed in July 2024 through which the United States finances deportation flights from Panama.

The first of these flights landed near Panama City on February 13 carrying 119 migrants from various Asian countries including Afghanistan, China, and Pakistan. President Mulino explained they would be transferred to a shelter in the Darién province and from there, returned to their home countries. Similar flights to Costa Rica reportedly began on February 17.

Rubio’s following stop was El Salvador, where he announced on February 3 that President Nayib Bukele had offered to take in deportees of any nationality with a criminal record, including alleged gang members, to be held in El Salvador’s mega prison. Bukele later clarified on X that only “convicted criminals” would be admitted “in exchange for a fee.” Both men added that the proposal included the transfer of convicted U.S. citizens, a procedure experts noted would be legally fraught. Rubio referred to the offer as “an act of extraordinary friendship” that would constitute “the most unprecedented and extraordinary migratory agreement anywhere in the world.”

In Guatemala, President Bernardo Arévalo announced in a joint press conference with Secretary Rubio on February 5 that his country would accept 40 percent more deportation flights from the United States and receive non-Guatemalan citizens. Under the Biden administration, approximately 14 flights landed in Guatemala on a weekly basis, with over 66,000 Guatemalans being returned to their country in the 2024 fiscal year.

February 4: Laken Riley Act and Guantánamo migration detention center

The first signed bill of Trump’s second term deals with migration. The Laken Riley Act, signed January 29, stipulates the federal detention of any migrant accused—but not yet convicted—of theft or a violent crime. It also empowers states attorneys general to sue the federal government if they feel there has been harm due to a failure of immigration enforcement.

During that signing, Trump announced that he would direct construction to expand a migrant detention center in Guantánamo Bay. This was later formalized in a memo. The president claimed that the U.S. military site, located in Cuba, could house up to 30,000 migrants, almost doubling the state’s holding capacity for persons under deportation orders. If constructed, it would be the largest U.S. migrant detention center. Flights carrying detained migrants from the mainland United States to Guantánamo began on February 4.

Best known as the site of a detention and alleged torture facility for suspected terrorists, Guantánamo Bay also hosts facilities that have been used intermittently in recent decades to temporarily house migrants and asylum seekers, including under the Biden administration, and to process or return persons picked up at sea.

January 28: Venezuelans to lose protected status

On January 28, the Department of Homeland Security announced the cancellation of an 18-month extension to TPS for Venezuelans. This reversed an order implemented earlier in January by the previous Biden administration that offered over 600,000 Venezuelans with TPS protection from deportation and legal permission to work until October 2026. The reversal means that protections for around 350,000 Venezuelans registered under a 2023 TPS designation will instead expire on April 2, 2025. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has until July 12, 2025 to make a final determination on whether to extend or end the legal status of Venezuelans registered under a 2021 TPS designation, which is due to expire on September 10, 2025.

Back in 2017, as one of the last acts of his first term, Trump granted Venezuelan migrants protection from deportation for 18 months, using a mechanism similar to TPS.

Following a meeting between Trump’s envoy for special missions, Richard Grenell, and Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro on January 31, Trump stated that Venezuela had agreed to receive deportation flights and offered to provide the means of transportation. Venezuela had stopped allowing the United States to return its citizens in January 2024. The Venezuelan government has not provided details on what was discussed with Grenell, but Maduro stated that they had ""taken a first step” towards a new relationship with the United States.

January 26: Military deportation flights raise regional ire

In his second term, Trump has introduced the use of military aircrafts to carry out deportations, a move experts note is unprecedented in modern history.

Military deportation flights bound for Colombia on January 26 triggered an explosive but short-lived dispute between Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro. Early that morning, Petro rescinded flight permissions for two planes carrying Colombian nationals. Petro objected to the use of military vessels and what he considered a lack of “dignified treatment” of those on board.

In response, Trump threatened “decisive retaliatory measures” including: a 25 percent tariff on Colombian goods, to be raised to 50 percent within one week; visa and travel bans for government officials, their families, and “supporters;” and “enhanced” inspections of Colombian nationals at ports of entry. The U.S. embassy in Bogotá also suspended visa processing.

Petro retaliated with the announcement that Colombia would also levy a 25 percent tariff on U.S. goods, along with a missive on X in which he suggested that Trump was plotting a coup, while insisting that he was “not scared of [a] blockade” and that Colombia would “stop looking to the North.” The United States is Colombia’s largest trading partner and purchases around a quarter of all Colombian exports.

However, before the end of the day, both the White House and the Colombian foreign ministry confirmed that deportation flights would resume as normal and that there would be no extra tariffs. The White House added that the tariffs and sanctions would be “held in reserve” should Colombia violate the agreement. Deportation flights resumed on January 28 with Petro sending the Colombian Air Force to carry his citizens to Bogotá.

The diplomatic dispute came just a few hours after the Brazilian government raised similar objections to returning nationals being handcuffed and prevented from using the bathroom on a January 24 deportation flight. When the plane made a stopover in Manaus, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva sent the Brazilian Air Force to collect the returnees and complete the journey to Belo Horizonte without handcuffs. Brazil’s foreign ministry later sent a diplomatic note to the U.S. requesting clarification on the “degrading treatment” of the migrants.

Also on January 24, Mexico blocked U.S. military planes from passing through Mexican airspace but allowed non-military deportation flights to land domestically. Neither government provided a public explanation for the refusal. In Guatemala, military deportation flights were allowed in on January 25 without issue.

January 20: Early executive orders show immigration priorities

Rhetoric about migration featured prominently in Trump’s inaugural address. He spoke several times about what he deemed “the disastrous invasion of our country” and mentioned specific policies—such as “Remain in Mexico” and large-scale deportation—in his address.

Hours later, Trump signed a series of executive orders that actualized many of the migration promises in his speech. That included declaring a national emergency on the U.S. border with Mexico and categorizing immigration as “an invasion"" under the Constitution, which provides legal justification for the federal government to take expanded action on behalf of the states.

Several of Trump’s executive orders marshaled resources to the border for the construction of infrastructure and the use of technology like drones. He also authorized the Department of Defense to send troops to the border. The first wave of the military included 1,500 troops, who began to reach their new posts on January 23.

Trump also modified several immigration policies. This included significantly reducing the geographical and time constraints on expedited removals, a mechanism that facilitates the deportation of undocumented migrants without an immigration hearing. He also resurrected the Migration Protection Protocols (MPP), better known as “Remain in Mexico.” This policy, first implemented by Trump in 2018, forces asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for their U.S. immigration hearings. He suspended the acceptance of refugees under the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. He ended the humanitarian parole programs for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans, leaving over 530,000 people in legal limbo. He also shut down a mobile application that migrants in Mexico used to schedule appointments with U.S. immigration, effectively canceling scheduled proceedings.

2024 Campaign

Immigration formed a central pillar of Trump’s 2024 campaign for reelection. On his campaign website, the first two of 20 “core promises” were to “seal the border and stop the migrant invasion” and “carry out the largest deportation operation in American history.” The Trump campaign insisted that his administration would focus on non-U.S. citizens in the country without legal status. More than three-quarters of an estimated 11 million undocumented migrants in the United States come from Latin America and the Caribbean, according to 2022 data compiled by Pew Research Center.

In the run-up to the election, Trump and his now Vice President JD Vance amplified unverified reports of crimes committed by migrants, including Haitians and Venezuelans, to provide grist for their plans to ramp up persecution and deportation of undocumented migrants. This aligned with another of his “core” campaign promises to “stop the migrant crime epidemic, demolish the foreign drug cartels, crush gang violence, and lock up violent offenders.”",https://www.as-coa.org/sites/default/files/styles/metatag_585x422/public/field/image/Deportation_Flight.jpeg?h=9994641b&itok=RjY0lhj_,N,,2025-11-08 02:02:25.433466

Trump Administration takes fight over SNAP funding to Supreme Court

After Rhode Island federal Judge John McConnell ordered the administration to make full payments of November SNAP benefits to the states within a day, the Justice Department filed a notice of appeal Nov. 6.

About 42 million Americans receive SNAP food assistance.

On Nov. 7, the DOJ asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit to halt McConnell's order by 4 p.m. EDT.

""There is no lawful basis for an order that directs (the U.S. Department of Agriculture) to somehow find $4 billion in the metaphorical couch cushions,"" the administration said in its request.

The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to intervene.

In response, the Trump administration filed a last-minute appeal on Nov. 7 with the Supreme Court to block the initial court order requiring the government to provide full SNAP food aid benefits.

Fourteen mothers jumped over the barricades and sat in a circle on Beach Street to “demand an end” to the immigration raids that have swept through the Chicago area since the Trump administration launched “Operation Midway Blitz” in September.

Less than a minute later, the women were arrested by Cook County sheriff’s deputies. The sheriff’s office confirmed the arrests and said charges were pending.

“We want to encourage other people who feel strongly about ICE’s actions to step off the sidelines and take our cities back,” said Teresa Shattuck, a mother from Oak Park. “We want to use our collective power and our white privilege in the way it should be used.”

Meghan Carter, another mother from Oak Park, said the women who were arrested understood the risks when they chose to take a stand, adding their experiences paled in comparison to what the detained immigrants inside the facility were enduring.

Carter said the suburban moms were a group of parents “fed up” with seeing immigration agents “terrorizing” their communities.

She also found that the attempt to use National Guard soldiers in Oregon had violated the U.S. Constitution’s 10th Amendment, which gives states any powers not expressly assigned to the federal government.

“The evidence demonstrates that these deployments, which were objected to by Oregon’s governor and not requested by the federal officials in charge of protection of the ICE building, exceeded the president’s authority,” she wrote.

Judge Immergut also disputed the president’s claim that antifa, at least in Portland, is an organized and cohesive group working against the federal government. She said testimony from the regional director for ICE about the level of damage at the Oregon facility or how disruptive the protests were was not believable, noting that demonstrators had “minimally impeded” federal workers. She added that her ruling does not preclude future efforts by the president to deploy the National Guard to Oregon.

Federal lawyers indicated at a three-day trial last week that if Judge Immergut ruled against them, they intended to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco. With the legal battle expected to continue, Judge Immergut stayed the portion of her ruling that would have reverted control of federalized guard soldiers back to Oregon’s governor for 14 days, essentially maintaining the status quo. A similar case involving the use of National Guard troops in Illinois is currently before the Supreme Court.

While Democratic leaders in Oregon celebrated the decision on Friday, the Department of Homeland Security objected to the judge’s characterization of the protests in Portland.

“President Trump is using his lawful authority to direct the National Guard to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following months of violent riots where officers have been assaulted and doxxed by left-wing rioters,” Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary with the department, said in a statement. “The president’s lawful actions will make Portland safer.”

Daily demonstrations began outside Portland’s ICE building in early June, after the Trump administration ramped up immigration enforcement. The crowds have generally been small — usually fewer than a few dozen people — and peaceful, but protesters have occasionally blocked the building’s driveway. They typically dispersed when federal officers in riot gear appeared.

A few confrontations, however, have turned violent, with federal officers using tear gas, rubber bullets and pepper-spray balls. The protests, now into their fifth month, have strained the Federal Protective Service, the agency charged with guarding U.S. government buildings.

On Sept. 27, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social that he planned to use “full force” to protect “war-ravaged Portland.” Later that day, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth asked Gov. Tina Kotek of Oregon, a Democrat, to activate 200 National Guard troops to help federal officers at the ICE building. Ms. Kotek refused, and the Trump administration responded by federalizing the soldiers and preparing to send them into Portland.

The lawsuit argued that the president had failed to demonstrate that the deployment was justified. Under Title 10 of the U.S. Code, a president may use the National Guard on U.S. soil in only three circumstances: a foreign invasion; a rebellion, or threat of a rebellion; or if the laws of the nation cannot be enforced with existing resources.

During the trial last week, administration lawyers argued that the last two conditions applied in Oregon.

In her final ruling, Judge Immergut disagreed on both counts and said the demonstrations, with a few notable exceptions, were largely peaceful and not as disruptive nor as dangerous as federal officials suggested.

The judge also wrote that she had been “deeply troubled” to discover that a small squad of Oregon National Guard troops were deployed at the ICE building after she had temporarily blocked their arrival in October.

At trial, federal lawyers acknowledged that a group of nine Guard soldiers had worked a shift at the facility on Oct. 4 starting in the late morning and stretching into late evening — after the judge had issued a temporary restraining order at 3:40 p.m. A few hours after the order, the administration flew 200 California National Guard troops to Oregon, apparently to replace the Oregon soldiers who had been barred from the ICE building.

“In other words,” she wrote, “defendants had time to order and coordinate the transport of federalized California National Guardsmen from Los Angeles to Portland but needed more time to communicate with the Oregon National Guardsmen at the Portland ICE facility.”

Judge Immergut wrote that while she was not citing the federal government for contempt of court, “this court expects defendants will provide further explanation when ordered to do so.”

“Nonpartisanship is the bedrock of the federal Civil Service,” wrote Judge Cooper, who had approved President Trump’s plan to fire tens of thousands of federal employees this year. “Political officials are free to blame whomever they wish for the shutdown, but they cannot use rank-and-file civil servants as their unwilling spokespeople.”

The ruling, which ordered the government to remove the partisan messaging from employees’ out-of-office email replies, came as a blow to an effort coordinated through the White House to use nominally nonpartisan federal agencies to exert political pressure on Democratic lawmakers, who are pushing to extend health care subsidies in exchange for voting to reopen the government.

Official websites and social media accounts across the federal government have blasted out similar partisan attacks declaring that Democrats or the “radical left” were to blame for the disruption of government services. Several banner messages on government websites said that “President Trump has made it clear he wants to keep the government open and support those who feed, fuel, and clothe the American people.”

Though Judge Cooper made note of that “politically charged language,” the case focused on the email replies sent from the accounts of furloughed Education Department employees. The American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union representing federal workers, had sued to have the email messages taken down.

Judge Cooper said the Education Department’s partisan attacks had “added insult to injury” for federal workers who were sent home without pay.

“The department waited until its furloughed employees lost access to their email, then gratuitously changed their out-of-office messages to include yet another partisan message, thereby turning its own work force into political spokespeople through their official email accounts,” Judge Cooper wrote.

He concluded that the Education Department had “overplayed its hand,” writing that the agency had infringed on its employees rights “by unlawfully compelling its employees’ speech.”

The messages had amounted to a remarkable breach for federal agencies and their typically nonpartisan work force, which normally do not get involved in politics. The Trump administration’s effort to wield government platforms to attack Democrats may also violate the Hatch Act, a law intended to ensure that the federal work force operates free of political influence or coercion, federal employment experts say.

Public interest and ethics groups quickly filed official Hatch Act complaints about the partisan attacks, though the Trump administration has recently moved to weaken enforcement of the law, which is coordinated through the Office of Special Counsel. Mr. Trump withdrew his nominee to head that agency last month after Politico reported that he had sent a series of racist text messages, including telling a group of fellow Republicans that he had “a Nazi streak.”

“Half asleep, I glanced over and saw a call from Washington DC,” Mr. Strawberry wrote. “Curious, I answered, and to my amazement, the lady on the line said, ‘Darryl Strawberry, you have a call from the President of the United States, Donald Trump.’ I put it on speakerphone with my wife nearby, and President Trump spoke warmly about my baseball days in NYC, praising me as one the greatest player of the ’80s and celebrating the Mets. Then, he told me he was granting me a full pardon from my past.”

A White House official on Friday confirmed that Mr. Trump had granted Mr. Strawberry the pardon, saying that the onetime baseball star had served his time and paid back taxes after pleading guilty to one count of tax evasion.

“Following his career, Mr. Strawberry found faith in Christianity and has been sober for over a decade — he has become active in ministry and started a recovery center which still operates today,” the official said.

The official did not answer questions about who had initiated the clemency process in Mr. Strawberry’s case.

In 2010, Mr. Strawberry appeared on “The Celebrity Apprentice” when Mr. Trump was the host.

Another contestant from that season, Rod R. Blagojevich, the former Democratic governor of Illinois, gained a full pardon from Mr. Trump in February.

In 2020, Mr. Trump commuted Mr. Blagojevich’s 14-year prison sentence in his corruption case, which stemmed from a scheme to sell a Senate seat being vacated by Barack Obama.

Some other prominent recipients of presidential pardons have made overtures to the administration, through people close to Mr. Trump or directly.

“This has nothing to do with politics — it’s about a Man, President Trump, caring deeply for a friend,” Mr. Strawberry wrote. “God used him as a vessel to set me free forever!”

A representative for Mr. Strawberry did not immediately respond to questions about the pardon.

One of baseball’s most fearsome power hitters of the 1980s, Mr. Strawberry was a core member of the New York Mets team that defeated the Boston Red Sox in the 1986 World Series, the second title in franchise history.

He enjoyed a late career renaissance with the crosstown Yankees, winning the World Series with them in 1996 and 1999. He also played for the Yankees in 1998 when they won the World Series, but was replaced on the playoff roster after a colon cancer diagnosis.

For all of his accomplishments in baseball — he hit 335 home runs, was named National League Rookie of the Year in 1983 and won two Silver Slugger awards — Mr. Strawberry’s career was repeatedly derailed by legal troubles and substance abuse.

In the tax evasion case, federal prosecutors accused Mr. Strawberry of failing to report more than $350,000 in income from autograph shows and other promotional appearances from 1986 to 1990.

He could have faced 15 years in prison if convicted of three criminal counts, but was sentenced to six months of home confinement as part of a plea deal in which he admitted to cheating the government out of $100,000 in taxes.

In 2000, Mr. Strawberry was suspended for one year by Major League Baseball for a failed drug test, his third violation of baseball’s drug aftercare program.

In 2002, a Florida judge sentenced Mr. Strawberry to 18 months in prison for the latest of six probation violations. He had previously received probation in connection with a 1999 conviction on drug and prostitution solicitation charges.

Mr. Strawberry served about 11 months before being released in 2003.

In the years since his incarceration, he has frequently spoken to inmates about his poor choices and his struggles with substance abuse.

Last year, the Mets retired his No. 18 at Citi Field.

The proposal, announced by Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, never had much hope of moving through the Republican-led Congress. Speaker Mike Johnson has refused to commit to even allowing a vote on extending the Obamacare subsidies, with many Republicans opposed to renewing the tax credits, at least without major changes.

Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, called the idea a “nonstarter.”

But after weeks of gridlock, it amounted to a major move by Democrats, whose previous proposal for funding the government was tied to a permanent extension of the subsidies and the repeal of a set of deep Medicaid cuts that President Trump signed into law over the summer, among other things.

Mr. Schumer framed the offer as a reasonable off-ramp to a shutdown that has threatened to snarl flights and sap food benefits across the country, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers furloughed or working without pay.

“Democrats are ready to clear the way to quickly pass a government funding bill that includes health care affordability,” Mr. Schumer said. He called on Mr. Thune to add the extension of health care tax credits slated to expire in December to the stopgap spending bill he has been trying to pass for weeks.

“That’s not a negotiation; it’s an extension of current law — something we do all the time around here, as we all know,” Mr. Schumer said.

He also suggested that lawmakers convene a bipartisan committee that would negotiate a longer-term compromise to bring down the cost of health care subsidies offered through the federal marketplace before next year’s enrollment period.

Earlier this week, a group of moderate Democrats who have been quietly holding bipartisan talks with some centrist Republicans on funding legislation had appeared ready to strike a deal to end the standoff. But Democratic election victories on Tuesday night in New York, New Jersey, Virginia and other states appeared to have stiffened the party’s resolve to continue demanding Republicans relent on the health care tax credits.

After huddling all week in tense closed-door luncheons, Democrats who had been divided on whether to prolong the shutdown or find a quick bipartisan compromise emerged on Thursday saying they remained unified around the issue of addressing health care costs.

But they also narrowed their demands, something many progressives had resisted. Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, had previously rejected the idea of extending the credits for only one year, saying it was insufficient. But Mr. Jeffries said on Friday in a statement that he backed Mr. Schumer’s new proposal.

“We are offering a compromise,” said Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said, adding, “Now Republicans just need to say yes and the government reopens.”

Republicans almost immediately rejected the proposal out of hand. Mr. Thune said the new offer was a sign of “progress” but did not bring senators “anywhere close to what we need to do here.”

Representative August Pfluger of Texas, the chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee, the biggest caucus of House Republicans, also called it a “nonstarter.”

That left a distinct sense of inertia at the Capitol on Friday, where senators had been bracing to work through the weekend but were uncertain of what they would be debating or whether any real progress could be made toward reopening the government.

Mr. Thune had previously signaled that he would call another vote on Friday on advancing yet another temporary spending bill to end the shutdown. He had raised the idea of voting on a new stopgap measure, plus three separate spending measures for programs related to agriculture, military construction and legislative agencies for most of 2026.

But bipartisan talks to finish those spending bills were still continuing on Friday, with several key sticking points unresolved, including the length of the short-term funding bill.

And Democrats were quietly pressing Republicans to include language in the spending bills that would reverse the mass firings of federal workers carried out by the Trump administration during the shutdown.

Instead, Mr. Thune called a vote on advancing G.O.P.-written legislation to pay federal workers during the shutdown. Democrats, who have said they oppose the bill because it would hand Mr. Trump wide latitude to choose which workers received compensation, blocked that measure in a 53-to-43 vote. That fell short of the 60 votes needed.

Three Democrats voted to advance the bill. Republicans picked up the support of one new Democrat who had previously voted to block the measure last month when Republicans called the measure up for a vote, Senator Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico.

Senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock of Georgia voted again to advance it. Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, who voted for the bill last month, did not vote.

Prosecutors claimed that the efforts of Mr. McMahon and his co-conspirators were intended to coerce a Chinese couple living in New Jersey to return to China to face corruption charges.

The prosecutors presented the plot as part of Operation Fox Hunt, a decade-long push that Chinese officials claim is aimed at repatriating fugitives. The Justice Department contended that the campaign was part of the Communist Party’s push to control Chinese nationals around the world.

But Mr. McMahon’s defenders say he was tricked into participating in the plot while working as a private investigator. They say he cooperated with the federal investigation, only to face aggressive tactics from prosecutors in the Justice Department during the Biden administration who were intent on making an example of Mr. McMahon.

While he was awaiting sentencing, he and his wife attended Mr. Trump’s inauguration in January. And they had support from people in Mr. Trump’s orbit, including Representative Mike Lawler, Republican of New York, and Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime Trump associate and friend who had urged the president to issue the pardon.

“I am glad that the president pardoned him,” Mr. Lawler said in an interview. “It was the right thing to do.”

That influence campaign followed a formula that has been shown to resonate with Mr. Trump, who has complained that he, too, was harmed by politically motivated investigations. Mr. Trump has used the unfettered presidential clemency power to reward allies and make political points, including casting prosecutions of his supporters as corrupt witch hunts.

A White House official echoed that framing in a statement confirming the pardon of Mr. McMahon. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, argued that the trial was flawed and that Mr. McMahon was tricked into participating in the effort by someone who cast it as an investigation into an individual who had embezzled funds from a construction company.

In reality, the official said, the people who had hired him were actually Chinese spies using his services to track down the individual. The official suggested that Mr. McMahon’s pardon campaign was aided by his career with the New York Police Department, during which he responded to the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks in the city.

Mr. McMahon’s pardon, like most issued by Mr. Trump, bypassed Justice Department guidelines for vetting and identifying deserving recipients who have served their time and expressed remorse. Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. also flouted the department’s clemency process.

Mr. McMahon applied for a commutation through the Justice Department this year, according to its website. But he would not have qualified for a pardon under its guidelines, since he was still serving his sentence.

Mr. McMahon had been in prison in Michigan until last month, when he was moved to a residential re-entry facility, according to Mr. Lawler, whose district is home to several of Mr. McMahon’s relatives.

“He never should have been prosecuted in the first place,” Mr. Lawler said. “He fully cooperated, gave them all the information that he had on the case, and then the Biden D.O.J. prosecuted him to make an example out of him when he didn’t do anything wrong.”

Mr. Lawler said that Mr. McMahon was suffering from ailments related to his response to the Sept. 11 attacks, and that his brother, a former New York City firefighter, had recently died from an illness believed to be related.

“This is a family that has really been put through the wringer for five-plus years,” Mr. Lawler said.

He credited the former police officer’s wife, Martha Byrne, an actor who appeared in a popular soap opera, with generating support for the pardon.

On social media late on Thursday, Ms. Byrne, who wrote a book about the case, posted a video of herself dancing to the song “Y.M.C.A.” at what appears to be a Trump rally.

“What a week!!! News to follow!!” she wrote.

In an interview on Friday, she called her husband a hero who did nothing wrong.

“And to have the commander in chief, the president of the United States, agree is absolutely incredible to us,” she said. “He understands the D.O.J. and how it can be absolutely brutal to innocent people. And we’re just people. We’re not politicians. We’re not political people.”

Mr. Stone, who received a pardon during Mr. Trump’s first term for obstructing a congressional inquiry into possible Trump campaign coordination with Russia, had hosted Ms. Byrne on his podcast and posted an essay on his website calling for the pardon.

Mr. Stone said he also wrote a letter to the president urging the pardon, but did not talk to any government officials about it and was not paid for his advocacy.

Mr. Trump this week also approved pardons for two Tennessee Republicans — the former House speaker and a former top aide — who had been sentenced weeks earlier on public corruption charges and were scheduled to report to prison later this month.

The Tennessee pardons were reported on Thursday by The Washington Post.

They were confirmed by a White House official.

Yet seven diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the talks, said that the United States came with a take-it-or-leave-it message to the council.

They said Michael Waltz, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, told diplomats from countries on the Security Council that the alternative to wholesale adoption of the Trump plan was to watch the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas give way to a return to war.

It was unclear if, should the resolution not pass, Israel would resume its military offensive against Hamas in Gaza.

The 10-point draft resolution, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, builds on the Trump peace plan in some respects but leaves major ambiguities, including about how to demilitarize Gaza.

It would authorize a “Board of Peace” to oversee Gaza at least until the end of 2027. It also says the coastal enclave would be managed day-to-day by a “technocratic, apolitical committee of competent Palestinians from the Strip” and calls upon the World Bank to set up a trust fund to finance reconstruction.

An International Stabilization Force would be responsible for “ensuring the process of demilitarizing” the territory, including destroying military infrastructure in Gaza and decommissioning militant groups’ weaponry. But the draft does not go into greater detail about how it would do that if militants refused to comply.

The resolution said that the stabilization force should coordinate with Egypt and Israel to train and support Palestinian police personnel, protect civilians, work to secure humanitarian corridors, and to secure border areas.

Some countries have been skittish about committing soldiers to such a force for fear that their soldiers could come into direct conflict with Hamas. Analysts have also said that Arab states would be unlikely to deploy their soldiers to Gaza if the plan did not include a pathway to establishing a Palestinian state, which Israel’s government opposes.

Mr. Waltz, the Trump administration’s emissary to the United Nations, held one-on-one meetings this week with the permanent members of the Security Council — Russia, China, France and the United Kingdom.

He also met with members of the Palestinian mission to the U.N. according to a senior U.S. official — a signal by the Trump administration that Palestinian leaders were not being frozen out of the process.

Security Council members are expected to provide written feedback to the United States by Friday, the senior American official said. The Trump administration hopes to put the resolution, which was presented to diplomats with the president’s peace plan attached, to a vote in the coming weeks.

The official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy, said that incorporating Mr. Trump’s peace plan into the resolution effectively addressed two pressing issues that had arisen in discussions with Europeans and Arab allies. Those concerns, the official said, were about Palestinian statehood and the role of the Palestinian Authority in Gaza’s future.

Though Mr. Trump’s plan includes a vague reference to the Palestinian aspiration to statehood, it does not outline a pathway to establishing a state. The draft resolution adds no new language on that topic.

Also, the draft resolution, like the Trump plan, would sideline the Palestinian Authority, giving it no role in Gaza until it completes unspecified changes.

The stakes for the Palestinians are high. If adopted, the draft Security Council resolution, which was presented to elected members of the council on Wednesday, would effectively turn Mr. Trump’s peace plan into binding international law.

On Wednesday, Mr. Waltz hosted the Security Council’s 10 elected members at the United States mission to the U.N., to hear their concerns and seek their support for the resolution. That meeting, to which Mr. Waltz also invited representatives of Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, was described in detail by two security council members present at the meeting, and two officials briefed on it, who demanded anonymity to recount it.

According to the four officials, representatives of Pakistan, Denmark and Somalia asked for clarification of the role of the Palestinian Authority in the future of Gaza.

When the representative from Denmark asked about the Palestinian Authority’s role on the Board of Peace and on the technocratic governing committee, Mr. Waltz responded by suggesting answers could be found in the 20-point Trump plan.

A diplomat from Guyana asked Mr. Waltz whether members of the Security Council would know who would sit on the Board of Peace by the time the draft resolution was put to a vote. Mr. Waltz replied that he was uncertain whether the board's makeup would be known by then, but stressed the need to approve the measure anyway to prevent the collapse of the cease-fire.

Though Mr. Waltz was evasive in responding to questions from the group about the Palestinian Authority, he expressed confidence that the deployment of an international stabilization force would trigger a pullback of Israeli soldiers inside Gaza.

Diplomats from Slovenia and Algeria both raised the subject of accountability, noting that the draft resolution omitted any mention of a requirement that the Board of Peace report back to the Security Council. An Algerian diplomat suggested that this would hand the Board of Peace a blank check. Mr. Waltz promised to take those concerns into consideration.

To pass, nine of the 15 Security Council members would need to vote in favor of the draft resolution, and all five permanent members, including Russia and China, would have to support or not veto it.

Weeks ago, France advised the United States on what could be included in a resolution, according to a document seen by The Times, and verified by two U.S. officials, that detailed the French recommendation. It said that the resolution could endorse a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and underscore the goal of helping the Palestinian Authority take responsibility for security in Gaza.

Those suggestions were largely overlooked in the draft resolution shared with members this week. Some elements of France’s advice, however, were worked into the U.S. draft, including language requiring that the international stabilization force abide by international law.

Palestinian analysts speculated that the Americans’ refusal to clarify key parts of the draft resolution was intended to give them room to maneuver.

“The Americans want to control everything,” said Akram Atallah, a London-based analyst originally from the northern Gaza town of Jabaliya. “By keeping things vague, they can do what they want in the future.”

In his meetings this week, Mr. Waltz told his counterparts that the draft resolution had undergone 21 revisions in three weeks, four Security Council diplomats said. They said he stressed that time was not on the side of those pursuing peace in Gaza because the cease-fire was fragile.

That all-or-nothing approach drew criticism from Security Council members, including some Europeans, who said in interviews that the United States could not force its will on them. They added that the Security Council’s role was not to be a rubber stamp.

Still, others privately conceded that the Trump administration’s evident willingness to use levers like tariffs to get its way with other countries had made them leery of challenging the United States.

Approval of the draft resolution would be a significant diplomatic victory for the Trump administration at the United Nations.

The United States has been isolated within the Security Council and the 193-member General Assembly over its staunch support for Israel since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack that ignited the Gaza war. The United States, under both the Biden and Trump administrations, vetoed six Security Council resolutions demanding an immediate cease-fire.

Under the terms of the agreement, Cornell is expected to pay a $30 million fine to the government — a pledge that the president of a Cornell faculty rights group called a “bribe” — and to invest $30 million on programs designed to enhance efficiency and lower costs in agriculture and farming. A land-grant institution, Cornell is known for its agricultural research programs.

The government had been scrutinizing Cornell after accusations of racial discrimination and antisemitism. In April, Trump administration officials asserted that they intended to freeze more than $1 billion in research funding for the school. University officials said at the time that stop-work orders were trickling in but that they were struggling to understand how the administration had arrived at its figure.

By last month, when Cornell’s president, Michael Kotlikoff, delivered his State of the University address, officials were still puzzling over the number. At the end of September, Dr. Kotlikoff said, Cornell had accounted for “nearly $250 million in canceled or unpaid research funds.” Friday’s agreement, however, was expected to resolve the federal funding pauses, no matter the math.

In a statement released to the Cornell community on Friday, Dr. Kotlikoff expressed relief.

“The months of stop-work orders, grant terminations and funding freezes have stalled cutting-edge research, upended lives and careers, and threatened the future of academic programs at Cornell,” he said.

“With this resolution,” he added, “Cornell looks forward to resuming the long and fruitful partnership with the federal government that has yielded, for so many years, so much progress and well-being for our nation and our world.”

Dr. Kotlikoff had vowed not to sign an agreement that would permit the government to “dictate our institution’s policies.”

He got his wish: Cornell’s settlement included a provision declaring the university and the government both “affirm the importance of and their support for academic freedom.” It also said that no part of the settlement could be “construed as giving the United States authority to dictate the content of academic speech or curricula.”

Cornell, however, did agree to provide anonymized admissions data to the federal government through 2028, details the Trump administration has also required from other schools as it scrutinizes whether race is used as a factor in selective college admissions. Justice Department officials said the school will also provide discrimination training to faculty and staff members.

And Justice Department officials said the university would use the administration’s interpretation of a 2023 Supreme Court decision that ended explicit consideration of race in admissions to higher education as long as that guidance is “consistent with relevant judicial decisions.”

Attorney General Pam Bondi laid out in a memo in July how that ruling, along with federal civil rights law, should be applied to schools receiving federal funding.

The agreement, dated Friday, was hashed out last week at the White House following months of talks. It settles investigations of Cornell, as well as its law school, by several federal agencies. Under the arrangement, Cornell’s payments and investments of $60 million will be spread out over three years

As a part of the agreement, Cornell admitted no wrongdoing, and Dr. Kotlikoff said he would personally certify ongoing compliance with the deal, signing off on the veracity of admissions data submissions.

David A. Bateman, the president of Cornell’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors, said that provision was among many that worried him and other members. He said that the explicit steering of $30 million toward agriculture programs smacked of the federal government directing Cornell priorities.

And referring to the fine, he said, “There’s nothing good to say about the bribe, the $30 million bribe.”

Dr. Bateman said that although any agreement was “strategically unwise and a betrayal of Cornell’s principles,” Friday’s settlement was “not as bad as it could be.” He said he believed that months of campus pressure had positioned Cornell leaders to demand better terms, and that mounting backlash to the White House’s efforts had left the government with less negotiating power.

The Trump administration did not see it that way.

Linda McMahon, the education secretary, said the agreement showed that universities “are refocusing their attention on merit, rigor, and truth-seeking — not ideology.” And Harmeet K. Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, called the agreement groundbreaking and said that it will expand agricultural development and productivity.

The agricultural research planned by Cornell will involve the use of artificial intelligence and robotics in farming.

The White House’s attack on Cornell is part of a broader crusade targeting higher education, and particularly the Ivy League. Shortly after taking office, President Trump, who has characterized university leaders as “Marxist maniacs and lunatics,” cut off funding to try to force some campuses to comport with his political agenda.

The investigations of Cornell stemmed largely from a series of campus demonstrations over the Israel-Hamas war and demands by students for university divestment from weapons manufacturers that supplied the Israeli military. Ms. McMahon had accused the school of not doing enough to curb protests that had “severely disrupted campus life” and made Jewish students on campus fearful.

The protests included a March 2024 walkout, an encampment a month later and a disruption at a Statler Hotel on campus where students shut down a career fair that included booths from the arms manufacturers Boeing and L3Harris.

Strained by the funding cuts, which struck a significant blow to university research activities, universities have felt pressure to comply with at least some demands, although they have pushed back on others.

Cornell’s endowment was valued at nearly $12 billion at the end of June — a formidable sum, but one far smaller than many of the university’s Ivy League peers. And as the Trump administration pummeled the university, Cornell leaders made clear that the school was feeling extraordinary financial strain.

In June, university leaders warned that they anticipated layoffs and had begun what they described as “a comprehensive review of programs and head count across the university,” where the work force had climbed by more than 15 percent in about four years.

The suspension of federal funding turned that growth into a crisis.

“We have been using institutional resources to try to plug these funding holes in the short term, but these interim measures are not sustainable,” university leaders wrote. “We must immediately address our significant financial shortfalls by reducing costs and enacting permanent change to our operational model.”

Cornell joined broader lawsuits against funding cuts. But unlike Harvard University, it did not bring a stand-alone challenge to the government.

Of the schools that have struck deals with the government, Columbia University faced the most onerous terms, including a $200 million fine. Like Cornell, it secured an explicit pledge that the government would not use the agreement to dictate academic matters.

Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Virginia have also cut deals with the government. The Penn and Virginia settlements included no financial penalties, while Brown’s included a commitment for the university to spend $50 million on work force development programs.

The Trump administration has been in stop-and-start talks with other schools in recent months, most notably Harvard University. The University of California, from which the government has demanded more than $1 billion to settle claims of civil rights violations, has also been in negotiations with the government.

But a Justice Department lawyer told a federal judge on Thursday that there was “no evidence” that the California system was close to reaching an agreement with the Trump administration.

The legal wrangling concerned the immediate fate of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which helps roughly one in eight Americans purchase groceries. For weeks, the Trump administration has repeatedly refused to tap an ample reserve of federal funds that would sustain those benefits into November, while the federal government remains closed.

Even though President Trump has long claimed to possess vast powers over federal spending — and has frequently reprogrammed the budget to advance his agenda during the shutdown — he and his aides have maintained that they could not source all of the money to send full nutrition aid to the low-income families that receive them.

A coalition of cities, religious groups and nonprofits sued over that refusal, telling the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island last week that the administration had a legal and moral obligation to supply the necessary funds. Twice, Judge John J. McConnell Jr. agreed, and on Thursday, he directed the White House to tap two accounts at the Agriculture Department that would fund SNAP benefits in their entirety.

By Friday, the Justice Department forged ahead with an appeal, arguing there was no “lawful basis” to force the president to find money in the “metaphorical couch cushions.” But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit declined to impose a temporary halt to the judge’s order, known as an administrative stay, as it began to consider the merits of the government’s case.

Immediately, the Trump administration then urged the Supreme Court to intervene, and asked it to decide in a matter of hours, by 9:30 p.m. Friday. In a series of social media posts, Pam Bondi, the attorney general, denounced the court in Rhode Island and claimed that it could not “dictate its own preferences for how scarce federal funds should be spent.”

The developments on Friday once again created chaos and confusion for the millions of low-income Americans caught in the middle of a federal shutdown that has stretched into its sixth week, the longest in U.S. history. Some of these families have been without aid for days, according to local officials, as their states grappled with conflicting and complicated instructions about the availability of federal funds for SNAP.

Even before the appeals court could rule, some states had resumed provisioning full benefits anyway. They did so by instructing the vendors that manage SNAP to load money onto E.B.T. cards, which is how participants in the program buy groceries.

In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, announced on Friday that she had directed state agencies to ensure that the entire amount of SNAP benefits paid by the federal government would go to recipients this month. She said those funds should start to reach families by Sunday.

“I’m working tirelessly to bring this uncertainty to an end for the nearly three million New Yorkers who rely on this program,” the governor said in a statement.

The Agriculture Department had even issued guidance to states earlier in the day saying that it was preparing to release the funds necessary to restore low-income Americans’ aid, according to a copy viewed by The New York Times. By Friday night, though, it remained unclear if the agency still planned to process those payments, or what would happen if the Supreme Court ultimately approved the administration’s request.

The Agriculture Department declined to answer questions late Friday. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Skye Perryman, the president of Democracy Forward, the legal group that had represented suing cities and nonprofits, criticized the administration for trying again to “take food out of the hands of families, seniors, workers and children.”

“And every time they tried, the courts told them what the law already makes clear: They cannot,” she said in a statement.

Since the start of the shutdown, Democrats and Republicans alike had clamored for Mr. Trump to spare SNAP from any disruption. But the White House repeatedly claimed that it lacked the power to preserve food stamps, a program that the president has long targeted for spending cuts.

By its own admission, the government had tens of billions of dollars left over that it could use to sustain food stamps this month. That included a roughly $5 billion emergency reserve that was specifically enacted by Congress for SNAP, as well as a second pot of money at the Agriculture Department, totaling into the tens of billions and filled primarily with tariff revenue.

Together, those funds well exceeded what would be needed to finance the nutrition benefits. And the Trump administration had already tapped some of the tariff money to prevent interruptions to another federal nutrition program during the shutdown.

But the Trump administration at various points refused to take the same action with SNAP, prompting a series of lawsuits, including the challenge brought by local officials at the federal court in Rhode Island.

Initially, Judge McConnell gave the government discretion on whether to make partial or full payments in November, and the funding source from which it would source that aid. His order required the Trump administration to act quickly and make those payments by this week.

In the end, the Agriculture Department opted for partial funding for food stamps, and the way it devised those payments threatened to leave millions of families with no aid at all, or without benefits for weeks or months. Many states, which sued separately in a case awaiting a ruling in Massachusetts, described the conditions foisted onto the program as unnecessarily burdensome.

That prompted Judge McConnell on Thursday to require the government to tap additional funds to make payments in full. That, he said, would avert any cuts and delays, as he admonished the Trump administration for its actions.

“This should never happen in America,” the judge said during a tense but brief hearing.

“We’re looking at it,” Mr. Trump said of the exemption, “because it’s very difficult for him to get the oil and gas from other areas. As you know, they don’t have the advantage of having sea.”

The meeting had promised to be a mutual admiration summit between two heads of state who have found common ground on issues like immigration. The two leaders spoke of their longstanding support for each other, with Mr. Trump praising Mr. Orban as a great friend who was “beloved” in Hungary, and Mr. Orban calling for a “golden age” of relations with the United States.

But the U.S. sanctions imposed last month on Russia’s two largest energy companies over the war are a sticking point. Hungary gets much of its energy from Russia and Mr. Orban says that the penalties are threatening his country’s sluggish economy as he faces one of the toughest re-election battles of his career.

Mr. Trump has urged European countries to cut their purchases of Russian oil as a way to financially handicap Russia’s military campaign. But on Friday, Mr. Trump sought to draw a distinction between Hungary, which is landlocked and depends on pipelines for oil and gas, and other European countries, which have more seaports.

“It’s a great country, it’s a big country, but they don’t have sea,” he said. “They don’t have the ports, and so they have a difficult problem.”

Mr. Trump said other European countries have seaports but still import Russian oil and gas. “And as they know, I’m very disturbed by that,” he said.

The meeting with Mr. Trump was a test of Mr. Orban’s foreign policy prowess, something the Hungarian leader has tried to highlight as a strength in his campaign. He has openly sympathized with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and, like Mr. Trump, he has broken with much of Europe by calling for Ukraine to cede more land to Russia to secure a cease-fire.

On Friday, Mr. Orban said that his agenda for the meeting with Mr. Trump included economic and military issues, as well as political cooperation. But the main issue, he said, was the war in neighboring Ukraine.

“It’s a most important issue for us, and we would like to discuss with you how we can contribute to help you in your peace efforts,” Mr. Orban told Mr. Trump.

When Mr. Trump asked him later whether he believed Ukraine could win the war, Mr. Orban seemed doubtful. “Miracles can happen,” he replied.

The meeting comes as Mr. Trump’s efforts to broker an end to the war in Ukraine appear to have stalled. Mr. Trump has all but washed his hands of the conflict, and on Friday, before meeting with Mr. Orban, the president continued to offer vague assessments of how and when the conflict might end.

“I think we agree that the war is going to end,” Mr. Trump said. “Sometimes people have to fight it out a little bit longer. But I think we agree that the war is going to end in the not too distant future.”

Mr. Putin, however, has shown no signs of stopping the three-year-old invasion, and this week Russia appeared to be close to capturing Pokrovsk, a strategically important railroad hub in eastern Ukraine.

Days before the U.S. sanctions were announced, Mr. Trump reversed course on a proposed summit with Mr. Putin that would have been held in Budapest. Mr. Trump said he canceled the meeting because he said he didn’t believe Mr. Putin wanted to stop the war, a position he reiterated on Friday.

But asked on Friday if there was a chance the meeting with Mr. Putin in Budapest could still happen, he said: “There’s always a chance.”

Mr. Trump has removed some of the sanctions that the Biden administration imposed on Hungary, largely to punish Mr. Orban for democratic backsliding, though other restrictions remain, including a suspension of the personal income tax treaty between the two countries.

Heading into the meeting, Mr. Orban appeared to be most worried about U.S. sanctions on countries that buy Russian oil. Hungary imports 86 percent of its oil from Russia, an amount that has increased since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, according to the Atlantic Council research group in Washington.

Without an exemption, Hungary could face secondary sanctions from the United States that could result in fines or being cut off from American financial institutions. Hungary, a member of the European Union and is Mr. Putin’s closest ally in the bloc, is already exempted from E.U. sanctions on Russian crude oil exports.

To get out from under the U.S. sanctions, Mr. Orban might have to bend on another issue: E.U. membership for Ukraine.

Mr. Trump wants Europe to shoulder the bulk of Western assistance to Ukraine. The European Union has agreed to open membership negotiations with Ukraine, which would help Kyiv stabilize the country’s economy.

But Mr. Orban opposes Ukraine joining the bloc, and he said this week on social media that such a move would “bring the war into Europe.”

In recent years, Mr. Orban, an ally of Mr. Putin, has defied most of Europe and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization by refusing to endorse sending military support or E.U. financial aid to Ukraine. But in some cases, he has also avoided outright vetoing aid.

James Batchik, an associate director of the Atlantic Council’s Europe Center, said in an analysis published this week that Mr. Orban’s unwillingness to clear the way on Ukraine’s accession to the European Union runs directly counter to Mr. Trump’s demands that Europe do more.

“Despite Trump’s chumminess with Orban, he has been the roadblock to the action the United States is demanding from Europe,” he wrote, adding that the sanctions mean “Trump has leverage.”

Public records experts say the new record-keeping policy opens ample room for both willful and unwitting noncompliance with federal open records laws in an administration that has already shown a lack of interest in, or willingness to skirt, records laws. That development could be particularly troubling as the department executes President Trump’s aggressive agenda of mass deportations, a campaign that has included numerous accusations of misconduct by law enforcement officials, the experts said.

“If you are an immigration official or an agent and believe that the public might later criticize you, or that your records could help you be held accountable, would you go out of the way to preserve those records that might expose wrongdoing?” said Lauren Harper, who advocates government transparency at the Freedom of the Press Foundation.

The Department of Homeland Security includes key immigration agencies such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection. The department did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday. But on Friday, after publication of this article, it said in an emailed statement that the application the agency had stopped using “was not the exclusive means of preserving text data,” but did not elaborate on why it had opted for manual record-keeping.

The department has maintained and will continue to maintain records of phone data, including text messages, the statement added, reiterating what department officials had said in a court statement filed on Wednesday.

Still, experts expressed skepticism that the new policy of manual compliance by individual officials could be effective or was designed in good faith.

The policy expects officials to first take screenshots of the text messages on their work phones, send it to their work email, download it on their work computers and then run a program that would recognize the text to store it in searchable formats, according to the department’s guidance submitted to the court.

Under the Federal Records Act, government agencies are required to preserve all documentation that officials and federal workers produce while executing their duties. They have to make federal records available to the public under the Freedom of Information Act unless they fall under certain exemptions.

The new policy was revealed as part of the lawsuit surrounding the department’s unusual response to public records requests filed by American Oversight, a nonprofit watchdog group.

The agency rebuffed a request for public records related to the National Guard deployment in Los Angeles this summer and to the migrant detention camp in the Everglades known as Alligator Alcatraz. The agency said it had not maintained text message data among top officials since early April.

But department officials, in sworn court statements, said those responses were provided “mistakenly.” They explained that public information officers had erroneously concluded that the agency lacked the ability to locate responsive records, without searching for manual screenshots. Those became the department’s official record-keeping practice for text messages since April 9.

The department is now searching for records that American Oversight has requested. But it failed to meet a deadline to respond to an inquiry from the National Archives on records compliance, according to the court filing. The department cited the government shutdown for delays.

Chioma Chukwu, the executive director of American Oversight, said compliance with federal records laws could be best achieved with a centralized system that allows transparent practices.

“Anytime you are relying on humans to manually archive information, there’s always room for error,” Ms. Chukwu said.

The change in the agency’s record retention policy since early April came after defense and national security officials were mired in an explosive scandal in March for communicating sensitive details of U.S. airstrike plans in Yemen on Signal, a private messaging app. Its users can set messages to disappear after a set time period; the chat group was exposed after a journalist was inadvertently added to the conversation.

Ms. Chukwu said that investigations and lawsuits that followed the Signal controversy showed that the administration officials had frequently used the messenger app’s auto-delete feature.

In May, more than a month after the department opted for the manual screenshot practice, the cybersecurity agency within the Homeland Security Department publicly warned that the application that allowed automated capture of texts, TeleMessage, could be vulnerable to malicious hacking.

But experts in federal public records requirements said such valid security concerns did not exempt the administration from adopting a record-keeping practice or new software that ensures full compliance with the law.

“Regardless of motive, in reverting to a policy of manual archiving of messages about government business, D.H.S. has increased its risk of noncompliance with its obligations to preserve important federal records,” said Jason R. Baron, a former director of litigation at the National Archives, referring to the Department of Homeland Security.

Ms. Harper said a screenshot of text messages was an inadequate means to preserve communication chains of official government business, even if the administration manages to preserve all relevant messages, as the law requires “a complete copy” to be preserved, including links and attachments.

The new policy “drastically increases the likelihood the agency isn’t complying with the Federal Records Act,” she said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/01/multimedia/07trump-news-promo8p/01nat-snap-jchv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 21:04:03.226640

The footage, obtained by the Boston Globe, shows a frantic commotion inside a vehicle in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, on Thursday. A desperate woman in the passenger seat tries to awaken the man in the driver’s seat, with a crying child in the middle. People can be heard shouting: “He’s having a seizure.” An officer can be seen trying to pull the passengers from the vehicle, while a Fitchburg police officer orders the crowd to “back up” repeatedly.

“They’re trying to rip the baby out of [his] hand,” another bystander says.

ICE said the video did not accurately represent the situation. Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary at the US Department of Homeland Security, said on social media that emergency medical personnel at the scene “found no legitimate medical episode” and the family refused medical care. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in a statement on social media wrote: “Imagine FAKING a seizure to help a criminal escape justice.”

Carlos Sebastian Zapata, the man in the video, told the Boston Globe on Friday that he fell unconscious as he feared his wife would be taken into custody. “I wasn’t letting go of my wife because they wanted to take her away,” Zapata told the newspaper.

He said agents pushed him during the attempted arrest, hit him around his ribs and pressed on his neck. “And that’s when I let go of my wife,” Zapata said. “I had convulsions or something.”

ICE confirmed that the operation had been focused on the man’s wife, who was accompanying him at the time. She was identified as Juliana Milena Ojeda-Montoya from Ecuador, and was taken into custody on Thursday.

Officials said Ojeda-Montoya had a warrant out for her arrest after she was charged by local authorities with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon after allegedly stabbing a co-worker and throwing a trash barrel at her.

ICE agents reportedly conducted a traffic stop of the family at 7.00am, and it evolved into an “attempted apprehension”. Agents contacted Fitchburg police around 8.03am, reporting that a growing crowd was posing a threat to the agents.

According to police statements to Boston.com, an officer, a supervisor and a captain were sent to the scene and “confirmed that a crowd was gathering and that the situation was hostile”.

The incident occurred amid Trump’s intensified deportation campaign, which included a large-scale enforcement effort in September known as Operation Patriot 2.0 in Massachusetts. That operation led to the detention of more than 1,400 people in the state for immigration-related reasons.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/017c6ccbe323e46bfd5ad61cdd64062a364217a7/450_0_7200_5760/master/7200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3a1f94413eddc76585dd27c9bd06079f",N,,2025-11-07 21:04:27.293867

TOP TALKER

In a dramatic courtroom moment, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis opened her ruling Thursday not with legal citations, but with Carl Sandburg’s famous ode to Chicago — the “City of the Big Shoulders.” She read aloud the lines challenging those who would “sneer” at a city “so proud to be alive and coarse and strong and cunning.”

That Chicago — alive, flawed and defiant — is the one Ellis said she sees from her bench. And with that spirit she issued a sweeping injunction restricting the federal government’s use of force during “Operation Midway Blitz,” the Trump administration’s controversial immigration crackdown.

That gripping coverage comes from the Sun-Times’ Jon Seidel and the Tribune’s Jason Meisner, who documented the testimony and Ellis’ ruling:

“The use of force shocks the conscience,” the judge declared, calling the government’s evidence “simply not credible.” What she’s witnessed over the last six weeks, the judge said, is a campaign that has “shown no signs of stopping,” marked by citizens being tear-gassed “indiscriminately,” struck by pepper-spray balls, and tackled in the street.

Her 90-minute ruling replaces last month’s temporary restraining order with a more permanent injunction that will remain in place until the broader lawsuit is resolved. The order bars agents from using “riot control weapons” on peaceful protesters or journalists without issuing two warnings. It also bans “chokeholds” and similar neck restraints except when “objectively necessary to stop an immediate threat” and mandates that agents display badge numbers “conspicuously in two separate places.”

Ellis also ordered that agents wear body cameras and avoid interfering with members of the press “in most circumstances.” The judge said these limits were not anti-law-enforcement but essential to “a government that conducts itself fairly and according to its own stated regulations and policies.”

Her written order is here.

About the case: It was brought by a coalition of journalists and civil rights groups, who recounted harrowing scenes: a pastor hit in the head with pepper balls while praying, a woman facing a gun for filming an arrest and others who were followed or harassed after criticizing agents online.

According to the Tribune and Sun-Times: Ellis didn’t hide her frustration with testimony from federal officials, particularly U.S. Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino, who she said “admitted that he lied about whether a rock hit him before he deployed tear gas in Little Village.” Video played in court showed Bovino tackling a protester despite claiming under oath that he “never used force.” Another agent, Kristopher Hewson, insisted he yelled “get ’em” at protesters — but Ellis said the footage clearly showed otherwise. “What he said,” she told the court, “was ‘hit them.’”

The government’s defense crumbled further when it failed to produce evidence of the violence it claimed — despite hundreds of hours of submitted footage. “The [Trump administration] would have people believe that the Chicagoland area is in a vice hold of violence, ransacked by rioters and attacked by agitators.” That, she said, “simply is untrue.”

The Department of Homeland Security blasted the injunction as “an extreme act by an activist judge that risks the lives and livelihoods of law enforcement officers,” according to a statement to Playbook. DHS vowed to appeal, arguing that agents had faced “rioters, gangbangers, and terrorists.”

Attorneys for the plaintiffs said Ellis’ ruling was a crucial check on unchecked power. “We have seen democracy in action, and there is nothing that can stop it,” lead attorney Steve Art told reporters after the hearing.

Ellis ended her ruling by quoting John Adams — “Liberty once lost is lost forever” — and Benjamin Franklin’s reminder that free speech is “a principal pillar in a free government.”

THE BUZZ

ELECTION OPTIMISM: Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson is riding a wave of optimism after fellow progressive Zohran Mamdani’s victory in New York City, viewing it as both validation and motivation for his agenda to tax the wealthy to fund social investments. Mamdani has made a similar proposal.

This week’s elections demonstrate that progressives, Democratic socialists and more moderate Democrats can unite around one core issue: “working people,” he told reporters Thursday during his weekly briefing at City Hall.

The mayor is channeling that post-election momentum into defending his $16.6 billion spending plan, even after S&P Global Ratings downgraded Chicago’s outlook from “stable” to “negative” following his decision to reduce the city’s advance pension payment from $271.8 million to $120.2 million. Johnson maintains that the budget remains “very sound.” WTTW’s Heather Cherone has more.

“I know there have been questions around pensions,” Johnson said at City Hall, noting that Chicago no longer has the pension advance fund established under former Mayor Lori Lightfoot. “However, we still were able, even in these very difficult, tumultuous times, to put forth an advanced payment while not cutting services.”

At the heart of Johnson’s plan is a proposal to reinstate a corporate head tax — $21 per month per employee at companies with more than 100 workers — projected to generate $100 million to replace expiring federal funds for violence prevention and community safety programs.

“If you’ve never had to choose between lunch for your children or rent, you may not fully understand the impetus behind this budget,” Johnson said, describing the tax as a modest ask of large corporations. “We have a very clear structural challenge within the city’s finances.”

Business groups have largely opposed the head tax — companies like McDonald’s — and some City Council members have labeled it a “job killer.”

A new survey offers a glimpse of how some Chicago voters feel about the mayor’s proposed budget (opposing it) — and what action they might take if their alderman supports it. In an effort to persuade the City Council to reject the plan, One Future Illinois commissioned nine ward-by-ward surveys conducted by Change Research. One Future Illinois is the same organization that led the opposition to the mayor’s real estate transfer tax proposal last year. The full polling memo is here.

Johnson insists residents are on his side. “Do they believe the ultra-wealthy and big corporations should pay their fair share in taxes? Chicagoans overwhelmingly agree with me,” he said.

“Certain medical conditions — including, but not limited to, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, cancers, diabetes, metabolic diseases, neurological diseases, and mental health conditions — can require hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of care,” the cable states.
It comes amid a broader Trump administration campaign to dissuade immigrants from coming to the U.S. “It’s no secret the Trump administration is putting the interests of the American people first.
A State Department official stressed to The Hill that the decision to issue a visa has always been at the discretion of an officer.
Public charge policies were shifted under the first Trump administration, greatly expanding who would be considered a public charge.","Applicants for immigrant visas to the U.S. could be rejected if they have certain medical conditions under a new State Department directive, the agency confirmed.

The policy would allow officers to deny visas to immigrants deemed more likely to rely on public benefits should they have medical issues.

Sent to State Department employees through an internal cable, the guidance instructed officers to consider both an applicant’s health and overall financial picture when determining whether to issue a visa.

“Certain medical conditions — including, but not limited to, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, cancers, diabetes, metabolic diseases, neurological diseases, and mental health conditions — can require hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of care,” the cable states.

“Does the applicant have adequate financial resources to cover the costs of such care over his entire expected lifespan without seeking public cash assistance or long-term institutionalization at government expense?”

The directive appears to resurrect the “public charge” rule from the first Trump administration that sought to deny green cards to any immigrant who received at least one designated public benefit — including Medicaid, nutrition asistance, welfare or public housing vouchers — for more than 12 months within any three-year period.

Fox News first reported the development.

It comes amid a broader Trump administration campaign to dissuade immigrants from coming to the U.S.

“It’s no secret the Trump administration is putting the interests of the American people first. This includes enforcing policies that ensure our immigration system is not a burden on the American taxpayer,” principal deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott said in a statement.

A medical examination is mandatory for all people outside the U.S. applying for an immigrant visa and all refugees coming to the United States. The new directive takes it further.

The cable directs officers to develop “their own thoughts about what could lead to some sort of medical emergency or sort of medical costs in the future.”

State Department officers don’t have medical training but are asked to weigh a variety of factors when determining whether to issue a visa, including finances and the likelihood those on a travel visa will return to their home country, as well as make judgments about any flags that come up during a criminal background check.

Still, the measure opens the door to a number of refusals, given the widespread nature of some listed conditions.

About 10 percent of the world has diabetes, and according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 40 percent of Americans are obese. According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally.

A State Department official stressed to The Hill that the decision to issue a visa has always been at the discretion of an officer.

Officers aren’t being instructed to reject an applicant because they have a certain medical condition, they said, but rather consider the “overall impact” if someone would be unlikely to be able to pay for their own medical care.

“It’s addressed on an individual, case-by-case basis,” the official said.

They gave the example of a diabetic, adding that they would not face rejection because they need insulin, but could be rejected if Medicaid would be needed to cover the drug.

Public charge policies were shifted under the first Trump administration, greatly expanding who would be considered a public charge. Previously, the term only applied to those primarily reliant on the government through cash assistance.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/AP25129717207488-e1752596752686.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-07 21:04:11.246770

Judge Carter has ordered that Mr. Chalco-Beltran not be removed from the country or the Southern District, in order to preserve the court’s jurisdiction.
It’s unclear whether Mr. Chalco-Beltran was charged with or convicted of a crime after entering the country.
Under Mr. Trump, immigrants facing deportation are generally held without bond for the duration of their legal proceedings, breaking with longstanding practice.","A blind Ecuadorean man has been held since Tuesday in a Manhattan lockup without access to a lawyer or any help challenging his detention, according to a petition filed by his sister this week in Manhattan federal court.

The petition, by Eva Magdalena Chalco Chango, who represents herself, accuses the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency of arresting the man, Carlos Anibal Chalco-Beltran, 40, as he left his home on Tuesday and walked to work. It came nearly three years after he was released by an immigration judge to await further proceedings.

Mr. Chalco-Beltran, who had applied for asylum, was placed in a holding cell at 26 Federal Plaza, site of the ICE offices in Lower Manhattan, according to the court filing, which seeks his release. Following reports about overcrowded conditions, a state judge in August ordered ICE to improve the conditions in those holding cells and mandated that detainees be able to make calls to their lawyers.

Mr. Chalco-Beltran is being held with his son, who was also arrested by ICE, and the agency was trying to ensure that the two continue to be held together, a government lawyer told a federal judge, Andrew L. Carter Jr., during a telephone hearing late Friday afternoon.

The judge ordered that Mr. Chalco-Beltran be appointed a pro bono lawyer, and pressed the federal government to provide him with documents that were in Spanish — and Braille.

As ICE arrests have filled up detention centers, the agency has come under scrutiny over how it provides basic medical care and accommodations for detainees with disabilities. The conditions have led to litigation from civil rights groups, reports of medical neglect and congressional scrutiny.

Mr. Chalco-Beltran’s case also underscores the strict approach the Trump administration has taken to detaining migrants who entered the United States during the Biden administration, and had previously been allowed to contest their deportation while living in the community.

In her petition to the court, Ms. Chalco Chango says she has been a caretaker for her brother throughout her life. The petition also includes a document from the New York State Commission for the Blind verifying his disability. The petition did not say whether Mr. Chalco-Beltran’s blindness required special accommodations that he lacks, or describe how he coped in the holding cells of the lockup.

Ms. Chalco Chango said in the filing that the room where her brother was being held does not provide access to paper, a law library or advice to detainees on how to challenge their detentions.

Judge Carter has ordered that Mr. Chalco-Beltran not be removed from the country or the Southern District, in order to preserve the court’s jurisdiction.

The office of Jay Clayton, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District, wrote to the judge on Thursday, saying that Mr. Chalco-Beltran remains at 26 Federal Plaza pending arrangements for his transfer to the Orange County Jail in Goshen, N.Y., which is ICE’s only detention facility within the Southern District.

The petition by Ms. Chalco Chango says that her brother was forced to flee his homeland because of threats on his life, and that he sought asylum in the United States after he entered the country near Roma, Texas, on Jan. 18, 2023.

The Department of Homeland Security, the parent agency of ICE, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Many migrants like Mr. Chalco-Beltran have been detained by the Trump administration, which has been seeking to hold immigrants in detention indefinitely, even those who previously were found not to be dangerous or a flight risk.

For decades, immigration judges granted bond to detained immigrants who were not perceived as public safety threats, allowing them to live in their communities and attend hearings while deportation cases wound through the courts. It’s unclear whether Mr. Chalco-Beltran was charged with or convicted of a crime after entering the country.

Under Mr. Trump, immigrants facing deportation are generally held without bond for the duration of their legal proceedings, breaking with longstanding practice.

Detention centers have filled up with tens of thousands of immigrants who typically do not have access to lawyers. Unlike in criminal courts, people detained by ICE do not have a constitutional right to a government-funded attorney in immigration court.

That can make it easier for the federal government to deport someone: Studies have found that detainees without lawyers are less likely to obtain relief or protection, and are more likely to be ordered removed from the country.

As prolonged detentions have piled up, efforts to release migrants from detention have spilled over into the federal district courts, where they can file so-called habeas corpus petitions.

Over the past few months, immigration lawyers in New York have said that they had noticed a spike in the number of detained immigrants filing habeas corpus petitions without a lawyer, usually with the help of relatives or community organizers.

AMY GOODMAN: So, that was Peter Weiss. Peter Kornbluh, you knew him well.

PETER KORNBLUH: That was the beautiful and conscientious and activist Peter Weiss. He never ceased to push for a more just system, a more equitable system, along with his extraordinary wife Cora Weiss. They were the supporters of so many of the progressive institutions that we know today, including the Center for Constitutional Rights, which did so much incredible legal work on human rights and on trying to hold the U.S. government accountable for the atrocities that it committed around the world.

There’s not enough words to describe how important Peter was to the progressive movement, to human rights over these last decades, since the late '50s, early 1960s. And it's sad to say goodbye to him, but we all continue to be inspired and guided by every deed, good deed, that he did over his entire life.

AMY GOODMAN: Peter Kornbluh, I want to thank you for being with us, senior analyst at the National Security Archive. We’ll link to your pieces in Foreign Policy and The Nation.

That does it for our show. I’ll be at the St. Louis International Film Festival tonight for two screenings of Steal This Story, Please!, a documentary about Democracy Now! I’ll be 7:30 at B&B Theatres in Creve Coeur West Olive 10 and Bowling, and at 9:00, the second showing of Steal This Story, Please!, at MX Movies and Bar.

From downtown businesses to retail corridors in Latino neighborhoods, the economic repercussions of the Trump administration's ICE enforcement has brought together a diverse group of business and civic leaders.

""The point is to shock and to scare not to enforce immigration laws,"" Chicago CRED Founder and Former Education Secretary Arne Duncan said. ""It is an attempt to create learned helplessness in our communities.""

In an attempt to help, Duncan brought together the group called United for Chicago.

""We know the president listens to business leaders,"" said Rebecca Shi, CEO of the American Business Immigration Coalition. ""He's extremely motivated by what the business community has to say. And so this is just to start, and businesses are making their voices heard.""

Shi calls Operation Midway Blitz economically reckless. She says revenues for some businesses have gone down by 50%.

""Immigrants, along with undocumented immigrants, contribute $22 billion in taxes and local spending every year,"" Shi said. ""They're not just part of our economy. They drive it.""

Shi says removing landscapers, restaurant workers, day care workers and so on is already driving up consumer prices.

""No one, Republican, Democrat or Independent voted for this,"" Former President & CEO of the Illinois Chamber of Commerce Lou Sandoval said.

All but six of them spoke against the program, describing ICE’s actions with words like “kidnapping,” “dangerous,” and “racial profiling,” with one person saying a partnership would “sell the soul of the city.” Notably, the speakers came from all 14 City Council districts.
“Call times would skyrocket.” He said he’d also likely need more overtime hours to account for the loss of officers working with ICE.
All of this should have served as an indicator of how the day would go for the two unlucky ICE officers sent to answer the Council’s questions.
In fact, the ICE people weren’t even sure Dallas would get $25 million.","It was the meeting that only one person wanted, and he wasn’t in attendance. After Dallas Police Chief Daniel Comeaux told the Citizen Police Oversight Board last month that he had turned down $25 million to partner with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Mayor Eric Johnson fired off a memo directing two City Council committees to meet jointly and reconsider ICE’s offer. The mayor, it seems, was rather bullish on the city’s police officers taking on the task of federal immigration enforcement.

“Clearly,” Johnson wrote, “participation in ICE’s Task Force Mode could provide significant financial benefits to the city.” But more importantly, he said, “This program could act as a ‘force multiplier,’ providing a path for the Dallas Police Department to deploy additional resources to reduce violent crime at lower cost to taxpayers.”

But despite his insistence that the Council should consider the matter, the Mayor of Somewhere Else was … somewhere else on Thursday. In his absence, 12 members of the Council performed the rare feat of doing both nothing (because the decision was Comeaux’s to make and didn’t require their approval) and doing something remarkable by nearly unanimously agreeing that Dallas will not be a city that buddies up with ICE.

Yesterday, before the Council questioned Comeaux and two ICE representatives, 74 speakers had signed up to share their views on the possibility of the city working with ICE. All but six of them spoke against the program, describing ICE’s actions with words like “kidnapping,” “dangerous,” and “racial profiling,” with one person saying a partnership would “sell the soul of the city.” Notably, the speakers came from all 14 City Council districts.

The comments continued until nearly noon, and then the Council’s questions allowed Comeaux to lay out his understanding of his job, his conversations with ICE officials, and why he concluded that 287(g), as it’s called, “is not the program for us” and “would not help us in any kind of way.” He had discussed it with his bosses in the city manager’s office (including City Manager Kimberly Bizor Tolbert and Chief of Public Safety Dominique Artis), several other law enforcement officials, and his own executive team. In short, he realized that the money wasn’t a guarantee, that his officers involved in the program would need to meet a daily quota of immigration arrests for the city to be reimbursed, and that he would likely need to devote 250 officers to the effort. “You take 250 officers from patrol, it would hurt us really bad,” he said. “Call times would skyrocket.” He said he’d also likely need more overtime hours to account for the loss of officers working with ICE.

“You have a really good police department here,” he concluded. Violent crime continues to decline, while the number of outstanding felony warrant arrests is on the rise. The department is making progress in reducing response times. His officers, he said, are earning the trust of the communities they serve, which would be eroded if Black and Brown residents felt that any cop they saw could actually be working for ICE.

Council members seemed to understand Comeaux’s decision and asked friendly questions designed to give him a chance to explain himself. Councilmember Cara Mendelsohn, who chairs the Public Safety Committee, did question whether there needs to be a policy that requires certain big-ticket opportunities to go before the Council, but by and large, Comeaux presented information to a horseshoe that was in his corner.

Latino members of the Council, including Jaime Resendez, Laura Cadena, and Mayor Pro Tem Jesse Moreno, talked about the impact that immigration enforcement has had on their lives. Resendez spoke about his mother and father, who were formerly undocumented residents. Cadena talked about her grandmother in Laredo, who was terrified of the immigration enforcement that focused on Black and Brown people when she was a child. “Just because I wear a suit,” Moreno said, didn’t mean he’d be protected from being profiled by ICE agents today.

All of this should have served as an indicator of how the day would go for the two unlucky ICE officers sent to answer the Council’s questions. At first, they introduced themselves only by their last names—Officer Francis and Officer Ivey. (When pressed later, Ivey did provide her full name—Fern Ivy, a 287(g) program manager with the agency.) The two had been provided (as had Comeaux) a list of questions in advance. Unlike Comeaux, they were not at all prepared to answer any additional questions.

Both often gave contradictory answers to questions based on Comeaux’s explanation of his conversations with ICE. When this was pointed out, they explained that they were from the Dallas Field Office and were not privy to the conversations Comeaux had with officials higher up. If the Council wanted answers and explanations about how much money was on the line, that was really no clearer after Thursday’s meeting.

Other things they didn’t know or could’t explain to the Council’s satisfaction: the length of time it takes to train a police officer for ICE duties, whether there is a quota, what constitutes probable cause, whether immigrants have rights, whether the federal government would indemnify the city against any civil rights lawsuits, and various aspects of the U.S. Constitution. In fact, the ICE people weren’t even sure Dallas would get $25 million. At times, Francis would tell the Council that he couldn’t answer their questions, only for a member to find the answer in an internet search moments later.

All of this visibly frustrated several on the Council and led to this testy exchange between Councilmember Adam Bazaldua and Francis:

“Can you tell me what the 4th Amendment is?”

“I’m not prepared to …”

“How about our 14th Amendment?”

“Where are you from, sir?” Bazaldua said before Francis responded, shifting gears. (Francis spoke with an obvious accent.) Francis began to stammer an answer, but Bazaldua continued: “I think you were afforded due process …” Council members complained that the line of questioning was not appropriate. “I think there’s some irony here,” Bazaldua said. He later apologized if his line of questioning made people uncomfortable but said, “That’s exactly what we’re asking our officers to do” to residents of Dallas.

After a few rounds of questions, the Council didn’t detain Francis and Ivey any longer. The Council batted cleanup, with each member taking time to explain his or her reservations about the whole thing.

And there were a lot of reservations. Moreno said ICE “failed to convince” him. Resendez castigated the mayor for being “reckless” and pitting the Council against law enforcement. “Chief Comeaux made the right call,” he said. Moreno said his discussions with residents and police officers indicate that the city doesn’t want this, and he worries that the city will actually lose officers at a time when it can ill afford to do so. Councilmember Maxie Johnson said that he felt ICE’s responses were “a bit disingenuous.” He added that it’s “hard for me to support any organization that rips apart homes based on skin color. I know what it means to be racially profiled.” And twice he offered a phrase that he said is often used when he’s playing dominoes: “All money ain’t good money.”

Even Mendelsohn said the irrefutable fact that working with ICE would take officers off the street gave her pause. “We cannot afford not to have every officer on the street,” she said.

In the end, even though a vote wasn’t necessary, the Council did agree to postpone any vote on a recommendation indefinitely. If nothing else, Bazaldua said, it would mean the discussion “ends here.”

Mayor Johnson did something remarkable Thursday: he provided a platform for a citizen from every single district in Dallas and nearly every single member of the City Council to speak at length about what they thought of ICE and his “force multiplier.” There was something magical about yesterday. The guy who has struggled to create a reliable coalition on the horseshoe finally whipped the body into a resounding, unified “No.”",https://assets.dmagstatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/NOKINGS101825janik051.webp,N,,2025-11-07 17:57:02.429498

But Republicans quickly said no, and Thune reiterated that they would not trade offers on health care until the government is reopened.
“We’re back to square one,” said Sen. John Kennedy, adding that he could not predict when the shutdown will end.
Or do they vote to reopen the government and hope for the best as Republicans promise an eventual health care vote, but not a guaranteed outcome?
“I’m not promising anybody anything,” Johnson said Thursday when asked if he could promise a vote on a health care bill.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Majority Leader John Thune quickly swatted down a Democratic offer to reopen the government and extend expiring health care subsidies for a year, calling it a “nonstarter” as the partisan impasse over the shutdown continued into its 38th day.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer made the offer to reopen the government on Friday as Republicans have refused to negotiate on demands to extend health care subsidies. It was a much narrowed version of a broad proposal Democrats laid out a month ago to make the health tax credits permanent and reverse Medicaid cuts that Republicans enacted earlier this year.

Schumer offered Republicans simultaneous votes to end the government shutdown and extend the expiring health care subsidies, along with a bipartisan committee to address Republican demands for changes to the Affordable Care Act.

“All Republicans have to do is say yes,” Schumer said.

But Republicans quickly said no, and Thune reiterated that they would not trade offers on health care until the government is reopened. “That’s what we’re going to negotiate once the government opens up,” Thune said after Schumer made his proposal on the floor.

Thune said he thinks the offer is an indication that Democrats are “feeling the heat.”

“I guess you could characterize that as progress,” he said. “But I just don’t think it gets anywhere close to what we need to do here.”

Republicans met Friday afternoon with no resolution about steps forward.

“We’re back to square one,” said Sen. John Kennedy, adding that he could not predict when the shutdown will end.

Despite the stalemate, lawmakers in both parties were feeling increased urgency to reopen the government as airlines were forced to cut more than 1,000 flights, government workers remained unpaid and food aid was delayed for millions of people. Thune pleaded with Democrats as he opened the Senate on Friday to “end these weeks of misery.”

It was unclear what may happen next. Thune was keeping the Senate in session over the weekend as a group of moderate Democrats worked on a possible compromise proposal. President Donald Trump called on the Senate to stay in town “until they have a Deal to end the Democrat Shutdown.”

Moderates continue to negotiate

As leaders of the two parties disagreed, the small group of Democrats led by New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen continued to negotiate among themselves and with rank-and-file Republicans on a deal that would end the shutdown.

The group has been discussing for weeks a vote for a series of bills that would pay for parts of government — food aid, veterans programs and the legislative branch, among other things — and extend funding for everything else until December or January. The three annual spending bills that would likely be included are the product of bipartisan negotiations that have continued through the shutdown.

But the contours of that agreement would only come with the promise of a future health care vote, rather than a guarantee that Affordable Care Act subsidies are extended by the end of the year. Many Democrats have said that’s unacceptable.

Still, Republican leaders only need five additional votes to fund the government, and the group involved in the talks has ranged from 10 to 12 Democratic senators.

“Unfortunately the Republicans made it very clear that they were not going to go along with the offer that Senator Schumer put on the floor, so we need another path forward,” Shaheen said Friday evening as she left a meeting with the other moderates. “We’re working on it.”

Republicans eye new package of bills

Trump urged Republicans at a White House breakfast Wednesday to end the shutdown quickly and scrap the legislative filibuster, which requires 60 Senate votes for most legislation, so they can bypass Democrats altogether.

“I am totally in favor of terminating the filibuster, and we would be back to work within 10 minutes after that vote took place,” Trump said Friday.

Republicans have emphatically rejected Trump’s call, and Thune has instead been eyeing a bipartisan package that mirrors the proposal the moderate Democrats have been sketching out. But it unclear what Thune, who has refused to negotiate, would promise on health care.

The package would replace the House-passed legislation that the Democrats have now rejected fourteen times. That bill would only extend government funding until Nov. 21, a date that is rapidly approaching after six weeks of inaction.

A choice for Democrats

A test vote on new legislation could come in the next few days if Thune decides to move forward.

Then Democrats would have a crucial choice to make: Do they keep fighting for a meaningful deal on extending the subsidies that expire in January, while prolonging the pain of the shutdown? Or do they vote to reopen the government and hope for the best as Republicans promise an eventual health care vote, but not a guaranteed outcome?

After a caucus meeting Thursday, most Democrats suggested they would continue to hold out for Trump and Republican leaders to agree to negotiations.

“That’s what leaders do,” said Sen. Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M. “You have the gavel, you have the majority, you have to bring people together.”

Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, said Democrats are “obviously not unanimous” but “without something on health care, the vote is very unlikely to succeed.”

Johnson delivers setback to bipartisan talks

Democrats are facing pressure from unions eager for the shutdown to end and from allied groups that want them to hold firm. Many Democrats have argued that the wins for Democrats on Election Day show voters want them to continue the fight until Republicans yield and agree to extend the health tax credits.

A vote on the health care subsidies “has got to mean something,” said Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats. “That means a commitment by the speaker of the House, that he will support the legislation, that the president will sign.”

But Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., made clear he will not make any commitments. “I’m not promising anybody anything,” Johnson said Thursday when asked if he could promise a vote on a health care bill.

Asylum Fee Notice

On October 30, 2025, a federal courtissued a temporary stay in Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project v. USCIS, halting implementation of the Annual Asylum Fee (AAF). As a result, USCIS has paused all related payment notices and instructions.

About the Asylum Fee

The AAF was introduced under theHR-1 Reconciliation Bill and outlined in a July 2025 Federal Register Notice. It would have applied to individuals with pending Form I-589 asylum applications for a full fiscal year. USCIS began issuing payment notices in early October, but those notices are now on hold.

Applicants who received AAF instructions should disregard them while the stay remains in effect. USCIS will not issue refunds for fees already paid; however, it recommends retaining receipts. Further guidance will be provided as litigation progresses.

Over 445,000 people have fled their homes in South Sudan this year alone according to the International Committee on the Red Cross.
South Sudan also faces an acute food insecurity crisis, largely driven by escalating conflict.
USCRI urges the Administration to immediately reverse the TPS termination for South Sudan and instead provide an 18-month extension and redesignation.
For more, see USCRI’s piece, “Navigating Instability: A Country Conditions Overview of South Sudan” published in September 2025.","Arlington, VA — November 7, 2025 — The U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants (USCRI) is deeply alarmed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for South Sudan, effective January 5, 2026. This decision undermines both the humanitarian purpose of the TPS program and the United States’ longstanding commitment to protecting individuals from returning to life-threatening conditions.

DHS justified the termination by asserting that South Sudan no longer faces armed conflict posing serious risks to returning nationals. Yet, just last week on October 29, the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan warned in an address to the United Nations (UN) General Assembly that “once again, civilians are being bombarded, women are being raped, children are being displaced and forcefully recruited into combat roles, and entire communities are living in fear…” The Commission underscored that South Sudan’s “political transition is falling apart” and that the “peace agreement’s key provisions are being systematically violated.”

As fighting intensifies, South Sudan remains in a dire humanitarian and displacement crisis. Over 445,000 people have fled their homes in South Sudan this year alone according to the International Committee on the Red Cross. Over 2.3 million refugees from South Sudan have sought safety in neighboring countries and more than 1.4 million others remain internally displaced.

South Sudan also faces an acute food insecurity crisis, largely driven by escalating conflict. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report released November 4 found that over 7.5 million people in the country will likely face crisis or worse levels of hunger between April to July 2026 (see more about IPC’s Classification system here). The UN has warned that without urgent humanitarian assistance in affected areas of South Sudan, the food and nutrition crisis will only deepen.

Using the fact that South Sudan has not yet plunged back into “full-scale civil war” as justification for this termination is fundamentally inconsistent with the statutory purpose and intent of the TPS program. Treating a fragile and rapidly deteriorating peace as evidence of conditions for safe return ignores the worsening conditions that would place returning South Sudanese nationals at extreme risk of harm, violence, persecution, and life-threatening insecurity.

USCRI urges the Administration to immediately reverse the TPS termination for South Sudan and instead provide an 18-month extension and redesignation. We further call on Congress and the Administration to reaffirm U.S. leadership in protecting displaced persons and upholding humanitarian principles at a time when lives hang in the balance.

Many attenders spoke against not just having a detention center in the vicinity, but also about the impact of social harms of the crackdown.
And it’s so obviously politically driven.” Marlis Dinning said what she heard at the town hall about the possible detention center was disturbing.
But she vowed to participate in the mounting community pressure to keep the detention center at bay.","In an Arizona town where farmers have long wrested a living off the arid land, reports that a former prison complex may be turned into an immigration detention center have sparked a fierce backlash, with residents seeing the potential transition as the latest undesirable symbol of the Trump administration’s massive escalation of immigration enforcement.

The facility in Marana, a town of about 63,700 people located north of Tucson, sprawls across a flat expanse of desert studded with scrubby bushes and hardy trees. It was shuttered almost two years ago, and the Management and Training Corporation, the private company that owns it, informed the town manager of company plans to operate a detention center in the prison.

During a town hall meeting on 23 October, residents crowded into a school auditorium to learn more from representatives of local government and advocacy organizations about the plan. Many attenders spoke against the jailing of immigrants amid Donald Trump’s crusade to deport as many undocumented immigrants as possible.

Karla Jones, one of the attenders, said she abhorred the idea of having a nearby detention center to hold immigrants – whose only crime in many cases is lacking US legal status, a civil offense – for extended periods of time. “That’s breaking up families,” she said. “And it’s people who are paying taxes, it’s people who are working. So I don’t want my community to support that.”

Federal legislation passed in July provided $45bn for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to build more detention centers for adults and children as part of a larger $75bn, four-year package for the federal agency. To vastly increase detention capacity, the federal government is relying heavily on for-profit private companies that run prisons.

The Utah-based Management and Training Corporation (MTC) is one of those companies. MTC built the Marana prison in the mid-1990s, when the population in the then largely farming community was about 2,000. It was the first private prison in the state.

In 2013, Arizona bought the prison for $150,000. In December 2023, the state – citing high costs and a decreasing incarcerated population – closed it. This past summer, after Arizona lawmakers rejected a bill that would have leased the prison for $1 a year to the federal government for use as an immigration detention center – MTC paid the state $15m to get it back.

Marana’s town manager, Terry Rozema, said there was little the town could do to prevent the use of the building complex as a detention center. “The facility is privately owned by MTC and is already properly zoned for use as a prison or an ICE facility. As such, the town doesn’t have authority to restrict its future use as long as it meets current zoning,” Rozema said in an emailed statement.

Emily Lawhead, MTC’s director of communications, declined an interview but wrote in an email that the company was “in discussions with several public agencies that may have a need for additional bed space”. ICE did not respond to questions regarding plans to use the onetime prison, but an agency spokesperson cited the need for “greater detention capacity” due to “a significant number of arrests”.

MTC already operates five immigration detention centers in California, New Mexico and Texas.

Its record in Arizona is spotty. In 2015, the state canceled a contract with the company after a riot at a prison it operated in the town of Kingman left more than a dozen incarcerated people and guards injured. A subsequent investigation by the Arizona department of corrections concluded that the company had “a culture of disorganization, disengagement and disregard” for state policies. MTC did not respond to the Guardian’s questions about those allegations, but the company has previously described the investigation’s findings as flawed.

Jennifer Allen, a member of the board of supervisors for Pima county, where Marana is located, said that given reports about the poor conditions facing ICE detainees across the country, she and her constituents were concerned about the treatment of people in the Marana facility if it were to be converted and about oversight of the facility. She criticized the federal government for showering immigration enforcement with resources while simultaneously cutting funding for social safety net programs for older adults, children and other vulnerable populations.

At the town hall, the federal government received plenty of criticism for its aggressive immigration agenda. Many attenders spoke against not just having a detention center in the vicinity, but also about the impact of social harms of the crackdown. Some residents brought signs bearing the slogan “Stop the kidnappings, protect your neighbors”, alluding to forceful arrests of immigrants in their homes, at work and in the streets.

Speaking to the crowd, Tucson resident Maximiliano Torres likened the Trump administration’s detention and deportation campaign to Arizona’s 2010 Senate Bill 1070, commonly known as the “show me your papers” law that empowered police to conduct immigration enforcement. Although police can still inquire about immigration status, it’s no longer required because courts have largely struck down the law as unconstitutional.

Recalling the law’s impact, Torres told the crowd: “They turned [crossing the border without authorization] into a criminal act, so they could justify putting those people in prison and forcing the federal government to pay private prisons.”

While Trump has repeatedly promised immigration enforcement efforts would be focused on undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes, statistics show that those being held in detention are primarily people without criminal convictions. As of September, 71.5% of the 59,762 immigrants in detention had no criminal conviction, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. Many convictions involved traffic violations and other minor offenses.

Under the Biden administration, immigrants with strong community ties and no serious brushes with the law would generally be released and be asked to check in with ICE periodically, since the government prioritized deporting people with criminal convictions, said Jennifer Ibañez Whitlock, senior policy counsel at the National Immigration Law Center. “Now everybody gets arrested, everybody gets detained,” she said.

The Trump administration has significantly expanded mandatory detention to keep immigrants in confinement during proceedings to remove them from the country, she said. “More and more often, people are just giving up and agreeing to be deported instead of sitting in jail trying to fight their case,” the attorney said.

In Marana, resident Tom Flynn left the town hall clutching one of the protest signs. He detests the possibility of an immigrant detention center in his town. “No 1, it’s morally objectionable,” he said. “No 2, it’s a detriment to the overall economy; it reduces the number of people who have been in the area, it depresses home values. And it’s so obviously politically driven.”

Marlis Dinning said what she heard at the town hall about the possible detention center was disturbing. “It seems like all of this has happened behind closed doors,” she said. She’s against the detention of immigrants, many of them asylum seekers who entered the country legally, and who now “have no way to get citizenship”, she said.

After the town hall, Jones was feeling quite unsettled by the overall discussion. But she vowed to participate in the mounting community pressure to keep the detention center at bay. “I really hope we can stop it from opening,” she said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ea6ca7745394f7b42e0ad23f76fb29c64e185b2/589_0_3829_3063/master/3829.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8bb7ee7af30c547b3951f87cc7eeff14",N,,2025-11-07 17:01:17.752291

Prior to the current administration, most ICE detention facilities were run by private prison contractors that both owned and staffed the building with federal funding.","WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is exploring buying warehouses that were designed for clients like Amazon and retrofitting them as detention facilities for immigrants before they are deported, a move that would vastly expand the government’s detention capacity, according to a Homeland Security Department official and a White House official.

The precise warehouses that Immigration and Customs Enforcement may buy have not yet been determined, but the agency is looking at locations in the southern U.S. near airports where immigrants are most often deported, the DHS official and the White House official said. Selecting such warehouses would “increase efficiency” in deportations, the DHS official said.

A deal to purchase the warehouses, which on average are more than twice the size of current ICE detention facilities, is past the early stages but not yet final, the DHS official and the White House official said. The DHS official described the warehouses as future “mega detention centers.”

Amazon would not be a part of any deal and would not profit from it as the warehouses were built by developers for Amazon but never used or leased by the company, the officials said.

An Amazon spokesperson said that the company is not involved in any discussions with DHS or ICE about warehouse space and that it leases and does not own the vast majority of its warehouse space.

It was not immediately clear who owns the warehouses that the government may buy and the DHS official and the White House official did not know how much the deals could be worth. The DHS official said some of the warehouses under consideration were built by developers with Amazon in mind but never used.

Any decision on whether to use such warehouses, or how many, has not yet been finalized, the DHS official said.

The White House referred all questions on the matter to DHS and ICE. DHS and ICE did not respond to comment.

Purchasing large warehouses would be the latest in a series of unconventional — and at times contentious — ideas in the Trump administration’s search for immigrant detention space. The plans underscore ICE’s ambitions to ramp up its detainment of immigrants on a large scale.

ICE has struggled to hit daily arrest quotas and fill hiring goals, and some of its senior leaders are being replaced amid White House frustrations.

Amazon warehouses range in size, averaging approximately 800,000 square feet. The largest is in Wilmington, Delaware, at 3.8 million square feet. By comparison, an ICE detention facility in Tacoma, Washington, houses 1,500 immigrants in 277,000 square feet.

The White House official said ICE would pay for the warehouses with funds from the budget reconciliation package that President Donald Trump signed earlier this year and calls the “One Big Beautiful Bill.”

The warehouses would be owned by ICE outright and not contracted through the private prison industry or states, as is the case with other facilities, the DHS official and the White House official said.

If the purchases are finalized, the idea is for ICE to convert the warehouses into detention facilities and likely run them with its own employees, not contractors or military personnel, the DHS official and the White House official said. Prior to the current administration, most ICE detention facilities were run by private prison contractors that both owned and staffed the building with federal funding.

An NBC News poll released earlier this month noted that 51% of voters said the Trump administration has lived up to their expectations on border security and immigration, while 44% said it fell short of their expectations. In addition, 39% of registered voters said they view ICE favorably, while 50% said they view it unfavorably. A Pew Research Center survey from this summer noted, “the Trump administration’s overall approach to immigration is viewed more negatively than positively, with 42% approving and 47% disapproving,” adding the sentiment was largely split along party lines.

Since Trump retook office in January, after campaigning on a promise of mass deportations of immigrants, his administration has tried different approaches to detention facilities, with varied success.

Trump charged the military earlier this year with holding immigrants in tents at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, but the plan to hold tens of thousands of immigrants there did not materialize.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250908-chicago-ICE-shield-badge-ac-1025p-7de36a.jpg",N,,2025-11-07 16:04:10.637513

To the chagrin of U.S. allies and rights advocates alike, the U.S. seat sat empty as the council president sought input from the United States — once a stalwart participant and defender of human rights worldwide — as it came up for its turn part of regular review of all U.N. member states.

Council members expressed regret that the United States didn't take part, called on the council president to urge the U.S. to resume its cooperation, and moved to reschedule the U.S. review next year: Such a review can't take place without the “concerned country” taking part. Honduras faced its review earlier in the day Friday.

There's no indication whether the Trump administration would take part next year either. The U.S. already announced in September that it would sit out Friday's review.

The American Civil Liberties Union, an advocacy group, said the Trump administration was ""setting a dangerous example that will further weaken universal human rights at home and abroad,” and pointed to rights concerns in the United States.

“From the discrimination and violence inflicted in the ICE raids, to the attacks on free speech of protesters and journalists, to the deployment of the National Guard in American cities when no crisis exists, the world is watching the United States government attacking the constitutional and human rights of its own people,” said Chandra Bhatnagar, executive director of the ACLU of Southern California, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The council examines the rights records of all 193 U.N. member countries about every four or five years. This was to be the fourth such review of the United States since the 47-member country council was created two decades ago.

WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is setting the record straight on a misleading viral video from Massachusetts of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrest of Juliana Milena Ojeda-Montoya, a criminal illegal alien from Ecuador who in August repeatedly stabbed her coworker with scissors and then threw a trash can at her victim.

On November 6, 2025, ICE conducted a targeted operation to arrest Ojeda-Montoya, a criminal illegal alien who entered the country under the Biden administration. During ICE's targeted vehicle stop of Ojeda-Montoya, her child and husband were in the car. The child was seated in the lap of the mother in the front seat of the car—recklessly endangering the child. The child was not in the safety of a car seat.

Juliana Milena Ojeda-Montoya

Officers informed Ojeda-Montoya they had a warrant for her arrest and requested she give the child to her husband, Carlos Zapata Rivera. She refused until the moment her husband purported to have a medical episode. Her husband, also an illegal alien from Ecuador, refused medical help and displayed absolutely no signs of medical concerns just moments later. ICE called 911 but the illegal alien refused any medical care.

Despite ICE law enforcement officers’ several attempts to deescalate the situation and repeated requests that the father take custody of the child, both parents stated they were willing to put the child into state custody. Once Zapata Rivera realized he would be arrested for immigration violations if he did not agree to take custody of the child, he suddenly decided to be a good father and left with the child.

During the arrest, Ojeda-Montoya resisted, and a crowd of agitators formed. Some of these agitators began shouting obscenities, death threats, and antisemitic remarks at officers including:

""You probably support Israel too...you look like a Jew... I bet you are a f***ing Jew.”

“I'm going to remember those eyes...I'm going to find you... I'm going to come for you... I know you probably have kids... We're going to kill you and your kids... I am going to shoot all of you.”

“Once again, the media ran with a FALSE narrative about our brave ICE law enforcement officers. As usual, here’s the REAL story: ICE targeted a known criminal who repeatedly stabbed her coworker,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “Medical personnel found there was no legitimate medical emergency. He was even caught on video on his feet and coherent moments later. Our law enforcement officers requested the father take custody of the child, but he refused. He quickly decided to leave with the child once he realized if he didn’t take custody ICE would arrest him for an immigration violation.”

On February 22, 2023, the U.S. Border Patrol arrested Ojeda-Montoya after she illegally entered the United States near Lukeville, Arizona. She was later released into our communities under the Biden administration in March of the same year. Ojeda-Montoya was transported to Cumberland County Jail in Scarborough, Maine and will remain in ICE custody pending removal proceedings.

The U.S. Supreme Court appeared skeptical of the Trump Administration's claim to broad tariff authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) during nearly three hours of oral argument on Nov. 5, 2025.

Justices across the ideological spectrum questioned whether IEEPA, long regarded as the cornerstone of U.S. sanctions policy, also authorizes the imposition of sweeping tariffs, a power that traditionally falls to the U.S. Congress under Article I of the U.S. Constitution.

The ""major questions"" and ""non-delegation"" doctrines, both aimed at preserving the constitutional separation of powers, featured prominently in the Court's questioning. Several justices emphasized the need for a clearer statement of congressional intent before allowing the executive branch to wield such expansive tariff authority.

The U.S. Supreme Court heard oral argument on Nov. 5, 2025, on whether the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) authorizes the Trump Administration's executive orders (EOs) imposing two sets of tariffs: 1) tariffs tied to fentanyl trafficking and illegal immigration, targeting imports from China, Canada and Mexico, and 2) broadly applied ""reciprocal"" tariffs on imports from most countries, justified by persistent trade deficits and alleged threats to national security and the economy.

These measures were challenged by small businesses and a coalition of states, and the lower courts concluded that IEEPA does not authorize such expansive tariff powers. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed but stayed its ruling pending Supreme Court review, which the administration sought on an expedited basis. (See Holland & Knight's previous alert, ""Court of Appeals Strikes Down IEEPA Tariffs, Setting Stage for Supreme Court Ruling,"" Sept. 9, 2025.)

Key Issues

The Supreme Court justices repeatedly pressed the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), represented by the solicitor general, to identify explicit statutory language in IEEPA that authorizes the president to impose tariffs. Although the statute empowers the president to ""issue … instructions, licenses or otherwise,"" to ""investigate, regulate or prohibit"" imports"" of ""property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest"" during a declared national emergency, it does not mention ""tariffs,"" ""duties"" or ""taxes.""

Several justices underscored that the power to impose tariffs is fundamentally a power to tax, which is reserved to the U.S. Congress under Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution. Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Chief Justice John Roberts both emphasized that tariffs generate revenue from American citizens and thus implicate Congress' core taxing authority rather than a mere regulatory function.

Multiple justices observed that, historically, when Congress intends to delegate tariff authority, it does so with explicit language and clear procedural safeguards, such as in Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 and Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The absence of comparable language in IEEPA was seen as strong evidence that Congress did not intend to confer such expansive tariff power.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett pressed Solicitor General John Sauer to identify a statute other than IEEPA and its predecessor, the Trading With the Enemy Act (TWEA), in which the phrase ""regulate importation"" has been interpreted to include tariff authority. The DOJ could not do so, and several justices questioned whether TWEA's wartime delegation and related case law provided a meaningful precedent. Although the Supreme Court upheld then-President Richard Nixon's use of TWEA to impose narrow tariffs, counsel for the plaintiffs drew a sharp distinction between that limited exercise of tariff authority and the sweeping tariff powers DOJ claims IEEPA grants.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and others referenced IEEPA's purpose and legislative history, noting that Congress enacted the statute in 1977 to narrow presidential authority that had been broadly exercised under TWEA. They pointed to procedural checks in the statute, such as congressional reporting and a legislative veto – a mechanism that was subsequently found unconstitutional in the 1983 case INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983)).

Several justices raised the ""major questions"" doctrine, noting that actions of vast economic and political significance require clear congressional authorization. They questioned whether the phrase ""regulate importation"" is sufficiently explicit to encompass the sweeping tariff authority claimed by the administration.

Justice Elena Kagan and others also focused on Constitution's allocation of taxing powers to Congress, expressing concern that the administration's theory would allow the president to bypass legislative checks. Justice Neil Gorsuch warned that accepting DOJ's position could create a ""one-way ratchet towards the gradual-but-continual accretion"" of executive power and questioned whether Congress could meaningfully reclaim such authority once delegated.

Practical and Remedial Concerns

Justice Barrett focused on the practical implications of invalidating the tariffs, particularly the complexity of reimbursing billions in duties already paid. Counsel for the plaintiffs acknowledged the challenges but argued that administrative complexity should not override statutory limits, at one point suggesting that relief could be offered prospectively to limit the administrative burden.

Implications for Clients

Tariff Exposure. The Court's skepticism suggests a meaningful possibility that the IEEPA tariffs will be struck down – either entirely or in part. This could allow importers to submit reimbursement claims and underscores the importance of maintaining robust compliance and recordkeeping practices to support any future duty recovery.

Future Executive Action. A ruling limiting presidential tariff authority under IEEPA would curtail the use of emergency powers for broad tariff actions and reinforce the need for explicit congressional authorization for major economic interventions. At the same time, it could prompt the administration to pivot to other trade authorities – such as Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 and Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (including the inclusions process) – to implement broad tariff measures in pursuit of its trade agenda.

Ongoing Uncertainty. Until the Court issues its decision, the legal status of the IEEPA tariffs remains unsettled. Although administrative mechanisms already exist for importers of record to request and obtain tariff refunds from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), importers should closely monitor developments and be prepared for potential changes in tariff obligations and recovery procedures.

Action Items

Review and maintain import records and tariff payment documentation to preserve eligibility for potential reimbursement claims.

Consult with Holland & Knight lawyers and professionals, who are closely monitoring the Supreme Court proceedings and assessing their implications for compliance and possible reimbursement strategies.

Evaluate exposure to other trade measures imposed under separate statutory authorities (e.g., Section 301, Section 232), which are not directly affected by this litigation but may impact your overall tariff risk profile.

Jason Crow on airport disruptions, gerrymandering, and ICE arrests - Colorado Public Radio","Anthony Cotton, Lauren Antonoff Hart, Stina Sieg, Brian Eason, The Colorado Sun, Bente Birkeland",,,,,https://www.cpr.org/2025/11/07/rep-crow-interview-airport-disruptions-gerrymandering-ice-arrests/,"Rep. Crow: Well, listen, this is the same answer, Ryan.
Rep. Crow: Yeah.
Rep. Crow: I can't speak about individual cases because we treat those with confidence, but – Warner: Do they exist?
Rep. Crow: No, that's not the way I would look at it.
Rep. Crow: The takeaway, which was overwhelming, is that America is repudiating Donald Trump and Trumpism.","Jason Crow says potential disruptions to the nation’s air travel should not be the impetus to end the government shutdown.

“Everyone's like, ‘Well, why don't Democrats work in good faith? Why don't Democrats open the government?’” Crow, the Democratic representative for Colorado’s Sixth Congressional District, told Colorado Matters senior host Ryan Warner. “We have been; in April, we passed a CR (Continuing Resolution) to fund the government. The administration made promises to the Senate. The Senate took their word for it anyhow and look what's happened in that time, all of the reliance, all the promises have been broken. They had the chance to negotiate with us in April and in May and in June and in July and in August and in September, you get the idea.”

The Trump administration said there will be a ten percent reduction to air traffic beginning Friday if the shutdown continues. Now in its sixth week, Democrats have insisted that existing subsidies to offset the cost of health care be included in the next continuing resolution in order to receive their votes to reopen the government. Republicans have countered that they’d be willing to address that request after reopening.

United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said recently that the shutdown is putting the American workers and the economy at risk and specific issues like health care should be addressed after the government reopens. Asked if a voice besides a Republican carried more influence with him, Crow said the answer would be the same,

“This is their crisis; they have made this,” Crow said. “Now, we have a responsibility to be willing to meet them in good faith, negotiate a compromise, because ultimately by policy we have to find a policy compromise, but they have to be willing to open the doors and start those discussions because we have repeatedly tried to do it.

“I'm sitting here in Washington right now ready to do it, and the Republicans are not here. So it starts with them exercising their responsibility in the way that we have been exercising ours”

In a wide-ranging interview, Crow also discussed ICE enforcement in Colorado and nationally, as well as the duty of troops who are being deployed to U.S. cities, his demand for transparency around lethal strikes on suspected drug-smuggling boats in international waters, and, in the face of gains nationally by the Democratic Party in this week’s elections, the importance of not discounting results from smaller, local races.

The following has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Ryan Warner: Denver International Airport, along with others are seeing a ten percent reduction in flights, DIA is actually asking the feds if it can pay air traffic controllers out of its own pockets. Would holiday travel disruptions move Democrats away from their push to address health insurance costs before reopening government?

Rep. Jason Crow: Ryan, I'm not going to bargain with people's health insurance and their ability to actually survive and provide health care for their children. Every parent knows everything begins and ends with the health of your children, the health of your family. That is essential to everybody's life. And on top of that, what we've seen the Trump administration do is weaponize hunger against Americans, weaponize our military against Americans, weaponize the Department of Justice against their political enemies. We have a president that is acting way outside of the normal bounds of the law, of the constitution, of our morality as a nation, and they have made that decision and they are acting that way and that is non-negotiable for me. So this is not our shutdown. They have made the decision to act in the way they've acted. They made the decision to shut Congress down. They made the decision to not come to us to work towards a bipartisan solution, and they have to now make the decision to open the doors back up, start negotiation and work with us in good faith.

Warner: There has been some talk that Republican leaders would pick up the health care discussion if Democrats agreed to reopen the government. Is that not a promise or an offer that you have faith in?

Rep. Row: Why would I have faith in that, Ryan? What about the last 10 months and the actions of Donald Trump in this administration would get me to trust them? They have lied repeatedly. They have pulled the rug out from us repeatedly. They have no trepidation whatsoever, none in violating the law, violating the constitution, saying and doing terrible things against their perceived political enemies, weaponizing every faction of the government, trying to suppress free speech and our fundamental freedoms, sending mass federal agents onto our streets to snatch American citizens and provide no due process to these folks. What about any of that would lead me as a leader, as an elected official with a sworn oath to my constituents, to Colorado and to the constitution to believe that I could trust this man and this administration?

Warner: Congressman, United has an enormous presence in Colorado. No doubt many airline employees live in your district, which includes Aurora next door to DIA. The CEO of United, Scott Kirby, in a press conference with the vice president implored Congress to reopen the government and then debate health care costs. Let's listen just briefly.

Scott Kirby, United CEO: “As every day goes by, the impacts start to grow and airlines are a pretty good real-time indicator of the economy and we start to see, still minor, but steep booking impact and you see that happening in the economy. We put the whole economy at risk and so it's been 30 days and while I don't have a position on which partisan side and how things should be settled with health care, it has been 30 days. I also think it is time to pass a clean CR, use that as the opportunity to get into a room behind closed doors and negotiate hard on the real and substantive issues that the American people want our politicians on both sides of the aisle to solve. But let's get a clean CR and get that negotiation done behind closed doors without putting the American workers in the American economy at risk.”

Alright, that's not Donald Trump, that's the head of an airline that's very important to your state. Does the message coming from him differ?

Rep. Crow: Well, listen, this is the same answer, Ryan. Everyone's like, well, why don't Democrats work in good faith? Why don't Democrats open the government? We have been. In April, we passed a CR to fund the government. The administration made promises to the Senate. The Senate took their word for it anyhow, and look what's happened in that time, right? All of the reliance, all the promises have been broken. They had the chance to negotiate with us in April and in May and in June and in July and in August and in September, you get the idea. They are the ones that decided to recess that House of Representatives. Donald Trump is the one that went on Fox and Friends and said, Don't work with the Democrats. We're going to go this alone. Don't even talk to them. Donald Trump is the one that canceled the meeting with democratic leaders and said, I'm not going to discuss with them or negotiate with them. This is their crisis. They have made this. Now we have a responsibility to be willing to meet them in good faith, negotiate a compromise, because ultimately by policy we have to find a policy compromise, but they have to be willing to open the doors and start those discussions because we have repeatedly tried to do it. And I'm sitting here in Washington right now ready to do it, and the Republicans are not here. So it starts with them exercising their responsibility and the way that we have been exercising ours.

Warner: You've talked about this administration weaponizing any number of things, the military, ICE, the Department of Justice. You represent Aurora, which has a substantial immigrant community, and I'm curious what constituent services look like for your office now with intensification of ICE enforcement?

Rep. Crow: Yeah. Our office is being deluged with very, very challenging casework and outreach from our constituents. The Muslim ban has resulted in many families in the metro area, the Denver metro area, not being able to reunite their families, not being able to bring their families together and travel. We have seen countless incidents of people being snatched off streets, ICE agents and CBP and others showing up in places where they shouldn't. The fear and intimidation that we are dealing with within the district, but within the greater metro area is really astonishing, and that's why my obligation to make sure I'm standing by my constituents, that we are helping them as much as we can, that we are providing people with information about their rights and providing a safe space for people is so essential right now. You know that I'm proud of the fact that I represent one of the most diverse districts in the nation. We are a district in so many ways of immigrants and refugees. That's a lifeblood of our economy and we're seeing the impact on our families, on our economy and on the core of our community.

Warner: You mentioned CBP, Customs and Border Protection. Do you know any of your own constituents who have status here who perhaps are citizens who have been arrested by ICE? Can you speak to that specifically for the Sixth Congressional District?

Rep. Crow: I can't speak about individual cases because we treat those with confidence, but –

Warner: Do they exist? Do those cases exist in your district?

Rep. Crow: We believe that they do. There have been over a hundred, but what I do know is there have been over a hundred incidents around the country of U.S. citizens that have been snatched off of the street by immigration officials that have been denied due process. That is a problem nationwide.

Warner: And you have an understanding that some of those may have touched your district.

Rep. Crow: That is our understanding.

Warner: Okay, thanks for that. Californians approved a ballot measure allowing the state to redistrict and reshape five congressional districts that ostensibly would go to Democrats. And this is in response to Texas, Missouri, and North Carolina's moves due to the same for Republican gains. Do you think Colorado law should change to allow for something similar here?

Rep. Crow: Yeah, I do actually. And then I say that not lightly because I'm somebody that believes that campaign finance reform and ending gerrymandering are two of the most important things that we have to do to protect our democracy, and we have done it. I fought for it. I have bills that would help end it. I was one of the original sponsors of the Protecting Our Democracy Act. In fact, Democrats, when this has been put up for a vote in the United States Congress, overwhelmingly, actually unanimously, every single Democrat in the House of Representatives the last time this was voted on, voted for a federal prohibition on gerrymandering and every single Republican voted against it. So we have repeatedly tried to do this in a nationwide basis, but the abuse and the assault in our democracy by this administration and their attempt to try to stack the deck in their favor going into the election season, I am not going to sit around and watch that just happen on my watch and go and do a battle with one arm tied behind my back. I'm not going to do it. And then when we regain power, I actually believe the first thing we have to do is we have to put the guardrails back in place and in some instances, put guardrails that have never been in place for our democracy to make sure that we end gerrymandering nationwide, that we reform our campaign finance system and we go to the root of the issues that have undermined our democracy and delivered Donald Trump to the White House.

Warner: A question for you as an army ranger: Are troops violating their oaths to the constitution when they engage in domestic law enforcement at the president's request?

Rep. Crow: No, that's not the way I would look at it. Every soldier, every sailor, every marine, every airman has an obligation to uphold the constitution, right, and to follow lawful orders. So long as orders are lawful, they have an obligation to follow those, but if an order is unlawful, they have an obligation not to follow that.

Warner: Except of course the interpretation of the constitution depends on the day and the court.

Rep. Crow: Well, that's not necessarily true, right? You have to exercise your judgment. You have to actually know the constitution and the law, and you have to make that decision often on the spot. When I was an officer and I was deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, we had to make decisions all the time about how to act in a certain situation, what was compliant with international humanitarian law, what was compliant with the law of armed conflict. You are educated and exposed to your legal requirements as part of your military training.

Warner: So whether it's Washington or Chicago or Portland, Oregon, you don't think the president has yet asked anything unconstitutional of troops?

Rep. Crow: I think the president has exceeded his authority and I think he has acted outside of that legal authority, and I've spoken as much. That's a different analysis though, Ryan, whether or not the troops themselves have been asked to violate the law or constitution, there's two levels of analysis.

Warner: It feels like splitting hairs. In other words, if you think that the president is acting outside the law and using troops as a pawn for it, isn't that the same question?

Rep. Crow: There are different questions. I mean, I see your point and I see the gray zone between the actions of the President and whether or not he's acting in and outside of his authority versus the operational and tactical responsibility of an individual troop.

Warner: You have signed a letter to the administration, demanding transparency around lethal strikes on suspected drug smuggling boats. You and others want a classified briefing as members of the Armed Services Committee on how “individuals and vessels are identified and what post-strike reviews are in place.” Congressman Crow, what are your fears here?

Rep. Crow: Well, my fear is that this is a classic example of the president acting outside of his authority without Congress declaring a conflict and the president acting as if there is a conflict. Right? When I sat in a briefing just a couple of weeks ago, they used terms like combatants and non-combatants when they were talking about the folks who have been targeted by these operations. That is the terminology of war. That is acting as if there has been a declaration of war when there hasn't, and only Congress can make a declaration of war. That's the first piece. The second is, this administration does not appear to have learned anything from our last 25 years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan. This country spent $3 trillion, 7,000 American lives, tens of thousands of other lives, 3 million combat tours, and most of those wars have ended poorly for this country, and the burden of those wars have been borne disproportionately by the American working class and folks in rural communities.

So having spent three combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, I myself harbor a lot of the anger and the resentment of working class folks around this nation for having been lied to and misled for two decades. And the same thing appears to be happening now. There is no problem that this president has seen that he doesn't think he can bomb his way out of, whether you're talking about Iran or the Houthis or now the Caribbean or now Nigeria.

The third thing that really bothers me is that there actually isn't a strategy to address the flow of drugs into this country. That does need to happen. Fentanyl has devastated our communities and killed tens of thousands of our children, and we deserve a real strategy to address the flow of drugs, and that means addressing the demand within the United States and educating parents, educating children and the flow. And there's actually nothing that has been relayed to me in any of my briefings that show this president, this administration, actually have a real strategy to address the flow of drugs. They simply are just blowing up and spending exorbitant resources doing so, blowing up a handful of speedboats and wooden rafts, posting videos of that and thinking that that will satisfy folks.

Warner: Just two bits of pushback. You paint the president as something of a war monger, but this is a dude who helped broker peace between Israel and Gaza. So square that for me first.

Rep. Crow: Well, I do believe that peace in Israel and Gaza and the West Bank and other places is important, and the ceasefire and the peace that is holding on very tenuously is actually a positive thing. Now, this president treated it as a transactional business deal. He is interested in striking real estate deals, not actually achieving peace. He's interested in the transactional elements of this, and already there are business deals that the administration and people associated with the administration are pursuing in this region. So that was their real motivation. But yeah, absolutely. Donald Trump campaigned and spoke like an isolationist and he is acting like an imperialist. In the first 10 months of this administration, we have seen a drastic expansion of conflict and military operations conducted by the U.S. military, and on top of it, he continues to saber rattle and talk about regime change in Venezuela. So there's no squaring of the circle that needs to happen. There is a very clear pattern of interventionists and the use of the military and drastic expansion of the use of our military over the last 10 months.

Warner: And then isn't the fight against fentanyl and other illicit drugs, isn’t that core to the administration's view of immigration enforcement? It seems hard to say that that's not a priority for Trump.

Rep. Crow: Yeah, it's not actually. What's core to their immigration enforcement is actually fear and intimidation and showing power. That's what they're trying to do. They're trying to strike fear and intimidate people throughout the country and use this new federal law enforcement force that they're building with $140 billion that house Republicans pushed through this summer to create a law enforcement agency that will do whatever Donald Trump asks them to do. That is what they're trying to do, and here's why I know that, Ryan: If this administration actually was serious about stopping fentanyl, why is there no evidence of any of these strikes in the Caribbean actually having been focused on fentanyl? There isn't, and this is a very important fact.

Warner: Election night this week was pretty rosy for Democrats, and I wonder what you take away that perhaps gets applied to 2026 and beyond.

Rep. Crow: The takeaway, which was overwhelming, is that America is repudiating Donald Trump and Trumpism. People are hurting, costs are going up. Health care is skyrocketing thanks to Donald Trump's mega bill in July. People see the chaos. They see the dysfunction, they see the destruction of critical government services in their everyday lives, and then they want leadership and they want government to work for them. We won in Virginia and New Jersey. Two of my closest friends are now going to be the governors of those states. But even more telling than those state races is what happened in city councils and mayor races and local legislatures and local judgeships around the country. And let's look at my own district where the Aurora City Council flipped, where Centennial flipped at both the city council and the mayor's level. For the first time in a very, very long time. There is something very significant happening and a massive movement afoot in America because people have had enough of the vitriol and the dysfunction.

Now it's our responsibility and my responsibility not to take that for granted. America sent a very strong message. They want something different. Now we have to meet the moment and we have to show that something different and what our positive vision is, and that is my work. That's what I'm doing around the country and around Colorado right now. I am recruiting the next generation of Democratic leaders to step up and to take office. I'm the chair of recruitment for the House Democrats, and I'm taking that responsibility seriously because this is about finding servant leaders, real genuine leaders who will step up, run races, flip districts, and move our country in a better direction.

Warner: I mean, recruitment is so key, but so is the idea of a face, a kind of a Trump for the left or an Obama or someone who gets the attention and drives people to volunteerism and to participation, and frankly to the polls. Is there a vacuum right now for Democrats?",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/250812-COLORADO-CHAMBER-BIENNIAL-CONGRESSIONAL-LUNCHEON-DENVER-ART-MUSEUM-COPOLITICS-KEVINJBEATY-55.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 17:57:09.450550

""It is worse than you can imagine out on the streets right now, and it is because of the federal immigration enforcement we're seeing every day.

He joined U.S. troops as they traveled from province to province, attempting to hold back the armed rebellion. And after U.S. forces withdrew from the country, and the capital city of Kabul fell to the Taliban in 2021, Dadfar feared he and his family would be murdered.

It took three years for the family of six to journey to the United States, where they applied for asylum and settled in Colorado. Dadfar, who had a permit that authorized him to work in the United States, initially got a job as an insulation installer in Boulder County, then studied and received a commercial driver’s license this fall to become a long-haul truck driver.

Last month, as Dadfar drove a truckload of supplies through Indiana, he was taken by masked ICE agents after he was forced to strip by the roadside and handcuffed. He has been locked in a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Missouri for 26 days.

Dadfar, who had been working as a truck driver for only a few weeks, was caught up in what ICE officials are calling “Operation Midway Blitz,” a Chicago-based effort to prevent “alien threats to public safety.” U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said 223 people were taken into custody in a “successful operation” with the Indiana State Police targeting truck drivers near the Illinois state line.

Noem’s news release said some of the people taken into custody were connected to crimes, including drug trafficking and driving under the influence, but she did not say how many of the 223 were accused of illegal activities. The truck drivers were issued commercial driver’s licenses by “sanctuary states,” including Illinois, she said. ICE had not yet responded to a request Thursday from The Colorado Sun for more information.

Dadfar is not accused of any crime and is following the legal path to asylum, said his wife, who did not want her name used because she is afraid that she and her children will become targets of immigration officials or anti-immigrant groups. She spoke to The Colorado Sun through a Dari interpreter, another Afghan who fled to Colorado after the Taliban returned to power.

“It’s very sad and disappointing at the same time,” she said. “My husband worked for 14 or 15 years to fight the Taliban. We had a really hard time coming from Afghanistan and getting here to the United States. Most of our lives have been under war, and now that we’re here, they detained my husband. I’m sad for me and my kids. They need their father. They need their dad to be with them.”

Family fled Afghanistan to Iran after the fall of Kabul

The family had been doing well in Louisville, where the four children, ages 4, 7, 9 and 11, were attending school, learning English and making friends. Three of the children are girls, who would not have been able to go to school beyond elementary grades in Afghanistan. The family had received support from Christ the Servant Lutheran Church, which helped them find housing. Life was starting to feel normal for the first time in years. The kids had just visited a pumpkin patch.

Now, when Dadfar calls once a day from the detention center, he tells his children he is hauling loads, not that he has been locked up.

Dadfar, 37, was at a weigh station beside the highway in Indiana, talking to his brother on the phone, when he said masked authorities were signaling him to stop. He quickly hung up.

The next time Dadfar’s family heard from him, a day later, he was in a detention center. He described to his wife that he was ordered by the ICE agents to take off his clothes and was asked whether he had a document to prove he was in the country legally. He told them he did, but he said the agents did not look at it.

Later, when Dadfar had his first court appearance, he saw a court document that was marked “yes” to a question about whether it was safe for him to return to his home country.

“But they never asked him this question at the court or at the detention center,” Dadfar’s wife said. “He is not safe if he goes back to Afghanistan. The Taliban are now looking for people like that, who worked for the government, who basically killed or fought against the Taliban. If he goes back, they will get him.”

Dadfar was threatened with his life, she said, as Taliban militants began taking over smaller cities on their way to Kabul, which fell back under Taliban control in August 2021. The family lived in Mazar, and Dadfar fled Mazar for Kabul as the Taliban entered their town. He was in Kabul when the U.S. government filled planes with evacuees, airlifting them to safety. Dadfar was at the airport, but did not get a seat.

Instead, the family went to Iran, traveling for 15 days through Pakistan and sleeping in a mountain camp. They lived in Iran for a year and a half. “Iran is very cruel to Afghan immigrants,” Dadfar’s wife said. “My kids couldn’t go to school. The Iranian people did not have good manners with me or with my family going anywhere in Iran.”

When they heard Brazil was accepting Afghan refugees, they applied for visas. Six months later, they arrived in Brazil, where they were placed in a camp with 13 families in one house, with four families sharing a bathroom, she said. They stayed in Brazil for a year, struggling to access community resources that would help them find work and housing.

“We decided to move to the United States for a better future, a bright future for myself and also for my kids,” Dadfar’s wife said. “Even though we heard that the way from Brazil to the U.S. is not easy, that not everyone can make it, we decided to go.”

The journey from Brazil to the U.S.-Mexico border took two months, including six days walking through the jungle in Panama. Their youngest daughter nearly drowned in a raging river as Dadfar carried a pack on his back and his daughter on his shoulders. “I saw dead bodies there, like six or seven dead bodies,” Dadfar’s wife said. “Maybe they died because of hunger. Maybe they died because of snakes. There were so many snakes there. I saw them all with my own eyes. It was the hardest time of my life, but we still kept going.”

By the time they reached the other side of the Darién Gap, the children had sores on their skin and infections in their eyes. They were starving. The youngest girl is still afraid to swim, even in a pool.

Three years after fleeing Afghanistan, the family reached the U.S. border. They scheduled an appointment with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection using the CBP One app, then waited in Mexico until it was their turn to explain their case for asylum to border patrol authorities.

They were interviewed, submitted to fingerprints and other biometrics to record their identities, and given a court date. They received one night in a hotel, with hot food, and were told to contact Dadfar’s brother in Colorado.

Dadfar’s brother paid for the family’s travel to Colorado, where they arrived in July 2024.

Boulder County residents have helped a wave of Afghan immigrants beginning in 2021

The family joined a contingent of Afghan people in Boulder County who fled their home country to escape the Taliban, an ultraconservative regime that prohibits teenage girls from going to school, banned social media, and for a few days in September, shut down the internet and cellphone service.

Several Afghan families came to Louisville and Lafayette four years ago as refugees, a separate immigration process that is handled by the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program and uses resettlement agencies or private sponsors to welcome newcomers and provide initial housing.

Marissa Seuc-Hester, who leads a volunteer ministry for immigrants at Christ the Servant Lutheran Church in Louisville, helped Dadfar’s brother. Then she helped Dadfar’s family. The family was “fully independent” for the past six months — until Oct. 10, when Dadfar was detained.

Seuc-Hester was infuriated by the news, which she learned in a call from Dadfar’s wife. “There are no criminal charges, no reason,” she said. “It has nothing to do with him particularly.”

Dadfar has a legal work permit and a pending case for asylum, a process that typically takes years and requires multiple appearances in civil immigration court.

When the family arrived in Colorado, the church helped them get into an apartment and enroll in school. Dadfar found work in construction, and his wife worked overnight shifts at a King Soopers. In recent months, Dadfar trained to become a truck driver, and his wife got her driver’s license, a car and a new job in retail, Seuc-Hester said. “They are just like every other family,” she said. “They are working. They are enjoying life, walking and biking to school. The kids are making friends and learning English and coming out of their shells.”

After so many years of war, and then a journey that terrified the children and nearly broke them, they were starting over.

“It’s just layer after layer of hardship for this family,” Seuc-Hester said.

Kate Leslie, who helped 12 Afghan families relocate to Boulder County and hosted two families in her home, called the detention of Dadfar a “violation of his civil and political rights.”

She compared the masked ICE agents to the Taliban and said the detention of an Afghan Army official who helped the United States during the war is “going to be incredibly distasteful to veterans and the military community.”

“It’s appalling,” said Leslie, who did not know Dadfar. “It’s an abdication of our responsibilities.”",https://newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25310677673482-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 14:57:12.940121

LaMonica McIver asked a federal judge to threaten sanctions to block the Trump administration from making any more statements about McIver that could affect her upcoming trial.

McIver’s filing, made on Thursday, is the latest salvo in a battle over how U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials have described the conduct of three New Jersey congress members during an unannounced inspection of Delaney Hall, an immigrant detention facility in Newark, in May. McIver (D-10) is accused of assaulting federal agents during that visit.

“DHS has slow-walked the removal of clearly prejudicial statements, issued new ones, and continued to maintain others on its website,” McIver attorney Lee Cortes said, adding that absent a court order McIver must continue playing whack-a-mole over federal officials’ statements about her.

‘Supposed assault’ at center of charges against NJ congresswoman

U.S. District Court Judge Jamel Semper last month ordered the administration to remove a series of posts made to the Department of Homeland Security’s X account that said McIver and Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-12) and Rob Menendez (D-08) stormed the facility during their May visit.

Body camera and other surveillance footage released in discovery show Delaney Hall officials let the House representatives into the facility for an inspection.

The three-count indictment against McIver alleges she assaulted federal officers during a scuffle outside Delaney Hall. McIver has pleaded not guilty.

McIver argues the charges are politically motivated and the prosecution is selective. The court heard arguments over McIver’s motions to dismiss the case on those grounds last month, though Semper has yet to issue a ruling.

McIver’s Thursday letter notes some prejudicial statements about her remain online despite Semper’s order that they be removed, including a May Department of Homeland Security press release that accuses McIver and others of “storming Delaney Hall” and a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement social media post that says McIver “attacked ICE officers.”

The letter also notes that Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman, is quoted in an October Politico article saying Democrats are no longer able to “storm ICE facilities.”

McIver’s attorneys argue the statements are part of a pattern meant to prevent fair trials in criminal cases.

I also want to welcome civil society colleagues and representatives of UN member states joining this important discussion.

Although the U.S. federal government will not appear before the Council as scheduled, it is heartening to have so many other representatives of the United States—from state and local governments, in addition to civil society—in Geneva today to share their assessment of the U.S. human rights situation and how to improve it.

As others have noted, if the United States sustains its boycott of the UPR process—just as Nicaragua appears poised to do—it will be the first time a UN member-state has decided not to comply with the UN General Assembly resolution creating this process. This would be especially unfortunate given longstanding, bipartisan U.S. emphasis on advancing human rights at home and abroad and U.S. involvement in creating the UPR itself.

It would be ironic as well since the values and principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights—that the United States helped draft some 77 years ago—are central to those undergirding the UPR.

The United States has engaged in the UPR on three prior occasions – including under the first Trump administration. That engagement has helped to make the process a positive force in improving human rights in the United States and around the world. It has also provided an invaluable vehicle for ongoing, robust engagement between civil society and governments on human rights, which doesn’t happen in all societies.

The universality of the UPR process is one of the key features that has made that progress possible. Because all countries participate in the UPR, it cannot be said that it is discriminatory or political in nature.

We at Human Rights First, along with many others in the human rights community, reiterate our call for the U.S. government to return to this process. At the same time, regardless of whether it does, we urge the Council to scrutinize the U.S. human rights record. Is it in the U.S. interest to be in the same camp as Nicaragua’s government rejecting UN norms? I think not. But nor is it in the interest of the Human Rights Council or its members to give the United States a free pass. With or without U.S. government representation, the UPR for the United States should proceed during this 4th cycle.

HRF’s views on the current U.S. human rights record

For those of you who may not know Human Rights First, we were founded in New York almost 50 years ago as the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights. A longstanding, core element of our non-partisan work has been defending refugee and immigrant rights through individual representation of people seeking asylum, impact litigation, and broader policy advocacy and research.

Through pro bono asylum representation, we have seen first-hand the impact of federal government action on the everyday lives of asylum seekers, refugees, and immigrants in the United States. Thus, I will focus my remarks on these issues.

Since the last UPR, respect for the rights of people seeking asylum or safety in the United States has been consistently eroded. However, things have taken an even sharper downward turn in the past ten months since the Trump administration took office on January 20.

In April of this year, we contributed to two joint civil society submissions—numbers 12 and 49—as part of this UPR cycle that focused on extensive, escalating U.S. human rights abuses against people seeking asylum, refugees, and immigrants.

As succinctly summarized in one of those submissions (Joint Statement 49):

[quote] “The United States continues to violate the human rights of non-citizens through mass detention, denial of due process, abusive and discriminatory policing, labor exploitation, and suppression of civic space.” [unquote]

I would like to drill down on three core areas of concern for Human Rights First with respect to refugee and immigrant rights.

The first area is mass detention. In recent years billions of dollars have been injected to supercharge the U.S. government’s campaign of mass detention of immigrants and people seeking asylum. In 2025, this detention machine grew to unprecedented levels with Congress appropriating to the U.S. federal agency Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) $45 billion for detention operations over the next four years. This is a 400% annual increase and larger than the budget for the entire U.S. federal prison system. An additional $30 billion was put towards ICE’s enforcement and deportation operations, increasing its annual budget three-fold.

The current U.S. government’s goal of “deporting millions of people” has led to the daily detention of over 60,000 people as of the end of August in an infrastructure with a maximum capacity for holding 41,500 people. To expand detention capacity, the United States incarcerates immigrants facing deportation in federal prisons, temporary processing sites and military bases, such as the offshore U.S. navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Moreover, over 90% of the U.S. immigration detention system is run by private prison companies, which are incentivized to maximize profits by understaffing facilities, denying minimally nutritious food and sanitation, and coercing manual labor from detainees. The result? Detainees sleeping on floors. And 25 deaths in ICE custody so far in 2025—the deadliest year in ICE’s history.

This massive deportation operation has also resulted in the unlawful detention of U.S. citizens. While the U.S. government does not track how many U.S. citizens ICE detains, an independent investigation found at least 170 U.S. citizens, including 20 children, have been detained at raids or protests since the start of this administration. At least three of those citizens were pregnant at the time ICE detained them. Two of the U.S. citizen children had cancer.

While detained, people are routinely held incommunicado—untraceable by the public and unable to communicate with the outside world, including family and attorneys. This amounts to what we believe are enforced disappearances under international law. In 2024, the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances issued General Allegations to the U.S. government for its practice of disappearing migrants in Customs and Border Protection (CBP) custody. Prior to being expelled or removed, some were pressured or forced to sign documents that in some cases they could not even see because they were shown a blank signature line on a screen. These problems have only gotten worse under the Trump administration.

We have also witnessed the Trump administration’s deeply troubling decision to revive the failed and inhumane policy of family detention, by reopening the Dilley family jail in South Texas. This facility is notorious for family separations, abusive, and subpar conditions. Medical experts have long warned that detaining families causes lasting and often irreversible harm particularly to the children, triggering severe health and developmental consequences—including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, developmental regression, suicidal thoughts, weight loss, sleep disruption, and recurring illness. These warnings have become devastatingly real at Dilley: a six-year-old child battling leukemia missed critical treatments while in custody; an infant lost eight pounds in just one month; and an eight-year-old with a broken arm was not taken to the emergency room because, according to detention staff, he “was not crying.”

A second major concern is U.S. denial of due process to migrants, which occurs through bans on asylum and refugee status, mass arrests, summary deportations, forced third country transfers, and denials of entry and residence due to racial and national origin discrimination.

In a series of regulations and executive proclamations issued by the second Trump administration, the United States systematically denies non-refoulement protection to non-citizens. A January 2025 presidential proclamation declares a “migrant invasion,” suspends entry at the U.S.-Mexico border for those without a valid visa, and bans asylum and other humanitarian protections. Human Rights First and partners have documented the dire human rights impact of this proclamation. Since January, we have found that DHS has used this Proclamation to deny access to asylum and expel or migrants fleeing countries like Afghanistan, Armenia, Ghana, Iran, Russia, Turkey, Uzbekistan and many others where there are significant human rights abuses.

The Trump administration has also negotiated an ever-growing web of largely undisclosed bilateral arrangements with countries to remove or expel—without reasonable notice—asylum seekers, refugees, people granted withholding of removal, and other migrants. Under these agreements, the administration has carried out escalating and illegal transfers of people to third countries where they have no connection, lack legal status, and face arbitrary detention. They also face refoulement to persecution or torture in their country of origin. Human Rights First has legally challenged these transfers in several cases, although regrettably, the U.S. Supreme Court has allowed them to proceed during our legal challenge.

Among the most egregious third country transfers were the March flights of hundreds of Venezuelans to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador, where the men experienced months of torture and abuse before being refouled to Venezuela. There were also some Salvadoran nationals on these flights, including Kilmar Abrego Garcia who had previously been granted protection from deportation to El Salvador and was eventually returned to the United States.

In other disturbing cases, third-country nationals have been transferred to Eswatini, where they were arbitrarily detained in a maximum-security prison without access to legal counsel; to Costa Rica, where families were detained without access to essential medical or psychological care; and to Ghana, where a Gambian man who had been granted protection in the United States under the Convention Against Torture due to his sexual orientation was sent before being forcibly returned to his home country, where homosexuality is criminalized.

According to Human Rights First’s ICE Flight Monitor—which tracks flights carrying out deportations and many of these third country forced transfers—from January 20 to October 31, 2025, the Trump administration conducted a record 1,700 deportation flights to 76 countries. Among these was the first U.S. deportation flight to Iran (via a layover in Qatar), which reportedly carried political dissidents, a Christian convert, and others who had been denied—or prevented from seeking—asylum. Deportation flights have also increased significantly to repressive countries such as Nicaragua, Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia.

On ICE flights, individuals are typically restrained at the wrists, ankles, and waist, even during multi-country routes that often last more than 30—or even 50—hours. Some individuals have been forcibly restrained in straitjackets, preventing them from moving their arms, standing, or even shifting position—a measure that medical experts warn can cause severe physical and psychological distress.

Third, and finally, the Trump administration has sought to use immigration law in ways that clearly deny the right to freedom of expression of non-citizens in the United States. For instance, we are proud to represent Yunseo Chung—a young woman originally from South Korea who came to the United States with her family when she was only seven years old and has permanent resident status. The U.S. government sought to detain and deport her because of her peaceful participation in pro-Palestinian protests. Fortunately, a federal judge issued a ruling blocking the United States from detaining her while we litigate to defend her First Amendment right to free expression. Similarly, the Trump administration has authorized the revocation of or denial of visas merely because of non-citizens’ alleged engagement in discourse with which it disagrees, including pro-Palestinian speech or criticism of slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Recommendations

In closing, and in response to many of the wide-ranging concerns I have just detailed, Human Rights First recommends the following:

The United States must comply with its non-refoulement obligations under international law not to return or facilitate the return of persons to countries where they would face a threat to their life or freedom or torture.

The United States must comply with U.S. law and allow persons at its border or on its territory to apply for asylum and provide them with a fair, non-discriminatory and adequately resourced process for adjudicating their claims.

The United States should end its mass arrest and detention campaign of people seeking asylum and migrants, including families and unaccompanied children, and ensure that detention is only used as a last resort.

The United States should cease the deportation and expulsion of migrants and people seeking asylum to third countries.

The United States should end the revocation of legal status, removal, or denial of entry to persons solely based on protected expression.

A: A Democratic proposal would restore almost $5 billion in unused funding for foreign aid that President Donald Trump let expire on Sept. 30. The proposal did not specify which international projects should receive the funds.

FULL ANSWER

During the government shutdown, House Speaker Mike Johnson has said that Democrats’ demands include “up to $5 billion … for wasteful spending for international projects,” listing specific amounts for civic engagement or “LGBTQI+ democracy grants.” Asked about those projects, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told a reporter he had “no idea what you’re talking about.”

Democratic lawmakers’ temporary funding bill, which amounts to $1.5 trillion over 10 years, did call for restoring about $5 billion approved by Congress for foreign assistance that the Trump administration allowed to expire. However, the Democrats’ proposal didn’t request that the funding be spent on specific projects.

Several readers have asked us about these claims, which have also circulated on social media, including in posts by other Republican lawmakers.

Reasons for the Shutdown

The government has been shut down since Oct. 1 because congressional Republicans and Democrats are at an impasse.

Republicans want to pass a “clean” continuing resolution to temporarily fund the government with no strings attached. Meanwhile, Democrats primarily want Republicans to agree to a funding bill that would extend the enhanced Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies that expire this year and reverse certain Medicaid changes that became law with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

But some Republicans have said that Democrats have other motives.

In an Oct. 14 press conference about the shutdown, Johnson said that a counterproposal offered by Democrats “would restore up to $5 billion of American taxpayer funds for wasteful spending for international projects.” He then listed examples of spending requests that he said were “in their legislation.”

“They want to spend $24.6 million of your hard-earned dollars as a taxpayer for climate resilience in Honduras. They want to spend $13.4 million for civic engagement in Zimbabwe. They want to send $3.9 million for LGBTQI+ democracy grants in the Western Balkans. They want to spend $2.9 million of your dollars for desert locust risk reduction in the Horn of Africa, and $2 million for ‘organizing for feminist democratic principles in Africa.’

“We are not doing that,” Johnson said.

The issue also came up when a reporter from a conservative news outlet asked Jeffries about the purported spending requests during an Oct. 22 press conference held by House Democrats.

“Can you speak to some of the programs that Democrats want funding for in the $1.5 trillion list of demands?” the reporter asked, referring to an estimate of the total 10-year cost of the continuing resolution proposed by Democrats. “We’ve heard things like $13.4 million for civic engagement in Zimbabwe, $3.9 million for LGBTQ democracy grants in the Balkans, things like this. You guys say this is about saving health care, but how do these pet projects fit in?”

Jeffries responded dismissively: “We have no idea what you’re talking about, or what Republican extremist fed you those talking points. But the reality is, what we are doing is defending the health care of the American people.”

While there is a basis for the claim that Democrats want to restore billions of dollars in canceled foreign aid, Republicans have gone too far in stating that Democrats have demanded specific projects around the world be funded with the money.

Trump’s Rescission Request

The issue began when the White House notified Congress on Aug. 28 that Trump planned to rescind nearly $5 billion in unobligated foreign aid funds through a maneuver known as a “pocket rescission.”

The standard rescission process gives Congress 45 days to act on a president’s request to withhold funds appropriated by Congress. If Congress doesn’t act in that time, the funds must be spent. However, a pocket rescission happens when the request to cancel funds is made less than 45 days before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, making it more likely that the deadline to spend the money (Sept. 30) would occur before Congress responds.

The rescission package that Trump submitted to Congress listed the budget amounts that were proposed for cancellation, the government accounts holding those funds, and examples of international projects that have been funded from those accounts, including some of the projects highlighted by Johnson. The White House called it “government spending that is woke, weaponized, and wasteful.”

For instance, Trump asked to withhold nearly $3.2 billion in budget authority authorized for the U.S. Agency for International Development’s account for Development Assistance, which the proposal said “is intended to fund programs that work to promote resilient societies, but in practice has done the opposite.” The document listed “$24.6 million to build climate resilience in Honduras” and “$13.4 million for civic engagement in Zimbabwe” as examples of what it called “wasteful” spending from that account.

Democrats responded by arguing that the president’s pocket rescission was illegal, and a U.S. District Court judge agreed. But the Supreme Court on Sept. 26, in a preliminary 6-3 ruling along ideological lines, said that the president could continue withholding the unused funds.

What Democrats Proposed

Before that Supreme Court ruling, Democrats, in their own continuing resolution introduced on Sept. 17, proposed that the almost $5 billion the White House froze be extended for the State Department to spend in fiscal year 2026, which began Oct. 1. That’s the same legislation that also proposes permanently extending the Affordable Care Act enhanced subsidies and undoing changes that Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act made to the Medicaid program.

But contrary to Republican claims that the Democrats are pushing to fund projects in Honduras, the Balkans and parts of Africa, the Democratic proposal doesn’t stipulate which foreign projects would have to be funded with the money.

“The Democrat-backed fiscal year 2026 continuing resolution would not automatically fund those specific projects, but it would provide funding for the State Department and foreign aid accounts from which those projects received funding in the past,” Joshua Sewell, director of research and policy for Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan government watchdog for fiscal responsibility, told us in an email.

“It would create a situation where Congress provides additional funding that the administration will likely attempt to not spend over the next year,” he said.

To avoid a similar scenario in the future, the bill proposed by Democrats included a provision that would prevent the president from being able to make future rescissions in the 90 days prior to when the approved funding is set to expire.

If Congress voted to make the roughly $5 billion available for spending in the 2026 fiscal cycle, it would be the Trump administration that would control which foreign projects receive funding, a House Democratic aide told us.

The aide said that the Biden administration had “awarded specific programs” based on “broad direction” given by Congress on how appropriated funds could be used, and that the grants mentioned by Johnson and others “have been terminated already” by the Trump administration. Extending the availability of funds that had not been obligated would make those dollars eligible for use based on the “original purposes and conditions” set by Congress, the aide said.

“The Trump Administration would then get to decide what kind of programs and countries they wanted to focus on,” the aide explained.

The office of Sen. Patty Murray, who introduced the Democratic continuing resolution along with Rep. Rosa DeLauro, previously criticized the Trump White House for “citing cherry-picked examples of past projects and initiatives that it finds objectionable” to excuse suspending approved funding for foreign assistance.

“The reality is this administration has flexibility to determine how exactly to fulfill the objectives provided by Congress for this funding — just as any administration does,” Murray’s office said in late August, after Trump’s pocket rescission was submitted to Congress.

Johnson’s Explanation

When we reached out to Johnson’s office, a spokesperson defended his claims, saying in a statement: “The Speaker has clearly and accurately stated what is plainly written in Democrats’ own proposal which includes a demand that President Trump’s rescissions be removed so Democrats can go back to spending $5 billion in American taxpayer funds on wasteful woke projects in other countries. The Democrats’ own appropriations website acknowledges this fact, stating that their CR ‘extends the availability of the funds at issue.’”

It’s true that the continuing resolution would extend the availability of the funds that Trump withheld, but not necessarily for the specific foreign projects cited by Johnson and others.",https://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/capitol_dome.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 14:01:39.190342

The 13 search-and-rescue organisations described their decision as a rejection of mounting pressure by the EU, and Italy in particular, to share information with the Libyan coastguard, which receives training, equipment and funding from the EU.

In an effort to reduce the number of people arriving in Europe, the EU has long faced accusations of ignoring widespread abuse and systematic human rights violations against people in Libya.

In 2021, a UN investigation found that migrants, asylum-seekers and refugees in Libya were subjected to a “litany of abuses” in detention centres and at the hands of traffickers, with one member of the mission noting that the findings were “suggestive of crimes against humanity”.

This week, the search-and-rescue organisations described the Libyan coastguard as an “illegitimate actor at sea”, noting that Libya was not a place of safety for refugees.

“We have never recognised these actors as a legitimate rescue authority – they are part of a violent regime enabled by the EU,” said Ina Friebe, of the German activist group CompassCollective, in a joint statement put out by the 13 organisations.

“Now we are increasingly being pressured to communicate with exactly these actors. This must stop,” she said. “Ending all operational communication with the so-called Libyan Rescue Coordination Center is both a legal and moral necessity – a clear line against European complicity in crimes against humanity.”

The organisations acknowledged that the decision could result in them facing fines, detentions and the confiscation of their rescue vessels.

Giulia Messmer, of Berlin-based Sea-Watch, said: “It is not only our right but our duty to treat armed militias as such in our operational communication – not as legitimate actors in search-and-rescue operations.”

In the past 10 years, rescue organisations operating in the Mediterranean have saved more than 155,000 people from drowning.

In doing so, they have come under increased pressure; campaigners have criticised an escalating crackdown on them by Italy, where hardline rules have blocked vessels from leaving port for a collective total of more than 700 days, while in August, Libya’s coastguard was accused of firing on a vessel belonging to SOS Méditerranée.

A report published last month by Sea-Watch accused the Libyan coastguard of 54 violent incidents since 2016, including shootings, ramming vessels, and threatening and assaulting people in distress.

The search-and-rescue organisations said this week that they had launched a new alliance, the Justice Fleet, whose website would track incidents involving the Libyan coastguard and compile information on legal cases pursued by the NGOs.

Their efforts took on added urgency Wednesday morning after the mayoral win of Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist whom Mr. Trump has sought to elevate into his new political foil.

The preparations — among activists, business leaders and Gov. Kathy Hochul’s office — have included private meetings to discuss lawsuits, the formation of rapid-response groups and multiple phone calls with the New Yorkers’ counterparts in Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington, D.C.

The backroom mobilization comes at an especially fraught time in the city and is the first test of a key question: Will Mr. Trump try to turn New York, his hometown and a place where he retains property and political allies, into another urban battleground over federal power?

Or could his deep ties to New York businessmen and real estate developers help prevent, or at least curb, an aggressive federal incursion into the city’s affairs?

Jackie Bray, one of Ms. Hochul’s top advisers, has led much of the state planning, peppering officials in other cities with questions to craft New York’s response. And leaders from New York City’s real estate and business sectors are planning to meet again next week, at Ms. Hochul’s request.

Kathryn S. Wylde, the chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, which represents much of the city’s corporate leadership, said that she had spoken with her counterparts in San Francisco, where business executives persuaded Mr. Trump not to send in federal agents last month.

“We certainly have taken note and discussed with San Francisco their successful strategy,” Ms. Wylde said.

On Thursday, a Trump administration official said that the president was invested in New York’s success but had no confidence in Mr. Mamdani’s ability to lead the city.

Trump officials are exploring ways to curtail federal funding to the city and have begun discussing what an immigration enforcement operation in New York would look like, should Mr. Trump order one, the official said.

“President Trump cares deeply about the safety and security of all New Yorkers,” Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement. “This shouldn’t be controversial, even for a communist, though we won’t get ahead of the president on any potential announcements.”

Drawing Lessons From Other Cities

In August, not long after federal agents descended on Los Angeles, Mr. Trump publicly mused about whether to send federal troops to Chicago or New York next.

Ms. Bray said New York would probably follow the lead of other Democratic states and sue the Trump administration if it tried to deploy the National Guard there. The focus, she said, was on preparing local and state police forces for the likelihood that federal agencies would cut off communication with them if deployed to New York.

“What we’ve heard, without exception, from both California and now from Illinois is that the feds get direction to stop communicating with state and local law enforcement,” Ms. Bray, who is the commissioner of the Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services, said in an interview.

There is an expectation, among business leaders, that the city’s major developers could intervene because of their relationships with Mr. Trump and New York businessmen who advise him. Those advisers include Howard Lutnick, the secretary of commerce; Steve Witkoff, a top diplomat; and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law.

Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, has warned against the deployment of the National Guard, saying crime is under control and that it “would send the wrong message.”

Jessica Tisch, the police commissioner, also spoke out in September: “As a lifelong New Yorker, I am revolted by the idea of the militarization of our streets.”

The city has provided more than $123 million to legal service providers this year, hoping that they won’t be stretched if detained migrants are scouring for lawyers.

But amid a mayoral transition, Ms. Hochul, a Democrat, appears to be taking the lead in preparing for a possible federal deployment. Ms. Wylde said that made sense, noting “the number of challenges the governor has been able to resolve quietly and effectively with the president.”

Organizing After the Canal Street Raid

The preparations picked up after more than 50 federal agents spread out on Canal Street last month. They arrested nine men, most of whom were West African, accusing them of being in the country illegally.

It was quickly seen as an example of street raids that could become common.

The daytime strike, on a thoroughfare teeming with tourists, was among the largest in the city this year, but it was supposed to have been even bigger, according to three people familiar with the raid’s planning.

The federal government had amassed more than 100 officers to conduct the raid, on sidewalks long known for vendors who sell counterfeit wares, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private deliberations.

But, in a previously unreported complication, the operation was scaled back after the news media learned about it, giving many vendors the opportunity to disperse.

Along New York’s immigrant arteries, from the Chinese and Mexican enclaves of Sunset Park to the Latino precincts in Corona and Jackson Heights, neighborhood groups have sprung into action.

Smaller raids in those pockets by Immigration and Customs Enforcement have served as dry runs for what many undocumented immigrants anticipate could grow into bigger roundups.

America’s proposed deportation of Abrego García to Liberia in the 21st century would be neither voluntary nor defensible, especially since he has explicitly requested relocation to Costa Rica instead.
By agreeing to host Abrego García, Liberia has not only subjected itself to legal wrangling but also compromised its humanitarian credibility despite making vague assurances about consulting “relevant national and international stakeholders”.
Since Liberia has one of the highest US visa rejection rates in the world, the new extension policy may have been an allowance for agreeing to host Abrego García.
Washington’s recent proposal to deport Abrego García to Monrovia is the latest blunder in US-Liberia relations.","When Liberia announced late last month that it would temporarily host Salvadoran national Kilmar Armando Abrego García on “humanitarian grounds” if he were deported by the Trump administration for a second time, the West African country was broadcasting its unique history as a haven for Black migrants fleeing racism and economic servitude in the United States.

According to the Liberian government, the decision to welcome Abrego García, who was unlawfully deported from the United States in March only to return under a court injunction in June, follows its “longstanding tradition of offering refuge to those in need”.

Liberia was once a semi-autonomous territory funded in part by the Washington, DC-based American Colonisation Society (ACS) comprising powerful white men who viewed free Blacks as a threat to slavery and saw emigration (deportation) as the only solution to dispose of them. Its founders – repatriates from the US and Caribbean who joined recaptives (Africans rescued aboard illegal slave ships) from the Congo River basin – rebuffed ACS largesse and declared the country independent in 1847.

The free and formerly enslaved Blacks who founded Liberia were not unlike Abrego García, who has become an international symbol of the dangers of presidential overreach. They, too, were pawns in white America’s bid to “make America white again” – as if it ever were just white – through the framing of Black and brown bodies as undesirable, threatening and therefore disposable.

But the similarities end there. America once deported migrants of colour to Liberia, but not like this.

Although Trump’s impetus for mass expulsions – anti-migrant racism – aligns with the anti-Black bigotry of ACS agents who had deportationist sensibilities, Black people who opted to settle in Liberia did so primarily of their own volition. In fact, many paid for their emigration to West Africa in the 19th century.

America’s proposed deportation of Abrego García to Liberia in the 21st century would be neither voluntary nor defensible, especially since he has explicitly requested relocation to Costa Rica instead. His high-profile case represents a litmus test for upholding due process and respecting human rights under Trump-era MAGA mania. By agreeing to host Abrego García, Liberia has not only subjected itself to legal wrangling but also compromised its humanitarian credibility despite making vague assurances about consulting “relevant national and international stakeholders”.

It is the latest country in Africa – a continent previously described in pejorative terms by Trump – to cave in to the first felon-in-chief’s coercive tactics. The irony is that, as a convict himself, Trump, too, would be deported if he were a migrant of colour.

Africa a ‘dumping ground’ for deportees from America

The vast majority of countries under pressure to receive deportees from America are African. Eight men arrived in South Sudan in July after the majority-conservative US Supreme Court authorised their expulsion. As weeks of court disputes ensued thousands of miles away, nationals of Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, South Sudan and Vietnam were held under American military guard in a converted shipping container in Djibouti.

Flights carrying other Black and brown deportees to Africa have followed in quick succession. In mid-July, after “months of robust high-level engagements”, five convicts from Cuba, Jamaica, Laos, Vietnam and Yemen were banished to the small, landlocked kingdom of Eswatini in Southern Africa. Shortly after, in mid-August, seven deportees arrived in the post-genocide central African country of Rwanda, which has in recent years positioned itself as an outpost for migrants expelled from Euro-America.

Deportation to third countries in Africa – or anywhere else for that matter – without due process is clearly a violation of human rights, even if the United States justifies ridding itself of alleged criminals by any means. Before enlisting Liberia’s cooperation most recently, the White House had been aggressively courting countries as diverse as Uganda, Libya, Gabon, Guinea-Bissau and Mauritania to host Abrego García. All of them are in Africa, and heads of state from the latter three countries attended Trump’s US-Africa summit held in July.

It appears the carrot of possibly benefiting from American commercial diplomacy followed the stick of accepting its deportees. But not all countries in Africa have complied when urged to do so. For instance, Nigeria – considered West Africa’s regional powerhouse – refused to kowtow to Trump, citing national security concerns. If a powerful ally can snub Washington’s request, why would its continental neighbours acquiesce?

What’s in it for Liberia – and Africa?

Although negotiations between the Trump administration and African governments have been largely shrouded in secrecy, countries that opt to take in deportees surely must be leveraging this diplomatically to secure concessions of their own, including the removal of US visa bans, the elimination of punishing tariffs, and the extraction of critical minerals for profit to power American technology ambitions.

Liberia appears to have been rewarded for its compliance. Following bilateral meetings held in October between American Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Liberian Foreign Minister Sara Beysolow Nyanti, Washington announced that, effectively immediately, it would extend the validity of certain non-immigrant visas issued to Liberians from one to three years with multiple entries permitted. This was a privilege Monrovia granted American citizens, but reciprocal arrangements were halted during Liberia’s protracted armed conflict from 1989 to 2003. Since Liberia has one of the highest US visa rejection rates in the world, the new extension policy may have been an allowance for agreeing to host Abrego García.

Washington’s inclusion of Monrovia in the much-touted US-Africa summit held this July may have been prompted by Liberia’s signing of a concession and access agreement with American mineral exploration company Ivanhoe Atlantic. Pending legislative approval, the 1.8 billion-dollar agreement would enable Ivanhoe to export Guinea’s iron ore using Liberia’s rail corridor. US companies have a chequered history in Liberia, though, so the concession has generated worthy speculation about its feasibility.

Despite the faulty assumption that Liberia has a “special relationship” with the United States, America’s contempt for the West African nation knows no bounds. The US was one of the last countries to recognise Liberia’s independence – in 1862. American companies Firestone and LAMCO pillaged Liberia’s rubber and iron ore for decades with the complicity of local elites. US Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen dismissed Liberia as being of “no strategic interest” when war ravaged the country in the 1990s. And Trump asked Liberia’s President Joseph Boakai where he learned to speak “such good English” during a cringeworthy White House exchange in July.

Washington’s recent proposal to deport Abrego García to Monrovia is the latest blunder in US-Liberia relations.

If Trump were alive in the 1800s, he probably would have found affinity with deportationists of the American Colonisation Society. But we’re no longer in the 19th century. As a country that “historically extended protection and goodwill to individuals and communities needing assistance”, Liberia would do well to remember that it is a sovereign nation whose policy decisions must not be shaped by the whims of racist white men.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ap_690dda000e3c1-1762515456.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-11-07 12:58:05.450515

The leaders shared recent developments in the ongoing federal immigration crackdown and how local governments are working to uphold human rights standards in their communities.

Mayor Johnson detailed the City’s efforts within the Protecting Chicago Initiative to ensure residents are well-versed in their Constitutional rights and that local law enforcement adheres to Chicago’s Welcoming City Ordinance. The Mayor also shared how Chicagoans have organized Rapid Response networks to verify sightings of federal agents, prevent the spread of disinformation, and keep their communities safe.

While the Trump administration refuses to cooperate with international oversight, in recent weeks federal agents in Chicago have deployed tear gas on a children’s Halloween parade, placed residents in chokeholds, zip-tied young children and removed them from their homes in the middle of the night, shot pepper balls at journalists, and, violently detained a teacher at a daycare center.

“I might not ever be able to say bye or see them again if you guys don’t side with us,"" he said. ""And I’m scared because of it, because they fought so hard to come here and choose a life for their kids.”

The meeting consisted of three hours of public testimony from Hillsboro residents about their fears and frustrations over ICE’s controversial enforcement as part of President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration, NBC affiliate KGW and the Hillsboro News Times reported.

Trump was reelected in part on a sweeping pledge to focus on illegal immigration, including vowing to conduct “the largest deportation operation in the history of our country.”

But the implementation of that enforcement has sparked near-constant controversy, amid reports of U.S. citizens being swept up, families divided and more.

The White House insists its policies are about law enforcement.

""We don't want to have to be in the position where people are being arrested and detained. But if they're in this country illegally and they don't leave now, that's what we're forced to do,"" Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary with the Department of Homeland Security, told NPR in April.

Critics have decried what they call callousness and cruelty based on ethnicity.

This week, Washington County, where Hillsboro is located, declared a state of emergency due to the growing immigration enforcement, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported. The declaration enables the county to set aside $200,000 in contingency funds to help impacted residents.

At the city council meeting on Tuesday, Manny, in his emotional testimony, urged council members to oppose the federal enforcement.

“I hope you guys do side with us because we are fighting for our rights,” he said, “and we are getting treated like animals because people judge us by the color of our skin and the way that we talk.”

“I’m scared that all of us are going to have to fend for ourselves,” he also said. “I’m scared that one day at school that I’m going to be held by [officers] I don’t know — people that are covered, people that I can’t identify because they wear masks and they don’t properly ID themselves.”

“I’m tired of telling my mom and dad every day after school, ‘Have you seen the new video of ICE pulling someone over because of the color of their skin?’ … I really hope you guys do something about it, because I do want something to change,” Manny said. “As a 16-year-old, I shouldn’t be scared. I should be focusing on school.”

Manny’s remarks drew cheers from the audience, and two city council members stood up in applause. Clips of him speaking soon went viral on social media.

PEOPLE contacted Hillsboro officials and DHS on Thursday, Nov. 6, for comment about Tuesday’s city council meeting in Hillsboro but did not immediately hear back.

Thursday saw a small crowd of protestors at a Deerfield-area intersection. Protesters said they were responding to reports that federal agents were being housed at a local hotel.

One of the organizers of the event, Highland Park resident David Borris, is a member of North Shore Says No!, an organization formed in response to news that Naval Station Great Lakes might be used as housing for federal immigration enforcement efforts. Since then, members have regularly met at overpasses in the region for “visibility events,” he said.

Borris claimed that they and other area organizations had “99% confirmed” the presence of federal agents at the hotel, including through the use of a database of license plates seen on federal immigration enforcement vehicles that matched several in the hotel’s parking lot.

In response to questions about whether agents are being housed at hotels or similar facilities due to a shortage of official housing options for agents, and if the agency had any comments about previous or future protests occurring at such locations, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin declined to discuss where or how federal agents are being housed while working in the area.

“Our agents are facing a 1000% increase in assaults and an 8000% increase in death threats against them, and you want us to reveal where they sleep?” McLaughlin said. “You’re insane.”

Borris railed against the federal government’s immigration enforcement efforts, which have sparked widespread protests across the country and in the Chicago area.

Lake County has found itself caught up in the larger Operation Midway Blitz, a surge of immigration law enforcement in the area meant to target “criminal illegal aliens,” according to the DHS under President Donald Trump.

Over a recent weekend, Lake County saw at least a dozen people arrested by federal agents, according to community organizers. A DHS spokesperson said in an email that the “illegal aliens” arrested in Lake County came from El Salvador, Mexico and Nicaragua. They had criminal backgrounds. DHS did not provide the names of the detainees so their criminal histories could be confirmed, or where any crimes took place.

Borris said the immigration enforcement has been “destroying families” with few of the benefits Trump has talked about. The “cruelty is the point,” Borris said.

While Borris is a longtime activist on several issues, he noted he was seeing people at events who have “never held a protest sign” until this year. As more people feel the need to protest, he said his organization gives people a place for their outrage while connecting them with other activists.

“People understand viscerally that the emergency is here,” Borris said. “Who’s left to stem the tide? We are the ones we’ve been waiting for. People feel that.”

The small crowd of protesters carried signs and cheered as motorists driving by honked their horns in support. The group included 78-year-old Sally Nador, a retired psychologist from Wilmette who was wearing an inflatable giraffe costume.

“What’s going on is just plain wrong,” she said. “We’re a country of immigrants.”

Referring to the federal agents, Nador said, “They shouldn’t be here.”

The retiree said it was “comforting” to see others out protesting.

“It helps to not be alone in these sorts of things,” Nador said.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ctc-l-ice-agent-protest002.jpg?w=1024&h=744,N,,2025-11-07 14:01:47.977559

“It’s heartbreaking.” Image: Canton, Mississippi ICE raid (via Department of Homeland Security)","The specter of race is never far removed from America’s immigration system. Last week, President Donald Trump lowered the nation’s annual refugee cap from 125,000 to just 7,500, reserving most of those slots for white South Africans fleeing what he described as “political persecution.” It was the latest iteration of an immigration system that, since Trump’s inauguration, has favored whiteness and overtly targeted people of color.

Nowhere is that imbalanced system more visible than in Mississippi and Louisiana, where race and geography have converged to shape the harshest immigration outcomes in the country.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have carried out more arrests of non-residents per capita in Mississippi than anywhere else, while Louisiana’s cluster of ICE detention centers serves as the nation’s primary immigrant holding cell. A huge chunk of all detained immigrants in the United States pass through a rural Southern corridor between Mississippi and Louisiana known by lawyers and activists as detention alley.

After immigrants are transported to these exclusively for-profit detention centers—hours from any major city—most are left to navigate a complex legal system with little or no representation. The facilities’ isolation, paired with some of the nation’s most conservative judges and hindrances promoted by White House policy, makes release or relief exceedingly rare.

It starts with ICE

The result is a system that punishes not only status but skin color and zip code, which in the South can be tantamount to a sentence of deportation. While the region has far fewer immigrants than other coastal states, the path through its immigration system appears to be far more punishing.

“It’s abundantly clear at this point that ICE carries out its mandate through racial profiling,” said Michelle LaPointe, the Georgia-based legal director of the American Immigration Council, a Washington D.C.-based advocacy group. “This happens all the time in smaller locales and places around the Southeast, but we don’t hear about it because ICE doesn’t make as many big, splashy, high-profile raids there.”

“But it’s only getting worse under this administration,” she added.

Mississippi has around 70,000 foreign-born residents, yet ICE officers in the state have been exceptionally aggressive in 2025, according to UCLA study of ICE arrests. Between February and June 2025, Mississippi recorded the nation’s highest per-capita rate of ICE arrests, at 21 arrests per 1,000 residents, compared with the next highest rate of 16 in West Virginia and less than one in Oregon (which is in last place).

That means a non-citizen in Mississippi is roughly 30 times more likely to be arrested than in Oregon.

According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, its immigration agencies do not collect racial data, a bureaucratic omission that has allowed the agency to sidestep questions of bias, even as lawsuits and advocacy groups have claimed a clear pattern of racial targeting.

As to why ICE is arresting so many immigrants in Mississippi, LaPointe believes it’s connected to the high levels of cooperation between ICE and southern law enforcement.

“There are many state and local law-enforcement agencies in places like Mississippi and Louisiana willing to help ICE make arrests, more so than in other parts of the country,” LaPointe said. “That arrangement is a big part of the ongoing story of being an immigrant in the South.”

In Mississippi, where roughly 45 percent of the population is nonwhite, profiling has a long history. LaPointe notes that ICE officers routinely target people based on appearance, language and location, and claims they focus raids on industries dominated by immigrants of color.

This indiscriminate strategy of arrest, fueled by Homeland Security arrest quotas and a recent Supreme Court decision that broadened ICE’s authority to racially profile, has swept tens of thousands into detention. While the policy has been effective at executing Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda, it has eroded constitutional protections, with consequences that reach beyond the undocumented. A ProPublica investigation found that ICE agents arrested 170 U.S. citizens, most of whom were Hispanic in appearance, with some accused of forging their own proof of citizenship.

Though ICE arrests reveal that racial bias most visibly, the discrimination only deepens once those same immigrants enter detention facilities and the courts, where outcomes hinge on politics and discretion.

Rural detention, vanishing hope

For those caught in ICE’s dragnet, isolation in the Deep South’s array of private detention centers has become an effective deterrent to fighting back.

“The jails are in the middle of nowhere,” said Assma Ali, a nationally renowned immigration attorney based in Ridgeland, Mississippi. “Because of that, you’re limited in access to attorneys, especially in Mississippi.”

Nearly every immigrant detained in Mississippi is ultimately transferred to either Louisiana’s network of for-profit detention centers or to Mississippi’s Adams County Correctional Center in Natchez, the country’s largest immigration detention center. According to court documents (which represent one side of a legal argument), Cameroonian asylum seekers detained at the Adams County facility were allegedly tortured until they signed deportation papers waiving their right to hearings.

Inside these detention facilities, according to LaPointe, conditions are grim, with documented evidence of poor food, undrinkable water and scarce medical care. The result, LaPointe said, is a perfect storm that breaks people down psychologically and “discourages them from fighting their cases and makes it easier for the government to get them to self deport.”

In effect, ICE has built a system whose harshest impacts fall on those least able to fight back.

Between Mississippi and Louisiana, 20 facilities hold detainees, nine of which are dedicated detention centers run by GEO Group, CoreCivic or LaSalle Corrections. All are located within a few hours of Baton Rouge or New Orleans—the places with greater access to lawyers who might defend those held inside. The Adams County Detention facility is also located in a rural setting.

“I think ICE deliberately sends them to Mississippi and Louisiana to get them away from friendlier jurisdictions where they have greater access to counsel,” LaPointe said. “That’s why you’ll find people there from all over--New York, D.C., everywhere.”

LaPointe believes the strategy is both psychological and logistical. “If detainees don’t understand the law or their rights, they’re easier to coerce into self-deporting,” she said.

Once the detainees reach Louisiana, the need for legal help becomes acute. More than 80 percent of those sent to the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center in 2025 were deported, according to a Los Angeles Times analysis of detainee movements. A fifth of all deportations this year passed through the Alexandria Staging Facility in central Louisiana.

The location of where a detainee ends up can be extremely important.

Nearly 80 percent of immigrants who appear before a Louisiana immigration judge are detained, compared with just 30 percent nationally, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), a Syracuse University-based organization that collects immigration data.

In conservative states, the figures are uniformly high: 71 percent in Arizona, 63 percent in Georgia, 53 percent in Texas. In liberal states, it plunges to less than 5 percent in New York, New Jersey and Maryland, according to the data set.

Inside the facilities, the despair runs deep.

“Some are very, very depressed, like, very depressed,” noted Ali, who said she limits her detention caseload because of the emotional toll. “They look around and see everyone losing their cases. They become hopeless. They deteriorate.”

Access to counsel, which is far easier in major cities, collapses entirely in rural regions. Visits can take a full day of travel. Phone calls take days to arrange and usually last less than an hour, and detainees often have no access to their own evidence, LaPointe said.

Of the 9,954 pending immigration cases tied to Mississippi as of 2025, slightly more than half have no legal representation, according to TRAC. Nationwide, more than 85 percent of immigrants issued removal orders in 2025 had no lawyer at all, compared to 40 percent of new detainees in 2025 who had their cases dropped after securing a lawyer.

Representation, notes TRAC, is the single strongest factor determining whether an immigrant wins the right to stay. Yet fewer than 8 percent of detainees had a lawyer at their first court appearance in 2025.

The remoteness of the facilities does more than limit access to lawyers--it shapes the entire legal culture around them. Judges working in isolation, far from public scrutiny or media oversight, often absorb the same punitive assumptions that define the local law-enforcement culture. The result, attorneys say, is a convergence of ideology and location. Courts see more removals not just because detainees lack representation, but because the system itself encourages the denial of relief.

“I think the best way to describe it,” Ali said of southern immigration courts, “is that your chances of winning your case while in one of these places are extremely low, but it depends on what country you’re from.”

Nationally, Central American nationals, especially from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, are detained at far higher rates than immigrants from South America, Asia or Europe, according to TRAC data. Mexicans are detained 57 percent of the time; Venezuelans and Brazilians, between 12 and 18 percent; Russians, Indians and Nigerians, between 5 and 17 percent.

Courts of unequal mercy

Once immigrants enter the court system, they are at the mercy of judicial discretion, which varies dramatically by region.

Reliable national data on immigration court outcomes is notoriously difficult to parse. ICE and the Executive Office for Immigration Review release information in inconsistent formats, often omitting hearing locations and case types, or conflating the location of detention facilities with the location of the court system it falls under. Some immigrants are recorded as having an address in the state they are being detained in rather than the state they were initially arrested.

However, asylum data, the most complete record of immigration decision made available, offers a clearer window into how regional bias shapes outcomes.

While nationwide asylum denials averaged 57.7 percent between 2019 and 2024, according to TRAC, Louisiana judges rejected nearly 97 percent of cases during that time. In Arlington, Texas, one judge denied more than 95 percent of cases. In San Francisco, by contrast, twelve judges granted asylum in more than 90 percent of cases, a stark illustration of how where an immigrant is arrested alone can determine their fate.

That imbalance intensifies at the appeal phase. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which reviews immigration rulings from Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, denies asylum claims at roughly twice the rate of other circuits, reflecting a long-standing ideological tilt that reinforces the region’s already punitive system, according to a 2025 academic study, “Justice by Geography.”

“The precedent in the Fifth Circuit is very harsh,” Ali said. “I never ask for a nice judge. I only ask for a fair one. But fairness is getting harder to find.”

Ali described cases in which “even clients with visible injuries, psychological reports, and expert evidence are denied on credibility grounds.” Discretion, she said, “often comes down to which judge you get, and in the South, that discretion tends to lean one way.” She added: “I will tell you with 99 percent certainty, if they return, they will be harmed in their native country.”

A 2025 UCLA study showed that judges with enforcement backgrounds are far likelier to deny the asylum pattern amplified under Trump, who reshaped the Board of Immigration Appeals by elevating only judges with denial rates of more than 87 percent.

Trump’s policies extended that rigidity to the pretrial phase. An executive order signed in August 2025 sharply limited who could receive bond and applies to longtime residents with families and no criminal record.

Under the new rules, only those who entered legally and later fell out of status are eligible for bond, a distinction that explains why Kasper Eriksen, a white Danish national who overstayed his visa after his wife’s pregnancy complications, was released from detention this spring.

“I don’t have the stats, but the policy means most people are not eligible for bond right now,” Ali said.

Even for those deemed eligible, the financial burden is crushing. TRAC data show most bonds fall between $5,000 and $25,000--sums representing months or years of savings for low-wage immigrant families. Unable to pay, many detainees languish for months, pressured into accepting deportation or plea deals.

The nationality of those who have been awarded bond shows a specific bias.

According to TRAC data, citizens of non-white, non-Western countries were denied bond at far higher rates than those from stereotypically white places. For example, immigrants from countries whose populations are primarily people of color were denied bond at rates between 49.2 percent and 62.3 percent in 2025, while the rate of denials plummet for nationals from Poland, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland and New Zealand.

In instances where a Western country has a low rate of its citizens being granted bond, it also usually has a high rate of withdrawal, meaning the detained person withdrew their application for bond and most likely accepted deportation. Withdrawal rates for Central American nations such as India, China and Cuba were far lower, indicating a reluctance to going home.

While immigrants of color languish in for-profit detention centers, denied bond and asylum at staggering rates, the administration’s new refugee policy openly favors white applicants. Trump officials defended the decision to prioritize white South Africans as an effort to help “victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands.”

Critics describe it as the restoration of a racial hierarchy within American immigration policy.

That hierarchy is visible in the immigration courts of Mississippi and Louisiana, where many detainees appear only by video from remote jails hours away from their lawyers and support networks. The hearings unfold with little public oversight, few lawyers present, and almost no media coverage. In those rooms, or on those screens, a person’s chances often depend less on evidence than on their birthplace, the color of their skin, or the zip code where they were arrested.

“It’s so hard to see,” Ali observed. “It’s heartbreaking.”

Instead, Judge Howell issued an order treating the Chamber/AAU motion as a summary judgement motion and issuing an expedited schedule for the parties' summary judgment briefing.
The Chamber and AAU are allowed to file a reply to the government's arguments, due December 8, 2025.
If the Chamber and AAU prevail, the court could invalidate or enjoin enforcement of the Proclamation nationwide.","Last week brought some clarity to employers about the timeline for federal courts' initial decisions on whether the President can restrict access to H-1B visas by imposing a $100,000 fee on employers seeking to sponsor an employee for an H-1B visa. The judge hearing a legal challenge to that fee ordered that all legal briefing in the case be completed by December 8, giving an early indication of how quickly employers and H-1B visa holders may have clarity about the legality of that fee as they plan for hiring, promotions, or transfers in 2026.

As background, on September 19, President Trump issued Presidential Proclamation 10973, which restricts the entry of certain H-1B workers from outside the United States unless their petitioning employer pays a $100,000 fee to the United States Treasury. Less than a month later, the United States Chamber of Commerce (the Chamber) and the Association of American Universities (AAU) filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia challenging the legality of the Proclamation, asserting that imposing a $100,000 fee violated both the Immigration and Nationality Act, which already specified the fees to be paid for H-1B petitions, and the Constitution, which generally prevents the Executive from imposing fees or taxes without authorization from Congress.

The Chamber and AAU also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, which would be an order from the court pausing the fee while the litigation went on. In the alternative, the motion asked the court to proceed directly to a decision in the case, known as summary judgement, because there were no issues of fact and only issues of law to be decided by the court. The government responded with a request for more time to reply to the motion, pointing to the ongoing government shutdown making it more challenging for the Department of Justice's lawyers to consult with other agencies about the litigation.

Last week, the judge hearing the case, Judge Beryl Howell, issued an order denying the federal government's request to delay briefing. Instead, Judge Howell issued an order treating the Chamber/AAU motion as a summary judgement motion and issuing an expedited schedule for the parties' summary judgment briefing. Judge Howell's willingness to forgo a preliminary injunction hearing and move directly to summary judgement is a good sign that the judge agrees with the Chamber and AAU that there are no disputes about the factual issues in the case. Her order also pointed out that the Chamber and AAU had demonstrated that they face immediate harm from the Proclamation, meaning that she should move the case forward quickly in spite of the shutdown.

Judge Howell's order specifies that the government must file its opposition to summary judgement by November 28, 2025. The Chamber and AAU are allowed to file a reply to the government's arguments, due December 8, 2025. Following completion of briefing, the court will decide whether to hold oral argument, though as noted above, Judge Howell has recognized that the Chamber and AAU have established that they are entitled to prompt judicial review. As such, the judge may be prepared to issue a decision before the end of December.

If the Chamber and AAU prevail, the court could invalidate or enjoin enforcement of the Proclamation nationwide. Regardless of the initial decision, the losing party will have the right of appeal to the District of Columbia Circuit Court. The DC Circuit may allow the Proclamation to stay in effect, or may allow the Proclamation to stay blocked while the litigation proceeds in the DC Circuit. A final decision would then be more than a year away, but Judge Howell's initial decision – and whether the DC Circuit allows that decision to go into effect while it considers the appeal – will provide employers and H-1B visa holders with clarity on how long they will need to be concerned about the Proclamation and its $100,000 fee.

In his virtual remarks, Johnson accused federal agents of targeting Chicago residents through violent raids and described incidents involving tear gas, chokeholds, and the detention of children.
Families torn apart by immigration raids,"" Johnson said.
What's next: Johnson said Chicago will continue local efforts to protect immigrants through its Welcoming City Ordinance and community-led ""Rapid Response"" networks.
Human rights are universal—or they are meaningless… The people of Chicago—and of this nation—deserve a government that honors their dignity, not one that diminishes it.""","Mayor Brandon Johnson testified Friday before the United Nations Human Rights Council, calling on the global body to investigate what he described as human rights violations tied to federal immigration raids and cuts to food aid under President Donald Trump's administration.

What we know:

Johnson joined municipal officials from several U.S. cities, including Philadelphia, Los Angeles and New York, during an event hosted by the ACLU, the Center for Constitutional Rights, and Human Rights First. The group detailed what they said were abusive immigration enforcement practices and the end of food assistance programs during the ongoing government shutdown.

In his virtual remarks, Johnson accused federal agents of targeting Chicago residents through violent raids and described incidents involving tear gas, chokeholds, and the detention of children.

""In Chicago, we live with the consequences of that moral failure every day. Families torn apart by immigration raids,"" Johnson said. ""Raids that have targeted daycare teachers, ride-share drivers, and restaurant cooks. Honest, hardworking, law-abiding people who contribute to the soul of Chicago, who literally make our city run.""

He also criticized cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

""As someone with first-hand experience, I can tell you how humiliating it is when you open the refrigerator and you have nothing to eat. In the wealthiest country in the world, there is no reason why our federal government should allow hundreds of thousands of Chicagoans to go hungry,"" Johnson said.

What's next:

Johnson said Chicago will continue local efforts to protect immigrants through its Welcoming City Ordinance and community-led ""Rapid Response"" networks. He urged the U.N. to apply the same standards of accountability to the United States as it does to other nations.

""We cannot do this alone,"" Johnson told the Council. ""No country should be above international law. Human rights are universal—or they are meaningless… The people of Chicago—and of this nation—deserve a government that honors their dignity, not one that diminishes it.""

The other side:

In its reasoning for the federal immigration crackdown, the Trump administration has said they have a duty to protect U.S. citizens from those who have unlawfully entered the country. As for SNAP, President Trump has said the program would be funded if Democrats worked with Republicans to reopen the government. Meanwhile, a federal judge on Thursday ordered the administration to fully fund the program for the month of November.

Far be it from me as well to say that you can’t tell where the Supreme Court is going based on the questions at oral argument.
If not in this case, for example, it will do so in the birthright citizenship case.
The longer The Situation drags on, the more things the Supreme Court will come to object to, and nobody should find that shocking, or redeeming.
I’ll deal with the tariffs opinion when the justices issue it.","The Situation on Tuesday asked a seemingly simple question about the criminal case against former FBI Director James Comey for allegedly lying to Congress: “Where’s the Lie?”

On Wednesday, the Supreme Court held oral arguments over the president’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose a range of tariffs on countries all over the world.

The argument, as you’ve probably read elsewhere, went not wonderfully for the government. Several key justices seemed skeptical of the arguments of Solicitor General D. John Sauer in defense of the administration.

And this has lots of analysts pronouncing, quite prematurely in my view, that the tariffs are going down.

Far be it from me to say that they are wrong. The conventional wisdom is often right, and it might well be right here too.

Far be it from me as well to say that you can’t tell where the Supreme Court is going based on the questions at oral argument. Because often you can. Despite the shrouds of mystery that accrue to justices, these are not oracles, and they don’t try to be especially delphic most of the time. Often they are pretty transparent, for better or for worse.

And really far be it from me as well to cite this decision—which hasn’t happened yet and may not come down the way the world has decided it will on the basis of a very thin set of reeds—as evidence that the Supreme Court really is less political than the conventional wisdom had concluded it was up until the very moment the oral argument began. The justices operate with a weird, complex mix of genuine principles and methodological commitments, ideology, and politics. That was true before the argument began. It’s true now. And it will be true whichever way they rule in a few months.

With all that said, I have a few things to say about yesterday’s oral argument, which I have now listened to.

My first observation is that it is not remotely surprising that some of the conservative justices—particularly Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch but also Chief Justice John Roberts—had some tough questions for the government.

Gorsuch, in particular, has a genuine and long-standing commitment to reining in the regulatory state and a consequent suspicion of broad delegations of power by Congress to the executive branch. It is hardly surprising that he is not so completely unprincipled as to drop this concern in its entirety the moment the president is Donald Trump and the president’s signature issue is at stake. That issue is, after all, an unprecedented claim of power by the president to levy taxes based on a statute that has never been used this way before.

The assumption that the justices are all political prostitutes—except the justices a given person just happens to like—is a very silly one. These are substantial people. And some issues may present clashes between their seriously-held philosophical positions and one’s sense of what “team” they are on politically. Sometimes, the clash is between one seriously-held philosophical position and another seriously-held philosophical position, and the “team” stuff is just along for the ride. It is not surprising that when this happens, thoughtful people respond thoughtfully and delve into an issue with care. When a justice does that, it often takes the form of asking probing questions of counsel. Gorsuch’s probing of Sauer on the consequences of reading IEEPA too expansively for the balance of power between the branches may just reflect the fact that he’s struggling. And that should surprise exactly nobody.

Second, the fact that this happened, and with more than one justice, emphatically does not mean that Trump is going to lose—though I won’t be surprised if he does. All it means, rather, is that law and a justice’s philosophical approach to judging are not irrelevant to that justice’s judicial behavior. That is to say that a Republican-appointed justice is not described accurately entirely with reference to the party of his or her appointing president, and a Democratic-appointed justice is not either.

There are still a lot of ways Trump can win this case, and get the votes of at least two—which is probably all he needs—of the three justices who were peppering his solicitor general with the tougher questions on Wednesday. The case turns on whether the words in IEEPA that allow the president to “regulate” goods that are “imported” to the United States in emergency situations reasonably include allowing him to impose tariffs. There are good legal arguments on both sides of this question, in my view, though there are exactly zero good policy arguments for the president’s tariffs policy.

The best argument for Trump’s position is that the word “regulate” is capacious and naturally does sound like it would include the power to levy duties. Particularly given the fact that the statute clearly allows the president to ban imports from a particular country. Why would it not include the lesser power to tax them? There are excellent arguments against this view too, mind you. But will it be shocking if two of the justices who ventilated some anxieties in oral arguments about the president’s edgy legal position turn around and decide that the best reading of the law does, in fact, tolerate it? No. It will not.

Nor, third and most importantly, will it in any sense redeem the Court’s institutional performance during the second Trump administration if they join with the three liberal justices and swat the tariffs down.

There’s a subtext in some of the excited chatter about the argument that maybe, just maybe, the Supreme Court will strike down the tariffs and we can all find our reconciliations with the justices over matters past and learn to love the Supreme Court again.

But the problem with the Court’s performance to date has not been, at least not in my view, that it lacks any sense of limits as to the legality of Trump administration action. We actually don’t know yet where its limits are, because The Situation has happened so fast that the Court has not issued merits rulings yet. I fully expect this term the Court to find that at least some of the Trump administration’s actions have crossed important legal lines. If not in this case, for example, it will do so in the birthright citizenship case. And over the longer term, I retain a certain confidence that the Court will find that many of the administration’s actions with respect to firing employees violated civil service rules; that certain impoundments of federal funds are illegal; that the administration can’t go after law firms because of their clients or university medical research because some professors and students in other parts of the same university say mean things about Israel or don’t seem angry enough about Oct. 7.

The longer The Situation drags on, the more things the Supreme Court will come to object to, and nobody should find that shocking, or redeeming.

The problem with the Court’s performance, rather, is the justices’ total lack of urgency about any of it, and their default position—reflected in oh-so-many emergency docket opinions—that the administration should be unmolested by the judiciary in tearing down the federal government in the meantime.

It lies in the constant intellectual beavering away on the part of the Court’s majority to treat in litigation what is glaringly aberrant as though it is normal and presenting merely the sort of legal problems that can be corrected later with a fully-litigated record.

It lies in the assumption that a mass firing creates thousands of individual lawsuits that can proceed in good time, as employment lawsuits have proceeded since before any of us were born—rather than a tsunami of destruction of government capacity that has to be thought of as a legal event of its own.

It is in the assumption that USAID contractors are likewise individual entities with individual contracts with the government, rather than that the president declared war on an entire fabric of congressional foreign aid policy, and that the legality of that war on this tapestry was far more urgent than the plight of any one USAID contractor—that while the individual contractor might be made whole retroactively two years down the line, the tapestry cannot.

It lies in the assumption that the individual immigrant treated abusively by ICE or whose residency gets lawlessly revoked or whose asylum case never gets heard should get in line and litigate his individual case—even though he can’t any more because he’s been locked up and deported and can’t afford counsel anyway—rather than that the courts should entertain more systemic challenges to ICE’s behavior.

I could go on, but I won’t.

I will say, however, that every time the Court vacates or stays another injunction and thus allows some lawless administration action to go ahead on the theory that it shouldn’t be stepping in on an emergency basis too blithely and that the case will be better developed when it comes back up with a full record, another small part of my confidence in the Supreme Court as an institution withers away. It’s almost entirely gone now. And none of it will ever be restored by merits rulings years later, by displays by justices that they do have principles—which is not something I have ever doubted—or that they are capable of ruling against Donald Trump . . . eventually.

Only yesterday, the Court issued a stay of a lower-court ruling enjoining the administration’s new insistence that passports reflect a person’s biological sex at birth. The court did not rule on the merits of the matter, of course; it merely said that “on this record, respondents have failed to establish that the Government’s choice to display biological sex ‘lack[s] any purpose other than a bare . . . desire to harm a politically unpopular group’” (emphasis added)—thus acknowledging that on some other more-developed record, perhaps down the line over months or years more of litigation, the challengers might develop a record that establishes this rather intuitive proposition.

In the meantime, however, the government will suffer an irreparable injury if it can’t execute its policy now—rather than after it’s deemed to be clearly lawful—and plaintiffs, well, they lack a “likelihood of success on the merits” anyway and we’ll deal with their concerns in good time when the merits docket winds its way back here.

So no. I’m not racing to draw conclusions from the argument on the tariffs matter—much less racing to draw meta-conclusions about the Court based on the conclusions about the tariffs case I’m not racing to draw, from an outcome I’m not racing to predict.

I’ll deal with the tariffs opinion when the justices issue it. I’ll agree with it. Or I’ll disagree with it. The political system, and the president, will yap about it—and adapt to it. And it will redeem exactly nothing and stand for no meta-point more important than that justices are not political automatons. Which is something that we all knew, or at least should have known, before Wednesday.

And The Situation? Well, it will continue the day after the decision comes down—as, indeed, The Situation will continue tomorrow.",https://lawfare-assets-new.azureedge.net/assets/images/default-source/article-images/inside_the_united_states_supreme_court.jpeg?sfvrsn=a9a5b204_5,N,,2025-11-07 10:58:59.294459

Maryland argues the FBI cannot simply cast aside various pieces of legislation that committed the bureau to the outcome of the site selection process and gave clear directive about how federal funding for the new headquarters must be spent.
“The Trump Administration has no grounds to ignore this selection, or redirect even one penny that Congress specifically appropriated for construction of the competitively selected site,” Maryland Sens.
“Moving to the Ronald Reagan Building is the most cost effective and resource efficient way to carry out our mission to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution,” Patel said in July when the decision was first announced.","The state of Maryland is suing the FBI after the bureau reneged on plans to construct a new headquarters at a selected site in Greenbelt in favor of using an existing building in downtown Washington, D.C.

The suit alleged the Trump administration ignored congressionally mandated spending plans and wrongly diverted $555 million in funding when it announced that rather than use the Greenbelt location selected after a multiyear bidding process, the FBI would instead use the Ronald Reagan Building, which had available space following the closure of the U.S. Agency for International Development.

“The [General Services Administration] (GSA) duly completed the site selection process in 2023 and selected the Greenbelt site. Congress set aside additional funds for the project after that decision. In July 2025, however, the FBI and the GSA abruptly announced that they had selected a new site, the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., and took steps to redirect the previously appropriated funds toward developing an FBI headquarters at the Ronald Reagan Building,” the state wrote in its Thursday suit.

“These actions flouted Congress’s explicit direction to choose a site from the three specified sites, as well as other specific statutory directives concerning the selection of the site and the use of the funds.”

The FBI did not respond to a request for comment. The GSA declined to comment.

The lawsuit is the latest chapter in the effort to move the FBI from its crumbling current headquarters at the J. Edgar Hoover Building in D.C., where netting has been installed to prevent the falling facade from injuring passersby.

Maryland argues the FBI cannot simply cast aside various pieces of legislation that committed the bureau to the outcome of the site selection process and gave clear directive about how federal funding for the new headquarters must be spent.

“The Trump Administration has no grounds to ignore this selection, or redirect even one penny that Congress specifically appropriated for construction of the competitively selected site,” Maryland Sens. Chris Van Hollen and Angela Alsobrooks, both Democrats, said in a statement.

“Yet the Administration clearly intends to do just that, while refusing to answer basic questions around the costs to taxpayers and security of the new site, or provide additional details on their plans.”

The state also argues the Reagan building comes with its own issues, saying it would need serious updates to meet the security standards for the FBI, while previous assessments found it needed $95 million for an upgrade to its fire protection system and $38 million to “repair of multiple cylindrical drum leaks at the building’s core.”

The multiyear site selection process weighed three locations, pitting Maryland and Virginia against each other.

Virginia has contended the process was flawed, asking for a pause after the Office of Inspector General agreed to ignite a review of the process after former FBI Director Christopher Wray sent a letter to FBI staff citing “concerns about fairness and transparency in the process” as well as the GSA’s “failure to adhere to its own site selection plan.”

In announcing its plans to use the Reagan Building, FBI Director Kash Patel argued it was practical to use existing space downtown rather than construct a new federal building.

A curated weekday guide to major news and developments over the last 24 hours. Here’s today’s news:

U.S. CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC OPERATIONS

Senior Trump administration officials—Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and a White House Office of Legal Counsel representative—told lawmakers in a classified briefing Wednesday that the administration is not planning strikes inside Venezuela and currently lacks a legal basis for attacking land targets, according to four sources familiar with the meeting. During the briefing to leadership from both chambers, as well as the top Republicans and Democrats on key committees, administration officials said the nonpublic “OLC opinion” authorizes only the September maritime campaign against suspected drug-smuggling boats and, per one source, lists 24 Latin America–based cartels and criminal organizations the administration is authorized to target; the campaign’s “execute order” likewise does not reach land targets. Officials didn’t rule out future options, noting they’re exploring a separate DOJ opinion that could justify land strikes without new congressional authorization, but no decision has been made. Natasha Bertrand, Jennifer Hansler, Katie Bo Lillis, Zachary Cohen, and Kylie Atwood report for CNN, noting, “In several briefings to Congress, including the one on Wednesday, administration officials have acknowledged that they do not necessarily know the individual identities of each person on board a vessel before they attack it. Strikes are instead conducted based on intelligence that the vessels are linked to a specific cartel or criminal organization, sources said. Administration officials walked through the process they use to identify and target the vessels and discussed the types of intelligence they had connecting the vessels to cartels during Wednesday’s briefing, one of the sources said.”

The Senate yesterday rejected, 49–51, a joint resolution requiring congressional approval before President Donald Trump could take military action against Venezuela, following the classified briefing by administration officials. Introduced in mid-October by Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) with 15 co-sponsors, the measure drew Republican support from Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Rand Paul (R-KY). The resolution “directs the President to terminate the use of United States Armed Forces for hostilities within or against Venezuela, unless explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific authorization for use of military force.” Connor O’brien and Joe Gould report for POLITICO; Filip Timotija reports for The Hill.

Lawmakers briefed by administration officials Wednesday delivered mixed reactions, with top Democrat Senate Intelligence Vice Chair Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) backing the intelligence but pressing for more transparency. Warner said “our intelligence assets are quite good” and the administration has “visibility” into drug movements, but warned that conducting “kinetic strikes” without interdictions to show boats “are carrying drugs and … full of bad guys” undermines public confidence. Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT) said he doesn’t doubt “some connection of these boats to trafficking,” but questioned whether safeguards match counterterrorism standards to avoid harming innocents. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) said he didn’t know the identities of everyone aboard but cited “high reliability” that crews were cartel-linked rather than “haphazardly on a boat.” Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-NY) said he heard “nothing” to convince him of the strikes’ legality; he added that lawmakers reviewed the nonpublic OLC memo. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) pushed for an all-senators briefing, saying, “What we heard isn’t enough.” Alison Main, Morgan Rimmer, Manu Raju, Jennifer Hansler, and Kylie Atwood report for CNN.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is set to announce sweeping reforms to the Pentagon’s weapons procurement system today, aiming to accelerate the military’s acquisition of new technology amid rising global threats. Speaking at the National War College, Hegseth will outline changes mandated by an April executive order from President Donald Trump, according to a draft memo seen by Reuters. The overhaul targets what officials call “unacceptably slow” procurement caused by fragmented oversight and misaligned incentives. The plan establishes Portfolio Acquisition Executives with direct authority over major weapons programs—streamlining decision-making by removing intermediate approval layers—and requires at least two qualified suppliers for key components through early production. Jack Queen and Dietrich Knauth report for Reuters.

Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH)—the Republican chairs of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees—wrote Chief Justice John Roberts on Wednesday, urging an investigation into anonymous federal judges who criticized the Supreme Court in a New York Times questionnaire, citing potential ethics violations. They argued judges must “act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence” and “not make public comment” on pending matters, saying descriptions of a “war zone” relationship and claims the Court is “undermining the lower courts” erode trust. They asked Roberts to report back on whether he had ordered an inquiry or cautioned judges. Karoun Demirjian reports for the New York Times.

A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit yesterday ordered District Judge Alvin Hellerstein to more closely assess how the Supreme Court’s July 2024 presidential immunity ruling bears on Trump’s New York falsified-business-records case—after Hellerstein ruled in September 2024 against removing the case to federal court because the case involved private conduct and Trump waited too long to seek removal. On remand, the appeal panel said the court should “consider the factors relevant to determining good cause,” which “presumably would entail closely reviewing the three categories of evidence that Trump claims relate to official acts and determining whether … the State’s use of such evidence means that his prosecution relates to acts taken under color of the Presidency as contemplated by Trump v. United States.” If so, the district court must assess “whether Trump has a colorable federal defense and whether he diligently sought removal,” and also decide “whether removal under § 1442(a)(1) and § 1455(b)(1) is even available at this stage of the state court proceedings.” The panel left procedure to Judge Hellerstein—“whether to solicit further briefing … or hold a hearing”—and emphasized it does “no more than direct the District Court to consider the motion anew,” adding it “neither rule[s] nor impl[ies]” any particular outcome. “If Mr. Trump is unsuccessful, he will continue a more conventional appeal, which will proceed through state court, a process that could take years. The president’s lawyers filed their formal appeal papers last week,” Jonah E. Bromwich reports for the New York Times. Kara Scannell and John Fritze report for CNN.

A suspected foreign actor breached the Congressional Budget Office’s network in recent days, potentially exposing communications between congressional offices and nonpartisan researchers, as well as internal email and chat logs, sources told the Washington Post and CNN. Congressional staffers were notified earlier this week via an email from the Senate Sergeant at Arms, who did not name a suspect but said the hacking incident was “ongoing” and that staffers should avoid clicking on links sent from CBO accounts because the accounts may still be compromised, CNN reported. A CBO spokesperson said in an official statement yesterday that the office “has identified the security incident, has taken immediate action to contain it, and has implemented additional monitoring and new security controls to further protect the agency’s systems going forward,” adding that “work for the Congress continues.” Four sources told the Post that “an adversary or one of” CBO’s “digital proxies” was to blame, while a U.S. official told CNN Chinese state-backed hackers are suspected of being behind the breach. One source told the Post that CBO officials told lawmakers they believe they detected the intrusion early, and another source said some Hill offices paused emailing CBO over cybersecurity concerns. The CBO is the nonpartisan scorekeeper that produces economic projections and “scores” every bill. Jacob Bogage and Riley Beggin report for the Washington Post; Sean Lyngaas reports for CNN.

A “suspicious package” containing an unknown white powder was delivered to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland yesterday, and opened in a building that houses the Air National Guard Readiness Center, sickening several people who were taken to the base medical center, sources said. The center and an adjoining facility were evacuated and a cordon established; first responders found “no immediate threats” and turned the scene over to the Office of Special Investigations, with an inquiry ongoing. An initial HAZMAT field test did not detect anything hazardous, and the team cleared the scene yesterday evening, sources said. Investigators are also reviewing political propaganda included in the envelope, and the extent of any illnesses remains unclear. Haley Britzky and Josh Campbell report for CNN.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta warned that Trump could use federal power to interfere with the 2026 midterm elections, citing a “disturbing pattern” of attempts to undermine trust in ballot security and disrupt state voting systems, referencing Trump’s 2020 subversion efforts. Bonta said his office is preparing for extreme scenarios, including potential deployment of the National Guard near polling places or misuse of the Postal Service to “undermine vote-by-mail ballots.” “We’ve thought about different types of intimidation and voter suppression, and, you know, [voter] roll purging,” he said, adding, “We’re going to do everything in our power to protect elections in California … and make sure they’re not improperly interfered with by the federal government.” Kyle Cheney reports for POLITICO.

Democrats on the House Oversight Committee want former Prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor to sit for an interview as part of their investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, seeking “to uncover the identities of Mr. Epstein’s co-conspirators and enablers and to understand the full extent of his criminal operations,” according to a letter addressed to Andrew dated yesterday. Gregory Svirnovskiy reports for POLITICO.

SYRIA

The United States is preparing to establish a military presence at an airbase in Damascus to support the U.S.-brokered Israel–Syria security pact, six sources said, including two Western officials and a Syrian defense official. The base sits at the “gateway” to parts of southern Syria expected to form a demilitarized zone under a non-aggression pact; at the request of U.S. officials, Reuters withheld the base’s name and precise location for operational security reasons. Planning has accelerated over the past two months, including several Pentagon reconnaissance missions to the base that concluded the long runway is ready for immediate use, a Western military official said. A Syrian defense official said Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft were sent to verify the runway, and a guard at one entrance said American aircraft were landing as part of “tests.” Technical talks have focused on using the site for logistics, surveillance, refueling, and humanitarian operations while Syria retains full sovereignty over the base, two Syrian military sources said. The move was discussed during CENTCOM chief Adm. Brad Cooper’s Sept. 12 visit to Damascus, where he and U.S. envoy to Syria Thomas Barrack met President Ahmed al-Sharaa, a person familiar with the talks said. Suleiman Al-Khalidi, Timour Azhari, and Feras Dalatey report for Reuters.

The U.N. Security Council adopted a U.S.-drafted resolution yesterday lifting sanctions on Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa and Interior Minister Anas Khattab, with 14 votes in favor and China abstaining. China’s U.N. ambassador Fu Cong cited counterterrorism and Syria’s security situation in explaining the abstention; Russia supported the measure, saying it reflected the aspirations of the Syrian people. Damascus called the vote a message of support for Syrians. Michelle Nichols reports for Reuters.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

The United States approved the sale of sniper rifles last year to Brazil’s elite police unit BOPE—linked to last week’s raid that killed 121 people—despite objections from U.S. diplomats, including the ambassador, who warned the weapons could be used in extrajudicial killings, three current and former officials told Reuters. “Reuters could not establish whether the U.S.-made sniper rifles were used by BOPE in last week’s raid. BOPE also purchased accompanying suppressors for the rifles, which were produced by Wisconsin-based Griffin Armament, but the suppressor shipment was initially blocked by the U.S. government, according to the documents and sources. Reuters could not determine if the suppressors were ultimately sent at a later date, though the State Department implied that they were not,” Gram Slattery and Fabio Teixeira report for Reuters.

Iran has asked about lifting U.S. sanctions, President Donald Trump said yesterday, and he’s “open to” hearing the request, while offering no decision or timeline, Reuters reports.

Kazakhstan will join the Abraham Accords to normalize ties with Israel, Trump said yesterday on Truth Social following a call with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu and Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. Kazakhstan’s government said the matter is in the final stage of negotiations, and Trump said a signing ceremony is forthcoming. “But there is a twist: Kazakhstan already has full diplomatic relations with Israel. The move shows how countries are finding creative ways to hand Mr. Trump political victories at a low cost to themselves,” Anton Troianovski reports for the New York Times; Matt Spetalnick, Simon Lewis, and Steve Holland report for Reuters.

Trump yesterday hosted the leaders of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan at the White House, emphasizing critical minerals as a “key priority” and pledging to deepen U.S. partnerships in the resource-rich region. The meeting — part of the C5+1 framework — focused on securing U.S. access to uranium, copper, gold, and rare earths amid competition with Russia and China. Jarrett Renshaw and Nandita Bose report for Reuters.

TECHNOLOGY AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

The European Commission plans to pause parts of its AI Act amid U.S. and Big Tech pressure. A draft slated for Commission adoption on Nov. 19 would soften enforcement—granting firms a one-year “grace period” on high-risk AI rules—though details could still change and it would still need approval by a majority of E.U. member states and the European Parliament.

OpenAI yesterday released a “Teen Safety Blueprint,” a framework it says artificial intelligence (AI) companies can adopt to protect teen users—and a practical starting point for policymakers—while committing to collaborate with experts and policymakers on public policy. The Blueprint seeks to establish standards so teens can use “safe and trustworthy” AI, saying ChatGPT should “meet them where they are” (e.g., respond differently to a 15-year-old than to an adult), and sets out five planks: (1) identify teen users with privacy-preserving age estimation; (2) adopt under-18 safety policies with age-appropriate defaults; (3) default to an under-18 experience when age is uncertain; (4) empower families with accessible parental controls; and (5) design for well-being with research-informed features and crisis supports. OpenAI also says it is “not waiting for regulation to catch up” and is already putting the framework into practice—pointing to the late-September parental controls rollout, proactive notifications, and work toward an age-prediction system to tailor ChatGPT for under-18s. Ashley Gold reports for Axios.

OpenAI also released “AI progress and recommendations” yesterday, calling for near-term, industry-led steps—without waiting for regulation—to steer frontier AI toward public accountability, privacy protections, and national-security safeguards. It proposes: shared safety standards and research-sharing among frontier labs; oversight and accountability “commensurate with capabilities,” including coordination with executive-branch safety institutes on biosecurity and control evaluations; building an AI “resilience ecosystem” (standards, monitoring, incident response); ongoing impact reporting by labs and governments; and user-empowering design that protects rights.

Chinese AI developer DeepSeek made its first public appearance since February yesterday, with senior researcher Victor Chen Deli warning in Wuzhen that AI’s long-term social impact could be “negative[ ]” despite near-term benefits. Speaking at the government-organized World Internet Conference alongside China’s “six little dragons,” including Unitree and BrainCo, Chen said AI may start displacing jobs within 5–10 years and could take over most human work in 10–20 years, urging tech firms to act as societal “defenders.” Liam Mo and Brenda Goh report for Reuters.

Meta internally projected that about 10% of its 2024 revenue came from scam and banned-goods ads, earning roughly $7 billion annually from “high-risk” advertisements shown an estimated 15 billion times per day, according to internal documents reviewed by Reuters. The records show Meta has for at least three years failed to stem widespread fraudulent ads across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, involving fake investments, illegal casinos, and banned medical products — sometimes even charging rogue marketers premium rates and compiling reports on the “Scammiest Scammers.” Smaller advertisers were allowed up to eight fraud violations before suspension, while major “High Value Accounts” could rack up over 500 strikes. One set of four scam campaigns generated $67 million in monthly ad revenue. The documents show Meta aims to reduce its reliance on illicit ad income but has warned internally that cutting such “violating revenue” too quickly could hit financial targets. The company also expects regulatory fines of up to $1 billion over scam ads, one document said. Jeff Horwitz reports for Reuters

Egyptian mediators have proposed that Hamas fighters remaining in the Israeli-held Rafah area of Gaza surrender their weapons to Egypt in exchange for safe passage to other parts of the enclave, two sources told Reuters. An Egyptian security official said the plan would also require Hamas to provide information on tunnel networks in the area so they can be destroyed. Israel and Hamas have not yet accepted the proposal, though a third source confirmed that talks on the issue are ongoing. Nidal Al-Mughrabi reports for Reuters.

A top German military official warned yesterday that Russia could mount a “small, quick, regionally limited” strike on NATO territory “as early as tomorrow,” though any move would depend on Western allies’ posture. Lt. Gen. Alexander Sollfrank—head of Germany’s Joint Operations Command since 2024 and former chief of NATO’s logistics command (JSEC) in Ulm—said Russia is too tied down in Ukraine for a large attack but still has enough tanks and retains significant air, nuclear, and missile strength. Sabine Siebold reports for Reuters.

Israel carried out heavy airstrikes on southern Lebanon yesterday, targeting areas it said Hezbollah was using to rebuild military infrastructure, despite a year-old ceasefire. The strikes followed evacuation orders issued by Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee on X for several southern villages, including Aita al-Jabal, Al-Tayyiba, and Tayr Debba, with residents told to stay 500 meters from designated sites. Two additional evacuation orders followed later in the day. The airstrikes began about an hour after the orders, sending thick plumes of smoke over the area. Lebanon’s health ministry said one person was killed and another wounded, while civil defense teams assisted in evacuations. Reuters reports.

Pirates attacked a Malta-flagged tanker off Somalia yesterday, firing on the vessel and launching a rocket-propelled grenade, maritime security sources said. The Hellas Aphrodite—en route from India to South Africa carrying gasoline—was boarded by pirates in a skiff, while all 24 crew members took refuge in the ship’s fortified safe room. The EU’s naval force said one of its assets was moving in to respond. The assault marks the most significant escalation in Somali piracy since December 2023, when the Maltese-flagged Ruen was hijacked and later freed by Indian naval forces. Armed assailants launched two suspected Somali piracy attacks this week, the first such incidents since 2024. Jonathan Saul, Renee Maltezou, and Yannis Souliotis report for Reuters.

Thousands marched in Latvia’s capital, Riga, yesterday to oppose the country’s potential withdrawal from the Istanbul Convention—a Council of Europe treaty on preventing and combating violence against women, including domestic violence—after parliament voted last week to leave but President Edgars Rinkēvičs vetoed the move and sent it back for further debate. More than 10,000 gathered in Cathedral Square for the “Let’s Protect Mother Latvia” rally—one of the country’s largest demonstrations in recent years—with additional protests planned in other cities and outside Latvian embassies abroad.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION INVESTIGATIONS

The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Washington, D.C., has been investigating “for months” D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser for potential bribery or campaign-finance violations tied to Qatar-funded travel by her and senior staff, people familiar with the probe told the New York Times. The inquiry stems from an April WJLA report about a 2023 U.N. climate-conference trip: Bowser’s office first said the D.C. Chamber of Commerce paid, then the U.S. Conference of Mayors, but records later showed Qatari officials covered more than $61,000 to bring Bowser and staff to Doha, and the conference group paid only part—prompting an ethics complaint by the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, which was once led by Matthew G. Whitaker. Prospects are uncertain amid DOJ turmoil: the FBI agent leading the inquiry was fired this week, and D.C.’s public-corruption unit has been depleted by dismissals and resignations, raising doubts about whether the case will move forward. “It is unclear whether the mayor’s office did anything for the Qatari government,” a key element for any bribery charge, and any campaign-finance case would need proof that misstatements were intentional rather than clerical errors, Alan Feuer, Devlin Barrett, and Michael S. Schmidt report for the New York Times.

Justice Department prosecutors in Florida are preparing to issue a series of grand jury subpoenas in their ongoing investigation into former CIA Director John Brennan and on the CIA and FBI investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election—part of an inquiry first reported in the Summer by Fox news, and now under the supervision of Jason Reding Quiñones, in consultation with senior DOJ officials in Washington.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

District Judge Karin Immergut is expected to issue a ruling today on whether the Trump administration violated federal law by deploying National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, following a three-day bench trial. The decision could mark the first to permanently bar the government from using federal troops to suppress protests against immigration authorities. Jack Queen and Dietrich Knauth report for Reuters.

District Judge Sara Ellis yesterday granted class-action certification and issued a preliminary injunction, finding that federal immigration officials “lacked credibility” and were likely violating protesters’ constitutional rights in Chicago. Ellis said from the bench that officials had lied about the nature of demonstrations against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, citing body camera and aerial footage that “directly contradicted” agents’ testimony. She found that federal agents’ use of tear gas and pepper balls against protesters, journalists, and clergy had chilled free speech, assembly, and religious exercise in violation of the First Amendment. Ellis ordered Border Patrol and immigration agents to give at least two warnings with a “reasonable opportunity” to disperse before deploying riot-control weapons, and declined to stay the injunction pending appeal. A written preliminary injunction followed. The court further ordered that defendants file by today a verification confirming that Commander Gregory Bovino was issued a body-worn camera on Oct. 31, completed required training, and is currently using the device in compliance with the preliminary injunction. Bill Kirkos and Priscilla Alvarez report for CNN.

Maryland and Prince George’s County yesterday sued the Trump administration after the Justice Department, the FBI, and General Services Administration scrapped the previously selected Greenbelt, Maryland, site for a new FBI headquarters and pivoted in July 2025 to the Ronald Reagan Building (RRB) in downtown D.C. The complaint alleges the administration is unlawfully “sabotaging” the Greenbelt site and defying Congress’s instructions to pick among three suburban sites (Greenbelt, Landover, or Springfield), and that the agencies then tried to steer money away from the FBI-HQ project to the RRB—via an FBI “reprogramming” of roughly $555 million (including $323 million appropriated for DOJ HQ) and a GSA transfer of about $843.8 million within the Federal Buildings Fund. On the law, the complaint claims the agencies: (1) violated appropriations law by using funds for a purpose Congress didn’t authorize (31 U.S.C. § 1301(a)) and by attempting an unlawful transfer (31 U.S.C. § 1532); (2) acted outside their siting and project-approval authorities under the federal public-buildings statutes (40 U.S.C. §§ 3301–3318 and related provisions) and implementing regulations (e.g., 41 C.F.R. § 102-83.85); and (3) violated the Administrative Procedure Act because the reversal from Greenbelt to the RRB and the funding maneuvers were “arbitrary and capricious.” The suit seeks to vacate the RRB decision and the funding moves, to bar the obligation of Greenbelt-designated funds for other purposes, and to obtain declaratory and injunctive relief. Nate Raymond reports for Reuters. Glenn Thrush reports for the New York Times.

District Judge John McConnell yesterday ordered the Trump administration to fully fund November SNAP benefits by today, granting plaintiffs’ motion to enforce last week’s temporary restraining order and issuing a second TRO. In last week’s order, Judge McConnell gave the government two paths: either use Section 32 Agricultural Adjustment Act amendments of 1935, contingency funds, or both to pay benefits in full by Nov. 3, or use contingency funds to make partial payments by Nov. 5 only if it “expeditiously” resolved the administrative and clerical burdens. The administration chose the partial-payment option but, the court found, failed to act “expeditiously,” granting the motion to enforce. “Far from being expeditious, the record suggests quite the opposite,” Judge McConnell found, adding, the government has “undermined the intent and effectiveness” of the court’s prior orders. “not inclined to excuse this noncompliance.” Separately, the court held USDA’s refusal to fully fund SNAP was “arbitrary and capricious,” calling the rationale “pretextual” and “for political purposes” that furthered “unjustifiable partisanship”, and noting “children are immediately at risk of going hungry.” DOJ has appealed both yesterday’s order and last week’s, leaving it uncertain whether SNAP benefits will be fully paid out on Friday as Judge McConnell directed. Devan Cole and Tami Luhby report for CNN. Nate Raymond reports for Reuters. Tony Romm reports for the New York Times.

A Supreme Court majority, 6–3, yesterday allowed the Trump administration to temporarily enforce its rule requiring passport applicants to list their sex as designated on their birth certificate, staying a district court order that had allowed applicants to choose M, F, or X and had been left in place by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. In an unsigned order, the Court wrote, “Displaying passport holders’ sex at birth no more offends equal protection principles than displaying their country of birth — in both cases, the government is merely attesting to a historical fact without subjecting anyone to differential treatment.” The stay of U.S. District Judge Julia Kobick’s April order—which found that the Trump administration’s policy likely discriminates on the basis of sex and is rooted in “irrational prejudice” toward transgender Americans in violation of the Fifth Amendment’s equal-protection guarantee, and further violates the Administrative Procedure Act—will remain in effect through the First Circuit appeal and any petition for certiorari. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor. Abbie VanSickle reports for the New York Times.

This failure to participate is a further abandonment of the U.S. government’s human rights commitments – it must not stand.
The Trump administration can, and must, reverse course, submit its national report for the review, even belatedly, and attend its review in 2026.”","GENEVA – The United Nations Human Rights Council today called on the United States to resume its cooperation with the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), a mechanism that calls for each UN Member State to undergo a peer review of its human rights record every five years. In its decision, the Human Rights Council also announced that it would reschedule the UPR of the U.S. for 2026, while leaving open the possibility for it to be scheduled sooner.

In August, the Trump administration announced that it would boycott the UPR, breaking longstanding participation in the UPR in an attempt to evade accountability for its human rights record. The UN Human Rights Council had given the U.S. government until Friday afternoon to appear in person before the council before issuing its decision.

In response to the failure of the U.S. to appear and the adoption of the resolution on non-cooperation, civil society organizations and state and local officials, who are attending the UN meeting in Geneva this week, echoed the Human Rights Council’s calls on the Trump administration to resume its cooperation with the UPR. Statements from partners are as follows:

“The Human Rights Council’s decision makes clear that the Trump administration cannot evade accountability,” said Jamil Dakwar, director of the Human Rights Program at the American Civil Liberties Union. “We condemn the Trump administration for undermining the UPR and setting a dangerous example that will further weaken universal human rights at home and abroad.”

“The Trump administration is abandoning its obligations to human rights protections domestically and internationally,” said Robert Saleem Holbrook, executive director of the Abolitionist Law Center. “In yet another instance of the authoritarian path this administration is embarking on, the refusal to participate in the UPR’s international convening will only harm its own interests. The decision reflects a reckless act devoid of leadership and deserves to be condemned and rebuked in the strongest possible terms.”

“The Trump administration's unprecedented decision not to participate in the UPR human rights review is shameful and reflective of the fact that they are either unwilling or unable to defend their abhorrent human rights record,” said Chandra Bhatnagar, executive director of the ACLU of Southern California. “From the discrimination and violence inflicted in the ICE raids, to the attacks on free speech of protesters and journalists, to the deployment of the national guard in American cities when no crisis exists, the world is watching the United States government attacking the constitutional and human rights of its own people. ""

Siya Hegde, Staff Attorney at the National Homelessness Law Center, remarked that “the Trump Administration’s failure to show up for its own review and pretend it is above the law has again made it clear that it does not care about basic human rights. To maintain any sense of legitimacy for the international human rights system that has provided protections for billions of people for the past 80 years, the UN Human Rights Council must call this out in the strongest possible terms. Without this international accountability, the risk of harms to people both in the U.S. and abroad, including to the millions of unhoused people in the U.S. who are being criminalized simply for not being able to afford the rent, will go up even more than it already has.”

“This is unprecedented: the United States risks becoming the first country in the history of the UN’s Universal Periodic Review process to fully evade this important human rights-related review,” said Carolyn Nash, Advocacy Director with Amnesty International USA. “The Trump administration has doubled down on its disregard for international accountability and human rights at home and around the world. This failure to participate is a further abandonment of the U.S. government’s human rights commitments – it must not stand.

But since the suit’s filing, neighborhood-level confrontations have become more common between civilians and agents carrying out arrests of undocumented immigrants.

U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis said she’d seen “ample evidence that agents … intended to cause protesters harm” during a number of clashes between the feds and members of the public that ended with the deployment of tear gas and left bystanders fearful and, in some cases, injured.

“I see little reason for the use of force that the federal agents are currently using,” the judge said Thursday. “Pointing guns, pulling out pepper spray, throwing tear gas, shooting pepper balls and using other less-lethal munitions do not appear to be appropriate.”

Before formally issuing her preliminary injunction, Ellis catalogued more than a dozen incidents in which immigration agents used excessive force against members of the public. While some stretched back to September when protests outside of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility in the Chicago suburb of Broadview were at their peak, the majority of the clashes the judge described occurred after she’d already issued a temporary restraining order governing agents’ use of force.

Read more: Democratic candidates, officeholders indicted for ‘impeding’ agent outside ICE facility

That Oct. 9 order stems from a lawsuit filed last month by protesters, journalists and clergy, mostly pertaining to their treatment by agents outside the Broadview facility. In one widely publicized instance on Sept. 19, the Rev. David Black was hit with multiple pepper balls an agent shot from the building’s roof, including twice in the head. During a marathon hearing in Ellis’ courtroom Wednesday, Black testified that he had reservations about going back to protest at Broadview after the incident.

But since the suit’s filing, neighborhood-level confrontations have become more common between civilians and agents carrying out arrests of undocumented immigrants.

The judge’s temporary restraining order prohibited the use of tear gas, pepper balls, rubber bullets, flashbang grenades and tasers on protesters who don’t pose “an immediate threat to the safety of a law enforcement officer or others.” For protesters deemed true threats, the order required them to give at least two separate warnings loud enough for the crowd to hear and allow “reasonable time and opportunity” for compliance before the deployment of a riot control weapon.

But Ellis on Thursday said that over and over, the Department of Homeland Security’s own evidence — including body camera footage — did nothing to refute testimony that agents gave no warnings before throwing canisters of tear gas or using other force against members of the public.

The judge pointed multiple times to an Oct. 23 clash between agents and a group of spontaneous protesters in Chicago’s Little Village, a neighborhood heavily populated by Mexican immigrants. During the incident, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino personally deployed canisters of tear gas, including over the heads of the crowd in direct violation of Ellis’ order.

The Border Patrol Commander has become the face of Operation Midway Blitz, though it’s ostensibly an ICE operation.

After the Little Village episode, DHS officials and Bovino himself claimed his use of tear gas was justified because someone threw a rock at his head. He even repeated it during a sworn deposition he was ordered to give last week. But as that deposition stretched into a third day, Bovino finally acknowledged he wasn’t hit until after the tear gas deployment.

Excerpts from the video deposition were played during Wednesday’s hearing, which also included live testimony from nearly a dozen others.

“Tellingly, defendant Bovino admitted that he lied,” the judge said Thursday.

‘Simply not credible’

But Ellis was frustrated that Bovino refused to acknowledge his own use of force captured in video footage of an Oct. 3 protest outside the Broadview ICE facility. In the video, Bovino can be seen tackling a man named Scott Blackburn to the ground before arresting him. But when Bovino was shown the video during his deposition, he denied that he used any force in that instance, instead testifying that “the use of force was against me.”

The judge said the video “obviously” shows Bovino tackling Blackburn “to the ground.” Ellis expressed amazement that “Bovino, despite watching this video, said that he never used force against Mr. Blackburn,” she said. The Border Patrol commander also testified that every use of force he was aware of agents committing during Operation Midway Blitz was “more than exemplary.”

But it wasn’t just Bovino’s view of events the judge couldn’t square with testimony and video footage. Ellis said that after reviewing “all of the evidence” in the case, the Trump administration’s evidence was “simply not credible.”

“The government would have people believe … that the Chicagoland area is in a vice hold of violence, ransacked by rioters and attacked by agitators,” the judge said. “That simply isn’t true. And the government’s own evidence in this case belies that assertion.”

Ellis’ words echoed language used by U.S. District Judge April Perry last month when she blocked the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard to Chicago to protect immigration agents from protesters that DHS officials called “violent” and “rioters.”

Perry ruled there was “no credible evidence that there is a danger of rebellion in the state of Illinois,” also noting the Department of Justice’s arguments in the case seemed to add to “a growing body of evidence that DHS’ version of events are unreliable.”

Ellis’ new injunction is substantially similar to her Oct. 9 order, though it also includes a new prohibition on chokeholds or other types of neck restraints unless absolutely necessary to stop someone from seriously injuring or killing another.

The judge also modified her initial order last month to require agents wearing body cameras to have them turned on. Until last week, that didn’t include Bovino. But after telling Ellis he’d never been issued a body-worn camera nor received training on how to use it, the judge ordered him to start using one.

First Amendment violations

Ellis monologued for more than an hour, rebuking the Trump administration for “indiscriminately” using force against those who loudly oppose the president’s immigration enforcement agenda. As the hearing drew to a close, she quoted President George Washington, who in 1783 warned that if “the freedom of speech may be taken away … dumb and silent we may be led, like sheep, to the slaughter.”

The judge cited an impromptu Oct. 3 speech from DHS Secretary Kristi Noem to federal agents assigned to Operation Midway Blitz encouraging them to “go hard” against protesters.

“What they are doing is advocating to harm not just you and your colleagues, but your families,” Noem said. “They’re doxing your identities and victimizing people every day by the way that they are talking, speaking, who they are affiliated with, who they’re funded with and what they’re talking about as far as consequences for what we’re doing by protecting this country.”

Ellis said Noem’s speech indicated “content-based restrictions” of protesters’ First Amendment rights, as DHS officials “do not deny they would treat pro-ICE demonstrators more favorably.”

But the judge said Noem’s words also fit the Trump administration’s pattern of attempting to justify use of force by painting a dark — and inaccurate — picture of a violent Chicago.

Ellis opened with reading the entirety of poet Carl Sandburg’s most famous work proclaiming the city as “hog butcher for the world,” emphasizing a line aimed at “those who sneer at this, my city.”

Instead, the judge said the Chicago she knew was made up of “everyday people standing watch to protect the most vulnerable among us.” However, Ellis noted that federal agents saw those same people as “professional agitators” based on their use of bicycles and whistles to alert others to immigration enforcement activity nearby.

“Describing rapid response networks, neighborhood moms as professional agitators shows just how out of touch these agents are,” she said.

The Trump administration on Thursday vowed to appeal Ellis’ order, calling it “an extreme act by an activist judge that risks the lives and livelihoods of law enforcement officers.”

But Steven Art, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said the administration “is all bark and just a little bit of bite,” arguing litigation has produced “some level of compliance.” He cited agents’ lack of tear gas deployment since Bovino began his multi-day deposition last week.

“They’re publicly saying they don’t give a damn,” Art told reporters after Ellis delivered her ruling. “But they care.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/2025-11/251106-rev-david-black-1-hm.jpg?h=2fe880c3&itok=49x_Q7og,N,,2025-11-07 10:59:07.105514

No UN member state has failed to be reviewed since its creation in 2006.

The US decision to disengage from this vital process is particularly concerning given the deteriorating human rights situation in the country. Since the beginning of its term, the Trump administration has implemented policies that pose significant risks to the human rights of people in the US and around the world.

Recent unlawful attacks on vessels the administration claims are trafficking drugs, the violent campaign of raids and detentions conducted by Immigration and Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officials, and the use of excessive force during demonstrations are just some examples of the Trump administration’s blatant violations of international human rights law.

The UN Human Rights Council reacted to the US disengagement by postponing the review until November 2026 and saying it will consider any appropriate action if the US continues to not cooperate.

The UPR was created with the clear purpose of ensuring that every UN member state, regardless of its power and size, undergoes a peer review of its human rights record. It is also a key opportunity for civil society groups to voice their concerns on the international stage, especially where repressive governments undermine freedom of expression and independent monitoring of human rights at the national level.

To support the US peer review, hundreds of US and international civil society organisations, including Human RightsWatch, submitted reports on a wide range of human rights violations, such as: arbitrary detention, abusive treatment of immigrants, regression in sexual and reproductive rights and LGBT rights, systemic racial discrimination, and attacks on fundamental rights and the rule of law. Civil society groups and US local and regional government officials organized several events at the UN to discuss the country’s human rights situation.

The US government seems to think it is an exception and that the universal review process should not apply to it. But if it considers itself a rights-respecting government, international scrutiny aimed at improving the national human rights situation should be considered vital. The Trump administration may avoid this formal scrutiny process for a time, but doing so will only generate international criticism and further erode its place on the world stage.",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph/public/media_2025/10/202510un_switzerland_flags.jpg?h=5cda7e75&itok=K0R_Wsr3,N,,2025-11-07 09:16:51.905823

Why did the federal government shut down?

It started as a fight over health care -- specifically expiring subsidies for health insurance premiums purchased on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace.

Some 24 million people — who don't have insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid — use the system to buy health plans.

Prominent Republican lawmakers have claimed the Democrats are looking to provide tax dollars to help pay for the health care of undocumented immigrants. That is not true.

Democrats in the Senate refused to vote for the Republican short-term funding bill that passed the House but did not include an extension of the health care tax credits. Democrats are also hoping to repeal cuts to health care programs that were put in place as part of the GOP spending and tax bill that passed over the summer.

Nov. 1 marked the beginning of open enrollment for people getting coverage through the ACA, when subscribers could start to see big premium increases unless the subsidies that have been helping people pay for coverage since 2021 are extended.

How did the Nov. 4 elections impact shutdown negotiations?

As NPR's Stephen Fowler reports, it's rare for President Trump and Democrats to agree, but both say the longest-ever government shutdown contributed to a dismal showing for Republicans in Tuesday's off-year election.

""I think if you read the pollsters, the shutdown was a big factor, negative for the Republicans,"" Trump said at a breakfast with Republican senators Wednesday. ""And they say that I wasn't on the ballot was the biggest factor, but I don't know about that.""

The president has consistently framed the appropriations lapse as something Democrats have caused and only Democrats can solve, but the election results cap a shift in tone that suggests a resolution could come sooner — and with his approval. Read four ways Tuesday's results could influence the length of the government shutdown

As NPR's Sam Gringlas reports, Tuesday's victories have sent competing signals to lawmakers in the Senate about how to end the ongoing government shutdown. Listen here.

What about WIC and SNAP benefits?

A Rhode Island federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to find enough money to restore full funding for SNAP benefits by Friday.

The government ""failed to consider the harms individuals who rely on those benefits would suffer,"" said U.S. District Court Judge John McConnell Jr. The ruling comes in response to a challenge filed by cities and nonprofits after the administration said it would halt funding on Nov. 1. McConnell and another federal judge in Boston ordered the government to use emergency funds to keep SNAP funding flowing, but Trump administration officials said it was only able to partially cover the payments.

The Trump administration had said it will dip into a contingency fund for SNAP payments this month, but recipients would get at most 65% of their normal benefits. States — who administer SNAP — would need to recalculate for partial payments. And in a recent court filing officials say that could take weeks or even months, especially in states with older systems for folks to get the money on their EBT cards.

The administration said depleting its contingency fund means there will be no money to sign up new people for SNAP in November — and it's also unclear what doing so would mean for SNAP payments in December if the shutdown persists.

A separate nutrition program is also at risk. The Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) provides nutrition education, breastfeeding support, and other healthcare screenings for 7 million people. Some states are now using emergency funds to keep clinics open and benefits available, but the National WIC Association says those funds are running out quickly.

What about Head Start?

As of Nov. 3, more than 8,000 children had lost access to Head Start, the federal early-learning program for low-income families. That's because federal funding for individual Head Start programs cannot be disbursed while the government is shut down.

Among the states hit hardest by the November funding lapse: Florida, Georgia, Missouri and Ohio.

Nationally, Head Start serves roughly 750,000 infants, toddlers and preschool-age children, providing not just childcare and early learning but also free meals, health screenings and family support.

Local Head Start programs are funded annually, though at different times of the year. Some programs get their money on Oct. 1, others on Nov. 1 and so on. If the shutdown lasts until December, says Tommy Sheridan of the National Head Start Association, still more programs would see their funding run out.

Without federal funding, Sheridan says, some programs will have to close immediately. Others have the resources to stay open at least another week, in hopes that politicians in Washington can resolve their differences.

What the shutdown means for federal workers

Altogether, about 1.4 million civilian federal employees across the country are going without pay, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank in Washington, D.C.

Of those, roughly half are furloughed, which means they are not working and not getting paid, but expect to return to work once the federal shutdown is over.

The other half have been deemed essential and so are continuing to work.

By law federal workers are supposed to get back pay once the shutdown ends, but the White House has tried to cast doubt on that.

The Senate has failed to advance a pair of competing measures to pay at least some federal employees during the government shutdown.

The Trump administration has managed to move money around to ensure that some people get paid, including active duty military and law enforcement officers with the Department of Homeland Security.

Many other federal workers are also still getting paid as usual during the shutdown. Salaries for some federal employees, including the vast majority of those at the Department of Veterans Affairs, do not come out of appropriations that Congress must approve every year.

Are government workers being laid off during the shutdown?

The Trump administration has been following through on threats to further slash the size of government during the shutdown, seeking to lay off roughly 4,000 workers last month.

Some unions that represent workers are fighting back in court; the federal judge overseeing the case on Tuesday indefinitely halted the Trump administration's shutdown layoffs, noting human toll. The order applies to federal employees in programs or offices where the plaintiff unions have members or bargaining units.

How is the shutdown impacting active duty military?

The White House has identified additional funding for the latest round of military paychecks despite the shutdown, according to a spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The spokesperson says that the agency is using around $5 billion from a military housing fund, a military research and development fund and a Defense Department account used for building ships. NPR asked if part of the money is also coming from a $130 million donation made by a billionaire Trump ally, but the OMB did not respond.

In October, the Trump administration found unused research and development funds to pay many active military members so they wouldn't miss a full paycheck, according to a Pentagon official not authorized to speak publicly.

Military families are already seeking additional assistance from food banks and other groups to help with paying bills.

USPS is ""open for business as usual""

""U.S. Postal Service operations will not be interrupted,"" according to a statement by USPS. The postal service is primarily self-funded and doesn't depend on the appropriations process to continue running as usual.

IRS furloughs nearly half its staff

A contingency plan from the Treasury Department says that slightly more than half of the IRS' approximately 74,000 workers remain on the job and will continue to work for the foreseeable future. Some IRS employees were issued reduction in force, or RIF, notices on Friday and posted screenshots of those notices informing them of their last day, Dec. 9.

The contingency plan says nearly all of those employees who continue to work will be paid using sources other than annual appropriations, which are on hold during the shutdown. Tasks will include completing and testing systems to handle next year's tax-filing season, and maintaining computers to prevent the loss of data.

National Nuclear Security Administration furloughs 1,400 employees

On Oct. 20, the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the nation's nuclear weapons, said it is furloughing approximately 1,400 employees. The agency is responsible for overseeing thousands of warheads that are not currently deployed on missiles, bombers and submarines.

According to an Energy Department spokesperson, the furloughs are due to the ""Democrat shutdown.""

Roughly 400 employees remain on the job providing security and safety oversight. And the office responsible for moving nuclear weapons around the country remains funded until next week.

— Geoff Brumfiel, NPR

In addition, Nevada Public Radio is reporting more than 1,000 nuclear contractors in Nevada could receive notices by the end of the month, because their work relies on the federal government remaining open.

National Parks are a mixed bag

Across the country, the National Park Service (NPS) have brought their operations to a halt. That includes the National Zoo and other Smithsonian facilities. NPR's Alana Wise reports that the Smithsonian assured the public that animals would still be cared for during the zoo's closure. Animal cams are considered nonessential and will be turned off for the remainder of the shutdown.

As KQED's Sarah Wright and Carly Severn reported, a contingency plan for the NPS says that park roads, lookouts and trails ""will generally remain accessible to visitors"" for the duration of the shutdown, but other services such as regular road and trail condition updates would not be provided.

Concerns have also been raised about the safety and responsibility of keeping parks open without having a robust number of employees available to conduct critical services.

Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits will continue

Social Security, VA and other benefits will continue.

But employees at Social Security field offices earlier last month said the government shutdown has left them unable to carry out an important service for some recipients. As NPR's Ashley Lopez reports, workers say they are unable to provide benefit verification letters to people calling in to request them. These official letters act as a sort of income verification and are therefore key to obtaining aid like housing assistance, fuel assistance and help from nonprofits.

In an Oct. 21 email to users answering commonly asked questions about how shutdown impacts, SSA noted the online portal can still be used to access benefit verification letters.

Some furloughed employees at the Labor Department were brought back to work, in order to complete the September inflation report, which is a key ingredient used to calculate the cost of living adjustment that Social Security recipients will receive next year. Last week, the SSA said the payments to recipients will increase by 2.8% next year, or an increase of about $56 per month starting in January.

Read more on how a fight over health policy led to the government shutdown from NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin.

ICE will mostly continue uninterrupted

Immigration cases and enforcement are proceeding as usual during the government shutdown, with a few small exceptions. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that the employees in the Office of Detention Oversight, which inspects immigration detention centers, are currently not working. ""We hope Democrats will open up the government swiftly so that this office can resume its work,"" McLaughlin said.

According to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, DHS law enforcement, including ICE agents, will be paid for work done during the shutdown.

""More than 70,000 sworn law enforcement officers across DHS including those serving in CBP, ICE, Secret Service, TSA and other critical mission areas will be paid for all hours worked during the shutdown period,"" Noem posted on X last month. ""By Wednesday, October 22, law enforcement officers will receive a ""super check"" — which covers the 4 days lost, their overtime, and their next pay period.""

Flying could be challenging

The government shutdown is taking a growing toll on the nation's air traffic controllers, who are working without pay, so the Federal Aviation Administration plans to reduce air traffic by 10% at many busy airports, the agency said Wednesday. The FAA says flight cuts will be phased in over several days; airlines tell NPR that changes only affect domestic flights.

The FAA plans to reduce air traffic in 40 ""high-volume markets"" beginning on Friday. FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford told reporters the agency wants to reduce the pressure at those airports before safety is compromised.

""We just can't ignore it,"" Bedford said, ""when the early indicators are telling us we can take action today to prevent things from deteriorating.""

Some air traffic controllers have taken on second jobs to support themselves during the shutdown, and many have called in sick. That's led to staffing shortages and extensive delays at some airports, raising concerns about more widespread travel chaos if the shutdown continues.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy insists the U.S. air travel system is safe, and that the Federal Aviation Administration will continue to reroute and limit the number of planes in order to keep it that way.

Duffy said the administration could be forced to close some of the nation's airspace if the government shutdown continues into next week and controllers miss a second full paycheck.

""You will see mass flight delays, you'll see mass cancellations, and you may see us close certain parts of the airspace, because we just cannot manage it,"" Duffy said on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, the Transportation Department says that federal subsidies for rural air travel will continue through Nov. 18.

The impact of the shutdown looks different in different parts of the country

Some states across the country are uniquely positioned to feel the impact of the government shutdown. Reporters from the NPR Network are digging into the ways the government shutdown is playing out in their region.

Here's what we know so far about how the shutdown is affecting specific communities across the country:

Alaska

The roughly 66,000 Alaskans who participate in the federally funded, state-run SNAP program did not have their cards refilled on Saturday. Alaska will use state funds to fill their SNAP cards and help food banks amid federal delays. [Alaska Public Media]

About 15,000 federal employees live in Alaska, one of the highest percentages of federal employees when compared with other states. President Trump's threat that federal employees could receive termination notices increases the uncertainty around how this crucial workforce to Alaska's economy could be affected. [Alaska Public Media]

For more on the impact in Alaska, head to Alaska Public Media.

Arizona

Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs is allocating $1.8 million in emergency state aid [KNAU] She conceded that was only a ""drop in the bucket"" compared to Arizonans' needs. [KJZZ] She said she would not spend state funds to keep Grand Canyon National Park open. [KJZZ]

Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport joined a handful of other airports across the country that have refused to display a video from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blaming Democrats for the government shutdown. [KJZZ]

California

Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Oct. 25 that he would deploy the California National Guard to support food banks across California as the federal government shutdown drags on, threatening to delay and stall food stamp benefits for millions of residents. [KQED]

Well over 1 million people in L.A. County get food benefits from CalFresh — the state's implementation of the federally funded SNAP program. The other major SoCal counties — San Bernardino, Riverside and Orange — each have more than 300,000 people on CalFresh, according to state data. [LAist]

The shutdown of the federal government has brought the full or partial closure of many National Park Service sites across California: Muir Woods is fully closed. Alcatraz Island is slated to stay open. Other sites like Point Reyes National Seashore and Fort Point have partial closures, with some parking lots blocked or bathrooms locked. Even some park staff said they didn't learn the plan until Sept. 30 — the afternoon before the government shut down. Yosemite is open, but with lots of changes for visitors. [KQED]

Colorado

The state is providing funds to operate two visitor centers at Rocky Mountain National Park. Sites and lands in Colorado operated by the National Park Service are open, but ""some services may be limited or unavailable,"" according to the agency's website. [Colorado Public Radio]

In Colorado, the federal government employs thousands of workers at federal laboratories, environmental agencies and about 50,000 federal civilian employees working for departments like Agriculture, Interior and Veterans Affairs. [Colorado Public Radio]

Court documents show almost 200 Colorado-based positions that the Interior Department wants to cut. [Colorado Public Radio]

Unemployment claims from Colorado's federal workers are surging amid the U.S. government shutdown. 1,946 furloughed federal employees have applied for unemployment benefits so far. [Colorado Public Radio]

Several Colorado credit unions are already issuing Government Relief Loans to help workers make ends meet. These short-term loans charge no interest as long as they're paid off within six months. [Colorado Public Radio]

Coloradans: Been impacted by the federal government shutdown? Colorado Public Radio wants to hear from you.

Connecticut

Connecticut will spend $3 million, which will stretch about two weeks, to partially supplement federal food aid benefits through the nonprofit Connecticut Foodshare. [WSHU]

Connecticut has a $2.5 billion budget surplus this year — its second largest in history. Advocates are asking Lamont to consider using it to help offset the federal shortfall. Legislative leaders are considering appropriating the money during a special session next month. [WSHU]

Georgia

The government shutdown triggered a wave of closures of Head Start centers, leaving students who are from low-income households, are homeless or are in foster care without preschool. [WABE]

Kemp has said he will not release any funds for Head Start, SNAP, or other federal programs. [WABE] He instead called on Georgia's two Democratic senators to vote to reopen the government, calling SNAP benefits running out ""the latest example of D.C. Democrats putting bad politics over the people they claim to care about."" [Georgia Public Broadcasting]

For federal workers living paycheck to paycheck, one option to get through being furloughed could be filing for unemployment insurance, Georgia Labor Commissioner Barbara Rivera Holmes said. The employees will have to pay the benefits back once the shutdown ends and they receive back pay, but the benefits can help them make ends meet while they are not being paid. [GPB]

Georgia farmers could also face delays in block grant funding and commodity data they rely on during the time-sensitive season of planting and harvesting. [NPR]

Hawaii

Uncertainty surrounding the distribution of SNAP benefits and ongoing furloughs during the government shutdown is straining federal employees in Hawai'i. A food pantry in Oʻahu food pantry added an extra day of distributions specifically for federal workers. [Hawai'i Public Radio]

Hawaii is setting aside $100 million to help eligible families with housing and utility payments. [Hawai'i Public Radio]

Farmers in Hawaii also worry about the impacts of the lapse in SNAP funding, as they rely on selling their produce at markets and grocery stores that serve SNAP users. [Hawai'i Public Radio]

University of Hawaiʻi is paying affected employees out of pocket during shutdown. Over 830 University of Hawaiʻi employees are at least partially paid through federal dollars, with thousands more in positions that are fully federally funded. UH has been able to pay them with internal funds, but it costs more than $20 million a pay period — every two weeks — for the system to match their salaries. [Hawaiʻi Public Radio]

For more on the impact in Hawai'i, head to Hawaiʻi Public Radio.

Illinois

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker signed an executive order to direct $20 million in state funding from the Illinois Department of Human Services and the BRIDGE Fund to support food banks across Illinois. The state's BRIDGE reserve fund has about $100 million in it and was created to fill short-term needs in response to Trump administration actions. [WBEZ].

Food pantries and pop-ups on the South and West sides of Chicago were hit with long lines on Saturday [WEBZ].

Three workers who spoke with the Chicago Sun-Times said they haven't been furloughed, but they've dealt with uncertainties and fragmented coordination since the federal government shut down Oct. 1 on top of a year of uncertainty. [Chicago Public Media]

Pritzker also signed an executive order to mobilize state support for farmers who have been feeling the impact of Trump's tariffs, including soybean prices dropping and leaving farmers with losses of $100 to $200 per acre. [WBEZ]

Indiana

U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins visited Indiana for the National FFA Convention and Expo and spoke about SNAP benefits. She blamed Democrats' refusal to approve stop-gap funding: ""Even if we could, we're going to be back at this same conversation in two weeks when it runs out again,"" she said. [WFYI]

An estimated 24,000 civilians in Indiana work for the federal government. Gleaners Food Bank set up food distribution systems to help federal workers in Indiana impacted by the shutdown. [WFYI]

Nonprofits that serve lower-income families in Southern Indiana say they're worried about the shutdown exacerbating food insecurity in the area. [Louisville Public Media]

Iowa

Over 60,000 Iowans participate in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children. [IPR]

Iowa's Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has been meeting with the state's six regional food banks. HHS will use existing state funds to match cash donations to the food banks up to $1 million [Iowa Public Radio]

Kansas

Jimmy Chen, who grew up living with food insecurity in Kansas City, made a free app for people on food stamps. His company is giving some of its users $50 each to help offset the government's delayed SNAP payments. [KCUR]

During the last two shutdowns, the USDA did not publish its monthly crop reports. This comes at an inconvenient time as Midwest farmers are in harvest season. [KCUR]

For more on the impact in Kansas City, head to KCUR.

Kentucky

Gov. Andy Beshear has been ""noncommittal"" toward the idea of holding a special legislative session on SNAP funding. [Louisville Public Media]

State Rep. Nancy Tate said that she supports holding a special legislative session to consider how the state could help food banks: ""They're the people that are on the front line."" [WKU]

Food Pantries called for extra support in navigating the SNAP benefits cliff. [Louisville Public Media]

Louisiana

Gov. Jeff Landry has declared a state of emergency to fund Louisiana SNAP benefits amid federal shutdown. The initial round of funding will come from the Louisiana Department of Health. Legislators also have the option to tap into a state reserve fund to subsidize future months and have approved the initial $150 million ask. [WWNO/WRKF]

Some Head Start providers in Louisiana have taken out loans to keep operating if the government shutdown stretches into its second month. [WWNO]

The National Flood Insurance Program, or NFIP, is managed by FEMA and provides flood insurance to those who don't have a private option. It has grown in size as most homeowners' insurance policies across the U.S. have dropped flood damage entirely. It covers nearly half a million Louisianans. Policyholders with expiring contracts could lose coverage and funds to pay claims have dropped $30 billion due to the shutdown. [WWNO/WRKF]

For more on the impact in Louisiana, head to WWNO/WRKF.

Maine

Maine receives $29 million monthly for roughly 170,000 residents who are on SNAP. [Maine Public]

Officials from the Maine Department of Health and Human Services say they are still waiting for guidance from the Trump administration about when food assistance money will be available. ""Once that direction is received, the department stands ready to issue payments to eligible recipients as quickly as possible,"" Lindsay Hammes, spokeswoman for DHHS said. [Maine Public]

Even though much of the staff of Acadia National Park in Maine has been furloughed, it has still been busy at the park. [Maine Public]

Maryland

Maryland Gov. Wes Moore declared a state of emergency Thursday, citing widespread economic disruption, and allocated $10 million to food banks and partner organizations across the state. [WAMU]

Prince George's County is home to more than 60,000 federal workers. The Capital Area Food Bank has been distributing food to federal workers affected by the shutdown. But the timing is a double burden: The Capital Area Food Bank has seen some of its own federal funding slashed even as demand skyrockets. [WAMU]

Massachusetts

Gov. Maura Healey said she won't tap Massachusetts' multi-billion-dollar rainy day account to shore up federal food benefits. Instead, she announced $4 million from another state fund, doubling the state's regular November payment to food banks. [WBUR]

Still, food banks warned they can't make up for the 56 million meals SNAP benefits would typically cover in Massachusetts this month. On Saturday, the first day of the freeze, nearly 600 people waited in line outside a health center for just one bag of groceries. [WBUR]

Michigan

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and House Republican leaders announced a plan to use $4.5 million in state money for the Food Bank Council of Michigan. [WEMU]

Michigan food pantries say they're already overwhelmed by the demand, including from SNAP recipients. [Michigan Public]

More than 9,700 Michigan retailers accept SNAP benefits. In 2023, those retailers redeemed more than $3.6 billion in benefits. Many of those places are now bracing for uncertainty. [Michigan Public]

Some Michigan counties have taken extra steps. Washtenaw County Commissioners scheduled a vote to allocate funding from the Older Persons' Millage to various food assistance programs. ""We had to think about what we could do to try to shore some of this up to try and help a little bit,""Commission Chair Katie Scott said. [WEMU]

Minnesota

The head of Minnesota's Department of Children, Youth and Families said SNAP recipients in the state can expect to receive partial benefits this month although the timeline is unclear. [MPR News]

Last week, Gov. Tim Walz announced $4 million in emergency state funding for Minnesota's food pantries as the federal shutdown continues. [MPR News]

Mississippi

Gov. Tate Reeves attacked Democrats in Congress for the shutdown, saying on X that his state is unable to cover the costs, ""There is sadly no simple way for state government to just step in and pay the hundreds of millions of dollars in harm that this shutdown by the Washington Democrats is causing.""

Reeves announced that he has requested a waiver from the USDA to ban the purchase of unhealthy processed foods and drinks using SNAP benefits, and allow the purchase of hot prepared chicken.

Missouri

Roughly 650,000 Missourians will not receive SNAP benefits for the month of November due to the ongoing government shutdown. [St. Louis Public Radio]

The Gateway Arch and Old Courthouse in downtown St. Louis are temporarily closed, with National Park Service work largely on hold. [St. Louis Public Radio] The Gateway Arch briefly reopened, but closed again once the shutdown went into its second month.

Gov. Mike Kehoe announced funding for Missouri food aid programs. The state is transferring $10.6 million to Missouri Area Agencies on Aging to provide meals to seniors across the state. Another $5 million will be given to food banks using Temporary Assistance for Needy Families funding. [St. Louis Public Radio]

New Hampshire

SNAP serves more than 75,000 people in New Hampshire. New Hampshire food assistance programs will receive an influx of $2 million in state funding for more than 75,000 state residents who rely on SNAP. [NHPR]

On Oct. 7, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., the veteran appropriator who has helped broker past bipartisan deals, told NPR, she has been working behind the scenes with senators from both parties to ""find common ground."" [NPR]

Gov. Kelly Ayotte announced Monday mobile food pantries for SNAP recipients will be available starting Wednesday, Nov. 5, and encouraged Granite Staters who could to make a donation to the New Hampshire Food Bank.

For more on the impact in New Hampshire, head to NHPR.

North Dakota

The state-owned Bank of North Dakota is partnering with local banks and credit unions to provide short-term low interest loans to federal government employees and members of the armed services stationed in North Dakota, if they experience financial hardship because of the federal government shutdown. [Prairie Public]

Gov. Kelly Armstrong announced he has directed more than $1.5 million in state funds to support food assistance programs. He said the state possesses the resources to respond to the shortfall — but not the infrastructure. ""We're still trying to get more guidance to figure out if there's a way we can lessen the impact."" [Prairie Public]

For more on the impact in North Dakota, head to Prairie Public.

Oklahoma

With the federal government shut down, National Park rangers are not present at the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum. Victims, family members and first responders are stepping in to educate visitors on the location's story.⁠ [KOSU]

Gov. Kevin Stitt, House Speaker Kyle Hilbert and Senate Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton announced a vote to make $1 million a week available to Oklahoma food banks. It comes from the $7.8 million State Emergency Fund and would last up to seven weeks. [KOSU]

Oregon

Oregon's political representatives espouse opposing statements about who is to blame for the shutdown depending on their political party [OPB].

Gov. Tina Kotek announced she's sending $5 million in state funding to food banks. The governor is tapping unspent funds from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the federal program that aids low-income families with children. [OPB]

Pennsylvania

Despite a court ordering the federal government to pay at least partial November food assistance benefits, Pennsylvanians likely won't see that aid anytime soon — due to an extremely complex and cumbersome process federal officials are requiring — according to state human services officials. [WESA]

Tens of thousands of Pennsylvania-based federal workers furloughed during the government shutdown may be eligible for unemployment compensation through the state Department of Labor & Industry. [WITF]

The SNAP freeze comes at the same time as the commonwealth's own budget impasse, which has stalled billions of dollars meant for schools and social services. [WHYY]

""The Commonwealth cannot backfill these costs,"" Pennsylvania human services officials said in a statement. [WESA]

Tennessee

There are several levers federal and state officials could pull to keep 700,000 Tennesseans from losing food aid. But as of now, it seems no one is touching them. [WPLN]

Timmeshia Fleming is a mother of three in Nashville who has used SNAP benefits off and on for years. She said interruptions and delays mean money has to go to food instead of other bills. She told WPLN, it's especially harrowing when it comes without ample warning. [WPLN]

Texas

Austin-Bergstrom International Airport has so far dodged the worst of flight delays caused by the federal government shutdown. But as the shutdown drags, it is becoming increasingly difficult for Austin's chronically short-staffed tower [KUT].

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program provides food purchasing support to approximately 3.5 million Texans, including more than 1.7 million children. Those benefits amount to around $617 million per month. [KUT]

U.S. Customs and Border Protection employees who inspect cargo at the 32 other official ports of entry are among the essential federal workers who must remain on the job unpaid. The longer the shutdown lasts, the greater the risk of cargo backups at these Texas ports due to unpaid employees calling in sick. [Houston Public Media]

Utah

In Ogden, Utah, about 10 percent work for the IRS, and when federal workers stop getting paychecks, impacts are felt quickly and broadly. [KUER]

State leaders have pledged $500,000 a week to Utah Food Bank to support Utahns who rely on federal government food assistance, up to $4 million. [KUER]

The connection between economic stress and domestic violence is long established. Some domestic violence service providers in the state worry the resulting stress from the shutdown could lead to more violence at home. [KUER]

Vermont

Vermont's Democratic congresswoman Becca Balint called on House Speaker Mike Johnson to bring House Republicans back to the negotiating table: ""It's astounding,"" she said. ""We have never had a Speaker of the House give up all of his power and authority — and by extension, all of our authority — by disbanding the House."" [Vermont Public]

Gov. Phil Scott and legislative leaders have approved a $6.3 million plan to backfill food benefits for 15 days but the Department for Children and Families says it might not be able to transfer that money to recipients' Electronic Benefits Transfer cards until Nov. 7. [Vermont Public]

Lawmakers and the governor allocated $250,000 to bolster supplies at local food banks in the meantime. Anore Horton, executive director of Hunger Free Vermont, said that figure falls well short of the lost buying power SNAP recipients will experience in the meantime. [Vermont Public]

Most Head Start programs in Vermont are not being immediately affected by the federal government shutdown, but that could change if the shutdown continues for another month. [Vermont Public]

Meanwhile, Vermont is waiting on more than $22 million in federal funds for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance, or LIHEAP, which helps people who can't afford to fill their heating tanks this winter. [Vermont Public]

The ICE officer allegedly suffered injuries including severe burns and a deep laceration on his face which needed 13 stitches.

The incident happened when ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) officers tried to detain Rodriguez, 33, after his most recent reentry into the U.S.

Authorities said Rodriguez has since been referred for federal prosecution for illegal reentry and assaulting a federal officer.

Per the release, Rodriguez’s criminal record includes a conviction for sexual assault of a child under 17, multiple DUIs and repeated illegal entries into the U.S.

He was deported in 2013 and again in 2020 after serving prison time for his offenses.

""This young officer’s life has forever been altered as a result of the continued hyper-politicization of routine law enforcement activities and spread of misinformation by the media, NGOs, and other groups opposed to immigration enforcement,"" said Bret Bradford, ICE’s Houston Field Office Director.

The assault comes as ICE moves forward with its operations nationwide amid what DHS officials have called ""the Democrats’ longest government shutdown in American history.""

Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin praised ICE personnel Thursday for maintaining operations under challenging conditions.

Gregory Bovino lied repeatedly in his deposition testimony about force that his agents and he himself personally inflicted in incidents across the Chicago area.
“In one of the videos, Bovino obviously attacks and tackles the declarant, Mr. Blackburn, to the ground,” Ellis said.

“They are inciting violence and then they are using the violence that they have created to justify even more violence.","A federal judge in Chicago on Thursday issued a sweeping injunction that puts more permanent restrictions on the use of force by immigration agents during “Operation Midway Blitz,” saying top government officials lied in their testimony about threats that protesters posed and that their unlawful behavior on the streets “shows no signs of stopping.”

“I find the government’s evidence to be simply not credible,” U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis said in an oral ruling from the bench, describing a litany of incidents over the past month and a half where citizens were tear-gassed “indiscriminately,” beaten and tackled by agents and struck in the face with pepper-spray balls.

Judge orders release of US Border Patrol head Gregory Bovino deposition videos: Watch them here

“The use of force shocks the conscience,” Ellis said.

The judge noted in particular that Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino lied repeatedly in his deposition testimony about force that his agents and he himself personally inflicted in incidents across the Chicago area.

“In one of the videos, Bovino obviously attacks and tackles the declarant, Mr. Blackburn, to the ground,” Ellis said. “But Mr. Bovino, despite watching this video (in his deposition) says that he never used force.”

The preliminary injunction largely mirrors — and replaces — a temporary restraining order issued by Ellis in early October that was set to expire at 11:30 a.m. Thursday. She instructed the government to notify each agency of its details and disseminate it to employees by no later than 10 p.m. Thursday.

The judge said she’d put out a more fulsome written ruling at a later time, but for now, it enjoins immigration agents from deploying tear gas or other munitions before issuing two explicit warnings, requires agents in the field to have body-worn cameras and wear clear identification on their uniforms and forbids law enforcement from targeting journalists or interrupting their news gathering in most circumstances.

Unlike the temporary restraining order, the preliminary injunction remains in effect until a final decision is made on the merits of the case, either at trial or through a settlement.

In her detailed ruling, Ellis not only denounced the heavy-handed policies of the administration of President Donald Trump, but issued a biting referendum of its clumsy views of Chicago itself, saying the city she sees “is a vibrant place, brimming with vitality and hope.”

She began by quoting from Carl Sandburg‘s famed poem, “Chicago,” which gave the city the ubiquitous nickname “City of Big Shoulders,” pausing to look up as she read the line: “And having answered so I turn once more to those who sneer at this my city, and I give them back the sneer.”

The judge ended her ruling by quoting from the Founding Fathers, including John Adams, who wrote to his wife, Abigail: “Liberty once lost is lost forever.”

She also quoted a 1737 essay by Benjamin Franklin, who wrote: “The freedom of speech is a principal pillar in a free Government: when this support is taken away the Constitution is dissolved, and Tyranny is erected on its Ruins.”

After court adjourned, more than two dozen plaintiffs attorneys and others involved in the case celebrated in the lobby of the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse, saying it was an important victory in reining in some of the abuses of the last nine months but noting that much work was still left to be done by the community — including staying vigilant and reporting any violations going forward.

“We have seen democracy in action and there is nothing that can stop it,” said Steve Art, the lead plaintiffs’ attorney. “We will win in the end.”

Longtime civil rights attorney Jon Loevy said the case was about a bedrock American principle of people being free to make their voices heard.

“ICE has come to town. They said they were going to go after murderers and rapists, but we all know how that’s played out,” Loevy said. “They are attacking communities. They are grabbing people at work, at Home Depots, people on the street, people with their kids, people near schools. And some people don’t like it, and they have a right to protest. They have a right to stand up and say, ‘We don’t want this. Go home.'”

Asked how the injunction would be enforced going forward, especially in light of the many alleged violations of the restraining order, Art said there was evidence that use of tear gas and other chemicals on protesters has lessened over the past month and the injunction only amps up the pressure to comply.

“When Greg Bovino was called in to testify on the stand because of all the violations that we found, what did we see?” Art said. “We saw the tear gas suddenly stop.”

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a statement Thursday it would appeal the ruling, and that the injunction was “an extreme act by an activist judge that risks the lives and livelihoods of law enforcement officers.”

The statement repeated language used previously about “rioters, gangbangers and terrorists” who have “opened fire” on federal officers, thrown rocks, bottles and other projectiles and rammed and ambushed them.

Ellis, however, noted that the government produced virtually no evidence of any of that in the proceedings before her, despite submitting more than 500 hours of body-cam footage and other videos from protests across the Chicago area.

Ellis’ ruling came after a marathon day of evidence Wednesday that featured the sworn videotaped deposition of Bovino, the tough-talking face of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement push, as well as live testimony from more than a half-dozen witnesses who said immigration agents pointed guns at citizens and threatened to arrest protesters who were doing nothing more than recording the agents’ activities on the street.

One of them, 12th Ward Ald. Julia Ramírez, testified she went to the scene where an agent had shot a woman in the Brighton Park neighborhood on Oct. 4 and was stunned to see immigration agents rolling what looked like a tank down Kedzie Avenue. Perched on top of the armored vehicle, an agent was pointing a gun at the crowd, she said.

“I couldn’t even believe I was living that. I felt helpless,” Ramírez testified, adding that the episode has had a “chilling” effect on residents and her personally. “I carry my passport around. My grandmother who is also a U.S. citizen doesn’t leave the house. I have to go out for her.”

What to know about immigration enforcement raids in Chicago after 3 months

But the judge also heard from a Border Patrol supervisor who testified about the violence and threats agents have been subjected to on Chicago-area streets, including protesters who fired commercial-grade fireworks at them, wielded makeshift shields outfitted with nails and threatened to ram their vehicles or call in gang members to shoot them.

Kristopher Hewson, a 19-year Border Patrol veteran, was asked near the end of the day whether he had “hesitation” about testifying.

“Of course, I did,” he says. “Coming in here with my face exposed and my name exposed could eventually lead to a doxing event or threats of harm to my family.”

But it was the testimony of Bovino, who came to Chicago in mid-September after similar operations in Los Angeles, that was center stage.

Although the deposition itself lasted more than six hours, Ellis watched only clips of Bovino’s testimony in which he not only did not back down one bit on the tactics his officers have used during “Operation Midway Blitz,” but even doubled down.

Asked at one point by veteran Chicago civil rights attorney Locke Bowman if he stood by remarks he made to CBS that the use of force at the Broadview ICE facility has been “exemplary,” Bovino at first surprised everyone by saying, “No.”

“The uses of force have been more than exemplary,” Bovino then clarified.

He was also shown video of him tackling a protester at the Broadview immigration facility in September and asked point-blank: Did you apply any force here?

“No,” answered Bovino, explaining that all he saw was himself making a lawful arrest. That’s different, he said, from a “reportable use of force” like deploying tear gas or shooting someone or using “open-hand strikes.”

Asked if force could be applied in the course of an arrest, Bovino seemed momentarily confused by the question.

“It’s possible,” he said. “In this case, the use of force was against me.”

But plaintiffs’ attorneys accused Bovino of lying repeatedly in his testimony, including a blatant misrepresentation about what happened during a high-profile incident in the Little Village neighborhood, where Bovino was seen leading an immigration action that targeted a laundromat and discount mall and sparked vehement protests on the streets.

At one point, Bovino was captured on video throwing tear gas above the heads of the crowd without warning and “despite an absence of threats or violence,” the filing alleged.

Bovino claimed he only did so after being hit in the head with a rock — a statement repeated on social media and again in his deposition, even though no video or other evidence of it happening ever surfaced.

It wasn’t until Bovino came back for a third round of questioning Tuesday that he admitted it had not occurred, Steve Art, lead attorney for the plaintiffs, told the judge in his closing argument.

“A government agent who is leading this operation cannot come into court and make stories up and expect to be treated like a credible witness,” Art said.

In their arguments, the plaintiffs said the abuses of immigration agents on the streets of Chicago comes from the very top, including Trump, who made it “abundantly clear that he elected Chicago for this operation, he then ordered and directed DHS to commence this operation here.”

They played video of DHS Secretary Kristi Noem giving a pep talk to Bovino and his agents at the Broadview facility in early October, saying they should “go hard” at people who voiced dissent against law enforcement tactics — language Bovino later incorporated into his own public statements.

In his closing, Art said DHS has “unleashed weapons of war” on Chicago.

“They are using a gas that is banned even in war,” Art said. “They are inciting violence and then they are using the violence that they have created to justify even more violence. They are harming everyone.”

At the end of his argument, Art turned toward the Department of Justice attorneys at the defense table and said, “In our opinion, these defendants should be ashamed of themselves.”

“In our opinion, this is a disgrace,” Art said. “And one of the great things about our Constitution is that if that’s what we think, we can say it.”

DOJ lawyer Sarmad Khojasteh countered by arguing the case is not about exercising free speech, but allowing law enforcement to do its job in the face of agitators who conflate constitutional rights with violent action.

“This case addresses to what extent does the freedom of speech protect people throwing rocks, bottles, trespassing, pinning down law enforcement, slashing tires, wielding weapons,” Khojasteh said.

After the ruling Thursday, Bowman was asked about his thoughts sitting across from Bovino in the deposition and hearing his curious responses, including denying that he tackled a person when he’d been captured on video doing exactly that.

Bowman said that he didn’t know what was going on in Bovino’s mind during those answers, but if he’d thought of himself as “a smooth liar,” then “in that deposition he was unmasked.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CTC-L-ICE-1001-67_241948666-e1761323560998.jpg?w=1024&h=673,N,,2025-11-07 10:58:45.701021

State law blocks local government entities, including school districts, from limiting cooperation or interfering with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other agencies.
Officers must have a warrant signed by a judge, or it must be an emergency, according to the lawsuit — and IPS legal counsel must authorize the access.
“ICE faced significant obstacles — caused by IPS policies and actions on January 8 — in its efforts to reunite the father and the son,” the complaint reads.
Rokita’s office sent a second letter on Oct. 3 about the findings of its investigation into IPS policies.","Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita on Thursday filed suit against Indianapolis Public Schools — with help from a conservative think tank — accusing the state’s largest public school district of “thwarting” federal immigration enforcement.

State law blocks local government entities, including school districts, from limiting cooperation or interfering with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other agencies.

“No public institution in Indiana has the right to pick and choose which laws to follow,” Rokita said in a news release. “When a school district refuses to cooperate with ICE, it doesn’t just break the law — it endangers students, protects criminal aliens, and sends a dangerous message to every government body in this state: that compliance is optional. Not on my watch.”

The lawsuit seeks an injunction preventing IPS from enforcing its policies.

Noem announces 223 immigration arrests in roadway blitz with Indiana State Police

In a Thursday evening statement, the IPS board of school commissioners affirmed the district’s commitment to “ensuring safe, supportive, and welcoming learning environments for all students.”

“As has always been the case, we will continue to uphold the law while keeping these commitments,” the board added, before knocking Rokita’s intentions.

“While IPS takes all legal obligations seriously, we respectfully hope that all concerned parties will recognize the heavy burden that silly litigation and political posturing places on students, families, and taxpayers,” the statement continued. “Every dollar spent on defensive legal posture is a dollar not spent on instructional support, teacher development, student services, or enrichment. In this case, Mr. Rokita prefers those dollars go to fight gratuitous political battles, as has too often been the case.”

Lawsuit’s claims

Rokita alleged IPS has “sanctuary” policies that bar employees from assisting immigration officers unless their cooperation is required by law and approved by the district’s superintendent.

IPS also prohibits employees from gathering, maintaining or sharing the immigration status of students, their families and district staff unless it’s legally required, Rokita asserted.

Finally, he accused the district of limiting ICE access to school facilities. Officers must have a warrant signed by a judge, or it must be an emergency, according to the lawsuit — and IPS legal counsel must authorize the access.

Rokita argued the district’ policies don’t let employees voluntarily comply — which he said violates state law — and that the limits are impermissibly stricter than federal law.

“Sanctuary policies are bad in any context, but they are especially troubling in our schools,” he said, in a news release. He claimed schools are “vulnerable to infiltration by criminal illegal aliens” and said that’s why “it’s essential that ICE be able to take action when that occurs to help keep our kids safe.”

The lawsuit described how IPS procedures tripped up one Honduran national’s planned self-deportation earlier this year. His son went to school on the day of the deportation flight.

“ICE faced significant obstacles — caused by IPS policies and actions on January 8 — in its efforts to reunite the father and the son,” the complaint reads.

The district asked ICE to produce a judicial order or demonstrate that it was an emergency, employees put the child in contact with an immigration attorney and legal counsel for both ICE and IPS went back and forth throughout the day.

The man missed his flight, and his voluntary deportation order expired later that day, according to the lawsuit. The child was released to the immigration attorney after the school day.

Story continues below.

That prompted a February letter and civil investigative demand from Rokita’s office to IPS about its policies. The district replied in April and made some changes in response, but the edits “did next to nothing to ameliorate the policies’ legal infirmities,” the lawsuit reads.

Rokita’s office sent a second letter on Oct. 3 about the findings of its investigation into IPS policies. The complaint accuses the district of failing to give substantive responses by an Oct. 17 deadline, or by an Oct. 28 extension. “Accordingly,” Rokita determined there’s probable cause the district has violated Indiana Code.

In its statement, IPS confirmed the district has been “actively collaborating” with the Office of Attorney General to review its policies and procedures. School board members said they needed more time to respond.

“Unfortunately, despite taking six months to craft his opinion on IPS’ policies, Mr. Rokita permitted only five business days from the time IPS received his review to respond, and then refused IPS’ request for any additional time,” they said. “Yet, these important issues deserve thoughtful, deliberative weighing of important legal rights — not impulsive, superficial efforts for political gain.”

Board members also criticized Rokita’s use of the term “aliens” for noncitizen children and their families, saying that he’s “willfully dehumanizing” them and instead calling students “invaluable, unique, and bright human beings.”

“In Indianapolis Public Schools, the safety and security of our students is our top priority, and this commitment is non-negotiable,” the board concluded.

The America First Policy Institute joined the case as special counsel.

“Attorney General Rokita is showing exactly the kind of leadership America needs,” said Leigh Ann O’Neill, the conservative think tank’s chief legal affairs officer. “When state attorneys general act boldly to enforce cooperation with federal immigration law, they help protect families, uphold the rule of law, and stop the political gamesmanship that endangers our communities.”

She said the institute is “proud to support this work” and is ready to help other attorneys general “looking to follow Indiana’s lead.”

The national nonprofit worked alongside the Attorney General’s office in developing the legal strategy. The institute sees the Indiana case as a model for other state leaders to hold “rogue” state government agencies accountable and restore lawful cooperation between local institutions and federal agencies.

Meanwhile, the state’s largest professional educators organization proclaimed that it “stands with” IPS.

The Indiana State Teachers Association “believes every child in Indiana, regardless of background or immigration status, has the right to a safe and welcoming public school,” the group said. “Educators have both a professional and moral responsibility to protect the wellbeing of their students and ensure schools remain places of learning, trust and stability.”

“ISTA stands with Indianapolis Public Schools and its educators who are working every day to uphold these values,” it continued. “Turning schools into extensions of immigration enforcement threatens that trust and undermines the learning environment every student deserves. Our focus must remain on educating and protecting students, not politicizing their safety.”",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-06-at-3.02.43 PM-scaled-e1762459551523-2048x1133.jpeg,N,,2025-11-07 09:16:59.466326

US senators voted 51-49 against the measure introduced last month by Sens. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and Adam Schiff (D-Calif.). Two Republicans—Paul and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska—joined Democrats and Independents in voting for the resolution.

""It's sad that only two Republicans voted in favor,"" Medea Benjamin, co-founder of the peace group CodePink, said on X following the vote. ""So much for 'America First' and for upholding their constitutional authority by stopping the executive branch from taking illegal military actions.""

Retired Maj. Gen. Paul Eaton, a senior adviser to the group VoteVets, said in a statement that President Donald Trump ""is waging a war that he unilaterally declared and refuses to get approved by the American people via their representation in Congress.""

""It isn't just criminal and unconstitutional, it betrays those who did fight on battlefields and spilled blood to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States,"" Eaton added. ""Shame on the Republicans who continue to shirk their duty and deny their constituents a voice.""

The War Powers Resolution was passed over then-President Richard Nixon's veto in 1973 to affirm and empower Congress to check the president’s war-making authority. The law requires the president to report any military action to Congress within 48 hours and requires congressional approval of troop deployments exceeding 60 days.

It's been 63 days since the first-known Trump-ordered the first strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean. At least 67 people have been killed in 16 such reported strikes since September 2, according to the Trump administration, which argues that it does not need congressional approval for the attacks.

Speaking on the Senate floor ahead of Thursday's vote, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said:

As we speak, America’s largest aircraft carrier, the Gerald Ford, is on its way to the Caribbean. It is part of the largest military buildup in our hemisphere that we’ve seen in decades. According to press reports, Donald Trump is considering military action on Venezuelan territory. But it also sounds like nobody really knows what the plan is, because like so many other things with Donald Trump, he keeps changing his mind. Who knows what he will do tomorrow?

Trump has also approved covert CIA action in Venezuela and has threatened to attack targets inside the oil-rich country. The government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro recently claimed that his country’s security forces had captured a group of CIA-aligned mercenaries engaged in a “false-flag attack” against the nation.

Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) said after Thursday's vote: “Today, I was proud to once again cast my vote for Senator Kaine’s war powers resolution. President Trump is acting against the Constitution by moving toward imminent attacks against Venezuela without congressional authorization. In doing so, he is risking endless military conflict with Venezuela and steamrolling over the right of every American to have a say in the use of US military force.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.png?id=62085601&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C54%2C0%2C54,N,,2025-11-07 11:58:08.781939

Members of the Public Safety and Government Efficiency Committees voted not to pursue a 287(g) agreement with ICE, using a procedural move that prevents the issue from advancing to the full City Council for now.

The decision followed weeks of debate after Police Chief Daniel Comeaux revealed last month that he had rejected a $25 million offer from the federal government tied to the proposal.

The agreement, he said, would have required Dallas officers to arrest at least 50 undocumented immigrants each day.

“This program would not help us make everyone safer in Dallas,” Comeaux told council members during the special joint meeting.

He said pulling officers off patrol for immigration enforcement could erode community trust at a time when public confidence in police is improving and response times are decreasing.

“I don’t want to take away that traction,” Comeaux said.

Comeaux’s stance drew sharp criticism from some residents who accused him of rejecting badly needed resources.

“You turned down $25 million, as if our neighborhoods aren’t being invaded,” one speaker said.

Others thanked the chief for refusing to cooperate with ICE, urging the city to “choose courage over fear and money.”

Andy Kim (D-NJ), have pushed to rein in Trump’s war powers has stalled in the Senate.
The history behind AUMFs Congress last voted to declare war in 1942, during World War II, the 11th time it has done so, according to the Senate Historical Office.

Under a 1973 law, formally called the War Powers Resolution, a president who orders a U.S. military operation “shall terminate” within 60 days the use of armed forces in the scenario unless Congress has declared war or authorized the activity.","WASHINGTON — Congress is split on moving to check President Donald Trump’s authority to start wars.

Trump is ordering lethal military strikes on what the administration says are suspected drug smugglers in the eastern Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea and he is suggesting the prospect of attacking Venezuela.

Under Trump’s direction, the U.S. also launched air strikes with “bunker buster” bombs against an Iranian nuclear site in June.

The House of Representatives voted in September, 261-167, to attach a bipartisan amendment to defense legislation that would rescind two legal authorities presidential administrations of both parties have used to send U.S. forces into combat, including recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Those authorizations, formally called “authorizations for military force”, or AUMFs, are decades old — one is from 1991, the other 2002.

On Thursday, the Senate voted 51-49 along party lines to prevent bringing a similar measure up for a vote. Legislation Democratic Senators, including Sen. Andy Kim (D-NJ), have pushed to rein in Trump’s war powers has stalled in the Senate.

“I share the sentiment that we need to reassert Congress’ authority when it comes to this,” Kim said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News, following the Iran bombings.

For decades, presidents of both political parties have used these authorities as legal foundations to send U.S. troops into battle, despite the fact the Constitution grants Congress alone the sole capacity to declare war.

The history behind AUMFs

Congress last voted to declare war in 1942, during World War II, the 11th time it has done so, according to the Senate Historical Office.

In the decades since, presidents and U.S. military leaders have initiated wars, spanning Vietnam in the 1970s, the Persian Gulf in the 1990s and wars after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, in Afghanistan and Iraq with authorizations.

Historically, authorizations, which Congress also votes on, have been narrower in their scope than formal war declarations.

On the campaign trail in 2016, Trump called the Iraq war begun under George W. Bush and deepened during the Obama administration a “big, fat mistake.”

“George Bush made a mistake. We can make mistakes. But that one was a beauty. We should have never been in Iraq,” Trump said during a 2016 presidential debate.

Once in office, Trump used the 2002 AUMF to expand military operations against the terrorist group ISIS in Syria and the wider Middle East, following a similar pattern from former President Barack Obama, who used the same authorization to pursue the militant group, often by drone strikes.

The Trump admin’s military operations in Latin America

The Pentagon has expanded its military firepower in recent weeks, targeting criminal groups operating in the drug trade in Latin America via 16 military strikes, as of Thursday.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the latest strike Tuesday. “We will find and terminate EVERY vessel with the intention of trafficking drugs to America to poison our citizens,” Hegseth said in an online post.

Members of both political parties have pushed the Trump administration for details about legal justification of the strikes, since Congress has not authorized them.

Under a 1973 law, formally called the War Powers Resolution, a president who orders a U.S. military operation “shall terminate” within 60 days the use of armed forces in the scenario unless Congress has declared war or authorized the activity. The president is allowed to extend the period 30 days.

With a letter, Trump notified Congress of his military campaign in the Caribbean on Sept. 4, making the 60th and final day authorized this past Monday. In his letter, the president invoked the 1973 law.

When asked by NJ Spotlight News for the legal justification of these strikes, a DOJ official said, “These operations were ordered consistent with the law of armed conflict.” They did not specify a legal statute or law.

Department of Justice spokeswoman Natalie Baldassarre referred questions about briefing Congress to the White House.

White House spokeswoman Victoria LaCivita did not respond to a request for comment.

Before the U.S. struck Iran in June, the administration briefed Republican leaders on Capitol Hill but did not tell all high-ranking Democrats until after the attack.

The Gang of Eight

“If there’s an imminent attack, generally the Gang of Eight is briefed,” Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-5th) said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News. “That’s why I have an issue here that the Gang of Eight wasn’t briefed.”

The Gang of Eight refers to the top leaders of both parties in the Senate and House, plus the highest-ranking Republicans and Democrats on both congressional intelligence committees.

As a member of the House intelligence committee, Gottheimer is briefed more frequently than the rest of Congress.

When he was a House member, Kim sponsored legislation to repeal the 2001 AUMF.

In June, it was unclear to Kim what legal authority Trump invoked to bomb Iran. “Under what authority is the president doing that?” Kim asked.

“I think what Trump did was a gift to humanity, especially the Israelis, but equally, over time, other middle eastern countries and us,” — Rep. Chris Smith

In an interview with NJ Spotlight News, Rep. Chris Smith (R-4th) said the president’s decision to strike Iran was wise, calling the country’s missile program a serious threat.

“I think what Trump did was a gift to humanity, especially the Israelis, but equally, over time, other middle eastern countries and us,” Smith said.

“As they develop an ICBM capability, they would use it,” Smith said, using the shorthand for an intercontinental ballistic missile, a long-range weapon. “I think they’d use it in Tel Aviv and other places.”

“You have to look at what the threat is. It’s existential and real,” Smith said. “First to Israel, but also to us.”

The amendment that cleared the House is part of a broader annual bill Congress must pass to approve Pentagon operations. Lawmakers are expected to take it up once they can reach a deal to fund the government, currently in the midst of the longest shutdown in U.S. history.

New Jersey’s congressional delegation voted on the amendment along party lines, with Democrats voting to repeal the authorities and Republicans voting to maintain them.

One resolution (S. J. Res. 59) to block the U.S. from engaging in hostilities with Iran was voted down by the Senate in June, 47-53, with Kim and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) voting yes.

A separate resolution (S. J. Res. 83), to pull U.S. forces back from hostilities that Congress had not approved, fell short in the Senate, 48-51, in an October vote. Kim and Booker voted for it.

As of Thursday night, a third resolution (S. J. Res. 90) to halt unauthorized military action against Venezuela has not been discharged to the Senate floor, though a vote was scheduled for the evening. Kim signed on as a sponsor of that measure on Wednesday.

In mid-October, Trump said publicly that his administration is considering military strikes against Venezuelan territory and that he had authorized covert action by CIA operatives against the country, an extraordinary admission.

The Trump administration has been open about its desire to push Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s authoritarian head, from power.

While Congress ultimately decided against shutting down the office, the fiscal 2024 defense policy bill required the Defense Department to overhaul how it operates.
In addition, the law mandated a pilot program on alternative analysis to test new approaches for evaluating defense programs.
“You’ve been deputy director since the law passed, and since January, you’ve been acting director.
“The recent addition of statutory requirements for military construction and sustainment review cost estimating has necessitated increased delegation to the services,” Payne said.","The White House’s nominee to lead the Pentagon’s Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation office, long criticized for overstepping its advisory role, told lawmakers he would work to restore the office’s credibility by refocusing it on its statutory mission as an independent advisory rather than a decision-maker.

“I have seen CAPE take on an advocacy role that I think is inappropriate for an independent analytic organization,” Michael Payne, who is currently serving as the acting director of CAPE, told the Senate Armed Services Committee Thursday.

CAPE has faced scrutiny over the years for operating beyond its statutory responsibilities — in 2023, the House Armed Services Committee even proposed eliminating the office altogether. While Congress ultimately decided against shutting down the office, the fiscal 2024 defense policy bill required the Defense Department to overhaul how it operates.

The annual legislation required the Pentagon to create an analysis working group, which would work with CAPE, the Joint Staff and DoD components to improve analytic standards across the force. The bill also required the department to stand up an analytical team, or the “program evaluation competitive analysis cell” — an independent team to review CAPE’s methodologies, assumptions and data.

In addition, the law mandated a pilot program on alternative analysis to test new approaches for evaluating defense programs.

So far, only one of those requirements has been met. “We have stood up the analysis working group, but we absolutely need to do more. Red teaming is an important part of any scientific or analytic endeavor, and if I’m confirmed, I will make it a priority to ensure that we comply fully,” Payne said.

Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), who leads the Senate Armed Services Committee, voiced frustration during the confirmation hearing that little progress has been made, even though Payne has been in a leadership role at CAPE since the bill was signed into law.

“You’ve been deputy director since the law passed, and since January, you’ve been acting director. And yet, the second and third directives of the statute passed by the Congress and signed into law by the commander-in-chief have not been implemented — that is a concern,” Wicker said.

In his written responses to lawmakers’ questions ahead of his confirmation hearing, Payne said steering the office back to its roots and away from advocacy would be his biggest challenge. The effort, he said, would require reforming the office’s cost-estimating and program-evaluation processes to better align with department-wide ongoing acquisition reform initiatives.

“I would address the program-evaluation process by reforming the analysis of alternatives approach to better align with the reformed requirements and acquisition processes, including early engagement with industry. For cost estimating, I would focus on ensuring cost reporting requirements for industry are less burdensome in order to better facilitate the entry of non-traditional vendors into the acquisition process,” Payne said.

When asked if he believes that the CAPE office would benefit from outside reviews of its processes, Payne said he recommends “using existing government entities to conduct such reviews, that the reviews be targeted with specific objectives, and that DCAPE be given an opportunity to address the findings directly in order to implement improvements.”

‘Strained’ workforce

Payne said while the team is still capable of meeting existing legal requirements by pushing some of its cost-estimation work to the military services, CAPE’s workforce is stretched thin.

“The recent addition of statutory requirements for military construction and sustainment review cost estimating has necessitated increased delegation to the services,” Payne said.

“I believe the workforce is sufficient, though strained in certain areas as it adapts to broader national workforce demographic and skill shifts,” he added.

""The quickest way for states to get benefits into people's hands is for USDA to fund the full amount of SNAP benefits.""","Topline:

A Rhode Island federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to find enough money to restore full funding for SNAP benefits by Friday.

What the judge said: In failing to fully fund the food assistance program that covers 42 million low-income Americans, U.S. District Court Judge John McConnell Jr. said the government ""failed to consider the harms individuals who rely on those benefits would suffer.""

About the ruling: The ruling comes less than a day after the Trump administration said it would cut November's SNAP food benefits by a bit less than it had previously announced. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said allotments would be reduced by 35% instead of 50%.

How we got here: The Thursday afternoon ruling comes in response to a challenge filed by cities and nonprofits after the administration said it would halt funding for the program on Nov. 1. McConnell and another federal judge in Boston ordered the government to use emergency funds to keep SNAP funding flowing, but Trump administration officials said it was only able to partially cover the payments.

WASHINGTON — A Rhode Island federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to find enough money to restore full funding for SNAP benefits by Friday.

In failing to fully fund the food assistance program that covers 42 million low-income Americans, U.S. District Court Judge John McConnell Jr. said the government ""failed to consider the harms individuals who rely on those benefits would suffer.""

The ruling Thursday afternoon comes in response to a challenge filed by cities and nonprofits after the administration said it would halt funding for the program on Nov. 1. McConnell and another federal judge in Boston ordered the government to use emergency funds to keep SNAP funding flowing, but Trump administration officials said it was only able to partially cover the payments.

McConnell's decision comes less than a day after the Trump administration said it would cut November's SNAP food benefits by a bit less than it had previously announced. In revised guidance for states, which are calculating partial payments, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a Wednesday night court filing maximum allotments would be reduced by 35% instead of 50%.

Even with the smaller proposed cut, the complex formula for reduced payments would have stayed the same, and still mean steep cuts for those who rely on the country's largest anti-hunger program.

USDA's proposed change came after an analysis by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which found the agency's original formula for partial payments would not have tapped all of its contingency funds. Two federal judges had found the administration is legally bound to spend that money to keep SNAP going.

CBPP also estimated the original reduced benefit plan would have left nearly 5 million people with no payment at all this month.

USDA did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the center's analysis or its changed plan. But in a court filing late Wednesday related to the revised partial payment formula, the Justice department wrote the agency ""realized this error and worked to issue new guidance and tables as soon as it was discovered.""

The change will be small in some cases. For example, the reduced minimum allotment for some 1-to-2 person households had been $12, and is now $16.

McConnell ordered the administration to restart the country's largest anti-hunger program after funding lapsed last Saturday, a month into the government shutdown. USDA rejected the suggestion by that judge, and another federal judge in Boston, that it tap a larger pot of money to fully cover SNAP payments. Instead, it chose to use only a smaller contingency fund that could cover only about half of the program's monthly cost.

Implementing the administration's complex partial funding formula presents enormous procedural challenges for states, which administer the program that serves 42 million Americans. The USDA itself warned it could take weeks or even months to get the benefits to people.

""It requires a complete recalculation and a complete recoding of our system,"" said Tikki Brown, the head of Minnesota's Department of Children, Youth and Families. She said there is no timeline yet for payments in her state.

Danny Mintz, who works for the civic technology nonprofit Code for America, said some states have antiquated systems from the 1970s that make it difficult to quickly implement sweeping calculation changes.

""There are legitimate concerns that altering the calculations of benefits may break things,"" he said. ""The quickest way for states to get benefits into people's hands is for USDA to fund the full amount of SNAP benefits.""

Some states already are warning it could be weeks before payments can be made.

In a bluntly worded letter to USDA — seen by NPR member station WESA — Pennsylvania Human Services Secretary Val Arkoosh said the federal government is ""directing states to use the most complex and labor-intensive approach possible.""

Pennsylvania is asking to use a simpler, faster method that was allowed for pandemic-related aid, and would essentially give everyone half their SNAP payment.

The prospect of delays and missed payments has brought a group of cities and nonprofits back to federal court in Rhode Island, to force the Trump administration to comply with an order to restart SNAP aid ""expeditiously.""

The Los Angeles Times reported that while carrying out an immigration enforcement operation at a Home Depot in the Cypress Park neighborhood, Border Patrol officials detained a 32-year-old U.S. citizen named Dennis Quinonez, who had a 1-year-old child in the backseat of his car.

The outlet reported that ""after two agents climbed into his car — along with their weapons — they drove off with the child as onlookers protested.""

The article noted that a DHS spokesperson said Quinonez ""allegedly ‘exited his vehicle wielding a hammer and threw rocks at law enforcement while he had a child in his car.’""

The outlet also noted that the spokesperson said Quinonez ""was arrested for assault, and, during his arrest, a pistol was found in his car that is reported stolen out of the state of New York,"" adding he ""has an active warrant for property damage.""

Quinonez was charged with unlawful possession of a gun and ammunition by a person previously convicted of domestic violence, the outlet reported.

Despite this, the outlet quoted an immigration activist who said, ""The fact that they were getting into that car, heavily armed, with masks on their face, they put that toddler in extreme danger.""

The activist said, ""It should shock everyone’s conscience that we have masked armed men behaving like that with a U.S. citizen father and a toddler who were just going to run an errand at Home Depot on a random Tuesday.""

Deeper in the outlet’s coverage of the incident, it reported that the ""agents decided to drive Quinonez and his daughter separately to another location, where agents determined that the handgun was loaded with five rounds of ammunition.""

DHS CALLS OUT NBC AFFILIATE FOR HIDING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIME HISTORY IN ARREST STORY

An LA Times reporter took to X to post about the incident, writing, ""During a Border Patrol operation outside a Cypress Park Home Depot yesterday, agents detained a U.S. citizen they accused of assault. The agents drove off with his one-year-old daughter in the backseat. She's since been reunited with her family.""

The reporter added that ""Maria Avalos, the child’s grandmother, said the agents ‘shouldn’t have driven off’ with her granddaughter.""

""When they got into the car, taking my granddaughter, I said, ‘Why are they taking her, are they really ICE, are they kidnapping her or what?’"" the woman reportedly said.

This post prompted a sharp reply from DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.

""Oh ffs sake, Brittny. This U.S. citizen left his own child unattended in a car and proceeded to attack law enforcement as the[y] were conducting an operation—he exited his car wielding a hammer and threw rocks at law enforcement as he abandoned his child,"" she wrote.

McLaughlin added that, given the facts that Quinonez was arrested for assault, a pistol was found in his car during the arrest, the car was reported stolen out of New York and he had an active warrant for property damage, ""law enforcement rightly looked over the child until they were in the safe custody of a guardian.""

On 10 June 2025, the High Court dismissed this challenge.
The claim for judicial review was accordingly dismissed by the High Court on 18 July 2024.
The challenge was in turn dismissed by the High Court on 23 July 2024.
The appellants sought to appeal the decisions of the High Court to dismiss their claims for judicial review.","Two Afghan nationals sought to appeal the High Court’s dismissal of their challenges to the Home Office’s decision to refuse their applications for relocation to the UK under the Afghanistan Response Route, the secret relocation scheme set up in response to the data breach in February 2022. In an OPEN version of a CLOSED judgment, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeals and held that the Afghanistan Response Route, as amended after the court’s order in R (CX1 & others) v Secretary of State for Defence & another [2024] EWHC 892 (Admin), was not irrational and therefore not unlawful. The case is R (AFA & Others) v Secretary of State for the Home Department & another (OPEN Judgment) [2025] EWCA Civ 825.

Background

Both appellants made applications under the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy on behalf of themselves and their dependants in August and October 2021.

The first appellant, AFA, worked as an armoured vehicle driver and security officer for various companies, assisting the Afghan Ministry of the Interior, which was funded by the UK government funded Strategic Support to the Ministry of the Interior (SSMI) program and the Strategic Support for Countering Violent Extremism (SSCVE) project. The first appellant’s wife and children are dependants on the claim.

The second appellant, QP1, supported the supported the British and Coalition mission before the Taliban takeover. His work included translating military vehicle manuals for Afghan security forces, assisting NGOs, representing Afghan missions abroad, and serving as a project officer for Afghan Aid and other UK humanitarian organisations, including in roles focused on gender equality and gender-based violence. The second appellant’s wife is a dependant on the claim.

The case was heard in the Court of Appeal in May 2025, at which time the first appellant was challenging the delay in making a decision in his substantive ARAP application in OPEN proceedings. The first appellant’s challenge to the refusal of his ARAP application was recently dismissed by the High Court.

Meanwhile, the second appellant was challenging the Home Office’s decision to refuse his substantive ARAP application. On 10 June 2025, the High Court dismissed this challenge.

Both appellants were affected by the Ministry of Defence’s data leak incident and therefore potentially came within the remit of the Afghanistan Response Route.

In the cases of both appellants, the Secretary of State for Defence informed the respective Special Advocates in CLOSED proceedings that the appellants were ineligible for relocation under the Afghanistan Response Route because they did not fall within the ‘high risk’ category.

The appellants sought to challenge these decisions in CLOSED proceedings in the High Court.

In the challenge by the first appellant, AFA & others, the High Court found that, even when applying anxious scrutiny and the Wednesbury principles, the Secretary of State was not acting unlawfully by limiting their assessment to the roles performed by applicants when considering whether to relocate individuals affected by the data breach to the UK. The court accepted the Secretary of State’s evidential basis for the policy, emphasising resource, operational and immigration concerns, and the difficulty of assessing risk for those outside the defined ‘high profile’ roles. The Court also rejected the first appellant’s second ground advanced on the basis of Article 8 ECHR, and held that this ground was “unrealistic” and unapplicable.

The claim for judicial review was accordingly dismissed by the High Court on 18 July 2024.

In the challenge by the second appellant, QP1 & Anor, the High Court highlighted the effect of CX1 and others, namely that in determining whether to relocate someone under the Afghanistan Response Route, it was lawful at the level of policy for the government for the Secretary of State to consider whether a relevant applicant was a ‘high profile’ person performing one of the roles in the Ministry of Defence’s list, or was a person performing another ‘high profile’ role putting them at effectively equivalent risk. The second appellant’s wife, whose data was not compromised, was not relevant to the claim.

The challenge was in turn dismissed by the High Court on 23 July 2024.

The appellants sought to appeal the decisions of the High Court to dismiss their claims for judicial review.

Grounds of appeal

Both appellants sought to appeal on the basis that the respondents’ policy on relocation was irrational and therefore unlawful. The first appellant also sought to appeal on the ground that the respondents unlawfully fettered their discretion in devising and applying the Afghanistan Response Route.

The judgment

In its judgment, the Court of Appeal noted the judgment of the court in the case of CX1 and others, where the court found in favour of the claimants, quashing the Secretary’s of State’s decision not to relocate them under the Afghanistan Response Route and requiring them to reconsider their cases.

The Court of Appeal highlighted that following the court’s order in CX1 and others dated 23 April 2024, the Divisional Court directed, at paragraph 5, that the Secretary of State for Defence “shall reconsider the approach to be taken to identifying those within the highest risk cohort for the purposes of the 25 March policy” by 14 June 2024.” In a letter dated 14 June 2024 the Government Legal Department confirmed that the Secretary of State had undertaken that reconsideration and had determined:

that the highest risk cohort for the purposes of the 25 March policy comprises high-profile individuals who either (i) held one of the roles identified in the MOD’s list; or (ii) held a different role which puts them at equivalent risk to those in the identified roles.

Turning to the grounds in the instant case, the court considered the appellants’ argument that the respondents’ underlying policy was unlawful. The court endorsed the approach in CX1 and others, particularly the seven “important contextual features”, noting these features made “the crafting of a policy that would be both just and workable very difficult.” The court also emphasised the importance of anxious scrutiny in this context because of the potential risk to life, a point raised and emphasised in CX1 and others. The court went further to highlight that the potential risk to life can be said to have arisen as a result of the “mistaken conduct of the British government”.

However, noting the amendment to the policy in light of the judgment in CX1 and others, the Court of Appeal ultimately rejected the ground of irrationality of the underlying policy and held that the respondents were entitled to “draw the line where they have” in terms of restricting the Afghanistan Response Route to high-profile roles only.

The first appellant argued that the respondents unlawfully fettered their discretion in devising and applying the relocation policy. As discussed in the case of CX1 and others, the doctrine of the fettering only applies where a statutory discretion exists, and here the policy was made and applied under prerogative powers, not statute. The first appellant argued that the Afghanistan Response Route was not created under prerogative and there were two sources of statutory discretion, namely the Immigration Act 1971 and section 6 of the Human Rights Act.

The court rejected these arguments. It noted that although the exercise of powers to control leave to enter and remain in the UK were created by statue, the formation and adoption of the Afghanistan Response Route, which was a background policy of relocation, is an exercise of the prerogative. The court also rejected reliance on the Human Rights Act as a source of discretion, noting that the Act creates duties, not powers, and does not itself confer decision-making authority.

Whilst the Court of appeal noted the “natural sympathy” that the appellants’ cases attracted, both appeals were ultimately dismissed.",https://freemovement.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_20171205_104425-e1512504403746-edited.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 05:17:29.856765

He settled in Nouadhibou, Mauritania’s second-largest city, where he shared a one-room shack with four friends, and found work as a casual labourer on construction sites, earning two to three times more than he had back home.

The oldest of nine children and the son of a rice farmer, Omar was able to save enough to support his family in The Gambia and pay his younger siblings’ school fees.

Then, in August, the National Guard’s armed pick-up trucks arrived in the city, and the police began rounding up migrants to detain and deport.

Nouadhibou’s construction sites became early targets, so, to avoid capture, Omar – who did not have a residence permit – stopped working. He limited his movements to his housing compound in a dusty alleyway in Ghiran, a neighbourhood with a large migrant population, and the adjacent corner store.

But soon, the police began targeting homes. They came day and night – breaking down doors if those inside did not respond immediately.

One evening, police swept through Omar’s compound. He and his friends escaped by fleeing over the rooftops, but with nowhere else to go, they returned later that night.

Still unable to work, Omar and his housemates ran critically short of money, sharing just one small bowl of rice a day, and occasional fish caught by a friend who would sneak through the backstreets to a nearby estuary in the dead of night.

“All the emotions I go through in one day are hard to explain,” Omar told Al Jazeera in early September.

‘Cruel and degrading conditions’

Al Jazeera spoke to migrants caught up in the government crackdown in Nouadhibou, the capital Nouakchott, and in both Rosso, Mauritania, and Rosso, Senegal – twin cities on opposite sides of the Senegal River, which marks the border between the two countries. Many of those we spoke to have since been pushed out of Mauritania, often to a third country.

The Mauritanian Association for Human Rights (AMDH) estimated that in March alone, 1,200 people were deported. Of those, about 700 had residence permits allowing them to legally work in Mauritania.

The Mauritanian authorities have not released deportation figures, but according to a statement by government spokesman Houssein Ould Medou, 130,000 migrants entered the country of 5 million in 2022, while only 7,000 people renewed their residence permits that year.

The government has not publicly detailed the scope and aims of its deportation campaign. But in May, Interior Minister Mohamad Ahmed Ould Mohamed Lemine told parliament that Mauritania was fully within its rights to control the movement of foreigners on its territory, stressing that authorities acted “with respect for human dignity”. The deportees were to be given sufficient food and water, access to medical services, and were allowed to keep their personal possessions, he added.

Earlier, in March, government spokesman Medou insisted that “reports of recent deportations were exaggerated,” referring to accounts circulating on social media sites.

After the mass deportations started this year, some experts noted that similar campaigns had also taken place in Mauritania in 2009 and 2012, albeit at a smaller scale. However, other observers pointed out that this time, the crackdown came not long after Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, announced a 210 million euro ($248m) migration partnership deal between the European Union and Mauritania in February 2024.

The financial package supports security and “migration management” as well as other investments in “green energy, employment and skills, entrepreneurship … and strengthening access to socioeconomic services for refugees, asylum seekers and host communities”, a European Commission (EC) spokesperson told Al Jazeera in a written statement.

However, experts note that in pursuing a policy of “border externalisation”, the EU has in recent years made deals with countries including Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and Niger to stem irregular migration from major departure points in Africa.

Mauritania is of particular interest because of its proximity to Spain’s Canary Islands. A 2025 report from Spain’s National Security Department stated that in 2024, 25,081 people departed from Mauritania’s shores for the archipelago – more than half of the islands’ 46,843 total irregular arrivals that year. A few people Al Jazeera spoke to said they might have considered travelling by boat to Europe, but that it was now too expensive and difficult. Most wanted to stay in Mauritania to work and send money home to their families.

In October 2024, an amendment to Mauritania’s 1965 immigration law came into force. The amendment legislated that any foreign national convicted of not abiding by immigration regulations, particularly those entering or residing in the country illegally, would be “automatically expelled” and banned from re-entry for a period of one to 10 years.

A few months later, in a speech to parliament, Prime Minister Mokhtar Ould Djay described “the fight against illegal immigration” as one of the government’s priorities.

The Mauritanian government did not respond to Al Jazeera’s requests for comment. But in response to questions about the EU, the EC spokesperson said the bloc has “scaled up its support to Mauritania” on “migration management”, while stressing that protection for those in need and respect for the human rights of migrants were “fundamental principles”.

The spokesperson added that the EU is “in a constant dialogue with Mauritania” to ensure the partnership is respectful of human rights.

However, rights groups, opposition politicians and migrants paint a different picture of what is happening.

“What people see every day is fear,” said Kadiata Malik Diallo, a Mauritanian opposition MP who has been a vocal critic of the government campaign. “Mass expulsions carried out under cruel and degrading conditions.”

‘How much can you pay?’

Nouadhibou, a windswept port city located on the tip of a narrow, 65km (40-mile) peninsula, has long drawn migrants from West and Central Africa. Many of them find work in construction, fishing, or other sectors of the city’s informal economy. They are a visible part of city life – in markets, ports, and streets – and while up-to-date numbers are hard to come by, in 2020, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimated the city’s migrant population at 32,000, about a fifth of the total.

For Nouadhibou’s migrants, the arrests have created fear and confusion.

An Ivorian construction worker in his mid-20s told Al Jazeera that he had been arrested three times in less than a week.

The worker, who did not have valid documents and asked to use only his surname, Traore*, said the first time police raided his compound, 11 people were handcuffed but released when they managed to pool the equivalent of $200 in bribes to the police.

Two days later, he said, the police reappeared, breaking down doors and arresting 14 people. They were taken to a local police station before being released when their boss at the construction site paid a bribe.

The third time, he was on a large construction site near Nouadhibou airport when it was raided by police, who arrested more than 60 men without documents. Some of those were able to pay bribes ranging from $11 to $33, but Traore had no money left and was only released after his boss intervened on his behalf.

Traore’s Ivorian colleague, Ibrahim*, said that when his compound was raided, he showed the police officers his recent entry stamp, which permitted him to stay in the country for the following three months. One of the police officers concluded that Ibrahim’s documents were in order, but another officer ignored the stamp and arrested him.

After spending five days in prison, Ibrahim was approached by a police officer, who he said told him, “Now we will do business. How much can you pay?” Ibrahim paid a $100 bribe.

The constant threat of extortion and harassment has dealt a major blow to the livelihoods of Nouadhibou’s migrant workers. “We don’t know what to do,” said Obi*, an electrician from the Ivory Coast. After narrowly escaping three arrests, he now only goes to work on days when he has heard that there will not be raids. He now feels trapped in Mauritania – unable to earn a living, but also unable to afford to return home.

‘If you have money, you can survive’

Two weeks after the first raid on Omar’s compound, the police turned up again. This time, they found him sleeping. Physically and mentally exhausted after weeks of worry, Omar said he submitted without resistance.

But for others, arrest was a more traumatic experience.

Yunisa*, a 28-year-old Sierra Leonean forklift operator at a Chinese fish-processing plant, was apprehended on his way to work. When he tried to call his boss for help, he said his phone was slapped out of his hand, shattering the screen.

“I have to go to work,” he protested as he was handcuffed. He said the officer told him, “You can go exploit your own country’s riches now.”

Yunisa said he was not allowed to retrieve his belongings from his home before he was deported to Rosso, Senegal.

Even those who were arrested in their homes describe not being permitted to take their possessions with them.

Youssouf*, a 22-year-old Guinean working in a sardine factory, said he asked for a moment to get his birth certificate and school diploma when police broke down the door of his shack, but was told, “We don’t have time for that.” When he tried to insist, he said he was slapped. He was taken without shoes to a nearby school, where he said he was searched, and police confiscated $3 they found in his pockets.

Once in Nouadhibou’s migrant detention facility, Youssouf said he was fed only once a day, typically a piece of bread with sardines, or sometimes just plain bread. For water, he was forced to rely on a small tap in the common toilet, accessible only during infrequent toilet breaks.

Omar said he was given no food during his three-day detention, but that police would offer to bring food from shops at extortionate prices. “If the price is 50 [Ouguiya], they bring it to you for 100. If you have money, you can survive,” he said.

The same principle applied when he wanted to make a phone call to the Gambian embassy in Nouakchott. The 11 Gambians he was in detention with were able to pool $13 to use a guard’s phone. The call failed, but they were forced to pay regardless and were not allowed to try again.

Migrants who have been detained say access to toilets was limited or non-existent. In the three days Omar was held in detention, he was forced to urinate into a large bucket with 50 other men in the same room where they slept. Yunisa said he and his fellow inmates were told to urinate into empty water bottles.

‘I cried, but the police didn’t listen’

While the deportation campaign has largely targeted men, women and children have also been swept up in police raids.

Mariam*, a 31-year-old mother of two from Sierra Leone, who had lived in Nouakchott for five years, selling ice-cream on the street, was approached by police on the way to a pharmacy, where she intended to buy medicine for her one-year-old daughter, who was sick with severe diarrhoea.

When she protested that her two daughters were at home – one in urgent need of medicine – she said she was told, “This isn’t the time for your baby. This is the time for documents.” She was then taken to a holding facility, which she described as a “cattle shed”.

After pleading with guards at the detention facility, she was allowed to make a phone call to a neighbour, who brought her children to the facility. For the next two days, they were held together. Guards would enter the room to eat in front of them, she said. On the second day, a guard gave her daughters an ice cream to share. It was the only thing they ate during their detention.

After two days, Mariam’s husband’s boss paid a bribe, and she and her children were released. That same day, she left voluntarily for Senegal to reunite with her husband, who had been deported some months earlier.

Others remain separated from their children. Oumar*, a 22-year-old Guinean migrant, now in Senegal, was arrested with his wife as they went to buy food, while their four-year-old daughter stayed at home.

“I explained everything, I cried, but the police didn’t listen,” he told Al Jazeera from his temporary accommodation in Rosso.

Unable to travel back to Mauritania and strapped for cash, Oumar and his wife do not know how they will be reunited with their daughter, who is being cared for by a neighbour.

Trapped in no-man’s land

From Nouadhibou, migrants are typically transported south in buses to detention facilities in Nouakchott, from where they are subsequently sent either to Gogui, Mauritania’s border crossing with Mali, or Rosso.

Detainees told Al Jazeera they are often chained to one another during the journey.

Amadou*, a 19-year-old Guinean now in Senegal, described how a policeman, intending to chain him to another detainee, pulled him forcefully by the collar. “My brother, don’t pull me like that, don’t pull me like I’m a sheep,” he protested. He said the officer slapped him so hard that a week later, he was still unable to hear properly.

Once in Rosso, detainees have their fingerprints taken at Mauritania’s border post, before they are released into the port area. There, they wait for a ferry to take them to the Senegalese border post on the other side of the River Senegal, just over 500 metres (550 yards) away. Once there, some of those with documents that enable them to enter Senegal visa-free are fortunate enough to cross the border. But many others remain stranded.

Omar, though still in possession of his Gambian ID card, which should have given him visa-free access to Senegal, was refused entry. “Have you been deported?” the border guards on the Senegalese side of the river asked. When Omar and his friends acknowledged that they had been, they were told to return to Mauritania.

Stuck at the Senegalese border post, they waited until the dead of night, when they instead paid for a pirogue to smuggle them to a remote drop-off point in the bush on the Senegalese side of the river.

Those lacking valid documents – often left in their Mauritanian homes because police did not allow for their collection – recounted similar experiences.

Youssouf was trapped at the Mauritanian border post until his friends pooled about $9 to help him pay for the pirogue to Senegal. Under the cover of darkness, the pirogue took him to a remote marshland a few kilometres downstream of the border post across the river. From there, he waded through knee-deep water until he reached dry land on the outskirts of Rosso.

Unable to afford the journey back to Guinea, Youssouf joined large groups of deportees sleeping on the streets of Rosso.

A day after Youssouf and his friends spoke to Al Jazeera, they were arrested by Senegalese police and sent back to the no-man’s land on the Mauritanian side of the river. There, they were once again forced to pool money to pay for a pirogue to take them back across the river.

Stepping off the pirogue and onto Senegalese soil, Omar and his friends circumvented Rosso through remote bush roads, entering the highway after the last police checkpoint outside the city. From there, they took a series of shared taxis towards The Gambia.

Al Jazeera reached out to the responsible government bodies in Mauritania to ask about the migrant deportation campaign, including the deportees’ allegations of widespread violations and misconduct by police. We contacted the government spokesman, the Gendarmerie, and the Ministry of the Interior, Decentralisation and Local Development, which is responsible for the campaign and in charge of the police forces conducting the operation. As of the time of publication, they had not responded.

‘If they stop deporting people, I’ll go back’

Speaking to Al Jazeera in late September, a week after his return to The Gambia, Omar expressed mixed emotions.

“There’s no policeman chasing us here. You don’t have to look over your shoulder,” he said, adding, “There’s no place like home.”

But with the rainy season not yet over in The Gambia, demand for labourers is low, and Omar has been unable to find work.

“The schools are opening, and my family is asking, ‘Where is the bag of rice?’” he said. “There is no cash and they don’t like it.”

Despite his ordeal, Omar remains nostalgic about his early days in Nouadhibou, when the work was regular and the wages good.

For now, he intends to keep a close eye on the climate in Mauritania. “If they stop deporting people, I’ll go back to Nouadhibou,” he said.

They were part of a vigil marching on Saturday to protest raids conducted by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement at Home Depot parking lots.

The light illuminated the crowd as it proceeded toward Central Avenue, a five-mile trip from the Home Depot parking lot to the ICE Phoenix Field Office building.

Demonstrators carried black signs reading “ICE IS KILLING US” in stark-white letters, each bearing the name and photo of a different community member who the protesters said died in altercations with ICE, or while in ICE custody. This year has seen the most deaths in ICE custody since 2005.

Several other signs memorialized Carlos Roberto Montoya Valdés, a 52-year-old Guatemalan immigrant, who died in August after he was struck and killed by a vehicle on the 210 Freeway in California while fleeing an immigration raid at a Home Depot in Monrovia.

“He came to this country to seek a better life,” said Erika Andiloa, political director for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network and leader of the event. “He was seeking work, and he returned to Guatemala dead.”

Organizers charge that Valdés’ death shows the unintended consequences of an immigration campaign to target people looking for work outside Home Depot locations across the country.

“There was no statement from Home Depot,” Andiola said. “They said nothing, they have allowed ICE to continue to raid their stores and their parking lots, so we’re here asking people to join us.”

This controversy is playing out against the backdrop of ICE raids and National Guard deployments to cities with Democratic leadership around the nation. The march and procession in Phoenix was just one of many nationwide demonstrations part of the Disappeared in America Weekend of Action that coincided with Día de los Muertos.

This also follows a recent ICE-involved shooting in Phoenix in which Jose Garcia-Sorto, a Honduran immigrant, was injured when an officer fired at his vehicle after he attempted to flee an ICE traffic stop on Oct. 29.

‘We sing to grieve our losses’

Beginning near the Home Depot parking lot on the corner of Thomas Road and 44th Street around 4:30 p.m., protesters’ chants, including “si, se puede” and “immigrant rights are human rights,” spurred the crowd as they marched through the daylight. As night settled in, the chants gave way to song.

Kai Newkirk, activist and founder of For All, took up a microphone from his place in the middle of the moving crowd and began the first verse to “Ain’t Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Round” with a warm timbre, his voice amplified by a carried speaker toward the front of the march.

As his voice rang out softly but full-bodied, the marchers fell quiet.

Newkirk thought about his father while he marched. His father is a carpenter who has worked in construction for years. Newkirk grew up seeing the mistreatment of laborers, he said.

“This mass deportation project, it is proven beyond a doubt at this point, that it cannot be carried out, certainly by this administration and ICE, without violating basic human rights and civil rights,” he said.

It’s not just undocumented immigrants who are getting persecuted, he said, but people with green cards, permanent residence, and veterans.

“We’re calling on them not to be bystanders and not to be complicit in the abuses and violations that ICE and Trump are carrying out, but to actually exercise their power to say, this is our private property,” he said. “They’re not welcome here.”

Before his finale, Newkirk asked his fellow marchers to hold their small, artificially flickering candles and join him as he began to harmonize:

“Oh, this little light of mine, I’m gonna let it shine.”

“We sing to bring us together,” Newkirk said. “We sing to grieve our losses and to gain strength in the face of our fears.”

‘Haven’t gone far enough’

The march arrived at its destination, the ICE Phoenix Field Office, about three hours later, and concluded with a procession in the spirit of Día de los Muertos, which was the following day.

Saturday’s procession came after a press conference outside of a Phoenix Home Depot on Oct. 28, led by Andiloa and other organizers. They brought large signs and loud voices to shine a light on a controversy sweeping the country.

George Lane, a spokesperson for Home Depot, denied the company’s role in any ICE raids.

“We aren’t notified that immigration enforcement activities are going to happen,” Lane wrote in a statement to Cronkite News. “And we aren’t involved in the operations. We’re required to follow all federal and local rules and regulations in every market where we operate.”

During the 2024 election cycle, Home Depot donated $2,028,000 to candidates through a political action committee, according to opensecrets.org. Republicans received 58% of those funds, including U.S. Rep. Juan Ciscomani, R-Tucson, who received $12,500, the second most of any candidate.

In a 2024 interview with NPR, Ciscomani, a naturalized citizen from Mexico, supported President Donald Trump on his efforts to secure the border through Executive Order.

On Sunday, Trump said in an interview with 60 Minutes that ICE raids will not end anytime soon.

“Haven’t gone far enough,” the president said, repeating that his goal is to remove criminals.

Ciscomani said during the NPR interview that immigration has become a crisis that impacts the people in his district throughout their daily lives.

“Issues like street releases of migrants weren’t something that kept people up at night a few years ago,” Ciscomani said. “Now, if you talk to county officials, that is the issue. And having funding for that and making sure that we don’t have 1000 releases a day is what keeps them up.”

Low-hanging fruit

Tensions between ICE and Phoenix residents have grown in recent weeks. Jose Garcia-Soto was hospitalized and later discharged on Oct. 29 after being shot by an ICE agent on Interstate 17, headed Northbound near Dove Valley Road. According to ICE spokesperson Fernando Burgos-Ortiz, Garcia-Soto was evading arrest.

“These are the unfortunate consequences when misinformation flows freely, and illegal aliens are urged to resist arrest even though they know they are residing illegally in this country,” Burgos-Ortiz said in a statement to Cronkite News. “ICE remains undeterred in carrying out its congressionally mandated mission to uphold the nation’s immigration laws.”

ICE agents aren’t trained for the street confrontations they find themselves in routinely under President Trump’s administration, according to a federal law enforcement officer who works for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

It’s much easier, the agent added, for ICE agents to arrest what he characterized as low-hanging fruit instead of building cases against organized criminals who are involved in large-scale drug dealing or human trafficking.

“At the beginning of the Trump administration, people were getting fired left and right. There’s a lot of pressure on the directors and the officers to meet those numbers,” said the agent, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution. “If you just take the ‘war on drugs’ and you flip it into the war on migrants, this is the equivalent of going after corner boys.”

They are not going after quality arrests; they are going after whoever is easiest to get, he added. It’s like meeting a quota instead of thorough investigations.

“It’s just easier to go after them than to actually go into, let’s say, like the projects or, you know, a low-income area and try and root out actual gangs,” he said. “It’s not something that the feds are well-versed in.”

Compounding the problem, the officer said, is that the standard for hiring has been lowered and that the new crop of agents does not have the experience for more complex investigations.

“They’re taking anybody and everybody,” he said, including people who have been kicked out of local law enforcement. “They’re not, they’re not used to going into neighborhoods and working the street. You know, so they’ve had the numbers where they can get them.”

The protestors have rebuked Home Depot for allowing ICE operations to continue on its property, according to the National Immigration Law Center. ICE agents can only enter private property if they provide a judicial warrant, and critics pointed out that on June 19, the World Series Champion Los Angeles Dodgers denied ICE agents access to its parking lots when looking to conduct a raid at a game.

Although not all parking lots are considered private property, according to The Home Depot’s Privacy and Security Center, the company uses security cameras in parking lots to prevent theft, implying it owns the spaces.

“Our goal is for the commercial entities in the United States to actually stand up,” Salvador Reza, 74, an immigrant rights activist and author, said Tuesday, Oct. 28. “Those corporations benefit from our dollars.”

Prepared, not alarmed

Former Arizona Democratic Chair Raquel Terán now works with Proyecto Progresso in Arizona to spread awareness about ICE arrests to ensure people know their rights and where to find help when a situation arises.

“We have been working to ensure that our people in our communities know their rights,” Teran said Oct. 28. “We want to make sure our communities are prepared and not alarmed, because we’re not seeing the escalation of abuse like we’re seeing in Los Angeles and Chicago and other places. That doesn’t mean enforcement is not happening here in Arizona.”

Five miles later, as the marching crowd approached its destination, Andiloa took up the microphone and read off each name on the black signs, prompting the marchers to respond “presente” loud enough for those detainees held within the ICE Phoenix Field Office to hear.

Reza thanked the crowd for caring about the community and day laborers, and spoke about what he sees as the next steps for this movement.

“This is just the beginning, we are going to continue on,” Reza said. “Today, there were about 100 people walking; in the future, there are going to be thousands and thousands.”

The ICE Phoenix Field Office continues to hold people arrested and detained off the street despite 30 years of several organizations arriving on-site to protest, Andiloa said before she encouraged the marchers present to push other communities in Phoenix and around the state to join in the call for a change in policy.

“Don’t take for granted the conversations that you can have,” Andiloa said. “Let them know what happened here today or the stories that you heard and invite them to join us, so that next time we’re double or triple.”

She then invited the crowd to construct the ofrenda.

The marchers went up to the fence to set down their signs and photos in a makeshift altar, and place their “little light” candles atop a table in front, each one shedding light on the traditional flores de cempasúchil on the table, and on the memory of those killed.

A Gazan man accused of participating in the October 7 attacks entered the United States on a visa after concealing his ties to the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP). His arrest exposes gaps in immigration vetting for militants from smaller or non-Islamist factions.

The case underscores a growing counterterrorism challenge posed by “gray-zone militants”—combatants with combat experience and ideology but unclear organizational ties, making them difficult to identify through current screening systems.

The recent detention of Mahmoud Amin Ya’qub al-Muhtadi (Arabic: محمود أمين يعقوب المهتدي) in Lafayette, Louisiana represents an uncomfortable development in U.S. counterterrorism policy. The 33-year-old Gaza-born al-Muhtadi was living in Lafayette on a temporary visa when Israeli intelligence alerted U.S. officials that al-Muhtadi’s phone had pinged a cell tower outside the Israeli community of Kfar Aza the morning of October 7, 2023 (Hebrew: כפר עזה) (ynet global, October 17). Kfar Aza, a small kibbutz (Hebrew: קיבוץ, “agricultural commune”) two miles east of the Gaza Strip, was one of the hardest-hit communities during the October 7 massacres; of the commune’s 950 inhabitants, 64 were killed that morning and another 19 taken hostage (ynet, March 5). Al-Muhtadi’s presence near Kfar Aza that morning suggests he was a militant who took part in the atrocities. The al-Muhtadi case, from his involvement in militancy to his arrival in the United States, highlights likely systemic weaknesses in vetting men from conflict zones, allowing a low-level actor from a small group to effectively slip through.

Numerous small paramilitary organizations and armed individuals joined Hamas in its October 7 attack. Al-Muhtadi was affiliated with the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (Arabic: الجبهة الديمقراطية لتحرير فلسطين, DFLP), a leftist organization related to the better-known PFLP (Arabic: الجبهة الشعبية لتحرير فلسطين, “Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine”), and fought as part of the DFLP’s military wing, the National Resistance Brigades (Arabic: كتائب المقاومة القومية). The DFLP was one of at least five other groups that accompanied Hamas in its invasion, many appearing to act with little top-down coordination. Among those accompanying Hamas were the Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades (Arabic: كتائب أبو علي مصطفى) of the PFLP, the Nasser Salah al-Din Brigades (Arabic: كتائب الناصر صلاح الدين), also called the Popular Resistance Brigades, which comprise a collection of different armed groups, and completely unaffiliated militants (BBC, November 27, 2023; UN Human Rights Office, June 10, 2024;

Al-Muhtadi’s group was not given advanced notice of the Hamas-led assault. The U.S. prosecution found evidence that he heard of the attack, gathered friends in his unit while telling one to “bring the rifles,” and went on to invade amidst the pandemonium (Erem News, October 17).

After leaving Gaza for Egypt sometime later, al-Muhtadi applied for a U.S. visa on June 26, 2024. On his application, he lied and claimed he had never been affiliated with a militant group. His application was approved, and he arrived in the United States on September 12, 2024, in Dallas, Texas. He then briefly lived with his children for a stint in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and then settled in Lafayette, where he worked at a restaurant (Sky News Arabia, October 18).

Western leaders have long feared deliberate infiltration by terrorist groups that send operatives to commit attacks in the countries to which they immigrate. This paradigm is built around combating deliberate infiltration by hostile groups, which has been a threat from international Salafi-jihadist organizations like al-Qaeda and the Islamic State (IS) over the past two decades. Meanwhile, groups like Hamas and even the less-renowned DFLP are blacklisted, and prospective asylum seekers with known Hamas affiliation are barred from entry. However, the existing vetting system appears ill-equipped to sideline militants from a long list of diffuse groups with complicated and only semi-documented affiliations. While the DFLP or similar organizations may be blacklisted, they do not necessarily have the organizational characteristics that make them intelligence targets, allowing immigration officials to effectively enforce the blacklisting. It appears possible that in a counterterrorism environment far more geared towards surveying high-profile Islamist groups, individuals affiliated with a small leftist militia may slip through the vetting far more easily.

Limited parallels exist among Iraqis and Syrians who immigrated in the 2000s and 2010s. These countries suffered from insurgencies by Salafi-jihadist groups, which spawned an environment of dozens of competing groups, largely operated by people who would not have attracted the attention of security services. A surprising example is this phenomenon was Salwan Momika (Arabic: سلوان موميكا) case. [1] Momika was an Iraqi anti-Islam firebrand who lied about his role in a Christian militia affiliated with Iran’s Popular Mobilization Forces (Arabic: الحشد الشعبي, PMF) when he sought asylum in Sweden (YouTube/Orient – أورينت نيوز). [2] While Momika’s activism was dangerous for himself and caused some public unrest, it was ultimately nonviolent. In other cases, former militants from the aforementioned countries went on to obtain criminal charges or demonstrate links to terrorism (ABC News, November 18, 2015; BBC News, August 26, 2024).

There is little independent information that intelligence or immigration services can use to verify risks in Gaza. In such an environment, the existing vetting procedures appear reliant on personal disclosure, making them easy to exploit. Even with Hamas’s dominance, the web of militant groups within Gaza numbers over a dozen, in addition to armed men who participate in hostilities as part of amateur militias (UNISPAL). Such individuals are unlikely to appear in databases gathered by intelligence services unless their exploits are truly unique and notable, but they retain all the key markers of militants: arms training, radicalization, connection to organizations, and sometimes combat experience. As much of the Western world juggles its humanitarian and security priorities around the Israel–Hamas War as well as other conflicts, opportunistic “gray-zone militants” like al-Muhtadi, who likely number in the thousands, pose an increasingly difficult screening dilemma.

Al-Muhtadi’s fate could set a precedent for future immigrants and asylum seekers with strong ties to militancy. It is uncertain whether al-Muhtadi was an active threat after landing in the United States, but participants in “opportunistic terrorism” need to be understood as belonging to an important gray area between “members of organized ideological groups” and civilians—especially when operating alongside the former.

Militants subverting U.S. and Western security checks should no longer be expected to do so with central direction. In an era and environment where a rag-tag leftist militia engages in joint operations with a world-renowned terrorist organization, policymakers need to understand militants as belonging within environmental milieus rather than organizational hierarchies.

But the program is one that Mr. Trump and his Republican allies in Congress have long sought to cut.
Even the Trump administration acknowledged that its approach would delay the delivery of benefits by weeks, or perhaps months.
Following his first hearing, Judge McConnell ordered the government to explore the use of that money to pay food stamps on time.
Roughly two dozen states have also sued the Trump administration in a bid to force the release of SNAP benefits.","A federal judge ordered the Trump administration on Thursday to fund food stamps in full for roughly 42 million low-income Americans, after admonishing the government for delaying aid under the nation’s largest anti-hunger program during the shutdown.

But the Justice Department almost immediately told the court that it would appeal the ruling. The move renewed fears that the poorest Americans would not receive their full benefits to purchase groceries this month, leaving many at risk of imminent and severe financial hardship.

The order, issued by Judge John J. McConnell Jr. of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, marked his second legal rebuke of the administration. Reading from the bench after a short but tense hearing, he sharply criticized federal officials for ignoring his original order last week to quickly restart payments for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP.

Judge McConnell attributed the inappropriate delay, in part, to an attempt by President Trump and his aides to disrupt the program “for political reasons.” He also pointed to public comments by Mr. Trump, who said at one point that he would halt all food stamp payments until Democrats struck a deal to end the shutdown, now in its sixth week.

“This should never happen in America,” the judge said, warning that millions of poor families could go hungry in the absence of reliable federal aid.

His order, issued soon after in writing, gave the government until Friday to make the SNAP payments to the states, which manage the provision of food stamps. For now, the directive appeared set to take effect as scheduled, though the Justice Department has not indicated if it will seek to pause it, as the agency prepares to appeal the matter.

“Faced with a choice between advancing relief and entrenching delay, it chose the latter — an outcome that predictably magnifies harm and undermines the very purpose of the program it administers,” the judge wrote in a 27-page order lambasting the administration.

The White House and Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment. The Agriculture Department declined to answer specific questions, and in a statement, it blamed the shutdown on Democrats.

Vice President JD Vance later attacked the court for what he described as an “absurd ruling,” claiming that a judge did not have the right to tell the White House how to handle the shutdown. He insisted the administration was “trying to keep as much going as possible.”

The ruling marked a temporary and perhaps fleeting victory for cities, religious groups and nonprofits, which had sued the Trump administration over its original refusal to continue funding food stamps during the federal shutdown. Absent a court order, roughly one in eight Americans stood to lose access to monthly federal nutrition aid starting this month, leaving many at risk of hunger.

By its own admission, the Agriculture Department had ample funds to continue SNAP without interruption in November and to make its payments in full. But the program is one that Mr. Trump and his Republican allies in Congress have long sought to cut. And it took the intervention of two federal courts, including an order by Judge McConnell, before the administration moved to restart nutrition assistance, which it only agreed to provision on a partial basis.

Even the Trump administration acknowledged that its approach would delay the delivery of benefits by weeks, or perhaps months. Many local officials later found that the Agriculture Department had exacerbated the problem, by saddling SNAP with a set of new and complex rules during the shutdown that would punish low-income Americans.

Some families even stood to receive nothing in November because of the way the agency had newly required states to calculate partial benefits. While the Agriculture Department admitted late Wednesday that it had made a mistake, and updated its policies, the change only further bogged down the food stamp program and threatened to inflict harm on its recipients.

Returning to court this week, local officials asked the judge to force the government to pay SNAP benefits in full and without delay. They pointed to the availability of a second reserve at the Agriculture Department, totaling tens of billions of dollars, that the Trump administration had tapped earlier in the shutdown to sustain another federal nutrition program.

Following his first hearing, Judge McConnell ordered the government to explore the use of that money to pay food stamps on time. Reconvening on Thursday, the judge explicitly required it, criticizing the administration for a “problem that could have, and should have, been avoided.”

Throughout the hearing, Tyler Becker, a Justice Department lawyer, insisted that the government had complied with the court’s requirements. Mr. Becker, at times taking a defiant or defensive tone, attributed the problem to “Congress not having appropriated funds.”

Skye Perryman, the president of Democracy Forward, a legal group representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement after the ruling that no one should “have to force the president to care for his citizens, but we will do whatever is necessary to protect people and communities.”

Some congressional Democrats and public interest groups soon whipsawed from praising the outcome in court to lamenting the possibility that the Justice Department would undermine SNAP through its appeal. Crystal FitzSimons, the president of the Food Research & Action Center, which supports the program, faulted the government for trying to “punish” poor Americans in the shutdown.

“Instead of using the funding that has been readily available to feed people, this administration continues to fight to deny tens of millions from accessing the nutrition they need,” she said.

Roughly two dozen states have also sued the Trump administration in a bid to force the release of SNAP benefits. On Thursday, they told a federal court in Massachusetts that the government’s actions would “lead to unnecessary, and in some cases, substantial, delays” — and they asked a judge there to require the Agriculture Department to fund benefits fully.

“A judge in Rhode Island just stopped the federal government from starving millions of Americans,” said Letitia James, the Democratic attorney general of New York and one of the participants in the lawsuit. “I am relieved that people will get the food they need. But it is outrageous that it took a lawsuit to make the federal government feed its own people.”

The Baltimore Sun first reported state officials’ plan to sue the Trump administration.","Maryland is preparing for a courtroom fight against President Donald Trump’s administration over the FBI’s future home.

The state’s Attorney General Anthony Brown announced the suit Thursday against the Trump administration after it scrapped plans to move the bureau’s headquarters to Greenbelt, Maryland, and opted instead to keep it in Downtown D.C.

Maryland leaders have been crying foul since the Trump administration formally announced its plan in July to move the FBI across the street to the Ronald Reagan Building, ignoring the site selection process of Congress and the General Services Administration, and the fact that Congress had already appropriated funds toward the Greenbelt relocation.

“The Trump administration is attempting to unlawfully reprogram and transfer over $1 billion in funds that Congress designated specifically for the Greenbelt project,” Brown said during a news conference Thursday.

In 2022, Congress directed the GSA to choose between Greenbelt and Landover in Maryland, and Springfield, Virginia. The GSA selected Greenbelt in November 2023. In addition to the money Congress set aside, the state of Maryland and Prince George’s County both pledged a combined $350 million to support the project, Brown said.

“They violated explicit congressional directives that limited site selection to the three authorized locations. They ignored federal requirements to consult with state and local government, and they acted arbitrarily and capriciously by abandoning years of careful planning without explanation or justification.”

In his lawsuit, Brown is asking the court to stop what he called the unlawful selection of the Reagan Building, and to prevent Congress from diverting appropriated funds.

“Maryland, we played by the rules. We won the project fairly. And we will not let this administration steal jobs and opportunities from Prince George’s County and Maryland.”

Just last week, the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works approved the plan to move the FBI to the Reagan Building. The committee’s plans have not gotten full congressional approval yet.

The Trump administration said in July moving the FBI to the Reagan Building, instead of constructing a new facility in Greenbelt, would save taxpayers money.

In response to a WTOP request for comment on the lawsuit, the GSA said it does not comment on ongoing litigation.

Maryland and Prince George’s County leaders said the federal government is ignoring security concerns and needs of the nation’s primary federal law enforcement agency — needs the Reagan Building doesn’t meet that the new Greenbelt site would.

“The problem with the current FBI building is that it’s too old, too small, and too exposed. So what does the President do? He moves the FBI to another building that is too old, too small, and too exposed,” Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said in a statement. “Trump’s actions aren’t just illegal, they lack common sense. And his foolishness will put law enforcement in jeopardy.”

In a statement last week, Sen. Chris Van Hollen, of Maryland, also expressed concerns about moving ahead with the proposal with “no completed security plan, and an incomplete cost assessment.”

Brown’s lawsuit also alleges the Trump administration did not consult Maryland at all in its decision, which Brown’s suit says harms Maryland by denying it and Prince George’s County significant economic benefits, jobs and development opportunities.

The Baltimore Sun first reported state officials’ plan to sue the Trump administration.

Police chief's rejection and political fallout

Local perspective:

""I move that this motion be postponed indefinitely,"" said Council member Adam Bazaldua.

That was the outcome of a meeting on Thursday by Dallas city council members, who support the Dallas police chief's decision to reject federal funds in exchange for partnering with ICE.

After Chief Daniel Comeaux rejected the offer, Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson said it should not have been his decision to make. That's what led to the public hearing on Thursday.

""It’s not the program for us, it would not make Dallas any safer because we are already aggressively going against violent crime,"" said Chief Comeaux.

Proposed 287-G Program

What we know:

Nearly 80 speakers signed up, overwhelmingly against the partnership proposal.

If approved, Dallas police officers would have the authority to detain and transport people suspected of being in the country illegally on behalf of ICE. The 287-G program reimburses cities for the use of their officers.

Chief Comeaux put the grant amount at $25 million, which he said would pay for the services of 250 police officers.

""The notion of entering a 287G agreement with the City of Dallas does not make sense, and it is purely political,"" said Councilman Jaime Resendez. ""Turning down the $25M decision was rooted in evidence and professional judgement, and it also happens to align with our values.""

Concerns over resources

ICE placed N.N.
on electronic surveillance under a June 2025 policy that instructs ICE officials to affix GPS-enabled ankle “whenever possible” and mandates electronic surveillance without individualized consideration of the need for it.
ICE’s unilateral decision to place N.N.","This case asks whether Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) can surveil people with electronic tracking in defiance a judge’s order that they be released from immigration detention on bond without any further conditions.

A person can only be released on bond by an immigration judge after a hearing where an ICE attorney has opportunity to present evidence that release is not appropriate due to flight risk or danger to the community. Based on the evidence presented, the judge decides whether to grant release, and if so, on what conditions.

Under these rules, N.N. was ordered released from detention upon payment of a bond and no further conditions. But ICE was unsatisfied with those results. And instead of appealing the judge’s decision, it defied the judge’s order. After N.N. was released from detention the agency gave him an appointment to report, where officers shackled him in an ankle monitor with 24/7 electronic surveillance. N.N. must be stationary and lying down for 30 to 50 minutes in order to charge the bulky battery of the ankle monitor on a daily basis.

ICE placed N.N. on electronic surveillance under a June 2025 policy that instructs ICE officials to affix GPS-enabled ankle “whenever possible” and mandates electronic surveillance without individualized consideration of the need for it. The policy stands to enrich one of the Trump administration’s largest campaign contributors, the private prison company GEO Group, which generates approximately $3.70 in daily revenue for the over 180,000 people the government says it plans to put on electronic surveillance.

What is the legal argument in this case?

ICE’s unilateral decision to place N.N. under electronic surveillance in violation of

the immigration judge’s order violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, the Administrative Procedure Act, the Accardi doctrine, which obligates administrative agencies to follow their own rules, and a non-statutory right against ultra vires agency action.

The policy that ICE has implemented of violating an immigration judge’s order with unwarranted electronic surveillance is also arbitrary and capricious and should be set aside under the Administrative Procedure Act.

A person can only be released on bond by an immigration judge after a hearing where an ICE attorney has opportunity to present evidence that release is not appropriate due to flight risk or danger to the community. Based on the evidence presented, the judge decides whether to grant release, and if so, on what conditions.

Under these rules, G.T. was ordered released from detention upon payment of a bond and no further conditions. But ICE was unsatisfied with those results. And instead of appealing the judge’s decision, it defied the judge’s order. After G.T. was released from detention the agency gave him an appointment to report, where officers shackled him in an ankle monitor with 24/7 electronic surveillance. G.T., a survivor of persecution and torture, feels ashamed and anxious that people in public will see the monitor and assume that he is a criminal or a terrorist. Out of embarrassment from being openly shackled and fear that he will face prejudicial or discriminatory treatment, he has stopped going to his mosque furthering his isolation and disrupting the coping mechanisms that had helped him manage his depression and PTSD.

ICE placed G.T. on electronic surveillance under a June 2025 policy that instructs ICE officials to affix GPS-enabled ankle “whenever possible” and mandates electronic surveillance without individualized consideration of the need for it. The policy stands to enrich one of the Trump administration’s largest campaign contributors, the private prison company GEO Group, which generates approximately $3.70 in daily revenue for the over 180,000 people the government says it plans to put on electronic surveillance.

What is the legal argument in this case?

ICE’s unilateral decision to place G.T. under electronic surveillance in violation of

the immigration judge’s order violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, the Administrative Procedure Act, the Accardi doctrine, which obligates administrative agencies to follow their own rules, and a non-statutory right against ultra vires agency action.

The policy that ICE has implemented of violating an immigration judge’s order with unwarranted electronic surveillance is also arbitrary and capricious and should be set aside under the Administrative Procedure Act.

The ruling by U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell Jr. gave President Donald Trump’s administration until Friday to make the payments through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, though it’s unlikely the 42 million Americans — about 1 in 8 — will see the money on the debit cards they use for groceries that quickly.

WATCH: How SNAP reductions are impacting local food banks

The order was in response to a challenge from cities and nonprofits complaining that the administration was only offering to cover 65% of the maximum benefit, a decision that would leave some recipients getting nothing for this month.

“The defendants failed to consider the practical consequences associated with this decision to only partially fund SNAP,” McConnell said. “They knew that there would be a long delay in paying partial SNAP payments and failed to consider the harms individuals who rely on those benefits would suffer.”

McConnell was one of two judges who ruled last week that the administration could not skip November’s benefits entirely because of the federal shutdown.

It has been a week of twists and turns for SNAP beneficiaries

Last week’s rulings ordered the government to use one emergency reserve fund containing $4.6 billion to pay for SNAP for November but gave it leeway to tap other money to make the full payments, which cost between $8.5 billion and $9 billion each month.

On Monday, the administration said it would not use additional money, saying it was up to Congress to appropriate the funds for the program.

The next day, Trump appeared to threaten not to pay the benefit s at all unless Democrats in Congress agreed to reopen the government. His press secretary later said that the partial benefits were being paid for November — and that it is future payments that are at risk if the shutdown continues.

Late Wednesday, the USDA, which runs the program, said in a filing in federal court in Rhode Island that it had done further analysis and found that the maximum benefit will be 65% of the usual amount.

Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita sued Indianapolis Public Schools over its policies on federal immigration enforcement, claiming the district thwarted an attempt in January to deport an IPS student’s father who wanted to leave the country with his son.

The lawsuit filed in Marion Superior Court on Thursday alleges that unlawful district policies limiting information and access to Immigrations and Customs Enforcement prevented the deportation of a “Honduran national” who agreed to leave the country under a voluntary deportation order.

An IPS student, the son of the Honduran national, went to school the morning of Jan. 8 in “apparent disregard of his father’s wish that they depart the country together,” the complaint states. ICE later contacted the district to “help the father take custody of his son” ahead of his deportation flight scheduled for that afternoon.

“IPS took the position that it would not release the child to an ICE officer unless the officer had a judicial warrant or other court order,” the lawsuit states. “ICE responded that it simply was asking that the son be released to the father so that they could depart the country as the father had agreed to do and that such action did not require a court order.”

It’s unclear whether the father and son left the country. ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The lawsuit challenges district directives to employees that restrict immigration enforcement officials from student information and physical access to school grounds. The lawsuit claims such policies violate state law, which prohibits governmental entities from restricting enforcement of immigration laws.

The legal action occurs as districts nationwide — some of which adopted policies designed to protect undocumented students during the first Trump administration — once again grapple with potential immigration enforcement on school grounds.

In January, the second Trump administration rescinded a Biden-era policy that classified schools as “sensitive” locations where enforcement should only occur under an imminent public threat.

The lawsuit follows a warning from Rokita in February in which he threatened legal action if IPS did not comply with immigration authorities. At the time, IPS said it was committed to fostering a safe, welcoming environment for all students and would comply with all state, local, and federal laws.

“Sanctuary policies are bad in any context, but they are especially troubling in our schools,” Rokita said in a statement Thursday announcing the lawsuit. “Schools across the country are vulnerable to infiltration by criminal illegal aliens—it’s happened in many other states—and it is essential that ICE be able to take action when that occurs to help keep our kids safe.”

In a statement, the IPS board said it is committed to ensuring a safe and supportive environment for all students and will continue to uphold the law.

“While IPS takes all legal obligations seriously, we respectfully hope that all concerned parties will recognize the heavy burden that silly litigation and political posturing places on students, families, and taxpayers,” the board said. “Every dollar spent on defensive legal posture is a dollar not spent on instructional support, teacher development, student services, or enrichment. In this case, Mr. Rokita prefers those dollars go to fight gratuitous political battles, as has too often been the case.”

In a Thursday statement, the Indiana State Teachers Association also indicated opposition to Rokita’s lawsuit.

“Turning schools into extensions of immigration enforcement threatens that trust and undermines the learning environment every student deserves,” the union said.

Lawsuit: School district policies hinder immigration enforcement

The lawsuit takes particular issue with a resolution that the IPS school board passed in 2017 reminding employees not to assist immigration enforcement efforts “unless legally required and authorized to do so by the Superintendent.”

The lawsuit also claims that this year the district restricted staff from sharing information regarding a student’s immigration status with federal authorities. Last January, IPS said it would not let ICE enter schools without warrants.

The federal Families and Educational Rights Privacy Act, known as FERPA, restricts the ability of schools to provide student information to outside parties.

But Rokita has previously told the district that FERPA does permit the disclosure of some information, such as directory information, that could be related to a student’s immigration status. And school officials could still give consent for law enforcement to enter school grounds without violating the Fourth Amendment, his office has argued.

The district has also previously stated on a section of its website that it will not allow ICE officers onto school grounds without a judicial warrant. That section of the IPS website is still active, but no longer mentions the need for a warrant.

Rokita’s office alleges these policies violate state law. The complaint also states that school staff connected the student with a private immigration attorney.

The complaint does not say whether the IPS student was a U.S. citizen or had documentation of his immigration status. But it argues that ICE does not need a judicial warrant to make an arrest.

“Unquestionably, schools are locations that may be exploited and infiltrated by criminal illegal aliens,” the lawsuit states. “When that occurs, it is critical for public safety that ICE have the full cooperation of local school officials in ICE’s efforts to locate and arrest such aliens.”

The school board said in its statement that it has been collaborating with Rokita’s office to review relevant policies, but that Rokita permitted IPS only five business days to respond to his review.

The board said “these important issues deserve thoughtful, deliberative weighing of important legal rights — not impulsive, superficial efforts for political gain.”

“Additionally, IPS is deeply offended that the Indiana Attorney General persists in willfully dehumanizing our children and their families by labeling them as ‘aliens,’” the board said.

Undocumented students have a right to a public education under the Supreme Court’s 1982 ruling in Plyler v. Doe. The Immigrant Legal Resource Center has argued that the Fourth Amendment protects students from unreasonable search and seizure, and therefore restricts ICE from entering the private areas of school grounds without a judicial warrant.

In January, Gov. Mike Braun reiterated support for federal law enforcement, issuing an executive order highlighting the state’s support for Trump’s immigration enforcement efforts.

“Recruiting ads targeting New York City police officers are nothing new – we’ve been seeing them for years.","ICE is trying to poach NYPD cops and add New York’s funniest to its controversial ranks, according to a new social media advertisement.

Coming hot off the heels of a contentious mayoral election and seemingly attempting to capitalize on fears some cops may have regarding their treatment under the new Mamdani administration, an ICE account on Instagram is calling on police officers to join their ranks.

“NYPD OFFICERS: Join an agency that respects you, your family, and your commitment to serving in law enforcement,” the post read before adding a recruitment link.

“Zero chill,” one commenter wrote. “Please protect our NYPD officers,” another wrote.

The NYPD did not immediately respond to amNewYork for comment.

Speaking with amNewYork, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams said he believes the ad is just another attempt to sow the seeds of chaos in the Big Apple.

“They are continuing to do what they do, which is trying their best to sow chaos, confusion, and fear, and now they’re just basically trolling New York City, and unfortunately, using the men and

women who serve the city to do that. I think they’re trying to pit New Yorkers against each other out of fear, and New Yorkers have just elected a mayor who wants to do the opposite of that,” Williams said. “They spend more time trying to figure out how to show this kind of discord. I wish I spent half as much time actually trying to figure out how we work together as a country. But that’s not their goal.”

Williams championed mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, stating that he believes the best way to counter it is to fall on what Mamdani has always pushed for, asking cops to not handle so much, such as mental health response.

“If people, anybody will take the time to listen to the message of the mayor and those of us who have been talking about public safety, they need to know that how much people actually value their service, and the one thing I said we can all do to support them is to actually stop asking them to do as much as we are, so they should look forward,” Williams said.

Mamdani’s team did not immediately respond for comment.

New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, who has spent months observing detentions at 26 Federal Plaza and was even arrested by ICE, also weighed in.

“Diverting New York City’s public safety resources to fulfill Trump’s abduction agenda makes New York’s communities less safe. This job listing is alarming and proves that immigration enforcement has nothing to do with public safety, but only to further a white nationalistic fascist agenda,” Lander said.

Police Benevolent Association President Patrick Hendry, the head of a union representing the rank and file, said that he believes this shows that an ad targeting cops highlights the need to address forced overtime and low wages.

“Recruiting ads targeting New York City police officers are nothing new – we’ve been seeing them for years. Every law enforcement agency in the country knows that our members are overworked, underpaid and subjected to endless demonization and second-guessing. We need our city leaders to work with us on fixing those issues. Otherwise, more talented cops will walk out the door,” Hendry said.",https://www.amny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Photo-Jul-08-2025-9-59-11-AM.jpg?quality=51&w=1200&p=q,N,,2025-11-07 01:56:50.000508

The congregation’s leaders can spell the reason with three letters: ICE.

Saint Theresa de Avila’s mostly Latino worshippers already were on edge this year as President Donald Trump’s administration prioritized Chicago for aggressively pursuing immigrant arrests and deportations. Then in September, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, dramatically expanded its presence in the city and escalated its enforcement activity, including military-style raids.

“It certainly has had an impact, and we don’t know how long this is going to go on like this,” the Rev. Gary Cox, Saint Teresa de Avila’s vicar, told Episcopal News Service. He estimates Sunday worship attendance is down 50-75% this year.

Fewer than 20 people attended the two services at Saint Teresa de Avila on Oct. 26. Cox said many members are staying home, choosing instead to participate in the livestream of the congregation’s worship on Facebook. Worshippers who still attend in person have been on alert, especially since ICE was spotted in the neighborhood a few weeks ago.

All those fears, however, took a back seat on Nov. 2 when the congregation welcomed Bishop Diane Jardine Bruce, who was visiting Chicago from the Diocese of Los Angeles. On behalf of Chicago Bishop Paula Clark, Bruce presided at the congregation’s two confirmation services. Attendance swelled to about 80 people as four people were confirmed.

“It was really wonderful. I have not seen the church that filled in a long time,” the Rev. Sandra Castillo, an assistant priest at Saint Teresa de Avila, told ENS. She also serves the Diocese of Chicago as canon for migration ministries.

The diocese also received encouraging news last week when a member who had been held in immigrant detention for weeks was released from custody. Willian Alberto Giménez Gonzalez, a member of St. Paul and the Redeemer Episcopal Church on Chicago’s South Side, was freed after a federal judge said ICE didn’t have the right to detain him indefinitely without a bond hearing.

With ICE patrols reported throughout the city this fall, the Diocese of Chicago has sought to protect its members from unlawful enforcement actions through a variety of measures, such as text alert networks, rapid response teams of volunteers and “know your rights” training sessions led by Castillo, a retired lawyer.

“We’re doing as much as we can,” Castillo said. “People are really going out of their way … to warn people and protect people.”

The increased ICE presence starting in September has been tied to an enforcement action that the Department of Homeland Security dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz.” Since then, local officials, Democratic state legislators, immigrant advocates and residents have accused the Trump administration of heavy-handed tactics that have sometimes involved detentions of people with no criminal records or immigration violations.

On Sept. 24, Clark said her diocese was canceling its annual Latino Liturgy out of concern for worshippers.

“I am humbled and sobered by the reminder that, for many in our diocese, the increased presence and aggressive tactics of ICE are a source of paralyzing fear that threatens personal safety, family well-being, and even the freedom to practice one’s faith,” Clark said at the time. “In light of this, I ask your continued prayers: for courage, for comfort, and for trust in God’s providence. May we stand in solidarity with those who find themselves in danger simply by tending to the daily rhythms of life.”

Cox said the immigration arrests also have upended the regular vendor fairs that Saint Teresa de Avlia hosts on church grounds. The vendors no longer feel comfortable setting up their stands there, and attendance also is down at the congregation’s outdoor fundraising events.

The fear goes beyond neighbors with uncertain legal status, Cox said. Even American citizens and immigrants with legal residency are concerned about getting swept up in ICE raids. They “are at risk just because they’re Latino and because they live in this area,” Cox said.

The congregation was particularly rattled by reports that a man was detained by ICE in an alley across from the church, and ICE has conducted enforcement actions in other parts of the city’s Southwest Side within a mile or two of Saint Teresa de Avila.

An Oct. 25 service honoring St. Jude was moved from the church building to a member’s home as a precaution, Cox said. For the confirmation services on Nov. 2, the congregation took additional steps to make it safer for members to attend in person.

They hung signs on parts of the building designating certain spaces as “área privada,” or “private area,” to deter ICE from entering without a warrant. The congregation has distributed whistles, which can be sounded if anyone sees ICE. And during the confirmation services, a member was stationed outside the church to watch for ICE, ready to alert worshippers if any federal agents approached. None did.

Worshippers should feel empowered to decide for themselves how they will respond to potential threats from federal agents, Cox said, though he is hopeful that more will find a “middle ground” between caution and boldness and begin returning to in-person services at Saint Teresa de Avila.",https://i0.wp.com/episcopalnewsservice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ENS_110625_Chicago.png?fit=1200%2C800&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-07 01:56:55.595229

The agency said the center’s purpose was to “support partner encounters in the field … focused on locating unaccompanied alien children”.
ICE anticipates the center will open by March and reach full operational capacity by June.
In response to a Guardian request for comment, assistant homeland security secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement: “Your reporting is inaccurate,” without providing any details.
That policy led to the separation of at least 5,500 migrant children from their parents and guardians at the US-Mexico border.","US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) plans to open a new call center to help law enforcement agencies track down unaccompanied migrant children.

According to a homeland security department Request for Information (RFI) notice released this week, ICE stated there was an “immediate need to establish and maintain” a call center equipped with “data-enabled technology”.

The agency said the center’s purpose was to “support partner encounters in the field … focused on locating unaccompanied alien children”.

The facility, slated to open in Nashville, Tennessee, will operate 24 hours a day and is expected to handle between 6,000 and 7,000 calls daily. The document did not specify why Nashville was chosen for the call center. ICE anticipates the center will open by March and reach full operational capacity by June.

In the RFI, ICE also asked potential contractors to outline what kinds of “enabling technology” they would recommend to “integrate partner and alien data with our systems to maximize call efficiency and reduce call time”.

In response to a Guardian request for comment, assistant homeland security secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement: “Your reporting is inaccurate,” without providing any details.

ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In addition to the planned call center, CoreCivic Inc, the nation’s second-largest private prison operator, is headquartered in Nashville. Since Donald Trump took office in January, the company has reported strong financial gains, announcing $538.2m in earnings for the second quarter of this year, a 9.8% increase over the same period last year.

The surge in profits for private prison companies, along with those of technology firms such as Palantir, which recently secured a $30m contract with ICE to build a database aimed at streamlining detentions and deportations, comes amid an escalation in immigration raids nationwide. These actions have provoked fierce backlash from the public, Democratic lawmakers and civil rights groups alike.

Reports of the planned ICE call center come as the Trump administration appears to have revived the practice of family separations in its renewed effort to deport millions, according to multiple cases reviewed by the Guardian. Immigration attorneys and former officials say the move is intended to pressure immigrants and asylum seekers to leave the US voluntarily.

Meanwhile, in a memo obtained by the Guardian last month, the Trump administration laid out plans to offer migrant children $2,500 as a “one-time resettlement support stipend” in exchange for their self-deportation.

This latest escalation builds on policies from Trump’s first term, which included a “zero-tolerance” approach that directed the justice department to prosecute anyone who crossed the border without legal status. That policy led to the separation of at least 5,500 migrant children from their parents and guardians at the US-Mexico border.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23c004a55a41c89e31d5d92f144b005f4d089b48/502_0_4996_3999/master/4996.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3375caa135c41e7ab10858c17947d8f0",N,,2025-11-06 19:17:03.538496

The case is Orr v. Trump, Case No. 1:25-cv-10313 (D. Mass., filed February 7, 2025), and is being appealed in the First Circuit Court of Appeals (No. 25-01579).

The passport policy stems from President Trump’s January 20, 2025 Executive Order (EO) 14168, “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,” which ordered the federal government to recognize only two sexes – male and female – and to recognize only the sex assigned to an individual at birth.

The State Department implemented the EO policy as applied to U.S. passports in the early months of the Trump administration. In February 2025, the State Department issued public guidance confirming the validity of all existing passports, regardless of the sex marker listed, but requiring that any passport renewals or replacements comply with the new policy by reflecting the individual’s male or female assignment at birth. As a result of the Supreme Court decision, it is likely that the State Department will revert to the guidance that was in place prior to the preliminary injunction, though it is also possible that the agency will issue updated guidance.

The Supreme Court decision means that unless and until there is a contrary court order, U.S. citizens who do not identify with their gender assigned at birth can no longer apply for and receive a passport that reflects their gender identity; they are again restricted to receiving a passport reflecting the male or female gender they were assigned at birth.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett seemed skeptical of the scope of the reciprocal tariffs Trump has placed on dozens of countries, allies and trading partners alike.
“Unfortunately, if you’re a business, you can celebrate a Supreme Court win if that’s the way it goes, but you’re not going to be off the hook,” Riley said.","This story is based on stories by Violet Jira published on November 5, 2025 by NOTUS. VTDigger has partnered with NOTUS and the Maine Monitor to cover federal actions affecting Vermont and Maine.

The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday related to the legality of President Donald Trump’s use of tariffs in a case that won’t just be deciding the fate of his trade policy, but also could redefine the limits of presidential economic power.

The hearing involved appeals in a pair of cases that challenge the Trump administration’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, including one with Vermont ties. Trump has used the law to bypass procedural norms and place extensive tariffs on enemies and trading partners alike without authorization from Congress.

One of the cases includes Terry Precision Cycling, or Terry Cycling, a women’s cycling apparel company, as one of five small business plaintiffs. The group sued Trump and his administration in the U.S. Court of International Trade in April. In May, a panel of three federal judges struck down most of the president’s tariffs. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit also largely backed the plaintiffs. The case was combined with another brought by private organizations impacted by the tariffs in Wednesday’s arguments in the Supreme Court.

The court also heard from a representative of 12 attorneys general, including Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark, who sued on similar grounds.

During the arguments, Solicitor General D. John Sauer defended the Trump administration’s actions — sometimes by contradicting the president.

Sauer faced a slew of skeptical inquiries from the justices who seemed to take issue with many of the Trump administration’s arguments, including that the president has broad authority to respond to international emergencies, Congress delegated the presidency this power, and tariffs are not taxes.

Since the Constitution gives Congress the power to tax, the claim that tariffs are not a tax was central to Sauer’s argument, despite the fact that the president has framed them as revenue-raising.

“We don’t contend that what’s being exercised here is the power to tax,” Sauer said. “It’s the power to regulate foreign commerce. These are regulatory tariffs. They are not revenue raising tariffs.”

Trump regularly says tariffs are making the country richer. And earlier this year, the White House floated using tariffs as a revenue raiser to offset the cost of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who spoke recently at the University of Vermont, made clear that she didn’t buy Sauer’s argument on tariffs versus taxes.

“You say tariffs are not taxes, but that’s exactly what they are,” she said. “They’re generating money from American citizens, revenue.”

‘Simply implausible’

How the justices decide the case will have major implications not just for Trump’s agenda but for how much unilateral power presidents have to regulate commerce.

During the arguments, Justice Neil Gorsuch leaned heavily into the question of congressional authority. He seemed to take issue with the fact that it would be difficult for Congress to reclaim that authority should the Supreme Court give the Trump administration what it was asking for.

“Congress, as a practical matter, can’t get this power back once it’s handed it over to the president. It’s a one way ratchet toward the gradual but continual accretion of power in the executive branch and away from the people’s elected representatives,” he argued.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett seemed skeptical of the scope of the reciprocal tariffs Trump has placed on dozens of countries, allies and trading partners alike.

“Is it your contention that every country needed to be tariffed because of threats to the defense and industrial base? I mean, Spain, France? I mean, I could see it with some countries, but explain to me why as many countries needed to be subject to the reciprocal tariff policy as are,” she asked.

The small businesses were represented by attorney Neal Katyal. He argued that tariffs are, in fact, a tax, and that the Trump administration was exceeding the authority Congress intended to give to the executive branch when it passed the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

“It’s simply implausible that in enacting IEEPA, Congress handed the president the power to overhaul the entire tariff system and the American economy in the process, allowing him to set and reset tariffs on any and every product from any and every country at any and all times,” Katyal said.

“And as Justices Gorsuch and Barrett just said, this is a one-way ratchet,” he continued. “We will never get this power back if the government wins this case. What president wouldn’t veto legislation to rein this power in and pull out the tariff power?”

The Supreme Court has until the end of its term next summer to make a decision, but the case has so far been on an expedited track, leading some experienced court watchers to expect a decision before the end of the year.

Other routes for tariffs

The White House has projected confidence in its ability to win the case — press secretary Karoline Leavitt said officials believe the Supreme Court will rule in their favor. Still, contingency plans have long been in the works.

“The White House is always preparing for plan B,” she said at a briefing. “It would be imprudent of the president’s advisers not to prepare for such a situation. With that said, we are 100% confident in the president and his team’s legal argument and the merits of the law in this case, and we remain optimistic that the Supreme Court is going to do the right thing. The importance of this case cannot be overstated.”

Trump has used the threat of tariffs in matters far beyond trade. The administration used a tariff investigation to pressure Brazil over its decision to prosecute former President Jair Bolsonaro. Trump attempted to use trade negotiations to stop Canada from backing Palestinian statehood. The threat of steep tariffs has been an essential leverage point in his peace negotiations between countries like India and Pakistan, as well as Russia and Ukraine.

The Supreme Court’s decision could stymie all of this.

Administration officials have indicated that even if they lose the case, they would find another way to levy tariffs.

There are multiple legal avenues to enact tariffs. Top Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro has signaled the administration was considering use of Section 122 and then Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, if use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act is deemed unlawful.

Multiple trade experts NOTUS spoke to said this would be the most plausible course of action for Trump to keep his tariffs alive if the court rules against him.

Peter Harrell, who served as senior director for international economics and competitiveness in the Biden White House, said “the most obvious choice” for the White House to temporarily maintain tariffs would be to invoke Section 122. That would allow tariffs of up to 15% for as long as 150 days on countries whose trade with the U.S. is unjustifiably imbalanced.

“That, to me, looks like the sort of obvious, immediate stop gap they could pull to keep many of their tariffs in place for a couple of months while they figure out what the longer term plan is,” he said.

Section 301 of the trade act allows an administration to launch investigations into specific countries and implement tariffs based on the results of that investigation. There are already active Section 301 investigations into China, Brazil and Nicaragua; the latter two were started under the administration of President Joe Biden. The Trump administration could begin more of them, but the investigations take months and again open the administration up to the possibility of lawsuits.

Over the past few months, the Trump administration has expanded its use of Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows him to put restrictions on the import of certain goods if they are found after an investigation to threaten national security.

But none of these powers is as expansive as the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, which the Trump administration has used to enact crushing tariffs with the stroke of a pen.

The International Economic Emergency Powers Act “only requires a finding of a national emergency, which is a more unilateral power within the president to make that determination,” said Everett Eissenstat, a partner at Squire Patton Boggs who represented the Trump administration on international trade matters as deputy director of the National Economic Council during Trump’s first term. “There’s no investigation, there’s no congressional consultation, it’s just a declaration of emergency, and that unleashes the power to regulate commerce, regulate importation.”

He added that there “were certainly more limitations” on Section 301 and Section 232.

If the Supreme Court were to rule in the Trump administration’s favor, it’s possible that the ruling wouldn’t just give the administration the legal go-ahead on current tariff policy, but open the door for the International Economic Emergency Powers Act to be used even more broadly than Trump is currently using it.

For the importers, business owners, consumers and taxpayers who are impacted by the president’s trade and tariff policy, a decision from the Supreme Court in either direction is unlikely to offer significant relief from the pressures of the Trump tariff economy.

“Unfortunately, if you’re a business, you can celebrate a Supreme Court win if that’s the way it goes, but you’re not going to be off the hook,” Riley said. “Trump will continue to impose tariffs, continue to impose costs on Americans, but he just won’t have the unlimited authority that he’ll have if the Supreme Court allows the IEEPA tariffs to remain in place.”",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/US-supreme-court-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 19:01:16.138110

In a Nov. 6 letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the lawmakers said that staff at the Office of Detention Oversight are crucial to ensuring safety at ICE detention centers. Staff at ODO were furloughed at the outset of the shutdown.

“Without ODO staff actively performing these duties, there is a heightened risk that detention facilities fail to meet required standards, compromising detainee safety, access to medical care, and legal protections,” the lawmakers wrote to Noem.

The lawmakers also point out that the Department of Homeland Security’s shutdown contingency plan includes exceptions for the safety of human life and protection of property.

“This is not hypothetical – ICE has publicly reported that at least twenty people have died in its custody since January,” they added.

The letter points to reports of overcrowding and other unsafe conditions at ICE detention facilities, as immigration enforcement operations have continued through the shutdown.

“Given these developments, we are deeply concerned about the health and safety of detainees and staff at ICE facilities during the ongoing lapse in appropriations,” the letter states. “The decision to furlough the entire ODO is a clear attempt to sabotage oversight into the conditions of ICE facilities and the wellbeing of detainees.”

The letter was led by Rep. James Walkinshaw (D-Va.) and also signed by Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Reps. Don Beyer (D-Va.) and Suhas Subramanyam (D-Va.).

In a separate Oct. 31 letter to Noem and acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, Rep. Maxine Dexter (D-Ore.) pointed out that ICE furloughed ODO staff despite receiving an influx of funding under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

“I recognize that certain nonessential functions must pause during a lapse in appropriations,” Dexter wrote. “However, a lack of funding cannot be used as justification to strip away any measure of accountability. To safeguard the health, safety, and dignity of my constituents, I urge you to reinstate necessary staff for the Office of Detention Oversight, immediately restore communication channels between ICE and congressional offices, and ensure Members of Congress have access to all ICE facilities.”

In an Oct. 17 letter, Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) said DHS furloughing ODO employees while retaining all press and communications staffers raises “serious questions about the department’s priorities during this shutdown.”

“ODO’s inspectors are responsible for ensuring that facilities meet federal health, safety, and humane treatment standards,” Krishnamoorthi wrote. “With detention levels now among the highest in more than a decade, suspending this critical oversight function while enforcement operations proceed uninterrupted is indefensible and represents a profound failure of priorities.”

The ODO furloughs come as the number of ICE detainees reach record high levels. As of Sept. 21, there were nearly 60,000 people in ICE custody.

ODO was created in 2009 to inspect ICE detention facilities. The office conducts a separate set of inspections independent from inspections run by ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations’ Custody Management Division.

The furloughs at ODO come after DHS also fired most staff at several oversight offices earlier this year.

The reductions-in-force at those offices – the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, and the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman – are now at issue in an ongoing lawsuit.

Rayito del Sol released a statement Thursday evening, saying in part, ""Yesterday was a deeply difficult day for our Rayito de Sol teachers, families, and communities.

Rayito del Sol daycare is closed for the rest of the week and will reopen Monday.","The teacher detained by ICE agents at the Rayito del Sol daycare in North Center is believed to now be at the Broadview processing facility, and parents in the community now have serious safety concerns.

Parents told CBS News Chicago they want to know why agents went into the daycare in the first place. Spokespeople from the Department of Homeland Security say they didn't.

Video captured the teacher's arrest Wednesday morning, and other video shows pre-K teacher Diana Galeano in the back of the unmarked car federal agents sed to detain her. Parents, staff and officials said children were present when she was taken into custody.

""We had agents with guns who were walking around the facility with teachers inside, with children inside,"" said Ald. Matt Martin, who represents the 47th Ward.

Martin said Galeano is at the Broadview ICE detention center and that, in detaining her, federal agents were inside the daycare building with no warrant. Martin, U.S. Rep Mike Quigley and U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez all said they had seen video from inside the facility showing ICE agents indoors.

But DHS officials said she was ""arrested inside a vestibule, not in the school.""

Rayito del Sol released a statement Thursday evening, saying in part, ""Yesterday was a deeply difficult day for our Rayito de Sol teachers, families, and communities. We are profoundly disturbed by yesterday's events. Since early yesterday morning, we have been steadfastly focused on the safety and well-being of our students, teachers, and families, and providing support to our wrongfully detained employee. We are humbled by the outpouring of support from our community , and we are extremely grateful for the manner in which our staff responded to a challenging situation.""

Parents like Alyssa Mikav and Maia Reed are shaken up and still in disbelief.

""Armed agents entering a school, traumatizing small children, traumatizing teachers,"" Mikav said. ""My goal right now is to understand why this is OK, at a federal level, for this to happen.""

DHS would only say that no one arrests were made in front of children, and that the man who was with Galeano in the car barricaded himself in the school. None of the videos that have been shared publicly have shown anyone other than Galeano being detained, and parents who witnessed her arrest said the ICE agents left the daycare center after she was in custody.

DHS officials say Galeano is in the country illegally from Colombia and paid to smuggle her teenage children across the border this year, which they said is the crime for which she was arrested. DS claims she ran into the daycare after fleeing a car chase with federal agents, who were trying to stop and detain her.

Matt Champion, a parent waiting for the daycare to open so he could drop his child off Wednesday morning, saw the arrest take place and told CBS News Chicago he saw a black car followed by an SUV pull into the parking lot from Addison, and added that ""neither car was driving particularly fast.""

Champion said the black car stopped and a teacher got out and ran into the school through two sets of doors, including an inner locking door.

A federal district court judge in Rhode Island has permanently enjoined the U.S. Dept. of Transportation from tying federal transportation grants to state cooperation with federal immigration enforcement or with rollback of diversity, equity and inclusion policies.

The Nov. 4 order nullifies the requirement nationwide and ends a months-long legal challenge brought by 20 states. The directive touched nearly every stream of federal capital assistance that state transportation agencies rely on.

The dispute centers on an April 24 directive from Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy instructing governors, state DOTs and transit agencies to both certify compliance with federal immigration-detainer requests and remove “policies, programs or activities premised on prohibited classifications” that federal DOT applied to a range of DEI initiatives.

Agencies that declined to comply risked having federal awards suspended or canceled.

States Sue DOT Over Threat to Cancel Grants If No Immigration Enforcement Help

California, Rhode Island and 18 other states— all but one led by Democratic governors—filed suit May 13 in the Rhode Island court, arguing the directive exceeded department authority and attempted to impose conditions Congress never authorized under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act or any other transportation statute.

The 123-page complaint asserts that federal law contains no provision allowing DOT to condition Federal Highway Administration, Federal Transit Administration of Federal Railroad Administration funds on cooperation with immigration enforcement.

No Basis in Law

In his ruling, Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. found that DOT did not identify statutory authority for its immigration enforcement condition and violated the Administrative Procedure Act’s clear-statement and reasoned-decisionmaking requirements.

Applying the Supreme Court’s Spending Clause framework under South Dakota v. Dole, McConnell concluded the condition lacked the required “relatedness,” writing that DOT presented “no plausible connection” between immigration-enforcement cooperation and the purposes Congress established for federal transportation programs.

The court reinforced findings from a June 19 preliminary injunction, when several states submitted declarations stating that compliance with the directive would require agencies to violate state civil-rights or sanctuary statutes.

Those filings also described uncertainty for infrastructure act-funded work already under contract and for upcoming grant cycles, prompting agencies to pause internal compliance reviews until the court clarified DOT authority.

Programs administered by the Federal Highway Administration, Federal Transit Administration, Federal Railroad Administration, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration were identified in the complaint as subject to the condition.

Because DOT indicated the directive applied to all federal grantmaking, major competitive programs—including RAISE, INFRA, MEGA and FTA’s Capital Investment Grants—also faced potential exposure.

Together, these formula and competitive programs distribute tens of billions of dollars annually for highway, transit and rail capital improvements. A post-ruling legal analysis states that McConnell’s decision vacates the condition from all DOT grant agreements nationwide. The docket shows no stay request or notice of appeal filed by the agency as of Nov. 6.

Nationwide Relief

The ruling’s nationwide sweep comes as the U.S. Supreme Court has sharply limited lower courts’ ability to issue such broad injunctions.

In a June decision, the high court held that district courts “generally cannot prohibit the government from enforcing a law or executive action against non-parties to a lawsuit,” according to a Sidley law firm legal analysis.

Other legal experts have made similar observations. A Dorsey & Whitney client alert noted that the scope of a federal court’s injunction must be “cabined to what is ‘necessary to provide complete relief to each plaintiff with standing to sue.’”

Legal observers say that while no party has sought a stay or appealed the scope of the order, the breadth of relief in California et al. v. U.S. DOT could draw scrutiny under the court’s new standard.

FEMA Disaster-Aid Denials Draw Fire as Politics, Policy Intersect

State officials praised the clarity the ruling provides. Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Neronha said the decision reaffirms the requirement that transportation dollars must be tied to statutory purposes.

“[USDOT] blatantly overstepped their statutory authority, violated the APA and transgressed well-settled constitutional limitations on federal funding conditions,"" he said. ""The ability of Rhode Islanders to travel on safe roads and bridges cannot hang on the political whims of one man,”

Neronha praised the restorative certainty for long-planned work dependent on multi-year federal awards.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the ruling confirms arguments the coalition advanced when the suit was filed. “Today, a court definitively rebuked the Trump Administration’s illegal efforts to withhold critical public safety funding from states that refuse to carry out his mass deportation agenda,” he said.

Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said the ruling protects “billions of dollars” in planned transportation improvements. She said the decision prevents the administration from forcing states into enforcement strategies that have “no bearing on transportation mobility or safety.”

Infrastructure attorneys say the ruling also reinforces procedural expectations for federal agencies. Ayelet Hirschkorn, a partner at Kaplan Kirsch in New York, said the decision “amplifies the importance of following established rulemaking processes to ensure that transit agencies have sufficient time to comment on proposed changes that affect current and future projects.”

She said by email that the ruling offers added reassurance that agencies can advance infrastructure work without facing “the difficult choice of foregoing federal funds that are key to the projects’ success.”

Hirschkorn noted that by declaring the restriction void on its face, the order affects all 50 states—an outcome that differs from asserting broad injunctive relief and one that may invite future scrutiny under the Supreme Court’s ruling in Trump v. CASA. She said she is not aware of any decision by the administration on whether it will appeal.

Motion allowed.

“This case concerns the scope of the government’s authority to detain noncitizens pending their removal proceedings without the opportunity for release on bond under 8 U.S.C. §1225(b)(2)(A). In recent months, the government has asserted that all noncitizens who entered the United States without inspection and are later apprehended inside the country must be detained without a bond hearing during their removal proceedings, regardless of how long they have resided in the United States or whether they have a criminal history. Specifically, the government has taken the position that such noncitizens remain ‘applicants for admission’ and, thus, are subject to mandatory detention throughout their removal proceedings under §1225(b)(2)(A) rather than discretionary detention under 8 U.S.C. §1226(a). The Board of Immigration Appeals (‘BIA’) adopted this interpretation of the statute in a precedential decision issued on September 5, 2025. See Matter of Hurtado, 29 I. & N. Dec. 216, 220 (B.I.A. 2025).

“Petitioner Jose Arnulfo Guerrero Orellana, the proposed class representative, entered the United States without inspection in 2013. On September 18, 2025, he was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (‘ICE’) and placed into removal proceedings. He subsequently filed this petition for writ of habeas corpus and putative class action complaint to challenge his detention without a bond hearing and the government’s recent interpretation of the scope of §1225(b)(2)(A). He argues that his detention without a bond hearing is unlawful for three reasons: 1) the government has misclassified him as subject to mandatory detention under §1225(b)(2)(A) when he is actually subject to discretionary detention under §1226(a); 2) his detention violates his constitutional right to due process; and 3) the BIA’s decision in Matter of Hurtado is contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (‘APA’), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq. …

“Guerrero Orellana now moves for class certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. He seeks to certify a class of noncitizens subject to mandatory detention under the government’s recent interpretation of §1225(b)(2)(A) who are either detained within Massachusetts or subject to the jurisdiction of an immigration court in Massachusetts.

“The government opposes the motion. After hearing, the Court allows Guerrero Orellana’s motion for class certification (Dkt. 31). …

“Guerrero Orellana seeks to certify the proposed class for all three of his claims. For the reasons discussed below, certification is warranted with respect to the claim that the government lacks statutory authority to subject noncitizens who entered the United States without inspection and are detained while residing inside the country to mandatory detention under §1225(b)(2)(A). The Court will address whether the class should be certified with regard to Guerrero Orellana’s due process and APA claims at a later stage should it become necessary to do so to resolve this case. …

“The proposed class shares a common question capable of class-wide resolution because its members are all detained without a bond hearing pursuant to the same allegedly unlawful government policy. …

“Accordingly, the proposed class presents the following common question of law: does §1225(b)(2)(A) authorize mandatory detention without a bond hearing during removal proceedings for noncitizens who entered the United States without inspection, were arrested while residing inside the country, and who are not subject to the expedited removal process under §1225(b)(1), parole revocation under §1182(d)(5)(A), or mandatory detention under §1226(c)? …

“For substantially the same reasons discussed in the context of commonality, Guerrero Orellana’s proposed class meets the typicality requirement. … The claims of Guerrero Orellana and the absent class members arise from the same governmental policy subjecting certain noncitizens to mandatory detention without a bond hearing during their removal proceedings. …

“The fact that §1252(f)(1) bars class-wide injunctive relief does not create a fundamental conflict between Guerrero Orellana and the absent class members. Guerrero Orellana and the absent class members all have suffered or will suffer the same injury from the government’s uniform policy imposing mandatory detention without a bond hearing on them during their removal proceedings. …

“Guerrero Orellana’s proposed class satisfies Rule 23(b)(2). The government has adopted a uniform interpretation of §1225(b)(2)(A) that imposes detention without a bond hearing during removal proceedings on all noncitizens who entered the United States without inspection, are apprehended while residing inside the country, and are not subject to parole revocation under §1182(d)(5)(A) or mandatory detention under §1225(b)(1) or §1226(c). This policy prevents all members of the proposed class from seeking release from detention from an immigration judge at a bond hearing. Guerrero Orellana asks for a class-wide declaratory judgment that the government’s imposition of mandatory detention under §1225(b)(2)(A) on this category of noncitizens is unlawful and that those noncitizens are entitled to bond hearings in immigration court. This ‘single … declaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of the class.’ …

“For the foregoing reasons, Guerrero Orellana’s motion for class certification (Dkt. 31) is allowed. …”

Much of the poor environmental conditions around the globe result from the activities of wealthy nations, the study found.

The team hopes this study can empower communities and lawyers working on environmental rights issues.","More than 99% of the world’s 7.7 billion people have one or more of their environmental rights threatened, according to new research.

In the most comprehensive analysis of inequality in environmental conditions to date, CU Boulder researchers revealed that nearly half of the global population lives in regions facing three or more environmental problems. Those include polluted air, unsafe water, extreme heat, food insecurity and biodiversity loss.

The analysis was published September 25 in Environmental Research Communications.

It provides strong evidence for urgent climate action, as representatives from nearly 200 countries prepare to convene for the 30th Conference of the Parties (COP30), the United Nations’ annual climate meeting, in Brazil beginning November 10.

“Over the years, communities around the world have been fighting for local environmental justice,” said first author Naia Ormaza-Zulueta, a postdoctoral researcher in the Better Planet Lab at CU Boulder. “We want to stitch their stories into a single, undeniable global tapestry so that they can’t be dismissed as isolated problems.”

In 2022, the UN formally recognized that everyone on the planet has the right to a healthy environment. The landmark resolution, while urging countries to take action to protect that right for their people, is not legally binding.

The resolution also failed to account for environmental harm caused by activities in other countries, said Ormaza-Zulueta, who's also a researcher at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. Extensive research has shown that large, industrialized nations, such as the United States, emit the most greenhouse gases, but lower-income countries experience the greatest impacts.

Pollution Without Borders

Ormaza-Zulueta and Zia Mehrabi, a data scientist in the Department of Environmental Studies and founder of the Better Planet Lab, wanted to put a number on how many people have had their environmental rights threatened.

They collected large datasets on environmental problems to calculate whether an individual in a given location around the world is experiencing, or has recently experienced, conditions that violated their rights in five core areas defined by the UN: clean air, clean water, a safe climate, healthy and sustainably produced food, and thriving biodiversity and ecosystems.

The team found that almost everyone on Earth lived in places that have recently experienced at least one environmental risk that failed to meet the UN conditions. Over 45%, or 3.4 billion people, had at least three rights threatened, and1.25%, or 95 million experienced all five conditions.

“The numbers are heartbreaking,” said Ormaza-Zulueta.

Having access to clean air, defined as an annual average outdoor particulate matter concentration below the World Health Organization guideline, was the most common threat, followed by access to healthy and sustainably produced food.

In Colorado, a study has revealed that ozone pollution, mainly from cars, and oil and gas operations, causes more than 800 deaths each year.

“A lot of people think Boulder has great air quality for being so close to the mountains,” said Mehrabi. “But the reality is that our ozone level is high for multiple months during the summer. There are days when the air quality is so bad that our children can’t play outside.”

Hotspots of injustice

While most people are at risk of poor environmental conditions, not everyone feels the same impact. Consistent with previous research, disadvantaged populations, such as those with lower incomes, those who are displaced and those living on Indigenous lands, are far more likely to experience poor air quality, limited access to clean water and excessive heat than the rest of the population.

Those living in wealthier areas usually experience the best environmental conditions and are more likely to escape the worst impact as climate change progresses.

Internationally, several environmental impact hotspots stood out in the study: South Asia, for example, contains 41% of all people living with all five threats to environmental rights, despite making up only one-fifth of the world’s population.

Much of the poor environmental conditions around the globe result from the activities of wealthy nations, the study found. For instance, pollution from the United States is responsible for 12,000 deaths from poor air quality in India each year and 38,000 deaths in China. Meanwhile, emissions from the 27 countries in the European Union have made extreme weather events 1.8 times more likely in Southeast Africa and the Amazon rainforest.

“No matter where we live, our rights are inherently connected to those of people in other parts of the world,” Ormaza-Zulueta said. She added that the large demand for products in the United States and Europe has caused biodiversity loss and deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. The resulting global warming and increased frequency of extreme weather events are felt around the world.

“An unstable environment destabilizes our society,” Mehrabi said. “There is already a lot of fear in the United States and elsewhere about conflict, immigration, and other signs of instability. Environmental issues are only going to make them worse.”

Even though the statistics are bleak, Mehrabi said they don’t tell the whole story. In addition to the five core categories, many people are at risk of other poor conditions that were not measured, such as exposure to toxins released from mining and plastic waste.

“There are many solutions to these environmental problems we’re facing now, from responsible clean energy to a more sustainable and just supply chain. We need strong policies that encourage businesses to adopt these solutions,” Mehrabi said.

Mehrabi pointed to due diligence laws in countries such as the Netherlands, France, and Germany, which require domestic companies to uphold human rights across their global operations. He said other nations need to follow suit.

The team hopes this study can empower communities and lawyers working on environmental rights issues.

“By showing how these injustices are happening across the world, deniers can no longer dismiss the polluted river here or dirty air there as anecdotes. This can be a critical tool for pushing for policy changes,” Ormaza-Zulueta said.",https://www.colorado.edu/today/sites/default/files/2025-11/pexels-yogendras31-2480807.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 17:17:54.763270

“Twenty-three people,” Bishop Seitz marveled, pondering the number of ICE detainees who died last year.
Isn’t that our responsibility?” Officials from ICE and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to multiple requests for comment about detention deaths for this report.
According to Ms. Wolf, the higher monthly detention tallies are the result of an ICE policy “of near-universal detention.” She explained that ICE agents previously had been allowed discretion over what to do with apprehended immigrants, particularly minors, pregnant women and people suffering from acute medical conditions.","The spiritual well-being of the men and women detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has become a well-documented concern among church leaders in recent weeks—from Pope Leo XIV in Rome to Bishop Robert Barron of Winona-Rochester, a member of the Trump administration’s Religious Liberty Commission. All to the good.

But as reports of overcrowded conditions, poor sanitation and supervision and rotten food at ICE detention facilities continue to circulate in the media and among immigrant advocates, the physical well-being of detainees has also come under scrutiny. An emergency class action lawsuit alleging inhumane conditions and violations of civil rights at ICE’s Broadview Processing Center near Chicago’s Midway Airport was filed on Oct. 31.

According to the suit, the Broadview facility is meant to serve as a short-term “holding facility” with a 12-hour limit on how long people can be detained there. “However, [ICE and the Department of Homeland Security] are holding detainees at the overcrowded facility for multiple days and even weeks while denying them access to sufficient food, water, showers, hygiene products, and medical care. There are no beds or blankets, and detainees are forced to sleep on the cold and dirty floor.”

“Everyone, no matter their legal status, has the right to access counsel and to not be subject to horrific and inhumane conditions,” Alexa Van Brunt, the director of the MacArthur Justice Center’s Illinois office, said in a statement announcing the lawsuit. The center is among the group of advocates representing immigrant plaintiffs.

“Community members are being kidnapped off the streets, packed in [holding] cells, denied food, medical care and basic necessities, and forced to sign away their legal rights,” Ms. Van Brunt said. “This is a vicious abuse of power and gross violation of basic human rights by ICE and the Department of Homeland Security. It must end now.”

A federal judge ordered ICE and D.H.S. officials to improve conditions at Broadview on Nov. 5.

Detentions—and deaths—are up sharply

Adding to alarm about conditions in detention facilities has been a spike in the number of detainee deaths reported for the 2025 fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30. ICE officials reported 18 deaths among detainees, but advocates at the American Immigration Council reached a count of 23 after reviewing ICE press releases and believe the actual loss of life could be higher.

“The way that ICE defines a death in detention is pretty narrow,” Rebekah Wolf, a staff attorney for the council, explained. Detainees who become seriously ill may be removed from detention and die at a medical facility off-site. “ICE sometimes does not report those as someone who has died in detention,” she said.

Huabing Xie, a Chinese national, became the last detainee to die this fiscal year while under ICE custody after suffering a seizure at the Imperial Regional Detention Facility in Calexico, Calif., on Sept. 29. He is not included in the agency’s official tally.

Whatever the final F.Y. 2025 tally of deaths proves to be, the current official number is still substantially higher than the 12 deaths reported in F.Y. 2024 and far higher than the typical loss of life under detention reported during the Biden administration. In F.Y. 2023, just four deaths at ICE detention sites were recorded; three deaths were reported in F.Y. 2022 and five in F.Y. 2021.

In fact, the last time deaths under ICE custody were this high was F.Y. 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic, when 21 deaths were recorded. In F.Y. 2019, eight deaths were reported, and six were recorded in F.Y. 2018, the first year ICE was compelled by Congress to publicly track deaths in detention. According to the A.I.C., deaths in detention this year are the highest since 2004, when 32 people died.

Kevin Appleby, the senior fellow for policy and communications at the Center for Migration Studies of New York, sees the spike in detention deaths as the inevitable outcome of a process of dehumanization begun by the Trump White House. “This administration has dehumanized immigrants and, accordingly, they are treating them inhumanely,” he said. “I think respect for human rights and human dignity has been lost.”

“This deportation campaign is driven by numbers and not by respect for basic human life, and you’re seeing the result of that,” he said.

Bishop Mark Seitz of El Paso has been among the strongest voices in the U.S. church speaking on behalf of immigrant communities as the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts began in earnest in recent months. “Twenty-three people,” Bishop Seitz marveled, pondering the number of ICE detainees who died last year. “My God.”

Bishop Seitz said he has heard many stories this year of drug-addicted people incarcerated by ICE struggling to receive treatment and of detained pregnant women being denied appropriate care.

“So some [detainees] might have been dealing with drug addiction,” Bishop Seitz said. “We have a lot of drug addicted people in our country, right? Why aren’t they being treated? Isn’t that our responsibility?”

Officials from ICE and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to multiple requests for comment about detention deaths for this report. It is unclear how much the ongoing government shutdown may have proved an obstacle to an official response.

Speaking on behalf of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in a statement emailed to America, spokesperson Chieko Noguchi said U.S. bishops “are of course concerned with any deaths in detention facilities and disturbed by the recent reports of the increase in the rates of death.”

“The USCCB has repeatedly discouraged unnecessary detention in favor of more humane, community-based alternatives for nonviolent detainees,” she wrote. “At the very least, the USCCB insists that detainees are consistently provided with their basic needs including regular access to medical care, as well as pastoral and spiritual care, and religious services.”

A policy of ‘near-universal detention’

Detainees have died after seizures and cardiac arrest, tuberculosis or after health crises related to chronic illness like diabetes or drug or alcohol addiction. At least three died because of apparent suicide while in custody.

So why are so many deaths in ICE custody happening now? Part of the answer is related to the sharp increase in the number of detainees, which in 2025 averaged about 60,000 detainees each month. That figure is vastly higher than the 18,000 to 30,000 per month typically held in detention in recent years. According to Ms. Wolf, the higher monthly detention tallies are the result of an ICE policy “of near-universal detention.”

She explained that ICE agents previously had been allowed discretion over what to do with apprehended immigrants, particularly minors, pregnant women and people suffering from acute medical conditions. Agents could make judgment calls that could mean allowing apprehended immigrants to remain in their homes with ankle monitors, placed in alternative forms of confinement or released on parole while their immigration cases continued.

But in recent months, “the statistics of people being released from detention on parole by ICE are really stark,” she said. According to Ms. Wolf, in December 2024, the last full month of the Biden administration, about 5,000 people were released from detention under parole. She has seen monthly numbers consistently as low as 70 released parolees this year.

“The regulation and the statute that governs release from detention hasn’t changed,” she said. “What’s changed is the directive from the executive, whether that’s from the president directly or from the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. They have made a political decision not to release people.”

Ms. Wolf is certain the quota pressure that ICE agents are currently experiencing is part of the reason so many apprehended immigrants in poor health or suffering from alcoholism or drug addiction are being consigned to detention.

“People with medical conditions are not being released when our regulations suggest that in many cases they should,” Ms. Wolf said. “We’re just detaining sicker people.”

And when in custody, detainees have the right to petition for release because of medical problems. Those kinds of appeals are just not being heard now, Ms. Wolf said, at the same time oversight of ICE practices has been severely diminished.

She described the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liabilities, intended as an internal watchdog, as essentially nonfunctioning. The office had been completely closed by D.H.S. Secretary Kristi Noem in March, but that decision was reversed in May after immigration advocates and civil society groups filed suits seeking to restore the office. The C.R.C.L. office is mandated by Congress to respond to possible abuses within ICE and the Border Patrol.

Higher detainee numbers have also strained medical and supervisory resources, and in the end, medical conditions are being left untreated, medications are not being properly administered, and medical and mental health crises are going unnoticed, the A.I.C. report charges.

Retaining competent medical staff has been a long-standing problem at ICE facilities, Ms. Wolf said, but that deficit has been exacerbated by higher detention rates now. And diminished overall supervision because of overcrowding has meant some detainees have been able to take their own lives, while others have experienced fatal medical crises without being observed or properly treated.

According to Ms. Wolf, the risk of suicide is high at immigrant detention facilities. Many detainees have already suffered a great deal of psychological trauma in their lives and are facing new degrees of hopelessness as they confront deportation orders or find that ICE officials are appealing orders that they be released—conditions that warrant higher degrees of supervision that many facilities may not be able to maintain.

“It’s 23 human lives”

“It’s not happenstance that these deaths have increased,” Mr. Appleby said. “It’s not just circumstances. It’s a direct result of the policy of mass deportations.”

Mr. Appleby believes that Congress must recover its oversight role before conditions can improve and deaths in custody begin to decline. That will remain a difficult challenge “because many of the Republicans in the House are afraid to call the administration out on these matters.”

“It goes back to the environment that [the Trump administration] created against immigrants,” he said, “how they speak about them, how they treat them”—an atmosphere where immigrants are “looked at as less than human.”

“There’s not an incentive there for ICE to comply with basic standards that treat people as human beings,” Mr. Appleby said. “They’re not rewarded for that. They’re rewarded for the number of people that they can detain and deport.”

“Twenty-three deaths is not a statistic—it’s 23 human lives,” Anna Marie Gallagher, the executive director of Clinic, the U.S. church’s legal ministry for immigrants, said in a statement emailed to America.

“Catholic social teaching calls us to protect life and care for the vulnerable,” Ms. Gallagher wrote. “Detention should never be the default when humane, community-based alternatives exist and are proven to work.”

Bishop Seitz pointed out that under U.S. law, crossing the border without the proper paperwork is a misdemeanor, but “even for people who feel that crossing a border without authorization is a serious crime…are they really willing to say it’s worth [risking people’s lives]? People who have not committed a crime, people who have lived here peaceably and contributed to their community for years?”

“If they look at those statistics, can they be satisfied with that?”

“Where’s the value of life here?” Bishop Seitz asked, “especially for us Catholics who are so convicted about the life of a person from conception to natural death? Do we just take a pause on that here because they’re immigrants?”

Chicagoans opposed to President Donald Trump's aggressive immigration campaign are taking his administration to court and winning so far.

A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:

This week, there's been hours of testimony, as one federal judge listened to accounts about citizens' jarring encounters with federal agents. And another judge ordered the administration to improve the conditions at an immigration holding facility in a Chicago suburb.

FADEL: Jon Seidel with Chicago Public Media and the Chicago Sun-Times has been covering this and is with me now. Good morning.

JON SEIDEL, BYLINE: Good morning.

FADEL: So these legal fights have been going on for over a month. In what ways has the city prevailed?

SEIDEL: Well, last month, a federal judge in Chicago ruled against Trump's efforts to deploy National Guard troops here. And another judge limited federal agents' use of force against protesters and required a senior official to actually sit for a lengthy deposition. And now that judge, Sara Ellis, is preparing to rule on what's called a preliminary injunction. It would basically extend the order she issued last month that governs agents' use of force here.

FADEL: Now, Judge Ellis held a hearing yesterday in order to make that decision. What was the testimony like?

SEIDEL: Yeah. She presided over an eight-hour hearing Wednesday. She heard from a woman who said she found herself staring down the barrel of a gun just for filming the arrest of day laborers. The judge heard from a pastor who said he was shot in the head by pepper balls while praying outside a holding facility. And the judge heard the video testimony of U.S. Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino, who's become the public face of this campaign. He said the use of force here has been, quote, ""more than exemplary."" And now Judge Ellis says she plans to hand down her ruling today.

FADEL: Oh. Tell us more about Bovino.

SEIDEL: Bovino came here from California where he led Operation At Large. That led to a very controversial ruling by the Supreme Court which allowed agents in that operation to continue stopping people based on factors like race and language. Bovino was accused last month of throwing tear gas into a crowd in Chicago's Little Village neighborhood without justification. Federal authorities say he did so while being confronted by a hostile mob. They even said he'd been hit in the head with a rock, but attorneys told Judge Ellis yesterday that Bovino finally admitted he threw the tear gas before the rock entered the picture. Bovino's deposition was conducted privately, and we're waiting to see how much of it becomes public.

FADEL: Now, we mentioned the ruling about an immigration facility. What is happening in that one?

SEIDEL: That's right. Judge Robert Gettleman presided over a similar hearing Tuesday. That one revolved around the conditions inside this holding center in suburban Broadview. It's where most people arrested by immigration agents find themselves being held, at least for a short while. Until this summer, the facility hadn't been intended as a long-term holding center. But Gettleman heard that people are being held there for days at a time, 100 to 150 people to a cell. They often have nowhere to sleep but the floor, he was told, and many are sleeping near a dirty toilet. Though it's long been considered a detention or processing center, Judge Gettleman said it seems more like a prison. And Wednesday, he ordered that people held there should all be given clean bedding and a mat, that each holding room should be cleaned at least twice a day, and that everyone should be given adequate supplies of soap, towels, toilet paper and other hygiene products.

FADEL: Jon Seidel with Chicago Public Media and the Chicago Sun-Times. Jon, thank you for your reporting.

SEIDEL: You're welcome.

They could be supervised and “trained” by Border Patrol officials in their new immigration enforcement roles.","In a major overhaul of immigration enforcement leadership, the Trump administration is replacing nearly half of top leaders at ICE offices across the country with current or retired Border Patrol officers.

For months, masked immigration agents have brought terror to communities across the U.S., arresting parents in carpool lines, dragging people into unmarked vans, threatening protestors, and arresting elected officials. So far, there has been no governmental accountability for these tactics.

Instead, the Trump administration is ramping up enforcement by pulling in staff from an even more aggressive agency. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has long been criticized for its culture of cruelty, racism, and impunity for human rights violations. Its subagency, Border Patrol, has been at the center of these complaints. This is the same agency that implemented President Donald Trump’s 2017 family separation policy, where infants and toddlers were stripped from their parents’ arms. As immigration raids escalate and become more brazen and aggressive, the decision to put the country’s most lawless agency in charge of immigration enforcement in major cities is an alarming escalation. And we are already seeing the effects. They’ve launched tear gas in residential neighborhoods in Chicago and Portland, rappelled from a Black Hawk helicopter into an apartment building to arrest families at night, violently attacked U.S. citizens, and used predator drones to surveil protests, predator drones to surveil protests.

U.S. Border Patrol is a lawless agency with a history of abuses

CBP is one of the world's largest law enforcement organizations with 60,000 agents, including nearly 20,000 Border Patrol agents. H.R. 1,Trump’s so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill,” provided funding to hire another 10,000 Border Patrol agents in July. Border Patrol has historically focused on immigration enforcement and drug interdiction at or near the borders with Mexico and Canada, where it operates checkpoints, roving patrols, and aerial surveillance.

For years, Border Patrol agents have engaged in reckless, abusive, unconstitutional conduct in their limited zone of authority and have rarely faced accountability for abuses. In the last 15 years, nearly 200 people have died as a result of encounters with Border Patrol: that includes 70 use-of-force cases, six people killed in cross-border shootings with no impunity, and more than 100 fatalities from Border Patrol-led car chases. Upon taking office, the Trump administration rescinded a hard-won agency policy to restrict these dangerous car chases.

Among those shot and killed by an on-duty agent was 16-year-old Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez. In 2012, Jose was shot approximately 10 times through the border fence by a U.S. Border Patrol agent while walking home from playing basketball. He was shot in the back and died on the sidewalk, only a few blocks from his home. In 2023, Border Patrol agents shot Raymond Mattia nine times, killing him outside his home on tribal lands in Arizona.

No agent has ever been convicted of criminal wrongdoing while on duty, despite documented deaths, excessive use of force during arrests, inadequate medical care, and deaths in Border Patrol custody due to neglect. The agency has a longstanding crisis of accountability. A decade ago, CBP’s former internal affairs chief warned that the agency “goes out of its way to evade legal restraints” and is “clearly engineered to interfere with our efforts to hold the Border Patrol accountable.”

During Trump’s first term, a Facebook group of current and former Border Patrol agents joked about migrant deaths and posted sexist and graphic memes about women in Congress. Since then, the agency has received more funding, more surveillance and military equipment, and now more power. It has never received real oversight or legal accountability. And now the agency is in charge of White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller’s main operation: mass deportation.

Trump is deploying Border Patrol agents away from the U.S. border

Over the last several months, Miller and Trump have cannibalized federal agencies to build an unprecedent federal police force. The administration has primarily focused on terrorizing cities and arresting, detaining, and deporting immigrants. The face of these sprawling operations is Gregory Bovino, the El Centro Sector Border Patrol chief whose aggressive raids in California appear to have won him a leadership role in the new interior operations. Bovino oversaw CBP operations in L.A. this June and was subsequently put in charge of the administration’s operation in Chicago. Just last week, Bovino himself threw a tear gas cannister in a residential neighborhood, captured on video. Agents under his command have used increasingly aggressive tactics, like punching a restrained man, and pulling dozens of U.S. citizens and children from their beds in a nighttime apartment raid.

Border Patrol’s elevation in this new enforcement regime is dangerous. And that danger is multiplied further through the 287(g) program. This program allows state and local police to enter into agreements with the federal government that allow them to participate in certain immigration enforcement activities under federal supervision and training. That is, instead of the state and local policing work that taxpayers hired them to do. More than 1,000 state and local police agencies are now part of that program.

But now, local police wouldn’t just be collaborating with ICE. They could be supervised and “trained” by Border Patrol officials in their new immigration enforcement roles. This is alarming, given Border Patrol’s culture of abuse, its track record on use of force, its lack of experience in the nation’s interior, and its apparent disdain for accountability and the rights of even U.S. citizens.

It’s no accident that Miller and Trump have put Border Patrol at the head of their politicized and violent immigration enforcement campaigns. As one former Department of Homeland Security official said, the replacement of career ICE officials is “designed to silence dissent and clear the field for Bovino’s task forces.” Cities and states should refuse to participate in this administration’s campaign of terror, and members of Congress must hold Border Patrol accountable, especially now that it is becoming Trump’s personal police force.",https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/11/immigrants-make-america-great-again-f.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 17:17:48.029338

Rokita alleges IPS thwarted ICE efforts to ""deport an illegal alien who had voluntarily agreed to leave the country"" in January. Rokita said he warned the district in February against its ""unlawful policies,"" but Rokita says the district has continued to defy Indiana's anti-sanctuary law.

“Sanctuary policies are bad in any context, but they are especially troubling in our schools,” Rokita said in a statement. “Schools across the country are vulnerable to infiltration by criminal illegal aliens—it's happened in many other states—and it is essential that ICE be able to take action when that occurs to help keep our kids safe.

The America First Police Institute (AFPI), a think tank closely aligned with President Donald Trump, joined the lawsuit as a special counsel.

According to the complaint filed in Marion County Superior Court, IPS has the following policies that defy state law:

IPS policies provide that IPS employees ""shall not assist immigration enforcement efforts unless legally required and authorized to do so by the Superintendent.""

IPS and its staff will not collect, maintain, or share any information concerning students', students' parents' or school employees' immigration statuses.

IPS refused to hand over student without a warrant

The complaint says that a Honduran national was scheduled to be deported on Jan. 8. The immigrant's child went to an IPS school ""in apparent disregard of his father's wish that they depart the country together that afternoon."" It is unclear if the child was a Honduran national or a United States citizen.

When ICE officers went to IPS to collect the child, IPS said agents could not collect the child without a warrant. An IPS teacher allegedly put the child in contact with an immigration lawyer. The child ended up leaving school with the immigration attorney, and the father's voluntary deportation order expired without him leaving the country.

It is unclear, from the complaint, if ICE ever sought or provided the warrant IPS demanded.

The complaint alleges that IPS has a close working relationship with IMPD, including a memorandum of understanding, in contrast to its relationship with ICE.

A judge blocked the Trump administration policy in June after a lawsuit from non-binary and transgender people, some of whom said they were afraid to submit applications.","The supreme court on Thursday allowed Donald Trump’s administration to enforce a policy blocking transgender and non-binary people from choosing passport sex markers that align with their gender identity.

The decision by the high court’s conservative majority is Trump’s latest win on the high court’s emergency docket, and it means his administration can enforce the policy while a lawsuit over it plays out. It halts a lower-court order requiring the government to keep letting people choose male, female or X on their passport to line up with their gender identity on new or renewed passports.

Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, hailed the decision, saying in a post on X: “Today’s stay allows the government to require citizens to list their biological sex on their passport. In other words: there are two sexes, and our attorneys will continue fighting for that simple truth.”

Meanwhile, the court’s three liberal justices dissented, with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson calling the decision a “pointless but painful perversion”.

She added: “Such senseless sidestepping of the obvious equitable outcome has become an unfortunate pattern. So, too, has my own refusal to look the other way when basic principles are selectively discarded. This Court has once again paved the way for the immediate infliction of injury without adequate (or, really, any) justification.

“What the Government needs (and what it does not have) is an explanation for why it faces harm unless the President’s chosen policy is implemented now. It suggests that there is an urgent foreign policy interest in dictating sex markers on passports, but does not elaborate as to what that interest might possibly be,” Jackson wrote.

“As is also becoming routine, this court misunderstands the assignment,” she added.

The state department changed its passport rules after Trump, a Republican, handed down an executive order in January declaring the United States would “recognize two sexes, male and female”, based on birth certificates and “biological classification”.

Transgender actor Hunter Schafer, for example, said in February that her new passport had been issued with a male gender marker, even though she has been marked female on her driver’s license and passport for years.

The plaintiffs argue that passports limited to the sex listed on a birth certificate can spark harassment or even violence for transgender people.

“By classifying people based on sex assigned at birth and exclusively issuing sex markers on passports based on that sex classification, the State Department deprives plaintiffs of a usable identification document and the ability to travel safely,” attorneys wrote in court documents.

Sex markers began appearing on passports in the mid-1970s and the federal government started allowing them to be changed with medical documentation in the early 1990s, the plaintiffs said in court documents. A 2021 change under Joe Biden, a Democrat, removed documentation requirements and allowed non-binary people to choose an X gender marker after years of litigation.

A judge blocked the Trump administration policy in June after a lawsuit from non-binary and transgender people, some of whom said they were afraid to submit applications. An appeals court left the judge’s order in place.

The solicitor general, D John Sauer, then turned to the supreme court, pointing to its recent ruling upholding of a ban on transition-related healthcare for transgender minors. He also argued Congress gave the president control over passports, which overlaps with his authority over foreign affairs.

“It is hard to imagine a system less conducive to accurate identification than one in which anyone can refuse to identify his or her sex and withhold relevant identifying information for any reason, or can rely on a mutable sense of self-identification,” Sauer wrote in court documents.

Since taking office in January, Trump has ramped up attacks against LGTBQ+ communities across the country. In October, his administration threatened to pause federal funding unless states remove references to gender identity and the existence of transgender and non-binary people from a federal sex education program.

At least 11 states and two territories acquiesced to Trump’s demands. Meanwhile, 16 states and Washington DC sued the administration over the demand.

Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, vice chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, said after the meeting he still didn’t know why the U.S. hasn’t intercepted the boats the administration says are carrying drugs, according to NPR. The military has blown them up, and officials, including Hegseth and President Donald Trump, have posted videos of the attacks on social media.

""Showing by interdiction, and drug recovery, and that the individuals on the boats are known narco-terrorists would sure go a long way in convincing Americans and for that matter, the rest of the world,"" Warner reportedly said.

Some lawmakers were satisfied after the meeting with Hegseth and Rubio, according to NPR. Idaho Republican Sen. Jim Risch, chairman of the foreign relations committee, said he and some of his colleagues have been “fully advised” and “fully satisfied” with the administration’s actions, the outlet reported.

Connecticut Democratic Rep. Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, reportedly agreed that Congress is receiving information on the strikes but noted that it has taken a while. The administration is sharing its legal justification for the attacks and information on other military operations, NPR quoted Himes as saying.

""In my world and the intelligence world, when something is done, we get a great deal of detail on every operation. That has not been shared,"" Himes reportedly said. ""Finally they've started to notify Congress of this stuff, until basically ten days ago we had nothing.""

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday that the administration has been “incredibly transparent” about the strikes, adding that it would be happy to speak to lawmakers about them.

The administration held a meeting on the attacks with Republicans last week but didn’t invite any Democrats. Warner called it a “partisan stunt” and a “slap in the face” to Congress.

“Shutting Democrats out of a briefing on U.S. military strikes and withholding the legal justification for those strikes from half the Senate is indefensible and dangerous,” he said in a statement. “Decisions about the use of American military force are not campaign strategy sessions, and they are not the private property of one political party.”",https://kfoxtv.com/resources/assets/kfox/images/logos/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-06 20:57:10.540760

“Increasingly, local law enforcement agencies recognized these data could be useful for their own quotidian surveillance.” Editorial Team: Sahar Fatima, Lead Editor Carolyn Copeland, Top Editor Rashmee Kumar, Copy Editor","Civil rights attorneys are suing the Trump administration to force the release of records detailing whether federal immigration agencies are using sophisticated Israeli spyware to track, monitor, and target immigrants and activists across the country.

The lawsuit, filed on Oct. 30 in federal court by Just Futures Law and the Center for Constitutional Rights, demands that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) comply with Freedom of Information Act requests related to their contracts with tech companies Cellebrite and Paragon Solutions. Both companies have been linked to government surveillance of journalists, human rights defenders, and protesters around the world.

Attorneys say immigrant rights are at urgent risk as the administration escalates arrests, detentions, and protest-related charges under President Donald Trump’s second term.

“The public has the right to know whether and to what extent the U.S. government deploys powerful spyware to infect people’s phones, extract data, and surveil people’s daily communications,” Julie Mao, an attorney at Just Futures Law, said in a press release.

“Like other law enforcement agencies, ICE employs various forms of technology to investigate violations of the law, while appropriately respecting civil liberties and privacy interests,” an ICE spokesperson said in response to a request for comment.

CBP did not respond to Prism’s request for comment.

ICE has worked with Israeli spyware company Cellebrite for more than a decade. The agency currently holds two active contracts totaling $11 million with the company, which markets phone-cracking tools that allow law enforcement to extract data from locked devices, according to the attorneys’ press release. CBP, which also holds at least 20 Cellebrite software licenses, has partnered with the firm since 2008, the press release states.

Spyware from the Israel-based Paragon Solutions, known as Graphite, is considered even more invasive. According to technical researchers, the tool can hack into smartphones, including encrypted messaging apps, without the user’s knowledge. ICE entered into a contract with Paragon in September 2024, but the Biden administration paused the agreement due to national security concerns after issuing an executive order limiting the use of spyware by federal agencies. Trump reversed that decision in August, clearing ICE to resume the contract.

Members of Congress sent a letter last month demanding answers from ICE about its use of Graphite, calling the secrecy surrounding the program “deeply alarming.”

Immigrant communities fear these tools could supercharge longstanding surveillance and criminalization. Advocates say the technologies fit into a broader landscape in which immigrants and their supporters have been increasingly treated as threats to public order. Organizers from Dallas to Los Angeles report that social media posts about protests have drawn ICE attention. Family members have had their devices searched during home raids. Community defense networks believe the government is monitoring WhatsApp chats used to coordinate court support and legal aid.

The level of intrusion remains unclear, which is precisely what the lawsuit seeks to change.

“We should not have to go to federal court to force the government to hand over these records,” Ian Head, manager of the Open Records Project at the Center for Constitutional Rights, said in the press release. “This administration wants to hide its abusive, Orwellian behavior, but we are fighting back.”

Earlier this year, the Canadian digital watchdog group Citizen Lab published a report tracing Paragon spyware deployments targeting political activists and journalists in Italy, Australia, Canada, and Denmark. Rights advocates fear the same tactics are now being adopted within U.S. borders and directed at already-vulnerable groups.

Surveillance researchers say the expansion reflects a deepening trend: Domestic policing agencies are increasingly using military-grade technology developed for foreign intelligence operations.

“In the wake of 9/11, federal agencies provided considerable funding to state and local law enforcement agencies to collect, analyze, share, and deploy a wide range of new data,” researcher Sarah Brayne told the research organization Data & Society. “Increasingly, local law enforcement agencies recognized these data could be useful for their own quotidian surveillance.”

The Texas Catholic Conference of Bishops expressed its solidarity this week with immigrants in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in Texas ahead of the implementation of a federal court order that will impact the immigrants’ legal status.

In a statement released Nov. 4, the Texas bishops called the looming implementation of the court ruling in the case Texas v. United States “unprecedented and disruptive.” The bishops said the ruling’s implementation will target “law-abiding people,” many of whom are “some of the most upstanding individuals” in “our communities.”

In the Texas v. United States case, Texas sued the federal government, claiming that DACA was illegally created without statutory authority, as it was created through executive action rather than legislation passed by Congress.

In January, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals largely upheld the U.S. district court’s declaration that DACA is unlawful but narrowed the scope to Texas, separating deportation protections from work authorization. This means, in theory, that DACA’s core shield against removal could remain available nationwide for current recipients and new applicants, while work permits might be preserved for most — except in Texas.

On Sept. 29, the U.S. Department of Justice proposed how the appellate court’s order should be implemented. According to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), implementation of the district court’s order is expected at some point after Nov. 24.

In their statement, the Texas bishops blamed political “unwillingness” to address immigration reform over the years for the “terribly broken immigration system” that has led to the current situation, which is “fomenting fear [and] severing relationships.”

“The present distress in our country regarding immigration is the result of decades of unwillingness on all sides to enact reasonable and meaningful immigration reform,” the bishops wrote, “reform which respects both national security needs and the human right of each person to work and raise a family in peace.”

“We will continue to work with people of goodwill to encourage compassionate outreach to those in dire predicaments and a humane reform of our terribly broken immigration system,” the bishops wrote.

The Texas bishops noted that they “are pastors of ICE agents and DACA recipients” and said the 5th Circuit’s ruling will “only exacerbate fear and distrust, pit community members against one another, and cause significant economic disruption for many communities.”

The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops’ (USCCB) Department of Migration and Refugee Services also called attention to the ongoing federal court developments expected to affect the program’s beneficiaries in Texas in an advisory at the end of October.

“Anyone eligible for DACA should consider the consequences of moving to or from Texas,” the USCCB update states, pointing out that relocation could trigger revocation of employment authorization with just 15 days’ notice.

For Texas’ approximately 90,000 DACA recipients — the second-largest population after California’s 145,000 — the implications could be stark, according to the U.S. and Texas bishops.

Andrew Arthur, a former immigration judge and a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, told CNA in October that the key takeaway from the USCCB’s update is a “warning” to DACA recipients “who live in Texas.”

Under the looming order, if it is implemented according to the U.S. government’s proposals, DACA recipients who live in Texas could receive “forbearance from removal” (deferred deportation) but lose “lawful presence” status, disqualifying them from work permits and benefits such as in-state tuition or driver’s licenses.

Launched in 2012 through executive action by President Barack Obama, DACA offers work authorization and temporary protection from deportation to undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as minors.

The first Trump administration tried to end the program but was blocked from doing so in 2020 by the U.S. Supreme Court. While President Donald Trump has indicated a willingness to work with Democrats on the status of DACA beneficiaries, the program continues to be subject to litigation, with the latest developments centering on the Texas v. United States case.

(Story continues below)

To be eligible for DACA, applicants must have arrived before age 16, resided continuously since June 15, 2007, and been under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012. There are approximately 530,000 DACA participants nationwide according to KFF, formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation. KFF estimates that up to 1.1 million individuals meet DACA eligibility criteria.

“We want to say unequivocably to all our immigrant sisters and brothers, and in a particular way to those who arrived as children: We have heard your cries.

Conducting limited immigration enforcement activities.","Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson told CBS News Texas he's heard conflicting information about the Immigration and Customs Enforcement 287g program that Dallas Police Chief Daniel Comeaux rejected, along with millions of dollars in federal funding.

In an exclusive interview this week the mayor said, ""I've heard wildly different things about what the program does and how it operates.""

That's why Johnson said he's looking forward to the briefing by ICE and Comeaux that's being held on Thursday morning.

""I want to hear from ICE, and I want to hear from the chief.""

""I want to hear from ICE, and I want to hear from the chief, and I want to understand what exactly it is that we are being asked to do by ICE,"" Johnson said.

The 287g program allows state and local law enforcement to enforce immigration laws under ICE oversight.

What is the 287(g) program?

Since 1996, state and local law enforcement agencies like police departments and sheriff's offices have been able to partner with the Department of Homeland Security to conduct some immigration enforcement duties through a voluntary program called 287(g).

There are three models within 287(g) that departments can cooperate with:

Serving administrative warrants in jails.

Executing civil immigration warrants on behalf of the federal government.

Conducting limited immigration enforcement activities.

Earlier this year, the Texas Legislature passed a law requiring all county sheriff's departments to participate in at least one of the 287(g) models.

ICE asks to meet with Dallas mayor to discuss funding program

The mayor's office said Johnson met with three top officials from ICE's Dallas office back on September 4.

They asked to meet with Johnson to discuss the 287g program in an email dated August 7, in which they said the program, ""Enables ICE to partner with state and local law enforcement agencies to identify and process removable noncitizens encountered during regular law enforcement operations. These partnerships help enhance public safety and promote consistent enforcement of immigration laws, all while respecting local authority and priorities...""

During a community meeting last month, Comeaux announced he turned down ICE's invitation to join the program and $25 million dollars of funding. That's when the mayor called for a council briefing.

""That's a significant amount of money for a police department that is trying to hire more officers, and that could use those resources,"" Johnson said in the interview.

Dallas Police Chief cites concerns about operational change, city safety

Comeaux sent a memo to the city council last Friday explaining why he said no to ICE.

""Implementing this program would reassign officers under federal oversight, which could negatively impact response times and erode the public trust that our department has worked diligently to build,"" the email reads. ""Committing to the 287g program would require an operational change away from the aforementioned goals, making our city less safe...""

In response, Johnson said, ""I would like to understand if it does require an operational shift because I have received communication from ICE. I've seen emails from them that say their whole purpose in expanding this program or at least the resources available to it, is to get more participation without taking local police departments off of their local priorities and their local mission, and without impeding their ability to do their jobs.""

CBS News Texas asked Johnson if he found out that the ICE program would require the police department to focus more on immigration and take officers away from their beats, from working with the community to prevent crimes and respond to them, would he agree with the Chief's decision?

""I think that is the exact right question,"" said Johnson. ""That is exactly the fulcrum of this for me. I would not be supportive of anything that took us away from our mission of reducing violent crime in our city. It's the number one priority of the department. It's my number one priority. I would not support and be in favor of us having our focus taken away from that. If we continue to do what we've been doing, but with $25 million in our pocket of reimbursement, essentially, then I'd be for that.""

Johnson praised Comeaux.

""I want to commend the chief,"" said Johnson.

Suddenly, agents from United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), some wearing balaclavas pulled over their faces, stormed in and arrested one of the teachers. A father who had come to drop off his child captured the scene on video: It shows two ICE agents dragging the screaming woman out of the building, while she insists she has valid papers.

A spokeswoman for the US Department of Homeland Security said ICE agents had not targeted the day care center but had ""attempted to conduct a targeted traffic stop of this female illegal alien from Colombia.""

The video, which has been shared on various social networks and picked up by various US media outlets, has sparked nationwide outrage. Local Chicago politician Matt Martin told the US broadcaster NBC that it was ""some of the most chilling video footage I have seen certainly in my time in office. We had agents with guns who were walking around the facility with teachers inside, with children inside.""

3,000 arrests in Chicago since September

This raid was part of a huge crackdown on immigration in Chicago that began in September. Since then there have been more than 3,000 arrests according to the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Since taking office in January 2025, US President Donald Trump has tightened immigration policy, clamping down on immigrants without valid papers and deporting those accused of being ""criminal aliens."" ICE agents have faced criticism for their aggressive tactics and the lack of transparency.

Many of those arrested are US citizens without a criminal record. There have been several raids on schools, retirement homes and other public institutions. There are countless videos circulating on social media platforms showing ICE agents, who are often camouflaged and armed, conducting arrests in a ruthless manner.

One video reportedly shows ICE agents in an unmarked car ramming another car, dragging out the driver and arresting her. Other videos show people out on the street being surrounded by agents and led away to vehicles and driven off. Agents have also been using tear gas. The NGO Human Rights Watch has reported that car windows have been smashed to drag people out of their cars. There have also been chases when people flee the agents in panic.

According to Human Rights Watch, there are also rights violations taking place in detention centers. The organization has documented several cases of agents putting undue pressure on people to agree to ""voluntary departure."" People under arrest have been tied up and forced to sleep on the floor; others have reportedly been denied food and water. People have also been prevented from contacting their families and/ or lawyers.

A review by the US broadcaster NPR found that at least 20 people had died in ICE custody this year already, the deadliest number in 20 years. The total number of people in immigration detention has also reached a new high of around 60,000.

'ICE is out of control'

""ICE is out of control,"" said Illinois Congresswoman Delia Ramirez in a press release. ""ICE is operating with impunity outside the confines of the law. ICE is trampling our rights. ICE is terrorizing our communities.""

She said this was ""what happens when Trump, Republicans and DHS leadership give ICE unlimited money, freedom from oversight, and a pass on transparency and accountability.""

In September, the Supreme Court effectively legalized racial profiling by removing restrictions and granting federal agents the power to detain people on the basis of skin color, language or employment.

President Trump defends ICE raids

President Trump has rejected all criticism and recently defended the raids, telling CBS news that he thought that the ICE agents ""haven't gone far enough."" According to the US news organization The Intercept, the immigration authorities are currently considering whether to offer ""monetary bonuses"" to bounty hunters for tracking down immigrants and reporting them to ICE.

This summer, the US president set aside around $170 billion (€147 billion) for immigration enforcement over the next four years as part of his ""big beautiful"" budget bill. This will make ICE the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency in US history, according to Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council. He told Jacobin magazine in July that ICE's budget would be ""slightly larger than the budgets of the FBI, [Drug Enforcement Administration], [Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives], Bureau of Prisons, and US Marshals Service combined.""

This bill aims to fast-track key parts of the earlier Bill C-2, which had already faced strong criticism for undermining refugee protections. If passed, Bill C-12 would block people who have lived in Canada for more than a year from making a fair refugee claim. It would also give the government broad powers to cancel immigration documents without proper review or due process.

These changes would strip away vital protections and could lead Canada to break its commitments under international human rights law.

Here’s what you can do:

Write to Prime Minister Carney urging him to:

Withdraw Bills C-2 and C-12 and instead uphold Canada’s long-standing commitments to dignity, protection, and justice.

From Bill C-2 to Bill C-12

In June 2025, the Canadian government introduced Bill C-2, misleadingly titled the Strong Borders Act. The bill proposed sweeping changes to laws governing border security, immigration, asylum, customs, and law enforcement.

Critics, including opposition parties, raised serious concerns about expanded data sharing and violations of privacy rights for Canadians. In response, the government introduced a new bill in October 2025 (Bill C-12) aimed at fast-tracking the parts of Bill C-2 that deal with refugees and immigration. Despite this move, Bill C-2 continues to move through Parliament.

What Bill C-12 would do

If passed, Bill C-12 would:

Deny fair hearings to many refugee claimants. People who make a claim more than one year after arriving in Canada would be barred from having their cases heard by the Immigration and Refugee Board, even if conditions in their home countries worsened after their arrival.

Punish people forced to cross between ports of entry. Those who enter Canada irregularly and apply for protection more than 14 days later would also lose access to a fair refugee process. Many people are forced to cross this way because of the Safe Third Country Agreement.

Push people into a weaker system. Instead of fair refugee hearings, they would face a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) process. This system does not guarantee an oral hearing, independent decision makers, an appeals process, or automatic protection from deportation while a case is being reviewed. As a result, people could be sent back to countries where their lives are in danger.

Grant excessive powers to cancel documents. The bill would allow the federal government to revoke valid immigration documents, such as permanent residence visas or work and study permits, based only on vague claims of “public interest,” without fair process or individual assessment.

Why these changes are dangerous

Every person has the right to seek asylum from persecution and serious human rights violations. People also have the right not to be returned to a place where they could face torture, cruel treatment, or other life-threatening harm. This principle, known as non-refoulement, is a core part of international human rights, refugee, and humanitarian law.

Bill C-12 threatens these rights by denying people a fair chance to seek protection and increasing the risk of deportation to unsafe countries.

Canada must protect, not punish

At a time when many countries are adopting harsh policies that criminalize and stigmatize people seeking safety, Canada must choose a different path. The government must uphold its international human rights obligations, protect people seeking refuge, and withdraw Bill C-12 immediately.",https://amnesty.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/BILL-C-2-UA-CANVA.png,N,,2025-11-06 15:17:08.152387

He said it publicly, he said it privately, but it was also a time when Palantir, because of its work with ICE, was being subjected to protests.
He thought Palantir was being unfairly singled out by activists, when other tech companies were working with ICE as well.
And how you answer that question will determine how you feel about the work that Palantir is doing.
This time around, he’s making no apologies for the work with ICE.","Karp, who has a PhD in neoclassical social theory, has long identified as a socialist and progressive. But over the course of the last decade, Karp has become an increasingly vocal supporter of Donald Trump and the right, expressing skepticism of immigration, support for unfettered AI development and a distaste for left-leaning protesters.

This transformation, which I called Steinberger to discuss, is particularly notable given the company Karp oversees. Palantir compiles and synthesizes vast amounts of data. The company has become hotly controversial under Trump because it has worked with U.S. agencies, including ICE, in their effort to expand their surveillance capabilities.

Karp’s Trumpy shift is hardly unique in Silicon Valley these days, but his politics remain idiosyncratic, and Steinberger thinks his evolution is about more than just flattering whichever political party is in power. All of that makes Karp and Palantir an interesting case study for understanding the roots of the MAGA drift in Big Tech, and whether it has limits.

“Karp is not going to say publicly where the red lines are,” Steinberger said. “But the thing that I think it’s fair to ask is, is there anything that could happen that would cause Karp to reconsider his work with ICE, or that even has implications on his broader work with the government?”

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

You reported this book for six years. How would you describe Alex Karp’s political evolution in that time?

When I first began talking to him in 2019, he identified as progressive, as a supporter of the Democrats. In six years of ongoing conversation, I would say he has drifted away from the Democrats and the left. I think he would say that the left left him, but clearly his politics have shifted.

During the first Trump presidency, he made very clear that he was not a fan of Donald Trump. He said it publicly, he said it privately, but it was also a time when Palantir, because of its work with ICE, was being subjected to protests. He was quite angry about that. He thought Palantir was being unfairly singled out by activists, when other tech companies were working with ICE as well. And he also felt that Trump had won in large part because of immigration, and the point he made to me and others back in 2019 and before then, was: People don’t like illegal immigration, and Democrats and progressives don’t take their concerns seriously. They will turn to people who do take their concerns seriously, and that’s why Trump was elected. So already, you can see a falling out with the left.

He also thought that what he saw as the left’s fixation with identity politics was toxic. He thought that was very harmful for Democrats politically and harmful for the country. So that was another point of departure for him. And then I think October 7 kind of cemented his break with the Democrats and the left. Even though he wrote checks to Joe Biden in 2024 and he was willing to continue to support Biden, his sense was that the left was not just expressing anti-Zionist views, but was indulging antisemitism.

Do you doubt anything about the story that Karp tells himself about his political evolution?

I think he was a self-styled progressive. He defined progressive as he wanted to define it. He had views that I think were fairly characterized as progressive, and still does. He has spoken directly about the problem of economic inequality in this country, which other billionaires are not as willing to acknowledge. I think he is still supportive of the idea of universal health care.

But even 10 years ago, there were ways in which he deviated from a progressive orthodoxy.

He was against affirmative action. He is a Second Amendment enthusiast. Even then, he had heterodox views. It would be much harder now for him to to plausibly claim that he’s a progressive, and I think he’s largely gone silent about that. And still, even though he’s not calling himself a conservative, he spends a lot of his time beating up on the left, in a way that suggests that in his mind, there has been a divorce [between him and the left].

It seems like Karp’s politics — though they have shifted right in a similar way — actually are more idiosyncratic than your average Silicon Valley founder’s. How is his political evolution different from his peers’?

I think you hit upon an important point. With some of these guys, certainly in this current moment, the cravenness drips off of them like sweat. Karp is a little different, which probably is connected to his background. He’s trained in the humanities. He’s a credentialed scholar. He holds a PhD. He knows history, he knows politics. His views are subtle in many cases. They’re well informed in a way that I think is not necessarily apparent in other tech executives who comment a lot about our politics and whose politics seem to have evolved.

Part of what is interesting about Karp in this moment is that — look, he went to Germany [for his PhD] in part because he wanted to understand why Germany, this pillar of civilization, descended into such barbarism [during the Third Reich]. That’s a very personal thing. His family had been affected by the Holocaust. But he also wanted to understand at an intellectual level why this happened. He does his dissertation on what effectively amounts to the rhetoric of fascism. He can talk about this stuff with some expertise and fluency that other people can’t, and so it makes him a much more interesting figure than some of these tech bros, if you will.

I think he knows that some of the rhetoric we’ve heard in recent years has unfortunate historical analogues. He knows this. He knows this in part because he studied the rhetoric of fascism. Now, he doesn’t believe that this rhetoric is leading to the same outcome here. That’s his view. And some people will agree with him, some people will disagree, but his training, his background, makes him certainly a much more interesting figure than a lot of these other guys, and maybe even more of a lightning rod than some others.

It seems like there’s a European flavor to a lot of his politics.

Yeah. I mean, for instance, he’s always dumping on the Democrats. I said to him years ago, “All you ever do is dump on the Democrats. I never hear any similar critique of the right.” He said, “Well, it’s a sort of a German thing where you just interrogate your own ideas.” You beat the crap out of your own side, your own ideas. You interrogate them relentlessly. So, he does have a sort of European sensibility.

Does Palantir’s increased work with the government on these potential surveillance programs concern you?

Karp says I suffer from TDS — Trump Derangement Syndrome — which is his way of saying, “I don’t really want to talk about the aspects of Trump that you want to talk about.” He wants to talk about the stuff that he likes, the policies that he approves of. He doesn’t want to talk about this other stuff. I think he would also say, in a more serious vein, that he thinks concerns are overblown. He believes that judicial independence is being upheld, that the courts are, as they did in the first Trump presidency, providing an obstacle for this administration. I think, though, it has to be recognized that Palantir is a very powerful technology.

There are a lot of misconceptions about Palantir. It is important to recognize that they do not collect data, they do not store data and they definitely don’t sell data. It is software that enables organizations to make better use of their own data. So, it’s important to understand that about Palantir, and at the same time, it also has to be recognized that at the end of the day, it’s the end user who determines how rigorously or not to use safety controls built into the platform. And so that’s always been the risk, and that’s a risk on the corporate side and it’s a risk on the government side.

I would say, though, that you know, in the context of the current moment, the question really isn’t do you trust Alex Karp and Palantir with your data? The question is, do you trust Donald Trump and Stephen Miller with your data? And how you answer that question will determine how you feel about the work that Palantir is doing.

In the book, you describe the internal dissent in the company with regard to working with ICE. How do you square many of Karp’s comments over the years about concern with Trump with some of the work that Palantir is doing, which often includes working directly with ICE?

In the first Trump presidency, Karp made very clear that he wasn’t enthusiastic about Trump’s immigration policy. He said that personally he was not in favor of illegal immigration, he thought it was a problem, he thought enforcement on the border was a problem. But he told me in 2019, “I am perfectly fine with the demographics of this country changing, and I don’t agree with Trump on many things. And his immigration policy is one of them.”

At the time, Palantir made the point that they were working with a branch of ICE that was not rounding up people. That explanation fell apart when it turned out that branch had been involved in some of the raids in the first Trump presidency.

Karp’s stated position on immigration put him at odds with Trump and at odds with his Palantir co-founder and longtime friend Peter Thiel. But Karp still said that Palantir had a contract with ICE, and they had duties to fulfill that contract, even if he didn’t personally agree with the policy. His point was that you can’t just pick and choose what work you’re willing to do based on whether you like the president or not, and that to have walked away from the work with ICE, to have terminated the contract, would have been Palantir effectively exercising a veto over the American voter, and he wasn’t willing to do that.

This time around, he’s making no apologies for the work with ICE. He told me he believes most voters determined that they want the demographics of the country to basically remain the same.

He was fine with internal protests in the first Trump administration at Palantir, because the company has always had a lot of in-house debate, and that’s something Karp thinks has been critical to their success. In the second Trump administration, that criticism has been a bit more muted, in part because the job market is worse. That’s an internal check on dissent, because it’s not so easy to go somewhere else if you’re unhappy with the direction of the company.

You write in your book about how Palantir has designs on becoming the operating system of the U.S. government. What would that require?

Palantir spent years trying to break in with the military. They ended up having to sue the Army in 2016 for the right to bid on a battlefield intelligence program for the military. They won that battle, and that opened the floodgates to becoming a major defense contractor. Now, they’re getting lots of contracts still, but the Pentagon is, if anything, thinking they might have too many Palantir contracts — that they need to spread things out.

I think part of the reason that Karp is on board with Trump is that he sees a huge opportunity here. Palantir’s software is already widely used, obviously on the military side, but [the Trump administration] is an opportunity to become even more deeply entrenched. I think that was certainly part of the motivation for getting involved with DOGE — Palantir helped build products for the IRS and a database to surveil and track immigrants — as they did.

But the risks here are, they are working in areas that right now are causing a lot of concern — the work with ICE and where things are going on that front. So, I don’t know that there are roadblocks so much as there are concerns about where policy is going and how policy is being enforced. Their work is already controversial, but could become even more so.

Karp is not going to say publicly where the red lines are. But the thing that I think it’s fair to ask is, is there anything that could happen that would cause Karp to reconsider his work with ICE, or that even has implications on the broader work with the government?

As Silicon Valley embraces its libertarian roots, is there some concern about Palantir from that political orientation as well?

I think certainly, if you’re a true libertarian, you would not like the idea of the government merging all these data silos, creating something approximating a master database of personal information on all Americans. And as a number of people have said, as DOGE was ransacking the federal bureaucracy [and using Palantir software to help do so], it was gaining access to data that it wasn’t authorized to have. You had people who worked in government for years saying, “Look, this stuff was kept segregated, not because we wanted government to operate less efficiently, but because it was understood that the government has a lot of information on Americans and can’t always assume that every person working in government is a good actor.” Information was kept siloed for a very deliberate reason to make it harder for bad actors to do bad things.

The argument you hear from Palantir and others is that this is all just work to make the government more efficient. They don’t want to talk about this in the context of Trump’s presidency, but I don’t see how you can not talk about it in the context of Trump’s presidency. He ran for the presidency in 2024 in large part on a vow to gain retribution against his enemies. And I think there are legitimate concerns that the data may be misused as part of his agenda. I think many people would say he’s weaponizing the government against his opponents. I mean, you had Stephen Miller after Charlie Kirk’s assassination saying that they’re going to go after progressive organizations like they are domestic terrorists. Is Palantir going to be used for that?

You can’t ignore the fact that Trump has made it very clear that he wants to weaponize the government against his enemies. And data can help do that.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F37%2Fa1%2Fd033586142029f8003c1a7be286f%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2212776473,N,,2025-11-06 16:02:31.636598

About 700,000 federal employees are furloughed without pay, and about 700,000 additional federal workers have been working without pay through the shutdown.
Denial of back pay has been a threat repeatedly made by the Trump administration during the shutdown, along with firings during the shutdown, which were blocked in a federal court.
“Federal workers serve the people.
President Trump wants the government reopen – the Democrats can choose to reopen it at any point, and they should do so immediately.”","As the US federal shutdown enters its second month, government workers are accusing the Trump administration of being “out of control” and bullying people who are “simply trying to do their best”.

The shutdown surpassed 35 days this week, beating the previous record set under Donald Trump’s first presidential term. About 700,000 federal employees are furloughed without pay, and about 700,000 additional federal workers have been working without pay through the shutdown.

Affected workers say the shutdown has been a continuation of attacks they have experienced under the Trump administration, from mass firings – many of which have been overturned or blocked in federal courts – to drastic budget cuts, pushes to take early retirements or resignation buyouts, and threats of withholding back pay for workers furloughed during the shutdown.

“It’s already been a chaotic year,” said Micah Niemeier-Walsh, American Federation of Federal Government Employees (AFGE) local 3840 vice president, who works at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (Niosh). She was initially fired along with most employees at the agency, but reinstated in May after political pressure to overturn the firings and a court intervened to block most of the firings.

“For many agencies, like the one that I am employed by, we’ve been effectively shut down for many months already because of the reductions in force that have already happened, and all of the attacks that we’ve been seeing on the federal workforce,” said Niemeier-Walsh.

“It’s become out of control, and I really hope that this shutdown is a wake-up call of how bad things have gotten.”

In November, furloughed government employees received furlough extension notices, although many notices did not contain assurances they would receive back pay once the government reopens. Denial of back pay has been a threat repeatedly made by the Trump administration during the shutdown, along with firings during the shutdown, which were blocked in a federal court.

“I have never, ever, ever, ever, ever thought that we would have our government attacking government employees,” said Omar Algeciras, who works at the Department of Labor. “ I think this is the epitome of harassment, bullying and attacks on people that are simply trying to do their best to provide a service or services to American workers.”

The Trump administration’s treatment of federal workers and their unions has put significant pressure and mental health burdens on federal workers who provide services to the American public, said Algeciras, vice-president of AFGE Local 2391.

“This is unprecedented, it’s unnecessary and I really do think that it’s very disheartening and saddening to see and to have to talk to some of our members and remind them that they need to take a moment for themselves, not to focus on what’s being said,” added Algeciras. “We’re having to take care of our union members, we’re having to take care of our co-workers, because it’s not coming from the top down any more.”

The AFGE has called for an end to the government shutdown, avoiding assigning blame to Republicans or Democrats for the shutdown and its prolongation.

As the stalemate to end the government shutdown continues into November, Trump has affirmed he has no plans to negotiate with Democrats, with the shutdown adding to the stress and anxieties federal employees have already endured under the administration’s efforts to cull their workforce.

Russell Vought, the White House office of management and budget director, said before the administration took office he wanted to put federal workers “in trauma” and for them to be viewed as “villains”, and he has attempted to use the shutdown to further those efforts.

“For myself and my members, they’ve been going through this chaos and stress and anxiety since February of, from one day to the next, not knowing if they’re going to have a job,” said Tandy Zitkus, AFGE Local 898 president and a furloughed worker at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Osha).

“Since February, there’s been a constant threat every day when you get up and go to work, and it’s unfortunately nothing new. It’s become a norm for the federal worker.”

Workers have been forced to budget as best they can around missed paychecks, from filing for unemployment and waiting on those benefits, deciding whether to visit food banks and requesting deferments on bills, said Zitkus.

“It’s overwhelming. It’s hard to stay positive,” Zitkus said. “Federal workers serve the people. They’re not politicians, and so there’s a lot of frustration being expressed to me by my members of: why is this going on, why is there a political fight going on that affects us? We’re civil servants, and we serve the American people, and we want to be able to continue to do that and be paid.”

Abigail Jackson, the White House deputy secretary, placed the shutdown blame solely on Democrats and repeated the misleading claim that Democrats are pushing for healthcare for undocumented immigrants.

“The only reason the government was shut down at all, let alone for this long, is because the Democrats decided to hold the American people hostage to push their radical, far-left policy agenda of free healthcare for illegal aliens,” Jackson said in a statement.

“American families have missed paychecks and benefits because of the Democrats’ irresponsible behavior. President Trump wants the government reopen – the Democrats can choose to reopen it at any point, and they should do so immediately.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9245167ef9eb1c353374f58b4a4e71dcf04293c4/30_0_2500_2001/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e4abe6b9a453c66ac60cc83864f85afb",N,,2025-11-06 14:01:24.311364

“History made: the lowest border crossings in October history and the sixth straight month of ZERO releases. This is most secure border ever,” said Secretary Kristi Noem. “Thank you, President Trump and our brave DHS law enforcement. You make America proud!”

“Our mission is simple: secure the border and safeguard this nation,” said CBP Commissioner Rodney Scott, “and that’s exactly what we are doing. No excuses. No politics. Just results delivered by the most dedicated law-enforcement professionals in the country. We’re not easing up — we’re pushing even harder.”

Standout Stats

Lowest October in CBP History

30,561 total encounters nationwide — the lowest start to a fiscal year ever recorded by CBP.

29% lower than the previous record low (43,010 in October FY2012)

79% lower than October 2024

Six Straight Months of Zero Releases

For the sixth consecutive month, U.S. Border Patrol released zero illegal aliens into the United States. Every individual apprehended was processed according to law — a milestone unmatched in modern border history.

Nine Months Under President Trump Sees Less Encounters Than One Month Under Biden

Since Jan. 21 through the end of October, there have been 106,134 total enforcement encounters along the Southwest Border — less than the Biden Administration’s monthly average of 155,485 encounters.

Daily Average Apprehensions on the Southwest Border

258 per day — less than 11 per hour

95% lower than the daily average under the last administration (5,110/day, Feb 2021–Dec 2024)

In October 2024, 312 aliens were apprehended every four hours — today, that’s one day’s worth of apprehensions.

Historic Control and Consistency

USBP nationwide apprehensions have averaged under 10,000 per month since President Trump took office — a level of sustained deterrence not seen in modern times.

This October: 9,845 apprehensions, 62% below the previous October low (26,039 in FY2018)

Eddington,,,,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/ice-cbp-border-patrol-facial-recognition-tech-immigrants-rcna241020,"According to stunning reporting by Joseph Cox at 404 Media, federal agents appear to be roaming around Chicago using mobile facial recognition technology, or FRT, on people to determine whether they should be deported.

Based on 404 Media’s review of videos, it appears that agents from ICE and CBP were utilizing the technology at least as early as February 2025 in New Mexico.

An involuntary FRT scan and possible detention at the hands of ICE or other DHS agents is a very real and frightening possibility.","According to stunning reporting by Joseph Cox at 404 Media, federal agents appear to be roaming around Chicago using mobile facial recognition technology, or FRT, on people to determine whether they should be deported.

And according to internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, emails viewed by 404 Media, ICE has been using the Mobile Fortify app, which “can identify someone based on their fingerprints or face by simply pointing a smartphone camera at them.” A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection confirmed its use of Mobile Fortify to 404 Media, saying, “This is one of many tools we are using as we enforce the laws of our nation.” A DHS spokesperson told MSNBC, ""While the Department does not discuss specific vendors or operational tools, any technology used by DHS Components must comply with the requirements and oversight framework.""

The implications of DHS’ use of facial recognition technology go far beyond the realm of immigration enforcement.

Based on 404 Media’s review of videos, it appears that agents from ICE and CBP were utilizing the technology at least as early as February 2025 in New Mexico. But agents reportedly employed the technology in Chicago on young people riding bikes, and also on an adult driver who explicitly declared their U.S. citizenship to agents. Nonetheless, the video shows agents demanding that the driver submit to an FRT scan to verify their citizenship status.

The incidents out of Chicago should shake the American conscience. But they should also serve as a warning that, if left unchecked, immigration enforcement’s use of this technology could potentially trigger a constitutional crisis.

In one of the most controversial Supreme Court “shadow docket” decisions this year, by a 6-3 majority in Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo, the justices stayed a lower court ban on immigration enforcement stops based on a person’s presence “at particular locations such as bus stops, car washes, day laborer pickup sites, agricultural sites, and the like; (ii) the type of work one does; (iii) speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent; and (iv) apparent race or ethnicity.” Thus, while the Vasquez Perdomo case remains on appeal at the Ninth Circuit, the high court’s majority is permitting ICE to use race and the other factors above in making immigration-related stops or even raids.

And contrary to Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s assertion in his concurring opinion that “If the officers learn that the individual they stopped is a U.S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States, they promptly let the individual go,” that clearly has not happened in at least 170 cases in which U.S. citizens were detained by ICE thus far in 2025. Many of them said they were physically abused, as reported this month by ProPublica.

If you’re in the vicinity of ICE operations and you don’t look like you’re of European ancestry, you could be a potential target. Speaking Spanish in public even as a U.S. citizen? An involuntary FRT scan and possible detention at the hands of ICE or other DHS agents is a very real and frightening possibility.

Nothing in the Immigration and Nationality Act permits ICE to conduct involuntary FRT scans — but neither does the statute prohibit it. In fact, there’s no federal legislation governing FRT use at all at this point, despite the fact that there are documented cases of FRT-based false arrest cases from 2020, 2023 and 2024. The lack of federal legal restraints on FRT use is being exploited by ICE and its fellow federal law enforcement agencies, to the detriment of the constitutional rights of those they target.

In the air travel context, Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley’s Traveler Privacy Protection Act would, if enacted, impose meaningful FRT constraints on the Transportation Security Administration, or TSA. What’s required more broadly is a federal ban on the use of FRT technology absent express congressional authorization and only in circumstances in which a particular person is being sought in connection with a violent crime. In no case should an arrest be made solely on the basis of an allegedly positive FRT result.

However, the implications of DHS’ use of FRT — backed up by reams of personal and public information on tens of millions of Americans — go far beyond the realm of immigration enforcement.

An involuntary FRT scan and possible detention at the hands of ICE or other DHS agents is a very real and frightening possibility.

Earlier this year and in the name of “immigration enforcement,” Trump’s Justice Department demanded voter roll data from several states, escalating to lawsuits to obtain the information. Just last week, the department upped the ante, announcing it would send election monitors to New Jersey and California in November, despite the fact that there is no obvious legal justification for doing so.

In theory, there is no constitutional, statutory or case law basis for Justice Department election monitors to demand that a voter submit to FRT to verify their identity and citizenship status prior to casting a vote in a federal election. However, given the administration’s penchant for testing constitutional boundaries, state and local election officials would be unwise to ignore the possibility.

Consider the following scenario: Trump’s Justice Department could attempt to employ FRT or other forms of voter verification protocols outside of polling places, asserting the need to prevent voter fraud by illegal immigrants or others allegedly ineligible to vote. State and local officials could refuse to allow federal monitors near polling places if they attempted to employ such measures. But that could trigger Trump to claim voter fraud was being perpetrated — and all because his monitors were prevented from stopping illegal immigrants or others ineligible from casting ballots. This would be especially politically explosive in areas where House races are decided by razor-thin margins and recounts take place.

The legal battle to decide the constitutionality — or lack thereof — of Trump’s actions would likely be won by state and local officials, but if enough House races were called into question, it could lead to a House election certification fight similar to the presidential election certification battle of 2020-21 —and thus another constitutional crisis.

States could prevent this scenario by banning FRT use on any state or local property and within one mile of a polling location. They should do so now, while they still have time.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-11/251103-ice-facial-recognition-es-21ac23.jpg",N,,2025-11-06 17:18:24.404556

President Donald Trump’s administration kicked off an initiative in February to find and deport unaccompanied children, an unprecedented push to track down minors who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally without a parent or guardian.

The Trump administration has since taken other steps to increase enforcement, including an attempt to deport dozens of Guatemalan children despite them having active U.S. immigration cases.

At the same time, the Republican administration has greatly expanded partnerships with state and local authorities to ramp up immigration arrests under a program known as 287(g). The number of state and local agencies participating in the program has risen from 135 just before Trump took office to more than 1,100, according to ICE data.

Critics have said the partnerships can erode trust in immigrant communities and make people less likely to report crimes.

Congress has not authorized military force against Venezuela.
Tomorrow, on a bipartisan basis, we will force a vote to block an unauthorized war against Venezuela.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Tim Kaine (D-VA), Rand Paul (R-KY), and Adam Schiff (D-CA) announced the Senate will vote tomorrow on their bipartisan war powers resolution that would block the use of the U.S. Armed Forces to engage in hostilities within or against Venezuela, unless that action has been authorized by Congress. This follows reporting that the Trump Administration is considering land strikes inside the country.

“There is no authorization for the use of military force that gives President Trump the authority to launch military strikes in Venezuela. And instead of working with Congress, the Trump Administration has left us in the dark about the ongoing operations and large-scale buildup of military assets in the region. It has not shared any information with the American people about what the fallout could be from this potential conflict,” said Kaine, a member of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees. “We shouldn’t be sending our sons and daughters into harm’s way with incomplete information, and without a robust debate in front of the American people. When the Senate votes on our bipartisan legislation to stop the Trump Administration from waging an unauthorized war against Venezuela, I urge my colleagues to join us in reclaiming our constitutional obligation and saying no to war without a vote from Congress.”

“The Coast Guard doesn’t blow up boats off Miami because 25 percent of the time their suspicion is wrong. Venezuela is no different. These are small outboards with no fentanyl and no path to Florida. To kill indiscriminately is akin to summary execution! Everyone should get a trial because sometimes the system gets it wrong. Even the worst of the worst in our country get due process. The bottom line is that execution without process is not justice, and blowing up foreign ships is a recipe for chaos,” said Dr. Paul.

“The Trump administration has made it clear that they may launch military action against land targets inside Venezuela’s borders, escalating from the boat strikes in the Caribbean and Pacific. In recent weeks we have seen increasingly concerning movement of military assets and reporting that undermines any claim that this is merely about stopping drug smugglers. Congress has not authorized military force against Venezuela. Tomorrow, on a bipartisan basis, we will force a vote to block an unauthorized war against Venezuela. We must assert our Constitutional authority over the use of force before the United States becomes entangled in yet another conflict, this time in South America,” said Schiff.

Kaine and Schiff introduced a similar measure focused on repeated strikes in the southern Caribbean Sea that the Trump Administration has carried out without congressional authorization, killing dozens of unknown individuals. The legislation did not gain enough Republican support to pass.

""There's been a large uptick in the number of individuals who are being detained when they're attending their criminal cases,"" Fresno-based immigration attorney George Rios told Action News.

He says ICE recently detained two of his own clients. They were undocumented criminal defendants out on bail for offenses against state law.

Rios says they were each going to court to right their wrong.

""You're trying to do things the right way, you're trying to comply with everything, you were showing up to court,"" Rios said, ""but that opportunity is cut out from under you.""

RELATED: Family members demand release of loved ones detained by ICE in Fresno

Action News has witnessed some of the courthouse detainments. In July, we were on the third floor when a criminal defendant was put into handcuffs by two federal agents in plain clothes, and then taken down the staircase.

Later that day, the man's public defender confirmed in court, on the record, that who Action News saw were, in fact, federal immigration enforcement officers.

With the defendant no longer present in court, the judge issued a warrant for his arrest.

""That's what they're required to do, and it's really sad and it's really frustrating,"" Rios told Action News.

The local warrant issued by the county judge can cause major issues for an undocumented defendant who would have otherwise been eligible to return to the United States.

""If he then tries to come back, and that bench warrant is still open, that can cause problems, and that can definitely delay things,"" Rios said.

Action News reached out to Immigration and Customs Enforcement last week.

We asked about the detainments, the prevalence and the scope of the enforcement. We also wanted to know if ICE is using the public court calendar to identify defendants.

Action News never heard back from ICE, but Republicans, like Congressman Tom McClintock in the North Valley, have long said immigration laws must be enforced.

""Let's be very clear that illegally crossing the border is a federal crime. That's why we call it illegal immigration,"" Rep. McClintock told Action News in February. ""So everyone who's done that is a criminal.""

The apparent enforcement at the courthouse is now causing fear and confusion.

“They ran into a daycare and attempted to barricade themselves inside the day care — recklessly endangering the children inside,” McLaughlin said.

He called his agents “sanctuary busters,” a swipe at so-called sanctuary cities, like Chicago, that limit cooperation with immigration authorities.","CHICAGO (AP) — An employee of a Chicago day care center and preschool was detained by immigration agents at work as children were being dropped off Wednesday, according to witnesses, reflecting the Trump administration’s increasingly aggressive enforcement tactics.

The employee ran from a vehicle into the Rayito de Sol Spanish Immersion Early Learning Center after officers pulled into the parking lot right after her, Alderman Matt Martin said, citing witness accounts. The employee was detained at the entry while telling authorities she has papers, he said. Authorities went inside to question several people around 7 a.m., when the facility opened, according to witnesses.

It was unusual even under “Operation Midway Blitz,” which has resulted in more than 3,000 immigration arrests in the Chicago area since early September. Agents have rappelled from a Black Hawk helicopter in a middle-of-the-night apartment building raid, appeared with overwhelming force in recreational areas and launched tear gas amid protests.

Several officers wore clothing Wednesday that read “POLICE ICE,” identifying them as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, according to Martin. Video circulating online showed at least one officer in a vest that said “ICE” as the woman was restrained and taken away.

The U.S. Homeland Security Department said the woman, from Colombia, entered the United States illegally in June 2023 and obtained authorization to work under the Biden administration. Her 16- and 17-year-old children crossed the border illegally last month near El Paso, Texas, and were brought to a government shelter in Chicago for unaccompanied migrant children.

Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland Security spokesperson, denied that the day care center was targeted. She said the driver of a vehicle registered to the woman and transporting her to the day care center ignored law enforcement sirens and emergency lights when authorities tried pulling them over.

“They ran into a daycare and attempted to barricade themselves inside the day care — recklessly endangering the children inside,” McLaughlin said.

Rayito de Sol, which operates eight locations in Illinois and Minnesota, did not respond to a request for comment. Following the incident, its school on the north side of Chicago closed for the day.

Parents gathered outside the preschool looking angered and dismayed.

Esmeralda Rosales, whose husband dropped off their 9-month-old child, rushed from work to show support for the staff. She said the woman detained was her child’s teacher.

“These are the nicest, kindest people. They don’t deserve, these children don’t deserve to be living through this,” she said.

Chris Widen, whose 4-month-old also is taught by the woman detained, said the operation came “at the school during the busiest time of drop-off where kids and families have to witness a teacher being forcibly removed and agents kitted up in tactical gear.”

Adam Gonzalez was dropping off his child when he saw people yelling and federal immigration officers in body armor outside the school. Something didn’t feel right to him, he said, so he began recording the worker’s detention.

“The world needs to see what’s happening, that this is not fake, that this is real,” Gonzalez said.

“In Chicago, it seems like you’re only one or two degrees of separation from someone who’s had an ICE experience at this point,” said Rayito parent Jason Wirth, who was on the way to drop off his child.

Immigration authorities have in recent months provoked an outcry for operating near schools, especially during the hectic hours of dropping off or picking up children.

In July, agents confronted a man in the parking lot of his child’s preschool in a suburb of Portland, Oregon, with many preschoolers looking on. In Los Angeles, agents handcuffed a disabled teen outside a high school campus, later releasing him when they discovered they had the wrong person. In Chicago, agents last month released tear gas that engulfed an elementary school playground where children had been playing.

Gregory Bovino, a senior Border Patrol official who has become a face of the immigration crackdown in Los Angeles and Chicago, has staunchly defended the administration’s tactics in the face of threats and protests.

“I didn’t have any reason to think it would be this bad, but it’s far worse than I ever thought,” he said in an interview Monday. He called his agents “sanctuary busters,” a swipe at so-called sanctuary cities, like Chicago, that limit cooperation with immigration authorities.

This story has been corrected to show Matt Martin said the woman told authorities she has “papers,” not that she was a U.S. citizen, and fixes Chris Widen’s quote to show agents wore “tactical gear,” not “practical gear.”

Big picture view: The incident adds tension to already fraught relations between Chicago and federal immigration authorities.","A daycare arrest in Chicago has drawn outrage from city leaders, parents, and witnesses after federal immigration agents detained a teacher in front of children.

What we know:

Mayor Brandon Johnson opened his Thursday media briefing with sharp criticism of the incident, which took place Wednesday morning at Rayito de Sol Spanish Immersion Early Learning Center in the North Center neighborhood.

""ICE agents entered a daycare. They went inside of a preschool. They tore a teacher out of a classroom in front of their children,"" Johnson said. ""That video shocked the conscience of every single Chicagoan… We most certainly cannot have this in our city or our country.""

Johnson accused federal agents of having ""acted with impunity"" and said the city would pursue all possible measures to hold them accountable.

The backstory:

Video circulating online shows agents detaining the teacher, identified by her attorney as a legally authorized asylum seeker, outside the daycare around 7 a.m.

Witness Adam Gonzalez said he saw the arrest as he dropped off his son.

""This is a daycare… to just take a preschool teacher who pours herself into these children, it’s just not right,"" he said.

U.S. Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Chicago) said agents followed the teacher into the daycare and detained her in front of children, ""causing panic and fear,"" without presenting a warrant.

""This is a parent's worst nightmare,"" Quigley said. ""You drop your kids off at daycare or school every day and assume they're gonna be safe. This is a violation of public trust and should send shivers down the spine of every parent.""

The other side:

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson denied the daycare was targeted and said the incident began when agents were conducting a traffic stop.

According to DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin, agents with their sirens and lights activated tried to stop the car that the teacher was a passenger in, but the male driver refused to pull over. Both occupants allegedly ran into the daycare and tried to barricade themselves inside, ""recklessly endangering the children.""

McLaughlin said the woman was arrested inside a vestibule, not the school, and that she ""lied about her identity"" but didn't specify how. The woman, from Colombia, entered the United States illegally in June 2023 and obtained authorization to work under the Biden administration. Her 16- and 17-year-old children crossed the border illegally last month near El Paso, Texas, and were brought to a government shelter in Chicago for unaccompanied migrant children.

DHS said more information on the male driver is forthcoming.

Big picture view:

The incident adds tension to already fraught relations between Chicago and federal immigration authorities. The city has clashed with federal agencies over enforcement tactics.

Border Patrol Chief Greg Bovino has defended the use of force by agents accused of using pepper balls, tear gas and other tactics against people protesting federal immigration policies and the detaining of immigrants in the area.

""I didn’t have any reason to think it would be this bad, but it’s far worse than I ever thought,"" Bovino said in an interview Monday. He called his agents ""sanctuary busters,"" a swipe at so-called sanctuary cities, like Chicago, that limit cooperation with immigration authorities.

Mayor Johnson in his remarks on Thursday also took aim at the Border Patrol chief.

""Greg Bovino allegedly told the court that this is his F'ing, or blank, city. No, Greg, it's not. The city belongs to Chicagoans. Your agents have broken laws. They have acted with impunity. But at the end of the day, we will hold you accountable for the crimes you have committed against our people,"" Johnson said.

""Ripping a teacher out of a daycare just further proves that this operation has nothing to do with the, quote, worst of the worst, end quote. The cruelty and the inhumanity that has been on display, that is their point. They're trying to intimidate us and we certainly see how far they are willing to go. We will continue to push back and resist this tyranny. We will use every single tool at our disposal. We will certainly push to look for additional measures that we can use to enforce our Constitution.""",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox32chicago.com/www.fox32chicago.com/content/uploads/2025/11/1280/720/johnson-ice-detain-teacher-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-11-06 14:01:38.548079

What we know:

On Wednesday, Nov. 5, Rep. Yassamin Ansari visited the Eloy Detention Center to check on Arbella ""Yari"" Marquez, 40. Marquez, a reported green card holder who has lived in the U.S. for 25 years, was detained in February after a traffic stop.

Rep. Ansari described the conditions inside the facility as horrific and said she witnessed Marquez coughing up blood during the visit.

""She is a cancer patient. She has leukemia. She has lost 70 pounds since being at Eloy,"" Rep. Ansari said. ""She has described vomiting blood. She has bruises on her legs. She is very sick.""

The congresswoman has spent months attempting to secure outside treatment, noting that Marquez did not receive an appointment with an oncologist until October. Ansari said Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is now delaying the release of Marquez’s test results.

Arbella ""Yari"" Marquez

Dig deeper:

Rep. Ansari also cited the deaths of 20 people in ICE custody this year alone, saying she is working to ensure Marquez is not the next fatality.

Ansari was accompanied by the ACLU of Arizona, which is working to improve conditions in ICE facilities. The ACLU is tracking reports of foul water, medical neglect and inhumane conditions at detention centers nationwide.

According to the ACLU, the national daily average of people detained has risen from 39,000 in January to 60,000 and is expected to reach 100,000 by January.

Rep. Ansari criticized the Trump administration’s immigration policies, stating, ""I think Americans by and large are turning against the administration on immigration ... Some sensible Republicans, especially here in Arizona, where we have such a diverse immigrant population, need to come to that conclusion that we have gone too far.""

The other side:

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not respond to a request for comment on Marquez’s medical care or the deaths in custody.

Unlearn the language of “good,” “innocent,” or “wrongfully.” This is not just a rhetorical shift, but a shift in values.
Remember, you don’t need to reinvent the wheel, radical harm reductionists and sex workers have been making toolkits, zines, and DIY guides for decades.","I ’ve been an organizer for half of my life now. What a strange thing to write.

I’ve been involved with struggles to abolish the death penalty, worked to kick racists and war criminals off campuses, to fund and expand abortion access, to form unions and strike committees; I’ve slept on concrete during youth rebellions, navigated supporting criminalized survivors of gender based violence, taught people how to reverse overdoses and test their drugs, built peer education amongst sex workers toward decriminalizing our labor, organized too many vigils for fallen comrades, gotten arrested symbolically and against all my best efforts, and liberated resources from institutional spaces and moved them to community as often as I could. I’ve done more, but I shouldn’t put it in writing (and neither should you, lesson one).

May this find you grounded in community and living your values, even as your survival, your labor, and your basic needs are vilified, exploited, or criminalized. For some of us, these are all too familiar conditions. For people organizing within the sex trades, or whose harm reduction work occurs outside the law, public scorn and carceral violence come with the territory. As someone who has done (and continues to do) movement work within these spheres, I want to share some thoughts, and lessons I’ve learned, with people who are trying to do the work of collective survival in these environments. If you are not a sex worker or involved in harm reduction work, you may also have something to learn from people whose political work often occurs outside the law (or in direct opposition to it). As authoritarianism tightens its grip, more and more people are going to face criminalization upon choosing to organize as workers, resist unjust policies, or practice mutual aid. If you are grappling with the difficulties that come with this kind of work, here’s what I can share.

I cannot stress enough how crucial it is to have a small, tight-knit crew you call your chosen political family. These can be people you actively organize with, or used to, or maybe you’re all involved in different projects now, maybe you met at the club, clinic or on the stroll, but these are your people who know you, trust you, are conflict brave, and can gut check you. You’ve engaged in political education together, you have shared values, and you have experience — these are qualities that are earned and grown collectively. There are no substitutes for these kinds of relationships. Lots of people will tell you what to do; these are the people whose advice you should consider first and foremost.

That being said, it is the criminality of the work that I need to focus on. Or at least the impact of criminalization on our waged work, our organizing work — our political work (because all labor is politicized).

Unlearn the language of “good,” “innocent,” or “wrongfully.” This is not just a rhetorical shift, but a shift in values. Let go of any preconceived notions you had about “criminals.” In fact, let me officially welcome you to the criminal class. Divorcing oneself from respectability politics can be hard, especially when there are so many barriers to resources when you’re perceived as criminal or charged as such. There are no “good ones,” there are only people, fellow workers, co-strugglers. Innocence is irrelevant because the laws have already betrayed us. And it is my belief that no one should be caged, tortured, detained, or deported by the state — all carceral violence is done wrongfully. We cannot pick and choose who rightfully and wrongfully experiences the hell of carcerality. If we do this, we are affirming the very system that seeks to kill us.

You must commit to unapologetic politics. It might be tempting to give into something we call the whorearchy — or the hierarchical stratification of sex working/trading people whose perceived value or worth is ranked based upon the associated stigma of their particular form of sex work (i.e., “I’m better than them because I work indoors instead of on the street”, or “I don’t deserve to be arrested because I’m paying for school, not drugs”). Whorearchy exists because of classism, colorism, substance stigma, racism, xenophobia, transmisogyny, ableism and other forms of discriminatory, oppressive ideologies. But whorearchy thrives because of the criminalization and stigma of the sex trades. There are no shortcuts to liberation, and winning rights for some at the expense of others in our criminal class is a kind of soul-death. When building a broad coalition, and involving people who have feminist and abolitionist politics, make sure you’re not so quick to win them that you abandon your lived experiences for respectability. Remember, those elites in power don’t actually care if you pander to them now, if your existence threatens their agenda, they will never honor your humanity, no matter how “good” and “respectable” you try to be. Remain illegible and unruly.

Skill up as many people as you know, now. Your skill shares do not need to be large or public or perfect. They just need to happen thoughtfully, carefully, and often. Refreshing your own skill sets on gunshot wound care, overdose reversal, rescue breathing, needle cleaning/disposal, learning the right quantities of misoprostol and mifepristone, and testing drugs for fentanyl and xylazine is a priority. Getting people together in person to build safer sniffing kits, and gather other harm reduction supplies, creates social community opportunities to check-in on each other, engage in risk and movement assessments collectively, and share advice on using and caring for our comrades who use drugs. There is no substitute for off-line, in-person conversations about strategy, tactics, and navigating work outside of the law. It is both urgent and patient work.

Urgent in that these are timely skills that more of us need to learn and practice, especially since the majority of people will still call 911 even though they may be scared of the potential for police violence. Often this comes down to a lack of self-trust and lack of knowledge on how to intervene without the state in an emergency situation. When you’re a sex worker, and your client or fellow worker overdoses, you need to be able to act swiftly and without state intervention whenever possible. Remember, you don’t need to reinvent the wheel, radical harm reductionists and sex workers have been making toolkits, zines, and DIY guides for decades. Find what speaks to you, and use it as a template, build from something that already exists and fact check it with trusted friends. It’s patient work because new skills may need to be acquired, language and practices change with new knowledge, and because people will say some really upsetting and problematic shit to you about drug use. I’m so sorry but they will. Even the comrades who you think should know better. You can’t see through everyone’s journey, focus on the skills, recommit to a politics of solidarity and care. It’s hard work doing peer to peer education, it can be draining, and you’ll need to ask for help, a lot. Take a deep breath, you’ve got this.

Be discerning, and figure out who’s in the room. There’s practicing safer communication (what I used to call security culture before the term was wrecked, and the concept debased) and then there’s becoming obsessive and gate-keeping. What I’m expressly advocating, especially within criminalized workplace contexts, is moving things offline whenever possible. Learn how to assess risks as an individual within a formation, and collectively for the formation as a whole. Technology will change, adapt, and entrap. Work only with platforms that have clear terms of service that aren’t already committed to throwing you under the bus, or expressly work with platforms that are built by community-minded people. We often can’t control how we make money, or what platform consolidation means. But when it comes to our organizing work, we can opt in and out of using tools that don’t serve us. We can also control what we do and don’t say and to who. This is critical — you have to move at the speed of trust. That will likely feel slower than you desire to act. You’ve got to get to a place where trust, collaboration, and safer outcomes for your communities are prioritized instead of appearing to have all the answers on the internet, jeopardizing your own safety to respond to every direct service ask, or inflating your organization’s numbers too rapidly.

Yes, it will present new challenges and there will be learning curves, but an emphasis on safer communication means talking to the people you are directly organizing with, regularly — checking in on materials, assessing needs and risks, outlining safer methods to trade sex or obtain substances, discussing the political landscape in real terms, and making space to do visioning work beyond immediate crisis-related tasks. If you are doing work outside of the law, you cannot do this on a zoom call with 90 people who you do not know. You also cannot do this at a large general membership meeting of an organization that’s open to the public. It will mean you have to repeat yourself, schedule more meetings, and develop an ear for infiltration. Some of these skills feel intuitive, but I promise, if you and your crew are paying attention, they can be learned, practiced and modified for your own needs.

Sex workers, and really all workers in criminalized economies, have gotten really good at developing new languages, code switching, and sharing information to keep each other safe by getting creative and working both within and against the repressive laws and their enforcement of any given generation. You’re being hoisted onto the shoulders of some tough, resourceful worker-organizers. You too will build and experiment with new tech, new skills, new tactics. Something that remains, however, is how you embody your politics and values. Don’t let people shut sex workers and drug users out of spaces you find yourself working in — speak up, point to the outlaw legacies of harm reduction and mutual care, be bold in your comradeship.

In addition to the obvious human rights violations posed by the changes — which, among other things, would amend policy to allow children to be targeted by biometric surveillance — it would put a target on the back of trans, intersex, and gender nonconforming people, as well as women and trans people of color, citizens and non-citizens alike.

“Under this proposed rule, DHS may also require, request, or accept raw DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) or DNA test results, which include a partial DNA profile, as evidence of genetic relationship, to determine eligibility for immigration and naturalization benefits or to perform any other functions necessary for administering and enforcing immigration and naturalization laws,” the proposal reads. “Where evidence of a relationship is required, this rule proposes to grant DHS express authority to require, request, or accept raw DNA or DNA test results (which include a partial DNA profile) from relevant parties such as applicants, petitioners, derivatives, dependents, and beneficiaries, to prove or disprove the existence of a claimed, or unclaimed, genetic relationship or biological sex.”

For example, it says, “DHS may request DNA evidence to prove or disprove an individual’s biological sex in instances where that determination will impact benefit eligibility.”

The policy as proposed doesn’t have many safeguards for privacy or constitutionality — the government can retain someone’s DNA profile indefinitely. It could further be weaponized to deny bids for immigration or asylum, out trans and intersex women being held in detention (who may not even know they are intersex otherwise), and track individuals in perpetuity through “continuous vetting.”

The DHS claims these changes will enable immigration officials to perform more thorough background checks, prevent fraud, and enforce immigration and naturalization laws. But it’s not only new arrivals that could be forcibly subjected to this treatment — longtime residents, naturalized citizens, and the families and sponsors of immigrants may also have to submit to sex tests.

Alejandra Caraballo, an instructor at Harvard’s cyber law program who has also provided legal aid to trans immigrants, called the initiative “dystopian.” When paired with troubling innovations in surveillance tech and attempts to criminalize trans people’s very existence, she says, the devastating potential of this rule, if finalized, cannot be overstated.

“You can create a digital Panopticon,” Caraballo said.

There is a 60-day public comment period ahead of any formal implementation.

The policy in question falls under the guidelines for the Collection and Use of Biometrics by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. It’s a revitalized version of a 2020 proposal from Donald Trump’s first term empowering Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as well as Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to launch dragnet surveillance campaigns.

That original bid was struck down by the Biden Administration before it could take effect, but Trump 2.0 brought it back with added provisions greenlighting sex testing via buccal swab — in other words, testing the chromosomal composition of DNA in a person’s saliva.

These biometrics can be used to trace and quash dissent, surveil marginalized communities, and add massive obstacles to trans, intersex and gender nonconforming people entering the country, including asylum seekers who may be fleeing gender-based violence abroad. If you can’t prove you’re a “biological woman” to the White House’s liking, then your ability to file for relief under, say, the Violence Against Women Act, may become more difficult.

Depending on a variety of factors, such as a person’s country of origin, this kind of sex testing can cost a small fortune. Not to mention the implications of such a policy ahead of the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles — if the U.S. government can grant or deny visa requests based on its own unscientific and inexact definitions of “biological sex,” then it can functionally control who gets to compete. And we know from decades of sports scandals that sex testing is also weaponized against cisgender women, and disproportionately, women of color. Think: Imane Khelif, Caster Semenya, or one of the eight women who suddenly found out they were intersex during sex testing at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, likely ending their athletics careers.

Even before the DHS added the new sex testing provision, countless medical groups, politicians, legal scholars, and human rights organizations decried Trump’s biometric powergrab. During the public comment process for the 2020 version of the policy, the American Medical Association argued that authorities lack “the capability to collect and process DNA at the appropriate scientific level to ensure evidence-based standards,” and that it further robs women and children fleeing violence of “informed, non-coercive consent.”

Meanwhile, The National Center for Lesbian Rights chimed in that the rule tramples privacy rights and “empowers mass and unprecedented surveillance” of the LGBTQ community. And the Congressional Committee on Homeland Security said the rule would increase the already staggering backlog of immigrant applicants under the DHS while endangering the personal data of millions.

“Like any authoritarian regime, they want control over the population, and they feel like they need control over the identification of every single person, in a multitude of ways, so that they can be tracked,” Caraballo told Erin in the Morning. “There’s no more anonymity.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2243643678-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 15:17:19.114765

An effective public charge rule would benefit current citizens by increasing tax revenue and economic growth while reducing government spending on welfare.
These are the types of questions that a new public charge regulation can answer by creating a points system for public charge decisions.
Table9 Impact of Points-Based Public Charge Rule on Different Visa Categories As noted above, anyone excluded under the new public charge rule would have the option of posting a bond to be admitted.
[13] Table10 Fiscal Impact of Points-Based Public Charge Rule A rigorous public charge rule—built upon objective, measurable criteria such as education, age, English proficiency, and welfare use—would better select future immigrants to the U.S. and reduce uncertainty for applicants.","During President Donald Trump’s first term in office, his administration sought to strengthen the “public charge” requirement of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which aims to prevent the entry of immigrants who are likely to depend on government assistance. The reform, however, was blocked by legal challenges and ultimately withdrawn by the Biden administration.

More recently, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) issued guidance directing immigration adjudicators to make fuller use of their existing public charge authority, consistent with current regulations. This is a positive step. But the second Trump administration should go further by strengthening the public charge rule to provide a clearer and more legally sound framework that excludes more applicants likely to become public charges while simultaneously offering greater certainty to applicants.

This issue brief presents a reformed public charge rule based on a points system. This proposal would more effectively exclude immigrant applicants likely to become public charges, as intended by the INA. An effective public charge rule would benefit current citizens by increasing tax revenue and economic growth while reducing government spending on welfare. It would also benefit immigrants by providing greater certainty about their eligibility and by incentivizing them to learn English and pursue education to qualify to immigrate.

One of the first federal immigration restrictions was the Immigration Act of 1882’s ban on immigrants who were “unable to take care of themselves without becoming a public charge.” In the Immigration Act of 1889, Congress excluded “paupers or persons likely to become a public charge.” For nearly 150 years—longer than any modern federal welfare or entitlement program has existed—U.S. immigration law has included some form of public charge exclusion. Congress recognized that, given the wealth of the U.S., many of the world’s poorest people would be better off as “paupers” in America than staying in their native countries.

The current form of the rule, found in the INA, provides that “any alien who, in the opinion of the consular officer at the time of application for a visa, or in the opinion of the Attorney General at the time of application for admission or adjustment of status, is likely at any time to become a public charge is inadmissible.”[1]

This statute applies to both temporary and permanent visitors, though it is applied differently in each case. For nonimmigrant visa applicants—excluding those applying for “dual-intent” visas, which allow for the possibility of permanent immigration—satisfying the public charge rule requires only demonstrating to the immigration officer that they intend to leave the country and will not become a public charge during their stay. For the most common visa of this category, the tourist visa, this means showing sufficient financial means for the trip and the return home without working illegally or relying on welfare or charity.

Public charge determinations are most relevant for evaluating permanent immigrants, who plan to remain in the U.S. through old age and thus present the greatest potential fiscal risks and benefits. Accordingly, this issue brief focuses on them.

The INA requires that the following factors be considered in determining whether an applicant is likely to become a public charge:

Age

Health

Family status

Assets, resources, and financial status

Education and skills

The law also allows the government to consider other characteristics that are not specified. However, an applicant deemed likely to become a public charge may still be admitted or allowed to remain if the applicant can submit an affidavit of support from someone who agrees to assume financial responsibility.

The current standard that is used to determine if a prospective immigrant is likely to become a public charge is based on a 1999 Interim Field Guidance issued during the Clinton administration.[2] That standard is not hard to meet: in 2017, approximately 1,000 immigrant visa petitions—out of well over one million—were rejected based on the public charge rule.[3] A number of those refusals may have rested on additional grounds and could subsequently be reversed in a later fiscal year if applicants established, in a new interview, that they were not likely to become public charges.

One reason that the rule is so rarely invoked is that, in making determinations, the government currently considers only whether an applicant has actually received government benefits in the past, but not whether they applied for them. Furthermore, adjudicators do not consider all forms of benefits in making their determinations, limiting their consideration to whether an applicant has received:

Supplemental Security Income (SSI)

Cash under Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)

State, tribal, territorial, or local cash benefit programs

Institutionalized long-term care at government expense

The current approach to the public charge rule does not take into account whether applicants have ever received aid under any of the following welfare programs:

Medicaid

Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)

Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)

Subsidies and disability pay under Medicare or Social Security

Subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act

Housing vouchers, rent or utility subsidies, or residence in public housing

Tax credits for low-income individuals such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)

Other refundable tax credits like the Child Tax Credit (CTC) or educational aid

Free school lunch

The Biden administration formalized this limited approach in a 2022 regulation that replaced the Trump administration’s overhaul attempt. The Biden-era regulation defines a public charge as one who is “primarily dependent on the government for subsistence.”[4] This is a higher bar to clear to become a public charge, because subsistence implies that the immigrant’s life would suffer or end without government aid—not that the immigrant is, on net, straining public finances. Therefore, immigrants who receive substantial welfare benefits without paying much, if any, in taxes would still not be considered public charges, even if their presence in America costs taxpayers thousands of dollars every year.

The Biden public charge rule also excludes consideration of future tax payments and thus does not allow a consular officer or immigration adjudicator to determine whether an immigrant is likely to become a net fiscal contributor or a net fiscal burden.

The current public charge regulations—which allow only for consideration of past receipt of a limited set of benefits—are out of step with the goal of the statute, which requires the government to weigh a host of factors to determine whether an immigrant is likely to become a public charge in the future. Of course, receipt of benefits, whether at the time of the application or in the past, should be part of the consideration. But the law and common sense allow many other factors to be considered.

The first Trump administration sought to strengthen the public charge rule through a regulation that would have expanded the number of programs considered to be public benefits, allowed adjudicators to consider whether an applicant had applied for benefits (as opposed to just receipt), and expanded the use of “bonds” to ensure that immigrants would pay back any benefits they may use.[5]

The Trump rule added consideration of the following welfare programs:

SNAP

Housing vouchers, rent or utility subsidies, and residence in public housing

Medicaid

Emergency medical care benefits

Free school lunch

Under the Trump rule, an applicant was “likely at any time to become a public charge” if it was “more likely than not” that the applicant would “receive one or more public benefits for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36-month period (such that, for instance, receipt of two benefits in one month counts as two months).”[6] Thus, under the rule, applicants should be rejected if the adjudicator determines that there is at least a 50% chance that the applicant will receive one welfare program for a year, or two welfare programs for 6 months, within a three-year period. The rule, however, was challenged by a coalition of blue states on the grounds that it violated the Administrative Procedure Act and was racially discriminatory. The courts delayed enforcement of the rule until Trump left office, and the Biden administration withdrew it.[7]

Although it was a step in the right direction, the Trump public charge rule reform suffered from a serious flaw: it did not provide adjudicators with sufficient clarity on how to evaluate demographic factors. In particular, the proposal offered no guidance on how much weight should be given to each of the factors. For example, does education matter more than age or age more than education? What about English proficiency?

These are the types of questions that a new public charge regulation can answer by creating a points system for public charge decisions. A points guide for immigration adjudicators would simplify implementation because decisions would be quicker and less arbitrary, which would also lessen the regulatory burden on both the government and immigrants.

In a previous report on the lifetime fiscal impact of immigrants,[8] I analyzed data on tax payments and benefit receipts across different immigrant groups. That report showed that immigrants without a high school diploma were more likely than not to become net burdens on the taxpayer, regardless of their age—and that elderly immigrants, regardless of education, were likely to become net public burdens. An improved public charge rule should therefore exclude all immigrants in these high-risk groups unless they can demonstrate—through factors such as English proficiency, stable employment prospects, or financially capable sponsors—that they differ meaningfully from the statistical norm.

The Trump administration should provide USCIS and consular officers with a rubric based on all of the factors that are required to be considered under the law, as well as English proficiency and past receipt of welfare benefits (Table 1). For immigrants who are applying for adjustment of status in the U.S. after living here for at least one year, the minimum score required would be 50 out of 100 possible points. For those applying for an immigrant visa who are outside the U.S. and have never lived in the U.S. other than on short-term tourist visits, the minimum score required would be 40 out of 80 possible points.

Table1

Points System Rubrics

Adjusting Status

Consular Processing

For each category, points would be awarded as follows:

Education (Up to 30 Points)

No high school diploma or equivalent (0)

High school diploma (10)

Some college education such as an associate’s degree (15)

Bachelor’s degree (25)

Professional or graduate degree (30)

Age (Up to 20 Points)

Under 21 years old (10)

21 to 39 years old (20)

40 to 49 years old (10)

50 to 59 years old (5)

60 years old and older (0)

English Proficiency (Up to 20 Points)

Applicants would have the option to take either the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), which is more common among British English speakers. Immigrants with a bachelor-equivalent or higher degree from an English-speaking university in an English-speaking country would not be required to take the test and would receive the full 20 points.

TOEFL or IELTS score under the 20th percentile (0)

TOEFL or IELTS score between the 20th and below the 40th percentile (5)

TOEFL or IELTS score between the 40th and below the 60th percentile (10)

TOEFL or IELTS score between the 60th and below the 80th percentile (15)

TOEFL or IELTS score at or above the 80th percentile or a bachelor’s degree or equivalent or a higher degree from a U.S. university or a university in one of the following English-speaking countries (20):

United Kingdom

Ireland

Canada

Australia

New Zealand

Past Public Benefit Use (Up to 20 Points)

Currently receives any public benefits or has ever received public benefits for 12 months or longer (0)

Received public benefits for at least 6 months but less than 12 months (5)

Received public benefits for at least 3 months but less than 6 months (10)

Received public benefits for less than 3 months (15)

Never received any public benefits (20)

Health (Up to 5 Points)

Disabled (0)

Not disabled (5)

The regulation should list explicitly which conditions, such as blindness or deafness, would count as disabilities for purposes of the public charge determination. Disability is included as one factor not out of any animus, but to ensure that public resources remain available for current U.S. citizens with disabilities, rather than being spread across large numbers of immigrants with conditions that will strain public resources. In addition, this factor is not weighed very heavily, meaning that it will still be easy for someone with a disability to pass this public charge test as long as they have some education, speak English relatively well, and have some financial resources—or are willing to pay their immigration bond.

Financial Resources (Up to 5 Points)

Net household assets below $10,000 (0)

Net household assets of at least $10,000 (5)

The immigrant should submit tax returns, bank account statements, investment account statements, and other financial documents such as home-value estimates and a list of all debts to calculate his or her net assets.

The consideration of “family status,” which is required by law, would involve scoring each spouse in a married couple separately on this rubric and then averaging both scores.

Absent a showing of other extraordinary evidence, any score below the minimum would lead to a determination that the applicant is likely to become a public charge and is thus rendered inadmissible.

For a better understanding of how this system would work in practice, consider the following illustrative examples.

Married Adult Sibling of a U.S. Citizen (FB-4 Immigrant Visa)

In this case we have a 42-year-old Mexican man who is married to a 37-year-old Mexican woman. The man was sponsored for permanent residency by his U.S. citizen sibling under the FB-4 immigrant visa, and the couple has been waiting in Mexico for more than a decade for an FB-4 visa to become available. Since they are married, both spouses must be evaluated by the public charge rule points table, and their scores will be averaged to determine whether they meet the requirements.

The husband did not complete high school, while the wife has a high school diploma but no college education. Both received low scores on the TOEFL. Neither is disabled. Although neither has ever received U.S. public benefits, because they have only ever visited the U.S. briefly for tourism, they will be evaluated on the 80-point scale that disregards past public benefit.

The couple would be scored as shown in Table 2.

Table2

Married Adult Sibling of a U.S. Citizen (FB-4 Immigrant Visa)

Husband (Principal Applicant)

Wife

Since their scores are 15 and 40, their average score is 27.5, below the 40-point threshold, thus making them inadmissible under the proposed public charge rule. Their visa would still be available, but they would have to reapply at the consulate after obtaining more education, saving more to meet the asset test, or learning more English. However, each year that they wait could subtract points from the age category.

Parent of U.S. Citizen (IR-5 Immigrant Visa): Example #1

This is the fastest-growing immigrant visa category because it is uncapped, so there is no waitlist. In this case we have a married couple from the Dominican Republic, aged 63 and 59, and who never lived in the United States.

The couple would be scored as shown in Table 3.

Table3

Parent of U.S. Citizen (IR-5 Immigrant Visa): Example #1

Husband

Wife

Because both spouses score under 40 out of their 80-point scale, they would be deemed inadmissible under the public charge rule, and their application for permanent residency would be rejected.

Parent of U.S. Citizen (IR-5 Immigrant Visa): Example #2

This second hypothetical example of the same parent visa category involves well-educated parents of a high-skilled immigrant from India who is sponsoring them after becoming naturalized.

The couple would be scored as shown in Table 4.

Table4

Parent of U.S. Citizen (IR-5 Immigrant Visa): Example #2

Husband

Wife

The average of their scores is exactly 40 points out of 80, so they can obtain their visa and live in the United States.

Employment-Based Immigrant (EB-2 Immigrant Visa)

In this case we have a German man who has spent years in the U.S. on an H1-B visa sponsored by a major bank and has now been sponsored for permanent residency. He is married to an Italian immigrant whom he met while they were both international students in the United States.

The couple would be scored as shown in Table 5.

Table5

Employment-Based Immigrant (EB-2 Immigrant Visa)

Husband

Wife

They both have very high scores and are thus admissible and can receive their visa. This will be the result for almost every single employment-based visa application, but not for family visa applications.

The INA allows the government to require immigrant applicants to post a bond in order to receive a visa, but in practice this requirement is rarely if ever imposed.[9] The Trump administration, however, has recently begun using this authority to deter visa overstays for tourists from a few African countries with high visa overstay rates.[10] The proposed reform in President Trump’s first term also sought to increase the use of immigration bonds in the public charge context. Under that proposal, applicants who could not satisfy the public charge standard could still be admitted if they posted a bond, but the bond—which is normally refundable after naturalization or permanent departure—would instead be retained permanently, thus effectively creating a fee for immigrants likely to become public charges.[11]

A public charge bond is preferable to an outright public charge exclusion because it gives applicants who would otherwise be rejected the chance to immigrate to the U.S., but only if they can cover the costs of likely future public benefit use. The 2019 reform proposal set these public charge bonds at $8,100, or about $10,000 in today’s dollars.[12] A better option would tie the bond amount to the applicant’s score under the points system: for those assessed on the 100-point scale, the bond would equal $1,000 per point below the threshold; for those on the 80-point scale, $1,250 per point. If an immigrant later violates the public charge rule—for example, by receiving public benefits as a green card holder—the bond would be forfeited and the revenue directed to the U.S. Treasury for deficit reduction.

For instance, if an immigrant’s public charge score is 30 out of 80—10 points below the 40-point threshold for admission—he can post a $10,000 bond to overcome it. If he is married or has a child, then the amount would be $20,000.

By increasing the costs of immigration, public charge bonds would ensure that more visas go to wealthier and more educated applicants and that fewer go to potential public charges. These bonds would simultaneously reduce the deficit by allowing the Treasury to accrue interest on potentially billions of dollars in immigration bonds.

A stronger public charge rule would have two effects on the immigrant flow: it would encourage immigrants to obtain more education and learn more English, and it would shift visa allocation to more educated and younger applicants both within and across visa categories. For example, because negative public charge determinations would overwhelmingly occur among family visa applicants, it is likely that many of those visas would go unused and thus that more visas would shift to the employment-based category as the law mandates. Additionally, within the family-based visa categories, more educated and younger applicants would have the opportunity to come to the U.S. ahead of earlier applicants who were rejected on public charge grounds. Both effects would result in a more highly skilled immigrant flow and thus a reduced budget deficit.

To estimate how many immigrants would fail to meet the public charge rule test—and the resulting effects on visa allocation—Table 6 analyzes American Community Survey (ACS) data on noncitizens who arrived within the last five years who were at least 18 years old at the time of arrival. Among such immigrants, those who fall into one of three demographic groups are unlikely to qualify under the new public charge proposal: those who lack a high school diploma, unless they are between ages 21 and 39; those who lack a bachelor’s degree and are age 60 or older; and those under 60 years old with either a high school diploma or some college education but bad English proficiency. Under this proposal, 32.2% of recent immigrants fall into one of these three groups and thus would likely be disqualified.

Table 6

Share of Recent Immigrants Likely to Be Excluded Under Points-Based Public Charge Rule

Some may object that this estimate—because it includes all noncitizens who responded to the ACS—may include a large number of illegal immigrants. To ease these concerns, I repeated the same test with the 2019 ACS, which predates the border crisis and thus has fewer illegal immigrant respondents. I also repeated the test with the 2023 ACS sample but limited the analysis to non-Mexican and non–Central American respondents who arrived in the last five years, since the overwhelming majority of illegal immigrants are from either Mexico or Central America.

The 2019 ACS data, presented in Table 7 suggest that 27.9% of recent arrivals would fall into one of the three groups likely to be inadmissible—lower than the estimate based on 2023 data but still very high.

Table7

2019 ACS Inadmissibility Estimates

Using the non-Mexican and non–Central American (Honduran, Salvadoran and Guatemalan) 2019 ACS sample, we get an even lower share of likely inadmissible immigrants: 24.2%, nearly one in four (Table 8).

Table8

Non-Mexican and Non–Central American Inadmissibility Estimates

The true inadmissibility rate will probably lie between 24% and 32%, given that legal immigrants tend to be older than those who are in the U.S. illegally. Excluding Mexicans and Central Americans reduces the share of legal immigrants in the sample who are sponsored by family members as well. In other words, we can reasonably expect that if we had a true sample with English ability, education, and age of all legal permanent resident applicants, approximately one in four would be denied or have to post a bond on the basis of this proposed public charge rule.

In estimating the effect of this proposal on greed card issuance, I assumed a lowerest estimated share of visas among the previous estimates that would be affected, since some applicants are exempt from the public charge rule (refugees and asylees). I also assumed that all applicants age 60 or older were parents of U.S. citizens and that all the diversity visa applicants had a high school diploma, as is required by law. Using the pre-pandemic fiscal-year 2019 immigrant visa issuances as a baseline, that means approximately 201,000 visas would be affected. Table 9 shows the impact for each visa category.

Table9

Impact of Points-Based Public Charge Rule on Different Visa Categories

As noted above, anyone excluded under the new public charge rule would have the option of posting a bond to be admitted. If the average bond is only $10,000 and all affected visa applicants pay it, this policy would raise $2 billion annually in bonds. And if only 10% of applicants violate the public charge rule later on and forfeit their bond, the result is a net deficit reduction of $200 million annually plus the interest on these bonds—approximately $80 million at a 4% long-term U.S. Treasury bond rate—for a total deficit reduction of more than $3 billion over a 10-year period.

But the greatest fiscal gains from this policy would be the result not of the bonds that the immigrants pay but the changes in selection of who immigrates. Many visas that are not issued in the extended family categories because of this proposed rule would instead carry over to the employment-based category. The other large gains would come from reducing the number of visas granted to parents of U.S. citizens, who often represent a large fiscal drag due to their collection of Social Security and Medicare shortly after arriving. Many in this category would either not be able to pay the required bond or would forfeit it upon receipt of those benefits.

For illustrative purposes, Table 10 shows the potential fiscal impact of this new system. I assumed that the public charge rule would be implemented as proposed in this issue brief, with an average bond amount of $10,000, half of the applicants in each category paying the bond, and 1 in 10 of bond payers forfeiting it through noncompliance. In that scenario, this proposal would raise $11.8 billion over 10 years, primarily via the increase in employment-based immigration. It would then raise more than $1 trillion over 30 years, from both the increase in employment-based immigration and a reduction in the number of elderly parents of U.S. citizens collecting Social Security and Medicare. These calculations are based on my report on the fiscal impact of immigration using Congressional Budget Office scoring.[13]

Table10

Fiscal Impact of Points-Based Public Charge Rule

A rigorous public charge rule—built upon objective, measurable criteria such as education, age, English proficiency, and welfare use—would better select future immigrants to the U.S. and reduce uncertainty for applicants. By aligning the allocation of green cards with immigrants’ likely fiscal contributions, this rule could reduce the federal deficit by billions every single year, promote greater self-sufficiency, grow the economy, and ensure that limited visa spots are directed to those who are most prepared to thrive and assimilate in the United States. While more applicants would be deemed inadmissible, the option of public charge bonds would create a fair and flexible pathway for them to immigrate regardless, and the clear expectations of a points-based system would encourage applicants to seek more education and learn English. The Trump administration should move quickly to implement this proposal so that any delays due to lawsuits would not prevent its implementation.

Any win is great; but winning at the appellate level after losing in Immigration Court felt even that much better.","At the University of Miami School of Law's Immigration Clinic, students develop valuable skills by working on complex appeals for clients before immigration courts, including the Board of Immigration Appeals and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The appeals process involves a thorough review of the trial record, exhibits, and transcripts, followed by extensive research and writing. For clients, the appellate process can be challenging, as it often means they remain in detention for an extended period.

In a significant win, students in the clinic successfully reversed a decision by an immigration judge at the Puerto Rico Immigration Court, part of the Executive Office for Immigration Review within the Department of Justice, on appeal, securing a new trial for their client. The victory highlights the advanced legal work performed by students and the value of the school's commitment to experiential learning.

The successful appeal was handled by 3L Joseph Korzeb, one of the clinic's two student fellows. The Board of Immigration Appeals remanded the case, agreeing with the clinic's argument that the trial judge had not performed the correct legal analysis. In its conclusion, the court stated, “We cannot uphold the Immigration Judge’s decision as currently constituted given the [judge’s] deficient findings.”

This work is critical, as it addresses cases where a client has already lost once or twice in a lower court. ""The stakes are higher,"" said Korzeb. ""Working on an appeal has greatly improved my legal advocacy. I have honed my legal research and writing skills under the guidance of Professors Rebecca Sharpless, [founding director of the clinic], and Andrea Jacoski, [associate director].”

Law student Maria Alonso worked on the appeal of the case that she, together with team members Anusha Joshi and Albert Nicaud, litigated at trial at the Puerto Rico Immigration Court last semester. “Losing a case that you truly believe was wrongfully decided can be deeply disappointing for both you and your client,” Alonso said. “But when that remand finally comes through, they feel hopeful again and grateful for a second chance. Working on appeals has not only given me hope that real change is possible, but has also strengthened my persistence, client communication, writing, and research skills.”

Jacoski praised the students' work. “They maintained a deep understanding of the legal strategy of the case at both the trial and appellate levels. I attribute their rich and granular knowledge of the case to the success of the appeal.”

Building skills for modern practice

Established in 2009, the Immigration Clinic allows students to advocate for immigrants in complex proceedings. Students also collaborate with immigrant rights organizations on projects aimed at legal reform and social justice.

This successful appeal is a direct result of the School of Law’s mission to prepare students through an innovative, experience-based curriculum. The school’s nine clinics provide students with immersive opportunities to represent actual clients and deliver legal services to underserved communities. These are part of the School of Law’s broader offerings of experiential opportunities designed to engage students in real-world lawyering.

“Working on a case at the Board of Immigration Appeals was perhaps the best legal training I have received in law school thus far,” said Korzeb. “My classes have hopefully prepared me well to become a lawyer, but this case allowed me to apply the law in a high-stakes case with the guidance and supervision of our seasoned professors. Any win is great; but winning at the appellate level after losing in Immigration Court felt even that much better. I'm honored and appreciative to have received this incredible opportunity.”

In issuing the two-week temporary restraining order in the case, U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman wrote detainees at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement center “have suffered, and are likely to suffer, irreparable harm” absent his order.

Among other demands, the judge is requiring officials at the ICE facility to provide detainees with a clean bedding mat “with sufficient space to sleep”; adequate supplies of soap, toilet paper, towels, oral hygiene and menstrual products; a shower for at least every other day; three full meals with water per day; and prescribed medication. Holding cells must be cleaned twice per day.

The order also requires detainees be ensured communication with attorneys in privacy, a list of attorneys available for hire and access to a phone. The feds also will be required to enter each detainee into an ICE online detainee locator system.

The order comes a day after the court heard more than three hours of testimony alleging that people were crammed 100 at a time into a holding cell without a hot meal, with nowhere to sleep but a dirty floor near an open toilet. Gettleman said Wednesday that he found the witness testimonies to be “highly credible.”

“People shouldn’t be sleeping in plastic chairs. They shouldn’t be sleeping on the floor,” Gettleman said.

A plaintiffs’ request to inspect the facility was not granted in the order.

In the lawsuit, former detainees at the center described sleeping on cold floors, poor sanitation and clogged toilets that sit in the middle of holding cells with no privacy. Lawyers called it “a breeding ground for illness to spread.”

The class-action lawsuit was filed last week by the MacArthur Justice Center and Roger Baldwin Foundation of ACLU. It alleges that “Broadview is a black hole, and federal officials are acting with impunity inside its walls.”

Government lawyers have recently said the Broadview facility is “not equipped to be an overnight facility.” But the Chicago Sun-Times and WBEZ have since documented how it has been holding people for multiple days at a time.

Gettleman said he tried to word the order in a manner “that honors the discretionary functions of running an institution like this and making it as workable as possible.”

He said the order will not go into effect immediately, noting, “I wouldn’t expect it to be at the snap of a finger.” Gettleman told the government lawyers to provide him an update by noon Friday on the status of the Department of Homeland Security’s ability to comply with the order.

Also Wednesday, plaintiffs’ lawyers said they’re looking for more information that will give them a better understanding of the space inside the detention facility. That includes video footage from inside the building, a list of detainees sent there, the documentation shared with detainees upon their arrival and policies governing the facility.

Vera employed a two-way fixed effects regression to understand how time after an election affects anti-immigrant attitudes.
“This also implies anti-immigrant attitudes are malleable.
“Our findings are important because there is a lot of xenophobic violence and hate crimes against immigrants,” Vera said.
Maybe there might be some possibilities to implement interventions to mitigate anti-immigrant sentiment during electoral periods.”","LAWRENCE — Immigration remains one of society’s most polarizing issues.

A new study examines how this issue affects voters during and after an election. While the results are tied to partisan viewpoints, they are less predictable than one might think.

“A strong polarization regarding immigration occurs closer to an election. But once we move away from an election, both sides begin to converge in the middle,” said Sofia Vera, assistant professor of political science at the University of Kansas.

Her article titled “Democratic elections and anti-immigration attitudes” finds that right-wing respondents exhibit more negative attitudes toward immigrants when the election cycle is in full swing, but those negative views decrease once the election is over. The research also found that left-wing respondents express lower levels of xenophobia immediately after the election, but their immigration views become more negative as time after the election increases.

Vera's work appears in the Journal of Peace Research.

“Immigration plays such an important role in the way people decide their vote,” said Vera, who co-wrote the article with Miguel Carreras of the University of California, Riverside, and Giancarlo Visconti of the University of Maryland.

“In the U.S., Europe and Latin America, many political parties are adopting very negative stances toward immigration. They want to restrict it. People are worried immigrants are going to steal their jobs or threaten the national identity. And many far-right parties are adopting extreme views, painting immigrants as a threat and basically scapegoating immigrants for their national problems.”

Vera assumed the anti-immigration rhetoric espoused during elections might be homogeneous, with most voters becoming more xenophobic due to the disapproving rhetoric. But her study found that voters move in different directions depending on where they stand ideologically.

“Right-wing voters close to elections hold the most anti-immigrant attitudes, and as time from the election elapses, their attitudes become a bit less anti-immigrant. But we also find something we weren’t expecting: We also see a movement with left-wing voters. Closer to elections, they are adopting very strongly pro-immigration attitudes. And the more time passes after elections, their attitudes revert to what they were prior,” she said.

The immigration viewpoints of centrist voters appear unmoved by such political dynamics during elections, she said.

To gather this information, her team used data from Module 5 of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES), a survey conducted between 2016 and 2021 in 45 different countries. The core objective of the CSES is to measure people’s stances and preferences toward representative democracy at the time of a national election. Vera employed a two-way fixed effects regression to understand how time after an election affects anti-immigrant attitudes.

One of the byproducts of Vera’s research is discovering how genuinely effective campaign messaging is in influencing voters regarding hot-button issues.

“We show that campaign rhetoric and elite rhetoric is shaping public opinion,” she said. “This also implies anti-immigrant attitudes are malleable. They can change and shift, and they do, especially around election time when this rhetoric and discourse is much stronger and more frequent.”

A KU faculty member since 2020, Vera focuses her research on political behavior in comparative perspective, as well as partisan elections and representation.

As an immigrant from Peru, Vera said she has not personally felt targeted by anti-immigration views.

“That has not affected me directly, not personally,” she said. “I’ve heard many stories from immigrant friends that they have been insulted or even mistreated. It hasn’t happened to me. But that doesn’t mean I’m less worried about the topic.”

Ultimately, she said she hoped this research could highlight the role — and responsibility — that political elites play during an election cycle.

“Our findings are important because there is a lot of xenophobic violence and hate crimes against immigrants,” Vera said. “And anti-immigrant speech can be a precursor to xenophobic violence. Maybe there might be some possibilities to implement interventions to mitigate anti-immigrant sentiment during electoral periods.”",https://news-archive-assets.ku.edu/data/e3/d7/01k9assv64ykvvw9dgejgx4cra.jpeg,N,,2025-11-06 09:56:55.158596
