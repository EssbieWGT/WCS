It prohibits state and local law enforcement from providing information about a person's immigration status to federal officials or disclosing personal identifying information to immigration authorities.

Earlier this month, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser filed a lawsuit against Zwinck, alleging that he had violated Colorado laws limiting cooperation between local and federal immigration authorities.","Five sheriff's deputies from Colorado are being disciplined after a college student spent two weeks in a federal immigration detention center last month after a routine traffic stop.

An administrative review concluded that Sheriff’s Deputy Alexander Zwinck shared information on a Signal group chat that included federal immigration agents after he had pulled over Caroline Dias-Goncalves, 19, a student at the University of Utah, Mesa County Sheriff Todd Rowell said in a statement Wednesday.

The agents then used that information to track Dias-Goncalves down and arrest her. She was taken to a detention facility in Aurora, where she was held for 15 days before being released on bond.

""The Mesa County Sheriff’s Office should not have had any role in the chain of events leading to Miss Dias-Goncalves’s detention,"" Rowell said.

Colorado law restricts coordination between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities. It prohibits state and local law enforcement from providing information about a person's immigration status to federal officials or disclosing personal identifying information to immigration authorities.

""I regret that this occurred. I apologize to Miss Dias-Goncalves,"" Rowell said.

Zwinck pulled Dias-Goncalves over while she was driving on Interstate 70 outside Loma on June 5. Zwinck claimed Dias-Goncalves was driving too close to a semi-truck.

The traffic stop lasted about 20 minutes and Zwinck released Dias-Goncalves with a warning. Shortly after she exited the highway, federal immigration agents stopped her, arrested her and took her to the Aurora detention facility, where she was held until June 20.

Born in Brazil and raised in Utah since she was 7, Dias-Goncalves is one of nearly 2.5 million people living in the United States known as “Dreamers,” young immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Dias-Goncalves arrived on a visa that expired over a decade ago and has a pending asylum case.

In interviews conducted as part of the review, Zwinck claimed he did not know he was violating any laws or policies when he shared Dias-Goncalves' information and location with federal authorities in a group chat meant to discuss drug crackdown efforts.

According to the review's findings, Zwinck was involved in at least four other incidents last month in which the information he shared on the group chat following his traffic stops led to federal immigration enforcement actions.

Zwinck also told investigators that he had received and read two department-wide emails from the sheriff's office last year and in January, both outlining how deputies should interact with immigration authorities.

The review concluded there was “a preponderance of evidence” showing that Zwinck as well as Sheriff’s Deputy Erik Olson, who was on the group chat, and their supervisor, Sgt. Joe LeMoine, “acted outside of agency policy.”

Zwinck was placed on unpaid administrative leave for three weeks and Olson for two. Both will be reassigned to patrol. LeMoine was suspended without pay for two days.

Lt. David Holdren, LeMoine's supervisor, received a letter of reprimand and Holdren's supervisor, Capt. Curtis Brammer, was provided documented counseling.

Earlier this month, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser filed a lawsuit against Zwinck, alleging that he had violated Colorado laws limiting cooperation between local and federal immigration authorities.

Rowell said the lawsuit ""sends a demoralizing message to law enforcement officers across Colorado"" and urged Weiser to ""apply the law equally to all law enforcement and government officials instead of making Deputy Zwinck an example.""","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/250616-Caroline-Dias-Goncalves-vl-548p-b8f924.jpg",N,,2025-08-01 09:59:00.679198

Mr. Holliday said he had contacted Mr. Kennedy’s office in June to tell staff members there about the family’s case and to ask for their support.
He said he believed ICE had eventually released Ms. Clouatre because of mounting public pressure from sources including Mr. Kennedy’s office.
It’s not a good look.” Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, confirmed in an email that Ms. Clouatre had been released from ICE custody.
She did not comment on what role, if any, Mr. Kennedy’s office had played in the case.","After nearly two months in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody, Paola Clouatre, 25, secured her release from a Louisiana detention center this week following an intervention from an unlikely source: a Republican lawmaker who has allied himself with President Trump.

Officials who work in the office of Senator John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, requested that the Department of Homeland Security release Ms. Clouatre from detention after an immigration judge halted her deportation order, according to emails reviewed by The New York Times.

Ms. Clouatre, a Mexican citizen, had been detained by ICE agents on May 27 while she was at a routine appointment in New Orleans related to her application for a green card and permanent resident status.

Ms. Clouatre first entered the United States as a teenager to seek asylum with her mother and brother. The family was processed at the border in Tijuana, according to Ms. Clouatre and her lawyer, and was granted parole, which allows migrants to remain temporarily in the country. In 2018, Ms. Clouatre’s mother failed to show up for a court hearing in California, leading a judge to issue a deportation order against Ms. Clouatre.

Ms. Clouatre’s apprehension came amid growing pressure from the White House to ramp up arrests to fulfill Mr. Trump’s pledge of mass deportations. ICE agents have raided farms, swept through factories and targeted immigration courthouses across the country, in some cases arresting immigrants as they attend routine hearings.

Mr. Kennedy, the junior Louisiana senator, has been a vocal supporter of these efforts, appearing on conservative radio shows and cable television to decry sanctuary cities and applaud ICE agents’ enforcement.

“If you’re in our country illegally, you’re a criminal,” Mr. Kennedy said during a July 17 Fox News interview. “Illegal immigration is illegal, duh.”

So the Clouatres were surprised to learn that people in his office were fighting to reunite their family.

In an email on Tuesday morning, Christy Tate, the constituent services representative in Mr. Kennedy’s office, wrote to Mr. Clouatre to confirm that his wife had been released from ICE custody after her office had made a formal request to the federal agency.

“I am so happy for you and your family,” Ms. Tate wrote. “We will continue to keep you, your family and others that are experiencing the same issues in our prayers.”

Ms. Tate did not respond to phone calls or emails, and representatives of Mr. Kennedy’s office did not reply to a request for comment from The Times.

Ms. Clouatre was released from a north Louisiana detention center on Monday and is back home with her family in Baton Rouge. She is wearing an ankle monitor and awaits a court date to continue immigration proceedings. Her lawyer, Carey Holliday, said she was likely to obtain a green card.

Mr. Holliday said he had contacted Mr. Kennedy’s office in June to tell staff members there about the family’s case and to ask for their support. He said he believed ICE had eventually released Ms. Clouatre because of mounting public pressure from sources including Mr. Kennedy’s office.

“It’s a very compelling case,” Mr. Holliday said. “This is someone who honorably served his country, was honorably discharged, and now the government wants to take his wife away. It’s not a good look.”

Scott Wiener, who authored a bill to ban certain kinds of face coverings for law enforcement.
That’s due in large part to opposition from powerful state and local law enforcement lobby groups, whose members resent being lumped in with federal immigration officials and questions about its legality.
Newsom has slammed federal agents’ use of face coverings — but also publicly questioned whether the state can regulate federal law enforcement.
The governor’s team in a statement also echoed moderate Democrats’ concerns about its scope.
“I’m not critical of the why, it’s the how,” said Kathryn Barger, a moderate Republican, during the meeting.","“People wearing ski masks are grabbing people, throwing them into unmarked cars and sending them to Alligator Alcatraz or El Salvador or Libya,” said California state Sen. Scott Wiener, who authored a bill to ban certain kinds of face coverings for law enforcement. “It’s really terrifying, and there should be a deep, broad-based movement to put a stop to this kind of fascist secret police.”

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security called the efforts “repulsive messaging bills that stoke dangerous anti-ICE rhetoric for cheap political points and fundraising emails” in a statement to POLITICO, adding that federal officers “clearly identify themselves as law enforcement” and need the masks to shield themselves from violence and online harassment.

Even in California, which is dominated by a Democratic supermajority, lawmakers and Gov. Gavin Newsom aren’t entirely sold on Wiener’s anti-mask bill. That’s due in large part to opposition from powerful state and local law enforcement lobby groups, whose members resent being lumped in with federal immigration officials and questions about its legality.

Newsom has slammed federal agents’ use of face coverings — but also publicly questioned whether the state can regulate federal law enforcement. The governor’s team in a statement also echoed moderate Democrats’ concerns about its scope.

“This is a critical issue facing our communities,” said Diana Crofts-Pelayo, a Newsom spokesperson. “Consistent with the Governor’s direction, we want to ensure the bill doesn’t disrupt the important work of state and local law enforcement, which doesn’t involve immigration operations.”

In Los Angeles County, one member of the Board of Supervisors questioned how such an ordinance would be enforced as her colleagues voted to take the first step toward drafting anti-mask rules.

“I’m not critical of the why, it’s the how,” said Kathryn Barger, a moderate Republican, during the meeting.

Janice Hahn, the supervisor who put forward the proposal, acknowledged its legality “may be decided in court.”

“This is the time for our vulnerable residents — and whether or not it gives them a false sense of security — they need to know that their government is paying attention … that we have the courage of our convictions to stand up and say, ‘When you’re in our county, this is how we expect you to behave as a law enforcement official,’” Hahn said.

I see following Trump 100 percent of the time.” In response, Steil lauded Trump’s executive orders and deportations.

Retired AFSCME union staff member and current organizer Mary Burpee of Elkhorn saw the town hall differently.
So people are frustrated.” Days before Thursday’s town hall, Burpee was part of a mock funeral procession that included a cardboard coffin left at the front door of Steil’s home in Janesville, which made national news Wednesday evening.","Republican U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil was met by a hostile crowd attempting to shout him down Thursday evening during his first town hall gathering since the passage of President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

Some supporters left early calling the spectacle “disgusting,” while one Democratic activist said the Janesville Republican “got what he deserved” for being a rubber stamp for Trump and the GOP.

The Elkhorn High School auditorium was filled with around 200 people, some of whom carried signs with slogans like “Resist,” “God is King no Others” and “Hands off SSI and Medicare.” When he entered the stage, Steil was met a by a roar of boos mixed with some cheers from a smaller group of his supporters.

The town hall was raucous as the audience repeatedly overpowered Steil’s microphone. He paused often while urging the crowd to stay civil and allow him to answer a series of questions out of respect to those who asked them.

The questions touched on a wide range of issues from federal funding for cancer research, Trump’s broad-ranging tariffs being enacted without congressional approval and the immigration arrests by masked ICE agents “disappearing” people.

One attendee questioned the morality of deportation raids during Trump’s second term.

“What I see happening to our immigrant population embarrasses me, horrifies me, and you have not raised your voice to complain about it,” she told Steil. “I see no leadership. I see following Trump 100 percent of the time.”

In response, Steil lauded Trump’s executive orders and deportations.

“What I see as moral hazard was created by (former President Joe) Biden by allowing the U.S.-Mexico border to remain unsecure,” Steil said, as he was drowned out by a roar of boos that lasted roughly 10 seconds.

“I think we need to secure the U.S.-Mexico border,” Steil continued after the crowd quieted. “You may not. It’s fine that we disagree.”

On tariffs, a man from Elkhorn said he was always under the impression that Congress must be involved, which was met with loud cheers. He then asked “what dire economic circumstances” put Trump in a position to issue them without congressional approval.

Steil didn’t get into specifics about the role of Congress, but said the overall goal of the Trump administration is “to make sure that other countries are treating the United States fairly.” He called China an “egregious abuser” of U.S. trade policies across multiple administrations. When asked again why the president is going it alone, Steil referenced an ongoing legal battle over whether Trump needs Congress’ blessing.

The shouting, the boos and overall chaos was too much for Walworth County resident Carol Stanczak who walked out of the auditorium about halfway through the question-and-answer session. She told WPR she came to have questions answered, but Steil was “road blocked by people screaming and hollering.”

“You know, I don’t know if these people are paid to come in here and be jerks,” Stanczak said. “This is not the American way. Let the man speak!”

She said Steil is a good leader who is committed to and concerned about his constituents. She said the audience’s behavior only strengthened her support.

“I’ll fight harder,” Stanczak said.

Another Steil supporter, Kevin Roblee of Lake Geneva, stood at the back of the auditorium and occasionally shouted at the crowd to let Steil answer questions. He said Walworth County is “a conservative county, and this is the fist time I’ve ever seen this kind of rhetoric coming out of the audience.” He said the dialogue “seems to be against Trump, rather than what Bryan Steil is doing in Congress, which is much more important and relevant.”

“This has nothing to do with Bryan Steil or his efforts in Congress, and that’s why I’m upset,” Roblee said.

Retired AFSCME union staff member and current organizer Mary Burpee of Elkhorn saw the town hall differently. She said she wasn’t surprised to see the anger leveled at Steil because constituents like her have been “demanding” he hold an in-person town hall “for many months, almost a year now.”

“Normally, I would be of the persuasion that there should be some decorum that, you know, let your representative speak,” Burpee said. “But I think he deserved this today, and I say that because he’s given the middle finger to his constituents for so long. And I think the passage of that horrible, big, beautiful bull**** bill has got people so angry, and it’s already passed. So people are frustrated.”

Days before Thursday’s town hall, Burpee was part of a mock funeral procession that included a cardboard coffin left at the front door of Steil’s home in Janesville, which made national news Wednesday evening. She said the coffin represented the “death of democracy,” and was in no way meant as a threat against Steil or his family.

Susan Chandler, who chairs the Democratic Party of Wisconsin’s 1st Congressional District delegation, also stood by Steil’s opponents who shouted during the town hall and said “people had a right to express their emotions.”

“I don’t feel he answered a single question that was presented to him,” Chandler said. “He was slick and polished, and it’s time for him to go.”

After the town hall concluded and the audience filed to their vehicles, a homemade “No Kings” sign was left hanging on the entrance to the Elkhorn High School auditorium.

Steil represents one of just two competitive congressional districts in Wisconsin, though he has won previous races comfortably and currently has a large fundraising edge in the early stages of this campaign cycle.",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/steil-town-hall-main-scaled-e1754020484238.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 09:58:11.747259

The recruitment email, sent this week, appears to have targeted law enforcement officers whose agencies participate in the 287(g) program.
Thompson said the association has heard from more than a dozen law enforcement agencies about the recruitment emails.
... Law enforcement has always been a calling.
This includes local law enforcement, veterans, and our 287(g) partners who have already been trained and have valuable law enforcement experience.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement is newly flush with billions from the “One Big Beautiful Bill” spending legislation and under pressure to rapidly hire 10,000 new agents. But one tactic it recently tried to do that hiring — aggressively recruiting new agents from some of its most trusted local law enforcement partners — may have alienated some of the leaders it needs to help execute what the Trump administration wants to be the largest mass deportation in U.S. history.

“We’re their force multipliers, and this is the thanks we get for helping them do their job?” Polk County, Florida, Sheriff Grady Judd said in an interview. Judd said he’s not happy about a recruitment email ICE’s deputy director sent to hundreds of his deputies, and he blamed Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who oversees ICE.

“Kristi Noem needs to get on her big girl pants and do what’s right. She needs to make sure that there’s an apology,” said Judd, who also made it clear that he wants to “support President Trump’s mission.”

NBC News spoke to local law enforcement leaders in four states whose agencies participate in ICE’s 287(g) program, under which local officers are deputized to help in immigration enforcement, and whose deputies ICE targeted for recruitment.

The recruitment email, sent this week, appears to have targeted law enforcement officers whose agencies participate in the 287(g) program.

The email, which NBC News has obtained, reads, in part: “As someone who is currently supporting ICE through the 287(g) program, you understand the unique responsibility we carry in protecting our communities and upholding federal law. Your experience in state or local law enforcement brings invaluable insight and skills to this mission —qualities we need now more than ever.”

The email also touts potential $50,000 signing bonuses as an incentive for joining ICE, and it links to a government recruitment website featuring an image of Uncle Sam, the headline “AMERICA NEEDS YOU” and the possibility of up to $60,000 in student loan repayment beyond the signing bonuses.

“ICE actively trying to use our partnership to recruit our personnel is wrong and we have expressed our concern to ICE leadership,” the Pinellas County, Florida, Sheriff’s Office said in a statement.

The sheriff in Pinellas County is a Republican, as is Judd.

“It was bad judgment that will cause an erosion of a relationship that has been improving of late. And it’s going to take some getting over, and it’s going to take leadership at DHS to really take stock, ’cause, hey, they need state and locals,” Jonathan Thompson, the executive director and CEO of the National Sheriffs’ Association, said in an interview.

Thompson said the association has heard from more than a dozen law enforcement agencies about the recruitment emails. He also said that the group has not heard from DHS since the emails were flagged to the association and that he intends to send a “very stern note” to ICE.

“This is inappropriate behavior of a partner organization,” Thompson said. “We’re all on the same boat. And you just don’t treat friends or partners like this.”

One Florida police chief who did not want to be named out of concern that his department could face retaliation said departments that have partnered with the federal government now fear they could lose their best officers.

“Now you know why everybody’s so pissed,” the chief said.

“This is like the transfer portal in college sports,” the chief said, adding: “We see people leave us because they believe they can make more money at other locations. ... Law enforcement has always been a calling. Now it’s a job.”

The DHS media office did not respond to questions about local law enforcement concerns but provided NBC News with a statement that it attributed to a senior DHS official: “ICE is recruiting law enforcement, veterans, and other patriots who want to serve their country. ... This includes local law enforcement, veterans, and our 287(g) partners who have already been trained and have valuable law enforcement experience. Additionally, more than $500 million from President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill will go to increasing our 287(g) partnerships with state and local law enforcement.”

The sheriff’s office in Forsyth County, Georgia, told NBC News that the Atlanta ICE office “sent an apology” for the recruitment email.

Not all sheriffs are upset with the recruitment effort. In fact, some say they support it.

Thaddeus Cleveland, the sheriff of Terrell County, Texas, said, “I think if someone wants to better their life, better their career, you know, look towards the long years, the long game, retirement, there’s nothing better than the U.S. government to go out and have a successful career.”

Cleveland, who has just four deputies, admits he cannot compete with the $50,000 bonuses the agency is offering.

“We may not be able to turn around and hire somebody the next day. It may take a few weeks. It may take a few months. But again, I support, you know, someone wanting to pursue something they’re interested in. I may end up having to work a little more, which is OK.”

Goliad County, Texas, Sheriff Roy Boyd also said he is not upset about the recruitment and noted that his office also has to deal with the state’s recruiting new troopers from his department.

“We can’t compete with the salaries of the state and the feds,” he said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-01/250128-ice-ch-1119-9937a1.jpg",N,,2025-08-01 09:59:25.760510

As the Trump Administration indiscriminately targets all immigrants, rather than focusing on violent criminals, including arresting lawful permanent residents and those here with legal protections, Padilla pushed for Republicans to finally come together to protect DACA recipients by passing the Dream Act.
Padilla emphasized that Republicans continue to voice support for the Dream Act behind closed doors and vowed to keep fighting to secure permanent protections for DACA recipients.
Key Excerpts: “Colleagues, it feels like every single day the Trump Administration finds new ways to defy the rule of law.
Senator Padilla is a leading voice in Congress for providing long-term undocumented immigrants with pathways to citizenship or permanent legal residence.","Padilla: “This mass detention and deportation operation will go down in our history as a stain, a dark chapter in our nation’s history, an outrageous moral failure, intentionally caused by this Administration.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Last night, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Immigration Subcommittee, took to the Senate floor to defend Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients from the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) baseless statement that “illegal aliens who claim to be recipients of DACA are not automatically protected from deportations.” Padilla slammed the Trump Administration’s push for DACA recipients to “self-deport,” emphasizing that these long-term residents, who were brought to the country as children, have been working, studying, and living legally in the United States since 2012 and are vital members of American communities.

He highlighted the story of Javier Diaz Santana, a deaf 32-year-old DACA recipient who was arrested while at the Los Angeles car wash where he has worked hard six days a week for the last five years. Masked immigration officials carrying weapons raided the Temple City car wash, confiscating his ID and handcuffing him, preventing him from communicating. Despite having no criminal record and living in the United States since he was five years old, Javier was taken to El Paso, Texas where he faced the risk of deportation.

As the Trump Administration indiscriminately targets all immigrants, rather than focusing on violent criminals, including arresting lawful permanent residents and those here with legal protections, Padilla pushed for Republicans to finally come together to protect DACA recipients by passing the Dream Act. Padilla emphasized that Republicans continue to voice support for the Dream Act behind closed doors and vowed to keep fighting to secure permanent protections for DACA recipients. He also blasted the Administration for scapegoating hardworking immigrants and using cruel immigration enforcement as spectacles to distract from their failing policy agenda.

Key Excerpts:

“Colleagues, it feels like every single day the Trump Administration finds new ways to defy the rule of law. They will tear families apart, decimate local businesses, and deceive the public in order to distract from their own failures and scandals. And nowhere has this been clearer than in their cruelty towards immigrants.”

“If it was just deportation operations focused on dangerous violent criminals, there would be no discussion, there would be no debate, there would be no disagreement. But that’s not what this Administration is doing. They are going after all immigrants. The vast majority of those that have been arrested and detained and many of those deported, many without due process before being deported, are not convicted criminals.”

“The Trump Administration is saying that these young adults who were brought to the United States as children and who have lived here, who have studied here, and who have worked here legally — let me emphasize that: worked here, studied here, lived here legally — since the year 2012, thanks to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, this Administration is saying now that they have no right to be here, that they could be deported, or maybe should be deported at a moment’s notice, or worse, that they should choose to leave their families and their communities for countries that they’ve never known.”

“The whole point of DACA is protection from deportation because these are not criminals or some danger to society. These are young people who have lived in the United States for as long as they can remember. These are young adults who, as kids, were on your little league team or in your Girl Scout troop. For God’s sake, they’re part of our communities, and they’re young adults who have now grown up to be lawyers, to be doctors, to be teachers, and who have more love for everything that this country stands for than anyone threatening them in Trump’s Department of Homeland Security.”

“This week, the Trump Administration is now telling them that they should be arrested and thrown out of the only home they’ve ever known in an attempt to satisfy Donald Trump’s quest for political points or an arbitrary quota. To the Trump Administration, let me say this: you cannot claim to love our country at the same time you’re trying to destroy our future.”

“Don’t tell me the Trump Administration is following the law when we hear cases like this, and don’t tell me that the Administration is only targeting dangerous, violent criminals because the data proves otherwise. … For as tragic and as heartbreaking as Javier’s story is, he’s not alone. There have been more and more stories of DACA recipients being arrested and detained, and the fear is just growing across communities.”

“One thing is certain: this mass detention and deportation operation will go down in our history as a stain, a dark chapter in our nation’s history, an outrageous moral failure, intentionally caused by this Administration. Because for all the tough talk, this is not just politics as usual. In fact, when the Dream Act was first introduced over 20 years ago, it was bipartisan, and it enjoyed bipartisan support for most of the last 20 years, and even today, polling shows an overwhelming majority of the American public supports DACA recipients. Yes, both Republicans and Democrats across the country.”

“Make no mistake, Americans will not soon forget what this Administration is doing to their neighbors — to their neighbors, to their co-workers, to their friends. Now, this story doesn’t end the way you think it might, because we will continue fighting, not just to stop these outrageous arrests, but we will not rest until we enact real and permanent protections for DACA recipients who contribute so much to our country.”

Video of Senator Padilla’s floor speech is available here.

Senator Padilla is a leading voice in Congress for providing long-term undocumented immigrants with pathways to citizenship or permanent legal residence. Last week, Padilla hosted a press conference in Los Angeles alongside immigration advocates, impacted families, and community leaders to announce legislation to expand a pathway to lawful permanent residency for millions of long-term U.S. residents. As Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids and mass deportation assaults intensified in Los Angeles, Padilla marked the 13th anniversary of the DACA policy by urging Congress to take immediate action to deliver permanent protections for millions of families, parents, and individuals who are increasingly at risk amid President Trump’s mass deportation agenda. He also delivered remarks on the Senate floor ahead of the anniversary, pushing for permanent protections for Dreamers rather than the indiscriminate ICE raids stoking fear in Los Angeles communities.

NBC Washington first reported on attorneys’ concerns about the increased presence of immigration officers at the courthouse.
“This type of ICE presence in and around the courthouse has never been like this,” said Butorac, who’s served as a public defender in Fairfax for over two decades.
The sheriff’s office, meanwhile, said it doesn’t assist ICE in making arrests, and that there hasn’t been a change to department policy.
The increased ICE presence, Butorac said, “adds a layer of making people afraid to come to court, and that includes everyone.","Federal immigration officials have started making arrests inside the Fairfax County Courthouse this month, a shift from previous practices that could make people reluctant to go to court, according to an attorney in the Northern Virginia suburb.

Dawn Butorac, the county’s chief public defender, said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have been “coming to the courthouse to arrest people when they show up for their court cases.” It appeared to be happening more frequently last week, she said, and they’ve been making arrests inside for about the last month.

NBC Washington first reported on attorneys’ concerns about the increased presence of immigration officers at the courthouse.

“This type of ICE presence in and around the courthouse has never been like this,” said Butorac, who’s served as a public defender in Fairfax for over two decades.

In some cases, the officers wait outside the nearby jail for when people are released on bond, Butorac said. But they’re also appearing “when they know people might have court cases — that could be traffic infractions, that could be traffic cases, it could be felony charges, and they’re showing up to arrest people.”

In a statement, a spokesperson for the Fairfax County Sheriff’s Office said the department is aware ICE made two arrests inside the courthouse on July 21. The agency doesn’t keep records of when and where immigration officials make arrests, the statement said, but “to our knowledge, these are the only arrests that have occurred inside of the courthouse building by ICE.”

Until July 21, the statement said, ICE would generally make arrests outside of the courthouse.

Butorac said sheriff deputies have been escorting ICE agents through the courthouse to specific courtrooms in order to help them find people they want to arrest.

“This actively assisting, walking through the courthouse with them, being with them when things are happening, that is new and shouldn’t be happening,” Butorac said.

The sheriff’s office, meanwhile, said it doesn’t assist ICE in making arrests, and that there hasn’t been a change to department policy.

The increased ICE presence, Butorac said, “adds a layer of making people afraid to come to court, and that includes everyone. That includes not only the people who are looking to have their cases resolved, but also people who might be victims of crimes. They might not want to come to court. People might not want to report crimes because they’re afraid of all law enforcement.”

The agents making the arrests, she said, haven’t displayed a warrant before taking people into custody. There have also been cases in which people have told officers they’re in the U.S. legally and have been charged with but not convicted of a crime, “which would be the thing that then would take away their status, and (their cases are) not being finished, and they very likely could never be resolved,” she said.

The circumstances, Butorac said, are creating a “due process problem.”

Attorneys are more aware and monitoring whether immigration officials are in the courthouse and are frustrated because, “We all have a stake in the system running fairly, and everybody’s matter being resolved and they’re not getting done.”

In the case of clients, Butorac said anecdotally, “You just see the fear that our clients have, and the greater risk they’re taking when making decisions about how to resolve their case.”

The announcement, made in a city where three-fourths of residents are foreign-born, was greeted with thunderous applause as Trump said his next administration was going to root out undocumented criminals.

But under the current Trump administration, the idea of who is considered a “criminal” has broadened to include all undocumented people. ICE raids and arrests of undocumented immigrants, regardless of their criminal history, have ignited fear and anger from Hispanic communities across the country, a diverse voting bloc Trump made inroads with in 2024.

In Florida, the governor was quick to assist the president make the leap from “bad hombres” to anyone without papers. In February, at the first meeting of his State Board of Immigration meeting, Gov. Ron DeSantis said, “If you are here illegally that is a crime too, OK? You can’t just say you have free range to be here illegally until you commit some type of felony. I want you out before you commit the felony.”

The sweeping characterization of undocumented immigrants as criminals, even those that are trying to follow the rules, is changing attitudes about President Trump’s response to what he once called an “invasion.” In South Florida, large groups of immigrants who had Temporary Protected Status or asylum cases pending saw themselves suddenly categorized as “criminals” after the Trump administration ended their statuses. Recent national polling shows Americans disapprove of Trump’s handling of immigration while a local survey shows that some of South Florida’s Venezuelan immigrants are feeling disillusioned. The pendulum swing now even has South Florida Republican elected officials finding themselves in a precarious situation: stay loyal to Trump’s agenda or answer to their immigrant voter base.

“There’s this huge upsurge of sentiment that this is a country of immigrants, that these immigrants are not all bad,” said Eduardo Gamarra, a political science professor at Florida International University. “And that even those who are being deported should be treated in a more humane way.”

‘Everyone is basically at risk’

Fort Lauderdale immigration attorney Mark Hamburger told the Miami Herald that under previous presidential administrations there was an understanding that migrants who commit serious crimes should be prioritized for deportation over undocumented people with clean records and families in the country that depend on them. “There is no line anymore. Everyone is basically at risk,” Hamburger said.

“Trump wants to group all immigrants into this category of criminals, but that’s just not true,” he said. “I’m sure they’d love to say, ‘They’re all criminals, they all have records.’ But they don’t even say that anymore. Now, what the press secretary says is, ‘Well, they’re here unlawfully and that in itself is a crime, so we’re detaining anyone who’s here unlawfully.’”

By targeting undocumented people in general, Hamburger said, the Trump administration has overwhelmed the court system and stoked fear, ultimately to push immigrants to self-deport.

One of Hamburger’s clients was a woman from Nicaragua who came to the United States in 2022 seeking political asylum, which her sister and cousin were able to secure. She had been living in Los Angeles, but was feeling paranoid amid the ICE raids and anti-ICE protests.

Hamburger called her before her trial, which was finally set for last month. She was noticeably nervous over the phone and hung up. When he called back, she confessed: “I’m in Honduras right now.”

Though she had a strong political asylum case, Hamburger said, the stress was making her sick. She gave up on her case and left the country.

“I have many other cases like that where people are just slowly putting up the white flag,” Hamburger said. “The chaos, the psychological torture, it reaches a certain point for immigrants where it starts to manifest physically as illness. And some people, ultimately, just give up.”

Americans soften on immigration

As U.S. Rep. María Elvira Salazar of Miami pitched the Dignity Act to the American public — and Trump himself — Salazar reiterated a crucial point that undoubtedly resonates with her constituents in Miami: not all undocumented immigrants are criminals.

“Yes, they broke the law, but someone gave them a job because they needed those workers, workers who are still needed today,” she said.

The bill would grant undocumented immigrants living in the country for more than five years with no criminal record a legal status that protects them from deportation. While its passage remains unlikely in a polarized Congress, it marks a notable attempt by Salazar to distance herself from the full scope of Trump’s immigration crackdown..

The timing is notable. A growing body of polling shows that the public mood is shifting — and fast.

A July 11 Gallup poll found that Americans are becoming more positive about immigration, reversing four years of rising concern. In June 2024, 55 percent of respondents wanted immigration reduced. By July 2025, that number dropped to just 30 percent. Among Hispanic voters, Trump’s approval on immigration now sits at 21 percent, well below his national average.

A separate CBS News poll found that a majority of Americans believe Trump’s administration is targeting “people who aren’t dangerous criminals” for deportation — and that his second-term policies have gone further than many voters expected.

What’s behind this big change in public opinion?

“A lot of it has to do with overreach,” said Mike Madrid, a Republican political commentator and expert on Latino voters. Many are critical of the Trump administration for circumventing due process and sending military vehicles to cities like Los Angeles, Madrid said. Americans have also been inundated with harrowing anecdotes in the news and on social media of undocumented immigrants being detained by ICE and separated from their families, likely adding to the unpopularity of Trump’s policies.

In Miami, ICE agents in plain clothes have arrested immigrants as they walked out of immigration courtrooms. In a New York Times report published in June, a reporter watched as ICE officers in Miami arrested an undocumented man they were looking for, along with his brother who happened to be with him.

“[Trump’s] numbers are still very strong with Republicans. I think the vast majority of Republicans did vote for this and like it, and frankly, think he probably could still be more aggressive,” Madrid said. “But the voters that he needs to get to a majority — young voters, Hispanic voters, independents — they have fled in pretty historic numbers. The collapse is pretty spectacular, especially given a very short time frame.”

Immigration attorneys across the country are hustling to help clients who have been swept up in the crackdown despite having no criminal history. Hamburger said most of his clients either have no criminal history or have been charged with misdemeanors, the most common being driving without a license. Two clients of his were arrested while fishing without a license, he said. Now, they’re in Alligator Alcatraz, the state-run immigration detention facility built in the Everglades where detainees reportedly face harsh and disgusting conditions.

Hundreds of detainees who earlier this month were held in Alligator Alcatraz or scheduled to be sent there had no criminal convictions or pending charges in the United States, the Herald reported this month.

‘They didn’t vote for this’

Salazar, who represents a diverse swath of Miami-Dade County with large populations of Cubans, Haitians, Caribbeans, Colombians and Venezuelans, is “in a bind,” said Gamarra, the FIU professor. While Gamarra said the Dignity Act bill is unlikely to pass, “it helps her public stance.”

Salazar will have to answer to that large constituency in the mid-terms, though Gamara said it’s too early to tell exactly how Latino voters in Miami will respond to South Florida Republicans.

But there are some notable trends emerging. An FIU survey Gamarra conducted in May among Venezuelans in Florida showed real disillusionment among a third of Trump voters with his administration’s immigration policy, particularly the ending of Temporary Protected Status and humanitarian parole.

“I can tell you from looking at the Venezuelan data that there is a degree of sentiment, very deeply held sentiment, that they were betrayed, that they didn’t vote for this,” Gamarra said. “They thought it was going to only be criminals because they made that distinction that ‘we’re not criminals.’ But they didn’t anticipate the broader definition of ‘criminal’ behavior that the administration has adopted.”

In the meantime, Madrid said he has noticed “fascinating” shifts occurring in different Latino communities in response to Trump’s policies.

For the first time in his career, Madrid said he is seeing the Cuban American community respond to this moment the same way the Mexican American community is, despite their very different histories in the United States and typical political beliefs. He recalled attending a recent press conference where Cuban and Venezuelan community leaders called on FIFA to protect attendees from ICE the way the Dodgers’ did in Los Angeles.

“That same fear, that same terror, is not something we normally see from the Cuban American community with a Republican president!” he said. “We’ve never seen that before.”
