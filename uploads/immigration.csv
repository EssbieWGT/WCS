Welcome to our live coverage of US politics.

Donald Trump has threatened to call a national emergency and federalize Washington DC after the city’s mayor, Muriel Bowser, said its police would not cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), whose agents have been taking illegal suspects into custody and have been accused of racially profiling people in doing so.

The US president took charge of the city’s Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) on 11 August for 30 days, activating the National Guard and deploying federal officers in what he framed as a crackdown on crime and homelessness but what was widely seen as another example of federal overreach.

The ruling reinforces federal authority to conduct immigration enforcement operations that critics argue disproportionately target Latino communities, including U.S. citizens and legal residents. As the state grapples with the implications, voices from government, advocacy groups, and affected communities are converging in opposition, underscoring deep divisions over immigration policy, enforcement practices, and civil liberties.

This extensive article explores the background of the case, details of the Supreme Court ruling, reactions from California’s leadership, social and legal ramifications, and the ongoing mobilization to challenge and mitigate enforcement impacts.

Immigration Enforcement and Historical Contestation in Southern California

Southern California has long been a focal point for immigration dynamics in the U.S., characterized by its large, diverse immigrant population and complex intergovernmental relations. Over the past decades, federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has conducted numerous high-profile operations in the region, drawing fire for alleged racial profiling and civil rights violations.

In 2020, multiple lawsuits and local ordinances sought to restrict ICE’s ability to conduct street-level arrests, demanding stricter procedural safeguards and transparency. These measures emerged in response to documented cases where U.S. citizens and lawful residents were mistakenly detained or subjected to intimidating tactics during large-scale immigration sweeps.

Supreme Court Case: Central Issues and Decision

The legal battle centered on whether local restrictions on immigration-related stops unlawfully interfered with federal immigration authority. Key constitutional questions included:

The extent of federal preemption under the Supremacy Clause.

Compliance with Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.

Balancing individual rights with federal interests in immigration control and public safety.

On a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court sided with the federal government, holding that:

Federal statutes and executive powers largely preempt local regulations limiting immigration enforcement.

Targeted arrests based on suspected immigration violations, including considerations of ethnicity and language, do not inherently violate constitutional rights if justified by reasonable suspicion.

Local ordinances that required additional verification prior to federal detentions imposed impermissible barriers.

The ruling thus grants greater latitude to ICE and related agencies operating in Southern California and beyond.

Reactions from California Leadership: Unanimous Outrage and Calls for Action

Governor Gavin Newsom, Attorney General Rob Bonta, and key members of the California Legislature quickly condemned the decision:

Governor Newsom described the ruling as “a setback for human dignity and justice,” emphasizing dangers posed to families and communities.

AG Bonta pledged to “redouble efforts” to uphold immigrant protections at the state level and vowed to defend Californians’ constitutional rights aggressively.

Prominent state legislators called for federal reforms and increased funding for legal defense programs.

Beyond elected officials, local leaders, including mayors and county supervisors, voiced alarm over anticipated upticks in detentions, displacement, and social disruption.

Table: Summary of California Leaders’ Reactions

Impact on Southern California’s Immigrant Communities

Southern California’s immigrant residents—many of whom have deep-rooted ties, U.S.-born children, and legal status—fear heightened exposure to immigration actions marked by racial profiling.

Key concerns include:

Disruption of Family Units: Increased deportations can split families, leaving children without caregivers.

Chilling Effect: Fear of enforcement reduces cooperation with police, impedes reporting of crimes or abuse, and hinders participation in public programs.

Economic Hardship: Detainment of breadwinners results in income loss, housing instability, and broader economic ripple effects.

Health Impacts: Anxiety and trauma exacerbate physical and mental health disparities.

Communities are already organizing mutual aid networks and legal response teams to address these challenges.

Data Illustrating the Local Impact

Approximately 40% of Los Angeles County’s 10 million residents identify as Latino.

Estimates suggest ICE made over 15,000 arrests in Southern California in 2024.

Data from community organizations report an 18% increase in family separations following enforcement spikes.

Studies indicate a 25% decline in crime reporting in neighborhoods heavily impacted by immigration raids.

Legal and Constitutional Implications

The Supreme Court decision raises critical questions regarding constitutional rights and the federal-state power balance.

Fourth Amendment safeguards guard against unreasonable searches but allow specific exceptions for immigration enforcement.

Equal protection jurisprudence confronts the permissibility of ethnic or linguistic considerations.

States have limited ability to obstruct federal enforcement but can regulate cooperation and provide supplemental protections.

Civil rights lawyers warn of a potential rise in legal cases fighting abuse and wrongful detentions.

Advocacy and Resistance Strategies

In response, community groups and civil rights organizations are mobilizing:

Training thousands of “Know Your Rights” workshops across affected areas.

Establishing rapid legal response teams for detainment cases.

Filing new lawsuits targeting patterns of unconstitutional enforcement.

Lobbying Congress for protective legislation, including new frameworks to prohibit racial profiling.

Broader Political and Social Context

The ruling represents a flashpoint in the nation’s polarized immigration debate:

Supporters frame the decision as necessary for public safety and border control.

Opponents see it as a major roll-back of protective measures for immigrants and a legitimization of racialized policing.

Media discourse, protests, and political campaigns increasingly focus on how immigration enforcement intersects with civil rights and community cohesion.

Comparative Overview of Immigration Enforcement in Major U.S. Cities

Future Outlook and Policy Recommendations

To mitigate harm and promote justice, several paths emerge:

Strengthened local legal aid and community defense funding.

Development of state legislation to shield vulnerable populations.

Enhanced public accountability mechanisms for federal agents.

Immigration reform at the federal level to clarify enforcement scope.

Continued dialogue and advocacy will shape the post-ruling immigration landscape.

Conclusion

The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to uphold federal law enforcement’s authority to profile in Southern California ignites a critical debate about the balance between security and civil liberties. While intended to enhance immigration control, the ruling threatens to erode trust, amplify fears, and deepen inequalities in one of America’s most diverse regions.

California’s leadership, communities, and advocates face a daunting task—navigating the complex intersections of law, policy, and humanity to protect rights, ensure justice, and foster inclusion amid evolving national realities.

This landmark decision marks a significant shift in the ongoing legal battles over immigration enforcement practices and civil rights protections for immigrant communities in the nation’s most populous city. The ruling has profound implications for governance, community trust, and civil liberties, and it has sparked a vibrant debate among legal experts, policymakers, advocates, and affected residents.

This comprehensive article delves into the background and developments of the LA immigration raids, the legal trajectory culminating in the Supreme Court’s stay, the details and rationale of the ruling, its immediate and long-term impacts, and the multifaceted response across various sectors. Structured to provide readers with a deep understanding, the article also employs statistical insights and tabular presentations to underscore critical dimensions of this issue.

Background: Immigration Raids and the LA Legal Context

For years, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other federal agencies have conducted operations targeting undocumented immigrants in California, particularly in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.

Los Angeles, home to millions of immigrants, many without legal status, has been a focal point for enforcement because of its role as a major urban entry point and sanctuary city status. However, operations involving ICE agents have been controversial, often stirring community fear and resistance.

Numerous large-scale raids targeting alleged gang members and criminal suspects have unfortunately resulted in the detention of US citizens and legal residents, raising alarms about the use of “racial profiling” and insufficient safeguards. Public and political backlash prompted local authorities and civil rights organizations to impose restrictions on ICE enforcement activities, seeking transparency, accountability, and civilian oversight.

The Legal Battle: From Injunctions to the Supreme Court

The specific case at issue emerged when Los Angeles County challenged federal immigration enforcement protocols, citing violations of constitutional protections including the Fourth Amendment’s ban on unreasonable searches and seizures, and due process guarantees.

Lower federal courts responded by issuing restraining orders and injunctions limiting when and how ICE agents could conduct “immigration stops” in LA neighborhoods. These rulings emphasized the overreach risks of indiscriminate sweeping actions without individualized suspicion and aimed to protect civil rights.

The Department of Homeland Security, backed by the Trump administration’s Department of Justice, appealed these decisions, arguing that the local restrictions interfere with critical federal functions and national security. The case escalated to the Supreme Court, which granted a stay allowing federal raids to proceed pending the final outcome.

Supreme Court Stay: Key Points and Reasoning

In a tightly divided decision, the Supreme Court’s majority ruled that:

Federal immigration enforcement falls within the exclusive domain of the federal government, preempting local measures that substantially impede operations.

The country faces “serious national threats,” justifying expedited and robust actions by federal agents.

While individual civil rights remain paramount, the government has not yet been shown to violate legal standards under the challenged procedures.

The stay does not signal final approval but maintains the status quo allowing ICE to perform arrests under existing protocols.

The decision was a narrow 5-4 outcome, reflecting deep judicial divisions over the scope of federal immigration power versus local autonomy and individual liberties.

Table: Supreme Court Votes on LA Immigration Raids Stay

Immediate Implications for Los Angeles

Federal enforcement agents swiftly resumed targeted immigration sweeps in several LA neighborhoods known for gang activity and drug trafficking. Coordination with local law enforcement increased, although critics accuse some agencies of complicity or insufficient resistance.

Communities, especially Latino immigrants, expressed alarm and heightened anxiety over potential detentions. Local government officials reiterated commitments to protect immigrant rights through legal aid expansions and shielding policies.

Civil Liberties and Human Rights Concerns

Opponents of the ruling warn that restoring broad federal authority risks the following:

Civil Rights Violations: The resumption of sweeping enforcement operations threatens Fourth Amendment protections.

Racial Profiling: Evidence indicates that ethnicity and language often become proxies for suspicion.

Community Disruption: Fear leads to decreased reporting of crime and public engagement.

Family Separation: Elevated risk of deportations affecting mixed-status households.

Legal aid organizations anticipate a surge in cases challenging arrests and seeking damages.

Government and Community Responses

California’s state leadership, including Governor Newsom and Attorney General Becerra, swiftly condemned the decision and announced expanded support for immigrant defense, including state-funded legal help and public awareness campaigns.

Community-based groups intensified outreach, emergency hotlines, and “rapid response” networks to aid those detained and their families.

Table: Community Support Initiatives in Response

National and Global Perspectives

The ruling has prompted nationwide discussion with other urban centers assessing enforcement models amidst similar tensions. International observers underline the balance between sovereignty, human rights, and migration management as a global challenge.

Future Legal and Policy Outlook

Court challenges continue with pending lawsuits seeking broader injunctions. Meanwhile, legislators in California and Congress face pressure to:

Clarify the legal framework around enforcement profiling.

Expand local protections and sanctuary policies.

Improve data sharing and transparency for oversight.

Invest in alternatives to detention and support community health.

Conclusion

The Supreme Court’s stay allowing immigration raids to resume in Los Angeles represents a significant moment in the enduring national debate on immigration, security, and civil rights. While it empowers federal enforcement agencies, it rekindles fears and frustrations within impacted communities. California’s leaders and advocates face a critical task to safeguard the dignity and rights of residents amid shifting legal boundaries.

Nathan Phillips, of Newton, Natasia Lawton-Sticklor, of Leominster, and Eleanor Reid, of Hanover, New Hampshire are all facing one misdemeanor charge of trespassing.

Police reported to the ICE Boston Field Office Friday around 11 a.m. after ICE agents reported protesters who were refusing to leave the front steps, according to court documents and the Burlington police.

The individuals – later identified as Phillips, 58, Lawton-Sticklor, 42, and Reid, 33 – “were trying to deliver food to the detainees that are in the facility,” according to a police report filed in Woburn District Court.

When police said ICE cannot accept the outside food and asked them to move to the grass, the trio allegedly refused and said they were “not going to voluntarily leave until they were allowed to deliver the food,” the report said.

The Boston Field Office is located in an office building near Burlington Mall. Since the administrative office has been doubling as a detention center, the town is attempting to gain access to inspect the building’s conditions, Burlington officials said in an update Friday.

Lawyers, including representing a teen from Milford who was detained for nearly a week at the Burlington office, have called the facility inhospitable and overcrowded, with detainees sleeping on concrete floors. State officials have called out the “abysmal” conditions.

“We’re here to deliver food and care packages to the people being held here, and visit with them, if possible, to make sure they’re doing okay,” Lawton-Sticklor told WBUR on Friday. “We have some deep concerns about food, basic necessities, being withheld from them.”

After the people allegedly said they had no intention of leaving “until we can deliver the food,” the report said, they were informed they could be arrested.

“You have all been asked multiple times to leave. This is the operational area of this facility. You are disrupting the operations of the facility by being here with no actual business. You have been asked to leave by the security of the facility and the Burlington Police Department,” a captain told the people at the scene, according to the report. “Are you refusing to do so? Are you refusing to leave?”

The three were then arrested without incident, according to police, who noted they believe arrests were the ultimate goal of a planned protest.

Phillips is a Boston University professor who previously participated in a hunger strike to protest what he called threats to free speech on campus amid the Trump administration’s crackdown on international student visas.

South Korea said Monday that it is closely looking into whether any human rights violations took place during the raid and detention of Korean workers by US immigration authorities in Georgia earlier this month, local media reported.

""I understand that the government is conducting a more thorough review with the companies to determine whether any human rights violations occurred,"" Yonhap News Agency cited presidential spokesperson Kang Yu-jung as saying.

Over 300 South Korean nationals returned home Friday after a week in detention following the raid by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at a Hyundai-LG battery plant construction site in Bryan County following negotiations between the two countries.

Many workers spoke of cramped spaces, mold-covered mattresses, cold temperatures and limited access to basic hygiene at the detention center.

Several others described how they were shackled with chains around their waist, legs and wrists during the arrest and treated roughly by immigration officers.

""The Foreign Ministry is looking at whether our demands were properly addressed, and the companies are also conducting their own reviews to check whether any measures were insufficient on either the Korean side or US side,"" Kang said.

The city-sponsored parade is usually held in early November and draws large crowds to Long Beach.

Even though the city is not aware of federal enforcement activity targeting the parade, the decision was made “out of an abundance of caution” because it’s “a large and very public outdoor event,” said Long Beach spokesperson Kevin Lee.

Long Beach City Councilmember Mary Zendejas had requested the cancellation, Lee said.

“This decision did not come lightly,” both Zendejas and the city said in statements. The decision addresses “genuine fears raised by community members, especially those who may face the possibility of sudden and indiscriminate federal enforcement actions that undermine the sense of security necessary to participate fully in public life.”

The Arte y Ofrendas Festival, a separate ticketed event organized by an outside vendor and held at Rainbow Lagoon Park, also has been canceled this year. The festival typically coincides with the city-sponsored parade and is held where the parade ends its route, thus drawing parade attendees.

Roberto Carlos Lemus, a marketer who brought food trucks and other vendors to the festival last year, called the cancellation “very sad.”

“Everyone’s very sad about the situation. Día de los Muertos has been one of the largest celebrations for a very long time, and the city has done a great job putting it on,” Lemus told The Times on Sunday. “Unfortunately with Latinos being kidnapped and attacked by ICE and the current administration, I do understand why they made the decision that they made.”

Lemus said some local businesses were worried about economic fallout of the festival and parade cancellation as well as the potential effects of raids on Latino Restaurant Week in Long Beach, an event he co-founded that is set to begin Sept. 22.

“They are afraid,” he said. “Overall, it affects everybody.”

Immigration raids have swept Southern California in recent months, with thousands of people detained by federal agents. A new Supreme Court ruling has cleared the way for U.S. immigration agents to stop and detain people in Southern California whom they suspect of being in the U.S. illegally, even if their suspicion is solely based on the type of job they hold, the language they speak or their appearance.

The ruling has bolstered fears that people with brown skin and Spanish speakers will be targeted — especially going into national Hispanic Heritage Month, which begins Monday — and was met with outrage by immigration rights attorneys and local leaders.

At its meeting Tuesday, the Long Beach City Council approved a motion to push unspent funds allocated for this year’s parade to next year’s budget, ensuring $100,000 will be available for the 2026 parade.

The council also added $600,000 to the Long Beach Justice Fund, which provides legal representation to residents who face immigration actions, bringing the budget available for the fund to $1.85 million. The fund ensures residents have access to “resources necessary to safeguard their constitutional rights, uphold due process protections, and preserve family unity,” according to the motion.

Some Southern California events have proceeded as scheduled despite similar fears.

East L.A.’s 79th annual Mexican Independence Day parade held on Sunday seemed to draw smaller crowds than usual, but many said they felt a sense of pride and duty to attend in spite of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

“We’re here and we’re going to continue fighting for our rights and for others who cannot fight for themselves,” Samantha Robles, 21, told The Times as she watched the parade roll by.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3816e86/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+213/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0d%2F16%2F0178a8a5473b9d707f85d7344fcb%2Fme-long-beach-dia-de-los-muertos-parade.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 03:56:40.469246

There have also been multiple reports that masked federal agents have swept up American citizens during the raids, as well as others with documentation granting them legal status.
“It was just very impactful for me.” On Sept. 9, witnesses captured federal agents targeting occupants of a Camero parked outside of Van Nuys Mexican restaurant for unknown reasons.
In that instance, masked agents shattered the driver’s window and detained two men, both of whom were said to have green cards or lawful permanent residents.
Asked by KTLA for comment on the Long Beach car wash raid, a spokesperson with DHS released the following statement:","Seven workers at a Long Beach car wash were detained by federal immigration agents Saturday, one of whom appeared to faint and collapse while in custody.

The incident comes nearly a week since the United States Supreme Court ruled the Trump administration could, at least temporarily, resume sweeping immigration enforcement operations in L.A. and seven other SoCal counties.

There have also been multiple reports that masked federal agents have swept up American citizens during the raids, as well as others with documentation granting them legal status.

Workers at Bixby Knoll’s Car Wash, at 577 E. Wardlow Rd., were the latest to be targeted in the Department of Homeland Security’s immigration dragnet.

The raid, according to witnesses, some of whom documented it on their cellphones, said the raid unfolded at around 10 a.m. Saturday when about four dark-colored SUV’s carrying masked agents with tactical vests pulled up and blocked the car wash’s entrance and exits, prompting several of the car wash employees to make a break for it.

One woman captured by agents and escorted to one of the SUV’s appeared to faint and collapse as she was about to be put into the vehicle. The agent holding her struggled to keep her off the ground before another agent came to his aid.

A man filming the incident, who did not want to be identified, can be heard yelling at agents to get her some medical assistance.

“The most striking thing for me was a woman probably my mother’s age running with her work tools being chased by a young ICE agent, running for her life,” he told KTLA. “It was just very impactful for me.”

On Sept. 9, witnesses captured federal agents targeting occupants of a Camero parked outside of Van Nuys Mexican restaurant for unknown reasons.

In that instance, masked agents shattered the driver’s window and detained two men, both of whom were said to have green cards or lawful permanent residents. A pregnant woman, a U.S. citizen, was also detained but later released.

Tom Homan, the White House Border Czar, has repeatedly emphasized that immigration enforcement operations will continue to ramp up. With SCOTUS’ temporary ruling on roving immigration patrols in L.A. County, DHS now has permission to target people based on their race, ethnicity and the language they speak.

Critics of the Trump administration’s tactics have raised alarm bells about people with no criminal history being detained and that hardworking folks trying to support their families are indiscriminately being arrested.

According to NBC News, more than 58,000 undocumented immigrants have been taken into custody since Trump took office. About 30% of those detained have criminal convictions, while 25% had pending criminal charges. The remaining 45% were categorized as “other immigration violator,” with 11% being fast tracked for deportation.

Bleeding Heartland is keeping the authors’ names confidential, as well as the location in Iowa where these detentions occurred.

June 16, 2025 began like any other morning for two hardworking men in an Iowa community. As dawn broke, the first—a restaurant employee driving to work—was boxed in by two unmarked cars. Masked figures jumped out, ordered him from his vehicle, and whisked him away.

Three friends, trailing behind, watched in horror, as it appeared their fellow worker was being kidnapped. One friend ran to move the abandoned car off the street, unaware that other masked men lurked nearby. He, too, was seized and driven away. Only two witnesses in the second car remained to tell the tale.

Friends and families did not learn these men’s whereabouts for thirteen hours, when their names were found on ICE’s (Immigration and Customs Enforcement, part of the US Homeland Security) detainee roster at Polk County Jail—a facility paid by ICE for housing ICE detainees. After 48 hours there, they were transferred to Pine Prairie Correctional Facility in rural Louisiana for four more days.

Relatives feared the worst: forced deportation to El Salvador’s CECOT terrorism center. Eight days post-abduction, a family member in El Salvador sent a photo of the two reunited with loved ones in their country of birth. Thankfully, both were released to family members in El Salvador and spared the CECOT prison.

ICE has been carrying out similar detentions resembling abductions around the country since January 20. Daily ICE arrests in Iowa have nearly tripled in the last six months compared to 2024; this rate of growth places Iowa twelfth in the nation. Despite at least 430 ICE arrests in five months in Iowa, only about five incidents have been reported in the press. Fear silences witnesses, yet we must not remain silent.

What happened to these Iowa neighbors violates their constitutional rights. The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit any government deprivation of “life, liberty, or property without due process.” This protection applies to everyone within U.S. jurisdiction, regardless of citizenship. Border crossing without papers is a misdemeanor, not a felony. ICE cannot unilaterally declare it a crime or bypass due process.

ICE’s tactics—masked agents, unmarked cars, no judicial warrants—evoke images of the Gestapo. Only a state or federal judge (not an immigration judge, who is under Homeland Security) may issue a lawful warrant. Administrative orders from ICE lack the force of constitutional law and can be refused.

Allies and immigrant families must prepare by visiting the Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice website for Know-Your-Rights cards and related information. This page from the ACLU of Iowa is also useful.

In addition, refugees and immigrants should always carry documents proving their legal status and entry dates.

Stopping these abuses requires action by U.S. citizens and other allies. We must make nonviolent “good trouble”:

Petition and protest to members of Congress. Tell them that immigrants are vital to Iowa’s growth and vitality, and that ICE’s due-process violations contradict the “Iowa nice” ethos.

Pressure the Iowa Department of Public Safety to rescind its 287(g) agreement with ICE, signed in March 2025, which deputizes selected state troopers to arrest immigrants on ICE’s behalf without proper warrants.

Urge the sheriffs of the six counties with jails that house ICE detainees to end those agreements with ICE. Polk, Pottawattamie, Linn, Woodbury, Muscatine, and Hardin Counties have such agreements. Constituents should meet with their local sheriffs and demand that they end or not renew their contracts with ICE.

Organize community allies to educate neighbors about their rights and establish rapid-response plans for ICE raids.

The Trump administration plans to ramp up detentions under the so-called “One Big, Beautiful Bill.” Effective October 1, 2025, that law nearly quadruples funding for detention centers, triples border-wall spending, and adds 10,000 ICE officers.

The rampant use—and abuse—of this “shadow docket” exploded after Trump’s three appointees during his first term solidified the current six-vote far-right majority on the Supreme Court.
The Trump administration filed 41 during his first term, generally to swat away challenges to extensions of executive power, and the Supreme Court granted 28.
When Joe Biden became president in 2021, however, the Supreme Court reversed course, repeatedly granting emergency petitions opposed by the administration.
It is clear that the Supreme Court is committed to using all its tools to dismantle democratic institutions and formalize a dictatorial regime.","On September 8, the six-justice fascist majority on the United States Supreme Court repudiated with no explanation whatsoever the constitutional principle that government agents must have individualized “reasonable suspicion” based on something more than ethnicity, employment or whereabouts to seize a person for investigation of immigration status.

This appalling ruling adds to the growing list of recent Supreme Court “emergency” interventions in pending lawsuits, most of which favor the Republican Party and particularly the expansion of executive powers under President Donald Trump, who openly seeks to wield dictatorial power.

Traditionally, the Supreme Court presides above the nation’s lower courts like a Colossus of Rhodes, granting “petitions for certiorari” to review between 50 and 100 cases of the several thousand submitted that term, starting on the first Monday of October and ending before the July 4 holiday. Each case should have already been fully litigated in the lower courts and present an important question of law that is either in conflict or unsettled in the lower courts. The resulting decisions are published in detailed written opinions that serve as binding legal precedents for future cases and, not infrequently, are accompanied by concurrences or dissents to elaborate on the reasoning of individual justices.

Until quite recently, the Supreme Court rarely granted emergency petitions, an “extraordinary” judicial power that is supposed to be used sparingly, and only to maintain the “status quo” and to prevent “irreparable injury” while the glacial judicial processes work themselves out. The rampant use—and abuse—of this “shadow docket” exploded after Trump’s three appointees during his first term solidified the current six-vote far-right majority on the Supreme Court.

The previous administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama filed only eight emergency petitions over the first 16 years of this century. The Trump administration filed 41 during his first term, generally to swat away challenges to extensions of executive power, and the Supreme Court granted 28.

When Joe Biden became president in 2021, however, the Supreme Court reversed course, repeatedly granting emergency petitions opposed by the administration. The two most notorious rulings, both during his first year in office, terminated an eviction moratorium intended to stop the spread of COVID-19 and forced immigrants seeking asylum to remain in Mexico while their applications were pending.

Later in Biden’s term, the Supreme Court majority used the shadow docket to vacate a lower court ruling by a three-judge panel that included two Trump appointees, reinstating Alabama pro-Republican congressional gerrymandering, preventing US Border Patrol agents from removing razor wire laid along the the Rio Grande at the direction of Texas Governor Greg Abbott, and blocking the restoration of 1,600 voters summarily struck from Virginia voter rolls under a Republican-backed program targeting supposed noncitizens.

In its first 20 weeks, the current Trump administration filed 19 emergency petitions, the same number the Biden administration filed over four years, and the Supreme Court ruled for Trump on 84 percent of them.

Particular outrage followed last week’s shadow docket order that blocked a temporary restraining order (TRO) entered last July by Los Angeles federal judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong to prevent roving ICE patrols from seizing people based solely on “(1) apparent race or ethnicity, (2) speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent; (3) presence at a particular location; or (4) the type of work one does,” and then holding them without access to courts or their attorneys.

The majority’s shadow docket order says absolutely nothing about Judge Frimpong’s 52-page explanation for her TRO, nor the Ninth Circuit’s 61-page order upholding it. Both are grounded in the Fourth Amendment’s explicit requirement of “probable cause,” which expresses the fundamental democratic principle that the government cannot seize human beings without “individualized suspicion” that they engaged in unlawful activities, as well as the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee of due process, including access to courts and legal counsel.

Although there was no opinion for “the Court,” Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh filed a concurring opinion claiming that racial and employment profiling is justified because “10 percent of the people in the Los Angeles region,” which he estimates to be 2 million, are “illegal immigrants” responsible for “myriad significant economic and social problems.”

Kavanaugh’s numbers are vague and inflated. US Census estimates for 2023 are that undocumented immigrants comprise 7.1 percent of the greater Los Angeles population, about a million people, which includes growing percentages from all regions of Asia, Europe and Africa, as well as Latin America.

Kavanaugh’s claim of “myriad significant economic and social problems” derives from right-wing talking points, not evidence. A recent study by the University of California Merced reports that for California as a whole, only 22 percent of undocumented immigrants have less than five years of residency. Nearly two-thirds have lived in the state for more than a decade, including 44 percent with over 20 years of residence. The value of their labor to California’s economy is estimated at $275 billion annually.

Kavanaugh dismissed the litany of horror stories recounted in the lower court record about the methods used by ICE agents during their arbitrary sweeps, claiming without evidence that for “stops of those individuals who are legally in the country, the questioning in those circumstances is typically brief, and those individuals may promptly go free after making clear to the immigration officers that they are US citizens or otherwise legally in the United States.”

For Kavanaugh, and presumably the other five fascists who voted with him, the Fourth Amendment requirement of probable cause allows Trump’s ICE Gestapo to demand, “Your papers, please!” based solely on someone’s ethnic appearance, language or accent, employment or whereabouts.

“To the extent that excessive force has been used” by a federal agent, Kavanaugh added, “the Fourth Amendment prohibits such action, and remedies should be available in federal court.”

This comment is particularly rich coming from a Supreme Court justice who has voted with the majority to block civil rights suits against federal police under the landmark 1971 case of Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, not to mention virtually all constitutional claims against local police, especially those concerning excessive force, by expanding “qualified immunity” into a virtual bar for recovery.

Lauren Bonds, the executive director of the National Police Accountability Project, told CNN, “What we’ve seen is, term after term, the court limiting the avenues that people have available to sue the federal government.”

“It’s bordering on impossible to get any sort of remedy in a federal court when a federal officer violates federal rights,” Patrick Jaicomo, a senior attorney at the libertarian Institute for Justice, told CNN.

Kavanaugh began his right-wing legal career as a lawyer for Kenneth Starr’s phony investigation of then-President Bill Clinton, who was impeached for denying consensual oral sex in the oval office. At an event held at a Waco, Texas community college on September 11 to honor Starr, who died in 2022, Kavanaugh gaslit the audience with the claim that the Constitution’s “framers recognized in a way that I think is brilliant, that preserving liberty requires separating the power. No one person or group of people should have too much power in our system.”

He was refuted by demonstrators across the street, who held signs such as “BK—Trump Flunky” and, with reference to last year’s notorious ruling giving Trump broad presidential immunity, “Shame on you. No one is above the law.”

In the August 2025 Gallup survey, the Supreme Court’s approval rating fell to 39 percent, the first time it has ever been below 40 percent, including record lows of 11 percent among Democrats and 34 percent for independents.

Willian Alberto Giménez González, who came to Chicago from Venezuela in 2023, was detained Friday when he went to a barbershop in the Little Village neighborhood, according to the petition filed in U.S. District Court.

He’s being housed at the Department of Homeland Security’s processing center in west suburban Broadview, the petition stated.

Kevin Herrera, Giménez González’s lawyer, said Saturday he believes the arrest was related to his client’s participation in a 2024 lawsuit against Home Depot, Inc. and the city of Chicago that contends security personnel profiled and struck Giménez González while he was outside a store seeking day work.

That lawsuit is pending at the same Dirksen U.S. Courthouse where Giménez González filed his petition Sunday.

Federal authorities said in a statement Saturday that Giménez González was in the country illegally and had been ordered deported by an immigration judge last year after he failed to show up to court.

“There is nothing unjust about enforcing the law and ensuring this illegal alien adheres to the laws of the United States,” Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a written statement. “ICE arrested Willian Alberto Giménez González for being in the country illegally.”

Giménez González’s petition stated he was “absent from an immigration hearing” in Memphis, Tennessee, in April 2024 “due to extraordinary circumstances,” and was ordered removed from the country “in absentia.”

He’s since appealed the ruling and his next hearing is set for July 2026 in Chicago, according to the petition.

In addition to a request barring deportation, the petition also asked a federal judge to prohibit Giménez González’s transfer to a different processing location outside Illinois. Federal officials have three days to respond.

His plight comes nearly a week after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced the Chicago-based immigration crackdown. It’s unclear how many people have been arrested in the area, but advocates have said the number of calls to their hotlines has been unusually high. The administration of President Donald Trump contends it has detained the “worst of the worst” in the operation.

At a protest Saturday outside the Broadview facility, Herrera said, “These are trying times for the legal system and the rights it protects.”

“But the community assembled here knows that people hold the powerful to account,” he said. “We will fight for Willian, and we will see to it that he is free to be with us in Chicago and to contribute to the city in all of the ways he has since he arrived. That’s a promise.”

Democratic U.S. Reps. Delia Ramírez and Jesús “Chuy” García also attended the event.

“Willian has to be released if we are a country of freedom and justice,” Ramírez said in Spanish. “Freedom and justice is what we say when we make our commitment to this country. Justice says Willian has to be in the house with (his wife) Mary, today.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CTC-L-Great-Lakes-Naval-protest009.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-09-14 23:56:49.776639

The protests came after a deadly ICE operation in nearby Franklin Park, Illinois, that killed one man during an attempted arrest.

Hundreds of protesters gathered outside Milwaukee's Federal Building, organized by the Milwaukee Fights Back Coalition, a group of grassroots and labor organizations opposing the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.

The demonstration was sparked by an ICE operation Friday in Franklin Park, Illinois, where federal officials say an officer shot and killed Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez. Authorities said Villegas-Gonzalez allegedly injured an ICE agent during an attempted arrest. According to a family GoFundMe, Villegas-Gonzalez died shortly after dropping off his sons at school.

""We saw what unfolded on Friday, where ICE agents invaded Franklin Park, Illinois and murdered Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez,"" said Alan Chavoya from the Freedom Road Socialist Organization.

The incident added fresh urgency to calls for accountability from immigration advocates who question the targeting practices of ICE operations.

""Over 90% of people being detained by ICE have no criminal background, so what's this whole thing of targeting criminals?"" Chavoya said.

Ether Cavaera from Milwaukee Alliance Against Racism and Political Repression emphasized the human impact of the operations.

""We are talking about ICE ripping people from their families,"" Cavaera said.

Katie Wagner, a protester from Menomonee Falls, said she joined the demonstration because of her concerns for the country and wanted her voice heard.

""We need to send a really strong message that we don't want ICE acting illegally in our city,"" Wagner said.

Wagner added that listening to others' experiences has shaped her perspective.

""When I hear what their experience is, I have to believe them. I have to know that is what they are experiencing. That's not what I experienced, but I have to have compassion and dare I say the dirty word, empathy for other people,"" Wagner said.

For protesters like Cavaera, the message to Milwaukee leaders was clear that this demonstration was just the beginning.

""Be prepared, that if you're not doing your job and protecting those Milwaukeeans and those citizens, we will be having this exact march outside your office,"" Cavaera said.

The protesters said they will continue to mobilize until ICE operations end in every city.

In response to recent protests, Homeland Security officials said ""Operation Midway Blitz"" in Chicago has led to the arrests of undocumented immigrants convicted of crimes, including assault and driving under the influence.

On Friday, U.S. District Judge Mary S.

In their complaint, lawyers for the groups — which are being represented by Democracy Forward, National Homelessness Law Center, Lawyers' Committee for Rhode Island, and ACLU Foundation of Rhode Island — describe how Congress appropriated $75 million for HUD to build permanent supportive housing for people in need. The department identified ""qualified projects"" and was ""prepared to award these essential funds"" through federal grants before it allegedly ""reversed course"" last week as the grants are set to expire on Sept. 30.

""I think that it's unfortunate that we're here on these things that are done so last minute by these agencies,"" McElroy, who was appointed by Trump in 2019, said Friday during a hearing held over Zoom, according to Reuters. She reportedly accused the administration of creating ""chaos"" with a policy that she agreed was rushed.

The government is allegedly seeking new applicants based on ""newly announced criteria,"" according to the groups' lawsuit, which was filed Thursday.

""Under these new criteria, HUD will only award those funds for projects in jurisdictions aligned with the Administration's broader social policy views and to applicants that will commit to them,"" the complaint says. ""And HUD is rushing the funds out the door, promising to award them during a seven day period on a first-come, first-served basis for projects that clear its ideological threshold.""

According to the groups, the government now disqualifies from consideration ""any entity seeking to build housing in a jurisdiction with policies the administration disfavors,"" per the complaint. This means there will be no funding for projects in a city or state that has not adopted the administration's ""draconian approach to local homelessness policies"" and agreed to help enforce federal immigration law.

The groups argue that the government is violating the Constitution and does not have the authority to hold back funds in this way. They asked the court Thursday in the complaint to halt the ""current rushed, unlawful award process"" and preserve the funds at issue from expiration, allowing for their ""prompt award"" for projects that meet ""lawful"" criteria.

Shaping the future of EU migration policy Europe is at a turning point in how it handles migration.","15 Sep 2025

European governments are stepping up talks on whether to send asylum seekers to countries outside the EU under expanded “safe third country” rules. The Council of Europe has warned that this could put migrants in danger, including torture or death.

A draft deal in the EU Council would give member states more freedom to reject asylum claims if another country is labeled safe, even if the migrant has little or no link to it.

At the same time, the Council of Europe’s Human Rights Chief Michael O’Flaherty has warned that shifting asylum processing elsewhere can cause “severe trauma and prolonged suffering” for people moved under these plans.

Broader leeway for declaring countries “safe”

The “safe third country” rule, updated in the EU’s Migration and Asylum Pact in May 2024, is now up for more changes. Under the current system, asylum seekers can only be sent to a country if they have some link to it, like family or past residence.

The new draft compromise, reviewed by Euractiv, would loosen this rule. It says links could include family, prior residence, cultural or language ties, or “other similar ties.”

It also widens the meaning of “transit” to cover cases where someone only passed through an airport or entered the EU after staying in another country.

Unaccompanied children, who were previously excluded, could also be transferred if the move fits international and EU law. The text calls these cases rare but removes the EU-wide ban.

These talks build on the May 2024 reform, which already allowed countries outside the 1951 Geneva Refugee Convention to be labeled safe, and even let states be considered safe only for certain groups or regions.

Council raises human rights concerns

The Council of Europe, a 46-nation human rights body based in Strasbourg and separate from the EU, has strongly warned against sending asylum seekers to third countries.

O’Flaherty said that these policies “expose men, women, and children to significant risks of severe trauma and prolonged suffering.”

He highlighted threats such as torture, arbitrary detention, blocked access to asylum, and large-scale deportations once migrants arrive.

The Council urged governments to consider the harm such transfers may cause and to uphold their human rights and democratic obligations.

It also stressed that many migrants sent under these deals have no real ties to the destination country, raising serious fairness and ethical issues.

Global backdrop, national experiments

The Council of Europe’s warning comes as more governments test policies that shift migration control to other countries. Since January 2025, the United States under President Donald Trump has signed deals to deport migrants to South Sudan, Eswatini, El Salvador, and Rwanda. Critics pointed out that most of these migrants have no real connection to those countries.

The United Kingdom also tried to set up a plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda, but the Labour government under Keir Starmer dropped it after taking office in July 2024. More recently, the UK and France agreed on a deal: London can return migrants caught in the Channel to France, while Paris can send the same number back across the border.

Italy has gone further. In 2023, it opened two centers in Albania—one in Gjader and one in Shengjin—to handle asylum claims from migrants rescued in the central Mediterranean. Other EU countries have shown interest in copying this approach.

Rise of externalization highlighted

Human rights groups and intergovernmental bodies warned that these policies often overlook the realities awaiting migrants in destination states. According to the Council, asylum seekers sent abroad face heightened risks of ill-treatment, with limited access to legal support and uncertain protection guarantees.

Outsourcing asylum processes also raises questions about whether states are shifting responsibilities that should remain under their own jurisdiction.

The organization stressed that while governments are under pressure to manage irregular migration, solutions must not violate fundamental rights.

Legal, political challenges inside EU

The proposed compromise text is being debated within the Council, where member states are split between those seeking stricter controls on migration and those emphasizing human rights safeguards.

Some capitals viewed expanded “safe third country” transfers as a way to deter irregular arrivals and ease domestic political pressure.

Others worried about potential violations of international obligations, particularly the principle of non-refoulement, which forbids returning individuals to places where they risk persecution.

The negotiations form part of the wider rollout of the EU Pact on Migration and Asylum, due to apply from summer 2026. The pact also includes a new return regulation and an updated list of safe countries of origin, which remain under negotiation.

Implications for people on the move

For short-term and long-term visitors to the EU, the ongoing negotiations signal a tightening environment where border checks and cooperation with non-EU countries may increase.

The upcoming launch of the European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS), expected in 2026, will already require non-EU nationals from visa-exempt countries to obtain pre-travel clearance.

Observers noted that expanded “safe third country” policies could interact with ETIAS by reinforcing the EU’s broader strategy of pre-screening and externalising migration control.

Migrants seeking protection may find themselves diverted to states with which they have no real ties.

This risks creating uncertainty for those fleeing conflict zones and could complicate the legal landscape for individuals already in Europe but awaiting asylum hearings.

Shaping the future of EU migration policy

Europe is at a turning point in how it handles migration. The Council of Europe has warned that sending people to a “safe third country” could expose them to torture, detention, or loss of the right to seek asylum.

At the same time, EU governments are discussing new rules that would make it easier to send asylum seekers to countries outside the bloc. These decisions will affect not just borders, but also how Europe defines its values.

The debate over the “safe third country” idea comes down to a basic question: who decides where safety begins and ends—and what kind of Europe will that choice create?",https://etias.com/assets/uploads/imagery/blog/refugees-sitting-behind-metal-fence.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 20:56:45.309192

While all looked normal on the route, there was an underlying fear that federal agents may try to conduct immigration enforcement during the parade. Heightened concerns follow the Department of Homeland Security's launch of ""Operation Midway Blitz"" to ""target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois.""

During the parade, dozens and dozens of colorfully decorated floats made their way down a two-and-a-half mile stretch of 26th Street.

Crowds of people lined the street -- watching the horses and dancing -- all in honor of Mexican heritage.

But there were fewer people than years past.

One woman NBC Chicago spoke to was passing out flyers – encouraging residents to know their rights in case of any run-ins with federal agents.

""We know a lot of people are scared,"" said Isabel Aguilar with the Progressive Latino Institute. ""We have to let them know they have rights, and if they are scared, there is always a way they can someone to help.""

To our knowledge, there were no arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement or any federal authorities.

The parade appeared to have gone on without any major issues.

Still, the feeling of uncertainty remained for some people in this neighborhood… worried for their friends, family and neighbors.

""It’s really unfortunate what’s going on with ICE, but if we keep doing this, they can back off and realize you can’t break this community for anything,"" said paradegoer Joshua Lopez.

""...But that’s why us, who were born here, are here to show our face, and we’re here,"" she stated.

CADOJ cited L.A. County Board of Supervisors v. Superior Court, a 2016 case in which the California Supreme Court ruled “real-time disclosure of ongoing spending amounts can indirectly reveal clues about legal strategy, especially when multiple amounts over time are compared.”

But government transparency experts say taxpayers have a right to know what the state is doing with their money.

“We as an organization have always thought that ruling sweeps far too broadly,” said David Snyder, executive director of the First Amendment Coalition, in an interview with The Center Square. “How much money is spent on public agency litigation is an important thing that the public should be able to know.”

The Center Square requested CADOJ disclose how much it has spent on its lawsuits against the Trump administration, including both through internal resources and outside counsel.

CADOJ confirmed that it has spent the $5 million allocated by Gov. Gavin Newsom’s “Trump-proofing” legal fund passed in a January special legislative session and that it has records of how much it has spent.

“While the Department has records responsive to your request for how much has been spent so far on the lawsuits against the current federal administration, the Department declines to produce cost records that are privileged attorney-client communications, or reflect attorney work product, both of which are incorporated into the PRA and made exempt from disclosure by Government Code section 7927.705,” wrote Deputy Attorney General Mayara Si to The Center Square. “Disclosing cost totals could provide insight into litigation strategy or legal consultation, especially in the context of active and ongoing litigation.”

“The Department can confirm, however, that it has spent the $5 million that were allocated to the Department from the Department of Finance pursuant to SBX1-1 at the time the SB X1-1 Annual Report was finalized,” Si wrote.

CADOJ shared its first annual report on “Trump-proofing” spending published on August 1, 2025, which stated the agency had not yet contracted with any outside counsel on these federal lawsuits.

“The $5 million in SBX1-1 funds that the Department has received to date has contributed to – but in no way has been sufficient to cover – the costs of the litigation,” wrote CADOJ. “The Department has not used any SBX1-1 allocated funds to contract with outside counsel for the purposes of legal representation in connection with any federal accountability matter.”

However, with CADOJ reporting that it had not yet spent any funds on outside counsel as of July 31, it’s unclear how sharing how much it has spent on internal staff in its lawsuits against the federal government would reveal legal strategy.

“The caselaw allowing agencies to withhold attorney billing statements in some circumstances applies only to bills from outside counsel, not the time agency lawyers may have spent on any given matter,” Snyder said. “The people deserve to know how agency employees spend their time, at least at the aggregate level, because those employees’ salaries are paid by taxpayers. It’s hard to imagine how an aggregate total of time spent by agency lawyers could implicate attorney-client privilege concerns.”

A U.S. diplomat expressed regret over an immigration raid in Georgia that detained hundreds of South Korean workers. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau proposed using the incident as an opportunity to strengthen bilateral relations, noting President Trump's interest in the case.

A top U.S. diplomat expressed regret on Sunday over an immigration raid in the state of Georgia that detained hundreds of South Korean workers and proposed making the event a turning point to strengthen bilateral relations, South Korea said.

In a meeting in Seoul, First Vice Foreign Minister Park Yoon-joo urged Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau to push forward bilateral discussions on follow-up measures, including a new visa category, the foreign ministry said in a statement. Some 300 South Korean workers returned home to cheers and emotional reunions on Friday, a week after being detained in the massive immigration raid at a Hyundai Motor battery plant - an event that sent shockwaves across South Korea, a key U.S. ally.

""Deputy Secretary Landau expressed deep regret over the incident and proposed using it as a turning point to improve the system and strengthen the South Korea-U.S. relationship,"" the ministry said, adding that Landau said President Donald Trump had ""high interest"" in the case. After the raid, Trump had suggested that the Koreans stay in the U.S. if they wished, and the negotiations with U.S. officials were straightforward, South Korea's top security adviser said on Friday.

To prevent the recurrence of such an incident, Seoul has called on the U.S. to provide clear guidelines for existing business visas and create a new visa category for Korean professionals to support massive investment projects by Korean businesses in the U.S.

In Sunday's meeting, Landau called for Washington and Seoul to speed up working-level consultations to ensure the issuance of visas commensurate with the contributions of Korean workers, noting that Korean investments help rebuild manufacturing in the U.S., the ministry said.

The U.S. Embassy in Seoul could not immediately be reached for comment. Park called Landau's visit ""timely"" in the wake of the raid, the ministry said, quoting Landau as mentioning President Donald Trump's decision that the Korean workers would not face any disadvantages when they re-enter the U.S.

This legal battle is just one front in a broader conflict over immigration that has left the Trump administration navigating a treacherous political landscape.","On September 13, 2025, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction that temporarily blocks the Trump administration from enforcing a sweeping new policy that would bar undocumented immigrants from accessing a wide array of federally funded programs, including child care, health care, and education services. The ruling, secured by California Attorney General Rob Bonta and a coalition of 20 other state leaders, comes at a time when President Donald Trump’s immigration agenda is facing mounting resistance—not just from political opponents, but from within his own party and even his administration’s business allies.

The Trump administration’s proposed policy, which would require federally funded programs to verify the immigration status of recipients, sought to overturn a Clinton-era policy that allowed people living in the country without legal permission to access “public benefit” programs. According to administration officials, the change was necessary to ensure that taxpayer-funded resources “are no longer used to incentivize illegal immigration.”

But as reported by The New York Times and echoed by Raw Story, this hardline approach has increasingly collided with economic realities and the interests of American businesses. President Trump entered his second term in January 2025 promising both the “largest deportation program in American history” and a “golden age” for American businesses. However, the tension between these two promises has become increasingly visible in recent weeks, as Trump has reversed or softened some of his most significant anti-immigration policies whenever they threatened to disrupt the economy.

California’s lawsuit, filed in July 2025, argued that the Trump administration’s new verification requirements would not only cause irreparable harm to vulnerable families but also have a chilling effect on all program participants, regardless of their immigration status. The coalition of states also warned that the proposed changes would cost their economies hundreds of millions of dollars. “With today’s decision, vital education, nutrition and health programs like Head Start — and the families who rely on their services — can breathe a sigh of relief,” said Attorney General Bonta. “The Trump Administration continues to pull the rug out from under California families just trying to get by, but we’re fighting back. We’re grateful that a district court has put a stop to this cruel new directive while our litigation continues.”

The programs that would have been affected by the Trump administration’s restrictions are extensive. They include childcare services for low-income families, adult education, mental health and substance use disorder programs, temporary housing assistance, food banks, cooling centers, and shelters for at-risk youth and domestic violence survivors. One of the most significant is Head Start, a national program serving more than 750,000 low-income children aged 0 to 5 across the United States, providing free school meals, medical screenings, child care, and support and job assistance for parents.

This legal battle is just one front in a broader conflict over immigration that has left the Trump administration navigating a treacherous political landscape. According to The New York Times, Trump’s efforts to crack down on illegal border crossings and restrict immigration have been celebrated by his base, but his willingness to reverse or contradict these policies when they threaten economic interests has infuriated his far-right allies and confused those charged with enforcing his agenda. David J. Bier, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, summed up the president’s approach: “His heart isn’t in the nativist purge the way that the rest of his administration’s heart is into it. He’s always been someone who likes to dabble in that type of rhetoric. But at the same time, he’s always had a soft spot for the economic needs from a business perspective.”

One recent flashpoint involved a high-profile immigration raid at the construction site of an electric vehicle battery plant in Georgia. Last week, immigration agents arrested nearly 500 workers, most of them South Korean citizens, at the site. The move caused deep anger in South Korea—a key U.S. ally and trading partner—and threatened to discourage the kind of foreign investment in U.S. manufacturing that Trump has championed. In response, Trump temporarily paused the deportations to consider allowing the workers to stay and help finish the factory, according to officials in Seoul. Most of the workers ultimately returned to South Korea, but the incident underscored the administration’s struggle to balance tough immigration enforcement with the needs of the economy.

Similar contradictions have emerged around the issue of student visas. In May, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the administration would “aggressively revoke” visas of Chinese students and “enhance scrutiny” of future applicants from China. Yet just two months later, Trump shocked his conservative allies by declaring he would let 600,000 Chinese students attend American universities. “I like that other countries’ students come here,” Trump said. “And you know what would happen if they didn’t? Our college system would go to hell very quickly.” The move sparked criticism from Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who questioned, “Why the administration would allow 600,000 students from China to replace our American student’s opportunities?” and declared, “We should never allow that.”

Trump’s shifting stances have also affected other sectors of the economy. In June, he acknowledged that aggressive immigration enforcement was hurting industries such as agriculture, hotels, and leisure, whose leaders complained that their “very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace.” In response, ICE officials temporarily advised agents to avoid enforcement at work sites in these industries, only to later walk back the guidance and insist that all operations remained on the table.

Throughout his presidency, Trump has attempted to satisfy both immigration hard-liners and business leaders who rely on immigrant labor. During his transition, he even expressed support for granting permanent residency to immigrants who graduate from U.S. colleges, saying, “You graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country, and that includes junior colleges.” Yet, hours later, his spokesman clarified that an “aggressive vetting process” would be imposed for foreign students. Since then, the administration has rescinded hundreds of student visas and moved to revoke green cards from pro-Palestinian protesters or scholars.

Mark Krikorian, head of the Center for Immigration Studies, noted that business interests have long influenced Republican administrations’ immigration policies. “There’s no question that the concerns of businesses are going to get a hearing in a Republican administration or a Republican Congress, but it’s not going to be the kind of relationship that existed in the past,” he said. Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, a former acting deputy homeland security secretary, added, “The president is a businessman. He has a concern when people say, ‘You know, I won’t be able to do business.’”

As the legal fight over access to public benefits for undocumented immigrants continues, the Trump administration finds itself caught between the demands of its political base and the practical realities of governing a complex, interconnected economy. The outcome of the litigation—and the broader debate over how to balance immigration enforcement with economic growth—will likely shape the future of American policy for years to come.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/XItev62DYjoeYeiKFW1FPzJADV0=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2Fsources%2F9941cd43-9bae-4fe1-8e60-c026fa992f16.jpeg,N,,2025-09-14 23:00:06.028903

Her family says she has no criminal record and had been attending regular immigration check-ins every six months.

On Friday, around 200 people carrying placards reading “Bring Grandma Home” and “Hands Off Our Grandma” gathered at the intersection of Appian Way and San Pablo Dam Road, below the El Sobrante Sikh Gurdwara, demanding her release.

On September 8, Kaur, a longtime Hercules resident, was taken into custody by ICE after attending what was supposed to be a routine immigration appointment in San Francisco. Her family claims she was later transferred to the Mesa Verde ICE Processing Centre in Bakersfield.

Kaur immigrated to the US in 1992 as a single mother of two sons and had complied with immigration requirements. For the past 13 years, she had been reporting to ICE in San Francisco every six months without fail. In 2012, her asylum claim was denied, after which she remained under ICE supervision.

Hundreds of people protesting her detention said she is “everyone’s grandma”. The demonstration was organised by her family, the Sikh Center, and advocacy group Indivisible West Contra Costa. Passing cars honked in support during the two-hour protest, which was also joined by staff from Congressman John Garamendi’s office and Hercules City Council member Dilli Bhattarai.

Her family has launched a campaign website, bringharjithome.com, urging supporters to contact elected officials, including Garamendi, Senators Alex Padilla and Laphonza Butler, and the White House.

Kaur’s granddaughter, Sukhdeep Kaur, told local media that her grandmother “is not a criminal” and that the love and support shown have been a source of strength for their family. The family also raised concerns about her health, as she suffers from thyroid issues, knee pain, migraines, and anxiety.

While addressing the gathering, Manjit Kaur, her daughter-in-law, said she is praying for her mother-in-law’s wellbeing.

State Senator Jesse Arreguín also condemned the detention, writing on X: “Over 70% of people arrested by ICE have no criminal conviction. Now, they are literally going after peaceful grandmothers. This shameful act is harming our communities.

Alan Chavoya, an organizer for the Freedom Road Socialist Organization, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that it is important for community members to make their voices heard and for Milwaukee to step up and be ready to push back against ICE operations in the city.

""We might be distinct movements, but we have a common enemy,"" Chavoya said. ""We don't need to see eye to eye ideologically but we do need to see eye to eye in our care for our city, our communities and our people.""

The protest, organized by the Milwaukee Fights Back Coalition, was planned in support of anti-ICE protests in Chicago, and comes just days after federal immigration agents fatally shot a man in an Northwest Chicago suburb.

The fatal shooting of Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez took place about a week into Operation Midway Blitz, a crackdown on immigration enforcement in the Chicago area ordered by President Donald Trump.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a press release on Sept. 12 that Villegas-Gonzalez ignored commands from federal agents when they attempted to conduct a vehicle stop as part of an ""enforcement operation targeting a criminal illegal alien.""

One of the ICE officers was hit and dragged by the car before he fired his weapon.

“We are praying for the speedy recovery of our law enforcement officer. He followed his training, used appropriate force, and properly enforced the law to protect the public and law enforcement,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a press release. “Viral social media videos and activists encouraging illegal aliens to resist law enforcement not only spread misinformation, but also undermine public safety, as well as the safety of our officers and those being apprehended.”

Speaker Jacob Flom, an organizer from the Milwaukee Area Labor Council, also emphasized the importance of fighting for better protections for working undocumented immigrants to prevent ICE from doing checks in the workplace.

Flom told the crowd that the Milwaukee area is a strong middle class community because of the work unions have done, urging protesters to look back at the city's labor movement history to learn how to better protect working immigrants to ""fight back against this ICE terror.""

Attendees clapped and cheered after each speech, waving signs that read ""join us before it's too late,"" ""labor against ICE terror"" and ""hands of Chicago, hands of Midwest.""

Since Trump took office in January, ICE agents have quadrupled arrests of people in Wisconsin with pending criminal cases, according to a Journal Sentinel analysis.

After the opening speeches, protesters marched from the federal courthouse to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services field office on West Wisconsin Avenue.","https://www.jsonline.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/14/PMJS/86154894007-img-7447.JPG?crop=639,361,x0,y59&width=639&height=361&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-14 18:56:52.609216

Together, these rules narrow illegal immigrants’ chances of winning reprieve from deportation.
“Nonenforcement of the laws by the Biden administration caused the backlog to explode and incentivized even more illegal immigration.
Ms. Bondi’s decisions in two immigration cases, under her power as attorney general, resulted in changes to the standards for asylum.
The Trump administration has reportedly fired dozens of immigration judges, particularly those who were profligate with granting asylum.","The Trump administration has quietly rewritten the rule book this month for illegal immigrants seeking asylum in the U.S., making it tougher to win their cases and easier for judges to dismiss them while erasing an incentive for migrants to even try.

The changes emerged in a series of immigration court decisions.

Attorney General Pam Bondi issued rulings tightening asylum, and the Board of Immigration Appeals barred most illegal immigrants from winning release on bond and allowed judges to “pretermit” asylum claims that appeared bogus.

Previously, judges had to hold a hearing that could last several hours, even if it was clear from the start that the migrant had no hope of winning asylum.

Together, these rules narrow illegal immigrants’ chances of winning reprieve from deportation.

Andrew “Art” Arthur, a former immigration judge, said those with strong cases should be able to win asylum faster. Those with fraudulent or bogus claims will be denied and perhaps deported faster.

He said the decision last week to allow judges to speed through cases without a chance of success is a “game changer.” It effectively creates a form of summary judgment, a standard process for regular courts, in the immigration court system.

“It’s a huge time savings,” said Mr. Arthur, now with the Center for Immigration Studies.

Although most of the focus in immigration enforcement is on the Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department plays a crucial role by overseeing the immigration courts, which rule on asylum claims and order deportations for those found in the country’s interior.

Over the past decade, the courts have become the soft underbelly of the system. Migrants figured out that bringing bogus asylum claims can delay deportation for years, giving them a foothold in the United States.

The Biden administration made a bad situation exponentially worse. Pending court cases surged from 1.5 million at the end of fiscal year 2020 to more than 4.2 million late last year.

The Trump administration cut the number to less than 3.8 million as of July, and judges were completing cases at more than double the pace. The drop in new cases reflects an astonishingly quiet border.

A senior Justice Department official said the changes will do even more.

“Nonenforcement of the laws by the Biden administration caused the backlog to explode and incentivized even more illegal immigration. These decisions reflect the attorney general’s commitment to reversing those trends and enforcing the immigration laws as written,” the official told The Washington Times.

Immigrant rights advocates have warned that some of the changes will devastate immigrants. The bond policy, for example, could force many to decide between long-term detention to fight their cases or accepting deportations they don’t want.

The decision applies to those who jumped the border — in formal terms, entered without inspection — and reached the interior.

Previously, an immigration judge could release an asylum-seeker on bond if they didn’t have a serious criminal record and weren’t deemed a danger or flight risk. In a Sept. 5 ruling, the Board of Immigration Appeals said they could be treated like new arrivals at the border, which meant no bond, because they hadn’t been formally admitted.

“The BIA’s decision to remove the long-standing authority of immigration judges to conduct bond hearings will subject millions of people, many of whom have lived and contributed to our nation for years, to detention without a fair judicial review of their cases,” said Sui Chung, executive director of Americans for Immigrant Justice.

Ms. Bondi’s decisions in two immigration cases, under her power as attorney general, resulted in changes to the standards for asylum.

In one, she said that claiming fear of gangs back home isn’t sufficient to obtain asylum. In another, she said the fear of domestic violence didn’t qualify.

Both decisions mark a return to policies from the first Trump administration, which Attorney General Merrick Garland overturned during the Biden administration.

Activists were dismayed by the Bondi revivals.

“This is a blatant power grab by Trump’s Justice Department,” said Karen Musalo, director of the Center for Gender & Refugee Studies at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco, which has been involved in litigation related to the on-again, off-again policy changes over the years.

Ms. Musalo said some migrants, particularly women and families, will qualify for asylum, but others will be returned to dangerous situations.

In a recent deal with the Trump administration, Ghana agreed to accept deported migrants with no connection to the West African nation.
Federal officials then deported 14 migrants to Ghana last week, five of whom had judges’ orders preventing their deportation to their home countries of Nigeria and Gambia.
The other four plaintiffs are still in Ghana, and have been told by officials there that their deportations were imminent.
Justice Department lawyers, in defending the deportations, did not dispute that Ghana sending the migrants to their home countries would violate their court-ordered protections.","A federal judge on Saturday denounced the Trump administration for what she said appeared to be a deliberate scheme to ignore court-ordered protections for a group of deported immigrants who feared persecution in their home countries of Nigeria and Gambia.

But Judge Tanya S. Chutkan of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia appeared reluctant to order the return of the five migrants to the United States, instead asking the government to submit a sworn statement detailing its efforts to prevent the deportations of the people to their home countries. Repatriating the migrants would violate the protections they had received from immigration judges in the United States.

An emergency hearing in the case on Saturday demonstrated how the Supreme Court had paved the way for the deportation of the five migrants in the case, and for President Trump’s mass deportation campaign more broadly.

Though she appeared highly skeptical of the government’s arguments, Judge Chutkan said that her “hands may be tied,” and expressed doubt that a ruling in the migrants’ favor would survive on appeal, pointing to several recent legal victories for the Trump administration’s deportation policies.

Judge Chutkan ultimately did not instruct the government to take specific action on the five deported migrants, and gave lawyers in the case more time to prepare their arguments. It is unclear if more members of the group of deported migrants will soon be deported to their home countries.

In a recent deal with the Trump administration, Ghana agreed to accept deported migrants with no connection to the West African nation. Federal officials then deported 14 migrants to Ghana last week, five of whom had judges’ orders preventing their deportation to their home countries of Nigeria and Gambia.

But the five migrants were told by U.S. and Ghanaian officials that they would be sent to their home countries anyway, according to court filings. One of them — a bisexual man from Gambia, where same-sex relationships are criminalized — was sent on Wednesday from Ghana to his home country.

The other four plaintiffs are still in Ghana, and have been told by officials there that their deportations were imminent.

Even as Judge Chutkan scolded the Trump administration for allowing Ghanaian officials to violate orders by U.S. immigration judges, she also appeared to suggest that she had little power to compel the government to return the migrants, at least for now.

“I have not been shy about saying that I think this is a very suspicious scheme,” she said during a hearing on Saturday, adding that the Supreme Court had blocked a lower court decision in a similar case earlier this year, “and there’s no point in getting decisions from me that are immediately going to be stayed.”

Judge Chutkan’s remarks, as well as her reluctance to compel the government to return the migrants, amounted to a significant victory for the Trump administration in its mass deportation campaign. The Supreme Court has broadly allowed the government to deport migrants to countries other than their own, and had paused a federal judge’s ruling that said the migrants must first be given a chance to show that they would be at risk of torture.

Justice Department lawyers, in defending the deportations, did not dispute that Ghana sending the migrants to their home countries would violate their court-ordered protections. The lawyers instead leaned on an argument that the Trump administration had previously used in the case of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, effectively saying that once a migrant had been removed from the United States and was in foreign custody, the issue was out of their hands.

Judge Chutkan appeared skeptical of that argument, saying that “the lack of that power appears to be by design,” and that it was intended as an “end run around the United States’ obligations.”

She added: “You send these individuals knowing you can’t repatriate them. You send them to Ghana, and you say, ‘Oh, but Ghana says they’re not going to send them home.’ And Ghana immediately prepares to send them home with what appears to be your full awareness. How is this not a violation of your obligation?”

The case echoes Mr. Abrego Garcia’s in other ways. One type of legal protection for the five migrants includes a status called “withholding of removal,” the same protection that should have prevented Mr. Abrego Garcia’s wrongful deportation to his home country of El Salvador. He has continued to fight a labyrinthine legal battle against his deportation, and the Trump administration has now sought to deport him to several other African countries that have also agreed to accept deported migrants — a so-called third-country deportation.

The five plaintiffs in the Ghana case, identified only by their initials for fear of persecution in their home counties, are citizens of Nigeria and Gambia, and have been described in court filings by their lawyers as having “abysmal” living conditions in a remote detention facility known as Dema Camp, at an undisclosed location in Ghana.

One man, known in court records as K.S., was deported to Gambia despite the fact that he had been granted a legal protection preventing deportation to his home country on the basis of his sexuality. K.S. is a bisexual man, and Gambia criminalizes relationships between men with a maximum penalty of life in prison. K.S., according to a court filing, is now in hiding in Gambia and fears for his life.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/13/multimedia/13dc-deport/13dc-deport-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 19:56:56.607320

Gurdeep Singh from the El Sobrante gurdwara in San Francisco, told The Indian Express that the community was aware of Kaur’s detention and concerned about it as she used to frequent the gurdwara.

Harjit’s daughter-in-law, Manjit Kaur, addressed the crowd in tears: “Our fears, I hope they don’t come true. I’m praying that she’s okay there. She’s everything to me.”

She also reminded the community that her mother-in-law has never resisted deportation. According to Richmondside, Kaur repeatedly sought travel documents from the Indian Consulate but was denied, and ICE itself assured her for years that she could remain under supervision until those papers were issued.

“ICE has been trying for the past 13 years to get her a travel document. If ICE can’t get it in 13 years, how are we supposed to get it?” Manjit said.

Family members said her health is in danger. Kaur suffers from thyroid disease, migraines, knee pain, and anxiety, and relatives claimed she does not have full access to her medications inside Mesa Verde.

When Manjit spoke to her over phone on Thursday, she said she could hear the fear and pain in her voice. “When we did hear from her, she was crying and begging us for help,” the family told ABC7 News.

Garamendi has criticised her detention as “misplaced priorities,” arguing ICE should focus on dangerous offenders rather than seniors with decades of compliance. His office has submitted an inquiry to ICE and pledged to press for her release.

California State Assembly member Alex Lee has also expressed support, saying Harjit “is doing it the right way” and should not be mistreated.

Meanwhile, her family has launched a campaign website, bringharjithome.com, urging supporters to contact elected officials, including Garamendi, Senator Alex Padilla, Senator Laphonza Butler, and the White House.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/09/Photo-2025-09-14T144134.978.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 15:56:57.717251

Instead, to their terror, the Trump administration disappeared him into a Louisiana detention facility for nearly two months.","I t was after 3 a.m. on Nov. 6 last year, and nobody on the planet was happier than a balding, slender man standing near the reception desk of the Hilton West Palm Beach.

Donald Trump had just finished hosting his 2024 election watch party at the adjacent Florida convention center, declaring victory in a speech eloquently touting “the most incredible political thing.” Jubilant Republican donors, campaign staff, future government officials, and attendees (of course, Jon Voight) flooded over to the luxury hotel to celebrate.

At the front of the lobby stood Stephen Miller, the man Trump would soon tap as his White House’s undisputed orchestrator of policies and executive authority.

Miller had been one of the first Trump administration’s key policy drivers, particularly when it came to the president’s throttling of legal immigration. Senior officials in President Joe Biden’s administration will tell you the country is still living with the damage Miller did to immigration during Trump’s first term, and that the Biden team was unable, or unwilling, to undo much of it with their four years in power.

But that night in Florida, something was different for the then-39-year-old Miller. A universe of possibilities was unfurling before him.

Amid the revelry, Miller huddled with other high-ranking Trump personnel and said his thank you’s to the ad hoc procession of euphoric conservative voters and GOP bigwigs who congratulated him over and over. They all could see it wasn’t just Trump’s victory that night — it was Miller’s, and many felt obliged to kiss his Trump-endowed ring.

To see the expression of unbridled joy written across Miller’s face at that moment of Trump’s restoration was to stare into the eyes of someone who could see the future: Trump’s top adviser, his most faithful believer, the one close aide who had somehow survived the countless purges of MAGA officials in the first term, knew the country was now his.

Speaking to one overjoyed woman, Miller said, “It’s gonna be great.”

Editor’s picks

More than seven months into Trump’s second term, Stephen Miller has become America’s — if not the world’s — most powerful unelected bureaucrat. With Trump’s blessing, Miller has been allowed to run and remake the country in a manner virtually unheard of for a U.S. government official of his rank. Think of any egregious policy from the Trump administration: Chances are, it was driven by Stephen Miller.

All of it bears Trump’s signature, but the president is not the one spending his nights writing executive orders and bending legal theory to his will; nearly all of this bears the authorship (or, at least, co-authorship) of Miller. Everything you loathe or love about Donald Trump’s America, you hate or cherish about Stephen Miller’s republic of fear.

Under Miller’s guiding hand, the government can deport (or kidnap and rendition) you or your spouse, without due process, to a foreign gulag, if the president feels like it. The White House can repeatedly threaten to take away the most basic of constitutional protections, such as habeas corpus. The president can launch Justice Department criminal investigations against his enemies who, by all known accounts, did nothing wrong except annoy the commander-in-chief, or refuse to help him steal an election. The president and his lieutenants can arrest you at a routine courthouse check-in, at your church, outside your kid’s school, even if you have no criminal record. They’ve instituted a heavily draconian system of immigration arrest “quotas,” ensuring a regime not mainly of mass deportation, but of mass disappearances and indefinite detention in jails and newly erected camps.

They’ve quickly turned much of federal law enforcement into the masked, nameless, unaccountable secret police, working at the whims of the president and his staff. The president can deploy armed National Guard troops, and even U.S. Marines, to the streets of an American city any time he wants — and deem it enemy territory. The administration has made censoring media organizations, comedians, and aging rock stars a policy priority, in an anti-free-speech crusade waged from the West Wing to the Federal Communications Commission.

“Shadow Sec Def.”

“Prime Minister Miller.”

“The REAL Attorney General.”

“The DHS boss.”

“President Miller.”

Trump administration officials and other Republicans close to the president and this White House are paranoid that Miller will one day hear them gossiping about him behind his back — but they still whisper the unofficial titles and nicknames that they bestow onto the White House deputy chief of staff.

When Rolling Stone asks one senior administration official about former Fox News star and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, this source says, unprompted, that “he does what Stephen wants him to do.”

‘One Intense Motherfucker’

As a teenager in Santa Monica, California, Miller craved nothing more than triggering the good-looking kids in school who wanted nothing to do with him.

Jason Islas, who first met Miller at Lincoln Middle School in Santa Monica, says he and Miller and a third friend were a tight-knit band of outsiders who spent middle school doing preteen-boy stuff, like talking about Star Trek (Islas remembers Miller as a big Captain Kirk fan). That all changed, though, in the summer of 1999, between eighth and ninth grades, when, Islas says, Miller informed him they couldn’t be friends anymore. “One of the things he did say was that he didn’t like the fact that I’m of Latin heritage,” Islas recalls.

In the decades that followed, Miller did not grow — except to become more hardened in his extremist views. When he worked as a communications aide in the office of Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions during the Obama years, he was so widely disliked by his conservative colleagues on Capitol Hill that Republican staff in other offices would invent or spread malicious rumors about Miller, such as that he liked to play with porcelain dolls. (A White House official insists that any such characterization of his time on the Hill is “inaccurate and baseless gossip.”) The staffers at the time never dreamed that he’d ever amount to much more than a punch line or an obscure cautionary tale of what happens when you read too many far-right hate websites and dive into Washington’s most feverish swamps.

Even today, not much has changed. As the president’s policy architect and enforcer, he is obsessed, according to three Trump advisers, with deploying the might of the government to stamp out what he deems “anti-white hatred” and “anti-white racism” and “anti-white discrimination” — no matter the cost.

Miller speaks almost exclusively in apocalyptic terms, in the caricatured language of military combat, forever war, and invasion against the culture and the homeland.

He’s yearned to erect a vast hyper-militarized network of what he’s dubbed “camps” for detention and mass deportation — a network he hopes will change the American political and physical landscape forever.

Miller, who is Jewish, has been denounced by his own uncle as a one-man betrayal of Jewish moral and political values. Miller has long held the deepest admiration for the Immigration Act of 1924, and wishes to bring America back to those days. The law is notorious for making the Holocaust deadlier for Jews who tried to flee the Nazis, only to be denied safe passage to the U.S.

Immediately after election night 2024 was called, human rights groups and pro-immigration advocates could not help but consider that they were not prepared for the onrush that Miller was about to unleash. Of all of the Trump appointees, he was the one who kept them up at night. For all of incoming Trump “border czar” Tom Homan’s big talk on mass deportations, he was nothing compared to Miller. To those familiar with Homan’s work, the former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) could recognize, occasionally, that there were some rules and restrictions, here and there. For a guy like Miller, the only laws that mattered were the ones he and Trump could pervert.

Miller may be the avatar of the anonymous racist internet troll brought to agonizing life and imbued with power. But that does not mean he doesn’t thoroughly believe in the righteousness of the ideology he’s selling. In his mind, he’s the triumphant hero — a one-man antidote to effete liberalism, and a holy warrior against the permissive legal and illegal immigration that has left him and his peers feeling mugged by pluralistic reality.

Talk to Republicans operating at the highest levels of Trumpville and you get a unique mix of admiration and unease when you ask them what they think about Miller. “One intense motherfucker,” a longtime Trump adviser notes.

Even attempts by his friends to make him sound gentler, kinder, or funnier often fall flat, making him seem like a crank or the meanest dork you’ve ever met. For instance, multiple longtime Miller associates say that the top White House aide is one of the most “MAHA” people you’ll ever meet, and has plunged headlong into Robert F. Kennedy Jr.-style food and health (or anti-health) agitprop. Accounts of his social life make him sound, to put it gently, tedious.

One conversational victim of his recounts to Rolling Stone what it was like to get hit on by a premarital Miller, circa 2017, at a bar not far from Dupont Circle. The story involves being grilled about which country was named on the collar of her clothing (don’t say China), and getting accused of being a “globalist” because she wasn’t the right kind of conservative.

Female strangers aren’t the only ones in Washington who think he’s weird. Over the years of their close working relationship, President Trump — ever the gossipy Mean Girl with a nuclear arsenal — has not shied away from insulting Miller behind his back. According to two sources with direct knowledge of the matter, Trump has commented to others in the past about Miller’s intense, awkward, and at times off-putting demeanor.

But to Trump, Miller is a useful battering ram, the policy answer to his lingering question of “Where’s my Roy Cohn?”

“Stephen Miller has been one of President Trump’s longest serving and most trusted advisers for nearly a decade, and I can personally attest to the respect the president has for Stephen because I witness it every day,” says White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. “That’s why Stephen serves as the deputy chief of staff for policy and Homeland Security adviser, because the president has the utmost faith in him and his proven leadership abilities. In addition to being extremely effective at his jobs, Stephen is a loyal colleague and friend. Any suggestion otherwise is false gossip from people who don’t actually know him.”

In addition to the press secretary’s statement, the Trump White House sent Rolling Stone a lengthy list of testimonials — resembling an extremely MAGA LinkedIn endorsements section — from Republican lawmakers to prove that people like Stephen Miller personally.

Sen. Josh Hawley, for instance, says he’s glad to call Miller “a friend,” adding that “he cares deeply about helping create a future where American families can thrive.”

“Stephen Miller is bright, thoughtful, takes the time to listen to our members and their concerns, and has always been easy to work with,” says House Majority Leader Rep. Steve Scalise, adding: “I am proud to call Stephen Miller a close friend.”

The White House provided similar statements from Sen. Tom Cotton, Sen. Mike Lee, and Rep. Jim Jordan, with a spokesperson saying they expected that all of the lawmakers’ praise for Miller would be included in this story.

‘Get It Done’

Nowadays, according to various sources working in and close to the Trump West Wing, the president’s lieutenant is technically a deputy White House chief of staff, but he far outpaces the actual White House chief of staff — Trump’s former 2024 campaign co-chief Susie Wiles — as Trump’s primary chief of administration policy.

Miller touches virtually every policy and executive action (especially as it relates to domestic initiatives), effectively all documents, Trump directives, constitutionally dubious orders, and memos. The architecture of Trump’s military crackdowns (in Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, and coming to a Democratic-dominant city near you) is in part a product of Miller’s vision for dominating liberal strongholds he despises.

“It’s a blast for Stephen,” says another fellow Trump adviser, in describing Miller’s role in orchestrating the domestic deployments of U.S. armed forces.

The Trump administration’s sweeping clampdown on diversity programs, higher education, and free speech Trump does not care for is a direct expression of Miller’s ethos, bringing to life a long-held ambition of federalizing the conservative “culture war” in ways once thought uncouth. Trump’s sprawling immigration and border enforcement is just “The Stephen Miller Show,” brought to you by Stephen Miller Productions LLC, and personally stage-managed by Stephen Miller.

With each shred of paper that the president will sign to launch these domestic programs, the Trump lieutenant peruses it, sometimes marks it up with edits, and pushes other Trump officials across the federal apparatus to, in his words, “get it done.”

His berating of intra-departmental and agency officials has become the stuff of legend, if not waking nightmares. Since the beginning of the second Trump administration, two sources who’ve worked in the federal government and have personally dealt with Miller tell Rolling Stone that his berating has made them each cry at work.

During intra-agency discussions, Miller has routinely name-called, yelled, threatened officials’ jobs or future in the party, and attempted to humiliate people in front of their colleagues. He becomes enraged if he feels the immigrant-arrest numbers aren’t padded enough, or if he believes Trump’s domestic agenda is being stalled, even slightly. He is known for working long hours and micromanaging the brutal policies coming out of the new administration. He has a longstanding reputation, dating back to 2017, in the Republican upper ranks as someone willing to say anything, do anything, and betray almost anyone, in the service of Trump and, more vitally, keeping his power and proximity to the president intact.

Within the highest levels of the Trump administration, the idea that Attorney General Pam Bondi runs the Justice Department or that Kristi Noem runs the Department of Homeland Security is woefully incomplete. Nominally independent departments are run by the West Wing of the White House — and therefore, largely, by Miller.

When some government personnel would note that Trump can deploy National Guard troops and armed U.S. Marines to Democratic-run urban areas, but that the troops can’t conduct traditional law enforcement, per se, Miller was the one telling administration lawyers and staff that Trump wanted them to figure out ways around that legal inconvenience, and to report back with whatever legal theories they’d produce.

Miller has made it a top priority for the opening months of this Trump term to normalize the deployment of U.S. troops on American soil — not for states of emergency, but for domestic political purposes. According to those who’ve spoken with them about it, Trump and Miller view those who object as “weak,” “cowards,” and “pro-crime.”

‘We Just Have to Follow Orders’

In the aftermath of Trump’s deployment of the National Guard and U.S. Marines to assist with ICE operations in Los Angeles, Miller insisted that purging undocumented migrants from the city would create a utopia for the remaining residents.

“You have any idea how many resources will be opened up for Americans when the illegals are gone?” Miller told Fox News. “No more waiting in line at an emergency room, no more massive traffic in Los Angeles. Your health insurance premiums go down, your public-school classroom size will shrink … and if you do need to get support from the government, you’re not going to be in line behind millions of illegal aliens from the third world. This is going to be such a gift to the quality of life of everyday Americans.”

In July, when speaking to the press pool in front of the White House, Miller was asked if it was the best use of the administration’s resources to be going after “moms with young kids.” In return, he grilled the reporter on what percentage of undocumented migrants should be allowed to stay. “Do you think we have some sort of Magic 8 Ball to see which particular illegal aliens … are going to go on to commit a rape or murder?”

Miller has no legal background, but according to Trump officials, Miller was the mastermind behind Trump’s ploy to use the Alien Enemies Act to conduct mass deportations without due process, a plot he detailed in 2023 during an interview with conservative radio hosts Clay Travis and Buck Sexton.

Miller was also the first member of the administration to publicly suggest the suspension of habeas corpus, the core constitutional right of protection from arbitrary detention by the state. Speaking to reporters at the White House in May, Miller said, “The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus can be suspended in a time of invasion, so I would say that is an option we’re actively looking at.” There is, of course, no invasion.

For those who want to grasp the true nature of Miller’s legacy and his role in our world, you have to look far beyond 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. To understand Trump’s principal enforcer, you need to understand what he is doing to countless people, all over the country — and then you’d have to understand his personal, instinctive response when he hears about the stories of his victims.

Across the country there are thousands of families ripped apart by the Trump-Miller gang, and most of those stories you won’t read about or may never hear about. One of these was relayed earlier this year to Rolling Stone by an Ohio-based immigration lawyer. This magazine verified details of this account, and agreed to use pseudonyms for the wife, husband, and three-year-old daughter. The lawyer asked not to be identified, due to Miller’s and the Trump administration’s zeal for targeting pro bono immigration attorneys.

In 2020, “Richard” (as we’ll call him) fled his Latin American home country to seek asylum in the U.S. As Richard will tell you, he had served in the military in his home country, but had grown fearful of what might happen to him if he remained, citing corruption and powerful organized crime.

By 2025, he had already made a life for himself in the United States. He had a wife — “Ellen” — and a small daughter, “Jessica,” and they were living in Columbus, Ohio. He worked to support the family, and Ellen stayed home with Jessica. There is no known history of petty or violent crime or any criminal record between them. However, in early 2024, the couple showed up for one of their scheduled hearings and left without actually attending it, but only because somebody at the check-in desk erroneously told them they were not on the schedule that day. That one mishap — which by all accounts, was not their fault — was enough to doom their family under Trump’s second administration.

This past June, Richard received a text message from ICE asking that he appear for a check-in at the local ICE office. Due to the Trump administration’s barrage of new policies and arrest quotas pushed by Miller and Trump, his lawyer was suspicious. Still, Richard had faith in this great country. He wanted to show he was no criminal, that he wanted to come here the right way, and that he had nothing to hide.

The Ohio-based attorney met the family of three at the federal check-in outside of Columbus, with all of them waiting in line to get into the building. Jessica and Ellen were wearing matching attire — Jessica’s hair in pigtails with ribbons, wearing a pink dress. The lawyer recalls the daughter and father laughing as Jessica played with her dad’s cheeks, which he blew up as if to mimic a puffer fish.

After they passed the waiting area, two armed ICE officers would soon flank them, and one of them told the attorney and the family that the officers had no choice. ICE had its directive “from Washington,” the officer said, which had been issued after Trump’s inauguration in January — new standards and demands for higher arrest and deportation numbers (regardless of any existing criminal record) that were directly authored by Miller.

The officer said they had to put the father in handcuffs right then and there, and take him away. “We just have to follow orders,” the ICE officer said.

At first, the Spanish-speaking family did not know what was happening. The lawyer had to translate all of this, back and forth, as the couple and their legal representative pleaded with the ICE officers to allow them to self-deport as a family. Surely doing so would save the American taxpayer money.

The ICE officer apologized. There was nothing anyone, apparently, could do.

The officers were courteous enough to offer to allow Ellen and Jessica to leave the room, so the child did not have to see them handcuffing her dad. The father squatted low to pick up Jessica and hug her goodbye. Jessica, confused and sobbing, would not let go, wrapping her arms around her father’s neck and her legs around his body.

One of the two ICE officers informed the family they needed to get things moving along, just as Ellen had her hands around Jessica’s waist, unable — at first — to pry the preschool-age girl off her dad. One ICE officer had his hand on the father’s shoulder, while the other officer hovered over the family.

“Daddy!” the girl screamed in Spanish. “I want Daddy! I want my daddy!”

Ellen was finally able to remove a hysterical Jessica from the room, and as the ICE officers took Richard, she kept yelling, “Daddy, Daddy, Noooooooooo!!!!” As they walked back to the waiting room, the lawyer could see the faces of the immigrants and others who were sitting in the waiting area, looking on in confused horror at what must have been waiting for them on the other side of that door. Months later, the attorney tells Rolling Stone, “I can still hear the little girl’s screams.”

Ellen and Jessica would pack up and leave for Richard’s home country. The two expected to reunite with him there within days. Instead, to their terror, the Trump administration disappeared him into a Louisiana detention facility for nearly two months. They have since been reunited, but the scars have yet to heal. The lawyer says that Jessica still wakes up in the middle of the night, shouting for “Daddy.”

“This was supposed to be temporary,” she added of the DACA program.
Already, because of a court challenge, DACA recipients in 19 states had been prohibited from enrolling in the health program.
“DACA recipients for … more than 10 years now have been on a constant roller coaster of lawsuits and litigation,” Sharma-Crawford said.
Texas DACA holders are still protected from deportation, but the decision opened the door for the state to end work authorization.","FORT WORTH, Texas – On Christmas Day her junior year of high school, A.L.E. sat near the tree, ready to open gifts. When her mom handed her a box, telling her it was a “big present,” the then-16-year-old expected a new pair of shoes.

Instead, she found an envelope. Inside was her Employment Authorization Document card, confirming she had been approved for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program.

Seven years later, A.L.E. holds a bachelor’s degree in political science from the University of North Texas, works at a law firm as a paralegal, and hopes to go back to school to study immigration and constitutional law.

Yet she still has no permanent legal status to remain in the United States.

“I have dreams. I want to be able to work,” said the 24-year-old, who asked not to be identified with her full name because she worries any publicity could affect her chance of one day obtaining legal status.

“This was supposed to be temporary,” she added of the DACA program. “But it’s just an ongoing cycle where every two years you have to renew, you have to pay the fee, you have to make sure that you don’t get in trouble – you don’t get a parking ticket – in case something comes up and they’re like, ‘No.’”

DACA turned 13 in June. The Obama-era program, which allows those brought into the U.S. illegally as children to stay and work, was never meant to be more than a stopgap on the pathway to conditional permanent residence, and ultimately citizenship, for those known as Dreamers.

Since 2012, about 835,000 people have been protected by DACA. But the program, along with the 525,000 immigrants who are still part of it, remains in limbo as the Trump administration implements a sweeping immigration agenda that includes workplace raids, increased detention and deportations of thousands of others.

The largest segment of active DACA recipients – 426,570 – were born in Mexico, but DACA holders hail from 160 different countries and territories, and more than 23,000 are from countries outside of Latin America – places such as South Korea, the Philippines and Jamaica.

Teenage beneficiaries are now adults with careers, homes, spouses and children. Today, the average age of a DACA holder is 31, according to federal data, and almost a third of active recipients are married. Some 88% of the initial DACA recipients from 2012 are in the labor force, according to the advocacy organization FWD.us, and 49% of those recipients have at least some college education.

“DACA recipients are part of the fabric of our communities and American in every way but on paper,” said Anabel Mendoza, communications director for United We Dream, which advocates for immigrant youths.

“I’ve met nurses; I’ve met doctors, students,” said U.S. Rep. Sylvia Garcia, a Texas Democrat sponsoring legislation to provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers. “They’re everywhere, and we will lose them – and lose that talent – if we don’t get the DREAM Act done.”

Yet another bill introduced in July by U.S. Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, a Florida Republican, and Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Texas Democrat, would provide a pathway to lawful permanent residency for immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. “The Dignity Act,” which includes other, sweeping immigration reforms, remains in committee.

Since 2001, lawmakers have introduced at least 20 versions of the “DREAM Act” to provide Dreamers with conditional permanent residency, which they could use to meet naturalization requirements. None has passed, and Garcia’s bill has received no committee hearing or vote since it was introduced in February.

“I’m waiting, and I’ll wait patiently,” Garcia said, “because it’s about getting it done (for) these Dreamers who’ve been here – no other country but this one in their heart, their soul, in their mind.”

In 2017, during his first term, President Donald Trump tried to terminate DACA, arguing the move to establish the program circumvented immigration laws and was unconstitutional. However, the U.S. Supreme Court blocked that action.

Before taking office again, Trump said in an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press” that he would work with Democrats on a plan for Dreamers, acknowledging that “some of them are no longer young people, and in many cases, they’ve become successful.”

Since then, though, Trump has provided few specifics about his stance or plans for DACA, but his administration has taken steps to curtail protections for Dreamers.

In late August, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reversed a 2024 policy that made DACA recipients eligible for medical insurance under the Affordable Care Act; some 11,000 people are expected to lose coverage. Already, because of a court challenge, DACA recipients in 19 states had been prohibited from enrolling in the health program.

Trump also issued an executive order challenging laws that allow in-state tuition for college students who are in the country illegally. The U.S. Department of Justice has since sued to end such policies in several states, including Kentucky, Minnesota and Texas. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton quickly agreed to stop the practice, calling it “unconstitutional and un-American,” but Texas DACA holders are not affected because they are considered “lawfully present” in the U.S.

Thomas Saenz, president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said immigration advocates and lawyers don’t know whether Trump will try to end DACA, given that officials have “not indicated whether they will do that, and they’ve not taken steps to do that.

“That’s the wild card,” he said.

Despite the protections DACA should offer, some recipients worry about being swept up in the administration’s mass deportation efforts.

In March, federal agents detained and immediately deported DACA holder Evenezer Cortez Martinez of Roeland Park, Kansas, after he returned from a visit to Mexico due to his grandfather’s death.

Cortez Martinez’s DACA was valid through 2026, and he’d been granted advance parole – permission to travel abroad and then return to the U.S. But agents deported him anyway, citing a 2024 removal order that Cortez Martinez said he was not aware of.

The father of three eventually was allowed to return to the U.S. And although there have been few reported cases of people with DACA or advance parole being detained, Cortez Martinez’s lawyer, Rekha Sharma-Crawford, said she advises DACA recipients not to travel out of the country, even if they have legal permission to do so.

The “breakneck speed at which the policies are changing” is causing too much uncertainty, she said. “It’s just not safe for anyone right now.”

Legal challenges spanning more than a decade have also left Dreamers on unsteady ground. Some rulings favored DACA, such as when courts in 2015 dismissed a lawsuit by Mississippi to stop the program and in 2016 blocked Arizona from denying driver’s licenses to recipients.

Other rulings have diminished the program; those included a 2016 U.S. Supreme Court decision that effectively barred the Obama administration from expanding DACA.

More notably, based on another court decision, the government in 2021 stopped processing first-time applicants. While current recipients can still renew, FWD.us estimates some 500,000 people are eligible for DACA but can’t have their applications processed.

“It’s sad how we’re 13 years later, and we’re still going through the same process,” said a 26-year-old San Antonio resident who has twice tried – and failed – to get DACA. “I mean, by this time, we all deserve a pathway to citizenship.”

And while most states allow recipients to enroll in college and obtain in-state tuition, South Carolina, Alabama and Georgia restrict in-state tuition for DACA students at public universities, according to a data portal run by the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration.

“DACA recipients for … more than 10 years now have been on a constant roller coaster of lawsuits and litigation,” Sharma-Crawford said. “I think they completely understand the fragile ground that they’re on and that DACA can be taken away from them at any point.”

The program has faced further setbacks in Texas, home to nearly 88,000 active DACA recipients – second only to California’s 147,000.

In January, a federal court ruled that part of the DACA program is unlawful but limited its finding to Texas, which argued that providing emergency medical services, social services and public education to recipients had cost the state more than $750 million.

Texas DACA holders are still protected from deportation, but the decision opened the door for the state to end work authorization. A district court judge will decide how the ruling should be implemented.

While other states could follow Texas’ lead and try to prove they’ve been harmed financially because of the program, Saenz said they are unlikely to do so.

“Texas was at great pains to show any injury from DACA – and we don’t think they succeeded at it – so other states will see it as arduous and resource draining,” he said in an email.

Advocates nevertheless worry that Texas could become the blueprint for how to take down DACA once and for all – piece by piece, state by state.

“They’re trying to chip away at the program … and that, I think, may be how they’re trying to go about dismantling the program,” said A.M., a 24-year-old DACA holder who lives near Houston. He asked to remain anonymous out of concern that he could lose his status or otherwise be targeted.

The American Immigration Council, an immigration advocacy group, estimates DACA recipients pay more than $5 billion in federal taxes and $3 billion in state and local taxes each year.

In Texas alone, the group reports, DACA-eligible residents contribute $2 billion in taxes and $6.2 billion in spending power – money that could be lost if recipients can’t work.

“That’s what is at stake here,” said Juan Carlos Cerda, a DACA recipient who serves as Texas state director for the American Business Immigration Coalition. “It’s jobs, and it’s the economic contributions.”

Many Texas recipients are weighing whether to move out of state so they can keep working, Cerda said, adding that he has heard from concerned employers as well.

“Employers have been coming to private discussions to discuss options to take and how to get engaged, and the solution here is for Congress to take action,” he said. “It’s an executive order, and it needs to become law.”

Nneka Achapu, founder of the nonpartisan African Public Affairs Committee, said she has little faith that Congress will pass anything to protect DACA recipients.

“While we love the idea of being able to change the status of many of the people who have been living here, we’re also realistic,” she said.

Only one Republican, U.S. Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar of Florida, has signed on as a cosponsor of the 2025 DREAM Act. News21 reached out to Salazar by phone and email but received no reply. Garcia said she’s reached out to other Republicans in the House to elicit support but doesn’t think many will sign on unless Trump backs the bill.

“This is just a dress rehearsal for when I can get it done,” she said, “when Democrats take the gavel back.”

Gaby Pacheco, president and CEO of TheDream.US – which provides college scholarships to students in the country without legal permission – said she and other advocates are trying to convey to lawmakers that it shouldn’t matter which political party is in control.

Either way, she said, Dreamers need relief.

“If Donald Trump was to happen to be the one that signs the DREAM Act … I’ll be the first one standing behind him, applauding the fact that it got done,” she said. “At this point, politics shouldn’t matter.”

News21 traveled to Fort Worth, San Antonio and the Houston area to speak with several Dreamers trying to navigate their lives and determine their futures, even as they wait to see what comes next. Three of the four asked to remain anonymous, fearful they – or their family members in the country illegally – could be targeted if they spoke out.

A businessman fights to stay for his family and workers

Inside a barbershop nestled along a strip of woods in Conroe, Texas, Zak Galindo is starting his day.

The 38-year-old owns two barbershops, a coffee shop, and a bakery and deli. Across the four businesses, he employs 70 people with help from his wife, Sophie, who moved to the U.S. from England as a girl.

She, though, is a naturalized U.S. citizen. He is not, and DACA – to date – remains his only protection from deportation.

“If I was to get deported, it would affect a lot of people — it wouldn’t just affect me and my family,” he said. “It would affect everybody that’s within the business, and their families.”

Galindo was 8 when his mother brought him and his two older sisters to the U.S. from Honduras in 1996. They settled in Chicago, where Galindo found community in the neighborhood barbershop. Eventually, the family moved to Texas to be closer to Galindo’s eldest sister.

At 17, Galindo obtained his license to be a barber, one of the few jobs in Texas that did not have a residency requirement. The job provided him with financial stability and helped him decide to pursue a degree in business at Sam Houston State University.

“I don’t know that I would have been able to even go through college or pay for college had I not had that profession, because I couldn’t have gotten another job,” he said.

Before graduating from college, he decided to apply for DACA – taking every precaution to ensure he remained eligible, including paying a friend to drive him back and forth to school because he couldn’t get a driver’s license.

DACA is open only to those who arrived in the U.S. before they were 16, have lived in the country since 2007 and were under 31 when the program started in 2012. Applicants can’t have been convicted of a felony or significant misdemeanor, and they must either be current students, have graduated from high school or have served in the military.

“It’s people that don’t cause any trouble, went to school,” Galindo said. “They’re good people. And if you meet a lot of them, they’ve gone on to be successful and to make a positive impact in their community and their jobs.”

Galindo was approved for DACA the same day he started an internship at an accounting firm, which would eventually lead to a full-time offer. After three years, he left to start his own barbershop.

Today, he’s one of those DACA success stories. He works closely with the Montgomery County Hispanic Chamber to advocate for other DACA recipients and shares his story publicly to help people understand, “This is what a DACA recipient looks like.”

“I wouldn’t have what I have now, wouldn’t be where I am now, if it wasn’t for DACA,” he said. “I feel like I’ve been blessed.”

Galindo has applied to become a naturalized citizen – like his wife of three and a half years. But the uncertainty of not having permanent status has forced the couple, who have been together for more than 10 years, to put off their dreams of starting a family.

“I still have DACA through the end of the year, but nothing’s guaranteed – and so hopefully everything goes as planned, and then we can start having some babies next year,” Galindo said. “We’re just kind of sitting in limbo in the meantime.”

He still holds out hope that lawmakers will act to allow Dreamers to permanently remain in the U.S.

“It doesn’t have to be full citizenship, because I also don’t think that we should cut the line,” he said. “But something to where we don’t have to fear, ‘Hey, DACA is over now,’ and we don’t have anything.”

A young Dreamer finds his voice

For A.M., a 24-year-old living near Houston who obtained DACA when he was 15, growing up in Texas without legal status has always been “scary,” regardless of who was in the White House.

“There’s always been that constant fear … that at any moment you could be detained and deported,” he said.

Throughout elementary and high school, he said, he felt like he was “hiding in the shadows.”

He was just 5 or 6 when his parents explained what it meant to be “undocumented” and what he needed to do if he one day wanted to get papers: Behave well, and avoid trouble at all costs.

Classmates, who didn’t know why he followed rules to a T, made fun of him. When friends asked where he was from, he lied – claiming Houston as his hometown, rather than admitting his family moved from Tamaulipas, Mexico, when he was 3.

“I always had this idea that I had to do very good in school and I had to be very careful with what I did, because if I did one tiny little thing out of line, that was the end of it – and that was putting me and my family at risk,” he said.

Then, A.M. was named valedictorian of his high school class. During his graduation speech, he took a risk and told the audience he was living in America without legal permission.

Hearing their applause, he was surprised but heartened.

Leading up to and after Trump’s 2016 election, A.M. opened up to more people about his status.

“That was kind of the awakening of: I shouldn’t have to live in fear, even though everything that he’s saying is kind of antagonizing us,” he said. “On the contrary, I should fight against it, stand up for myself and stand up for others like me.”

Always a science lover, A.M. studied microbiology at Texas A&M University and hoped to go to medical school, but only two Texas medical schools accept DACA recipients. Instead, he’s training to become a community health worker to help others who lack status get access to the resources they need.

In college, A.M. finally met other people who’d grown up as he did. He got involved with United We Dream, hosting “Know Your Rights” training sessions on campus and sharing resources for the organization’s UndocuHealth program. He plans to volunteer at an immigration center in Houston and wants to start a network to help business owners alert each other to immigration agent sightings.

DACA is the only thing protecting A.M. from deportation. He considered applying for an employment-based visa, but an attorney advised him to stick with DACA because the visa was not guaranteed. His little brother is a U.S. citizen but too young to sponsor him for a green card. The only other option for a family-based petition is through marriage to a U.S. citizen.

For now, A.M. plans to keep renewing DACA, but he’s hopeful that Congress will pass the DREAM Act. He thinks everyday Texans would support the bill even if their Republican congressmembers didn’t.

What helps him stay positive, he said, “is recognizing my worth here in the country, how much I’ve contributed to the lives of others and how much they’ve contributed to my life as well. And realizing that, yes, I might be undocumented, but that doesn’t make me any different.

“I still matter. My existence still matters.”

An application, and a life, caught in the crosshairs

The then-19-year-old psychology student made her way to the library of San Antonio College. As she settled in, a news report caught her eye: Trump had terminated DACA. The news cut deep: A.L. had recently submitted her application to become a recipient of the program.

“Everything else after that was just like gibberish to me,” said the now-26-year-old. “I didn’t feel connected to my body in that instant.”

A few years ago, she reapplied. But her application was frozen in the system after a judge deemed the program unlawful, barring new applications from being processed.

“I felt like I wasn’t worth very much,” A.L. said. “I thought: Why do all these people have opportunities and I don’t, when I feel like I’ve always worked hard since I was little to get to where I am?”

A.L. and her family emigrated from Aguascalientes, Mexico, in 1999, when she was just 9 months old. The fourth of five children and a self-described overachiever, she has always worked hard to excel, from being on the honor roll in elementary and middle school to taking classes for college credit while still in high school.

When A.L. began thinking about college, she set her sights on the Ivy League. But when she shared that dream with her mother, she got an unexpected response:

“You can’t apply to certain schools,” her mother warned. “You’re undocumented.”

The teenager then asked: “What is being ‘undocumented?’”

While many colleges allow students in the country illegally to enroll, A.L. said her family worried for her safety, given that she is the only one of the family’s children without protected status or citizenship. As A.L. watched her friends send off their college applications, she began to feel the effects of her status.

“That’s when it hits you,” she said, “that reality that you can’t do everything that everyone else is doing.”

She’s consulted with a lawyer about other ways to gain legal status; their advice was that marriage would be her fastest route. So, she continues to hold out hope for DACA, despite the uncertainty and the effect waiting has had on her mental health.

Her personal experiences drove her to study psychology in college. She hopes to become a licensed family and marriage therapist, because she wants to help others find stability – something she has always lacked.

A.L. has thought about returning to Mexico, but she said her parents brought her to the U.S. to give her a better future – and she intends to build that future in America, despite the obstacles.

“I guess you can say this is my life – it’s been my life since I was a baby,” she said. “This is where I grew up, and if I fought this hard to be here, I’m not going to give it up to go back.”

A Texan at heart considers leaving

A.L.E. was just 5 when her parents moved her family from Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, to the Lone Star State. Fort Worth is home to everything she holds dear: her parents, her two younger sisters, her boyfriend and her closest friends.

When A.L.E. learned that Christmas morning in high school that she’d obtained DACA, she put down roots and pursued the opportunities her parents hoped she’d have in the U.S. She got a driver’s license and a job as a lifeguard. She went to college to study political science.

Texas is the only home she knows.

Now, she wants to attend law school in Texas so she can stay near her two younger sisters, both U.S. citizens. But with the state likely to end work authorization for DACA recipients, she wouldn’t be able to save for tuition or pay her bills. She said she’d have to go elsewhere.

“My community is here, and I don’t want to leave that because of something that a politician has decided they don’t like or does not fit into their agenda,” she said.

It remains unclear how a federal judge will implement the court ruling against DACA and work authorization in Texas. But the state’s nearly 88,000 DACA holders could face the same dilemma: Stay with their friends and families, or leave to be able to work.

A.L.E. recently learned she’s developed an autoimmune disease. She blames the stress of worrying about an uncertain future. She’s saving money and reaching out to family in Mexico, in case she has to leave the U.S. But she doesn’t have any real plan for what she will do if DACA ends.

“I don’t want to marry someone just because I’m scared I’m going to lose everything I have,” she said. “It’s also hard to get an employer to be like, ‘Yes, we’ll help you with this.’”

A.L.E. has been involved in politics for years. During her senior year of college, she interned for a member of Congress, spending much of her time focusing on immigration policy. She’s gone door to door in communities in Arizona, canvassing for United We Dream. She also campaigns for her county’s Democratic Party.

However, she isn’t afraid to call out Democrats for failing to pass the DREAM Act when a Democrat was in the White House and the party was in control of Congress. She’s cautiously hopeful that lawmakers will act under Trump. And she has no plans to stop fighting for a chance to live out her life in America.

“At a certain point, we didn’t have DACA,” she said. “We had to advocate for it. We had to go to the streets. We had to go to Congress and be like, ‘You need to give us something now. … You need to help us.’

“So I think that’s something that we need to think about – to just stay open-minded and stay hopeful and just not give up.”

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced on Friday it lodged a detainer for the federal arrest and removal of an illegal immigrant after he allegedly used a machete to decapitate a Texas merchant.

Yordanis Cobos-Martinez, a Cuban national, was arrested on Wednesday by Dallas police on homicide charges after he allegedly used a machete to behead a merchant during an argument in front of the victim's family, according to a news release from ICE.

He then allegedly proceeded to kick the victim's head ""around like a soccer ball,"" the release said.

The proposal comes just days after Mr. Kirk, a close ally of President Trump and a prominent voice in the conservative movement, was killed in what the authorities have described as a politically motivated attack. His death has heightened concerns among both Democrats and Republicans about the safety of high-profile figures in government and politics.

The additional funding “is necessary due to increased threats against public officials,” the request said, pointing to “anticipated costs for the marshals to provide protective services for the Supreme Court of the United States.” The money would remain available through September 2027.

The administration also acknowledged in its request that Congress itself also faced the possibility of violence. While the White House stopped short of dictating how to expand protections for the legislative branch, it urged lawmakers to consider adding additional resources for the Capitol Police and other security measures.

Security for lawmakers has undergone significant changes in the years since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Chief among them was an overhaul of the Capitol Police’s authority, which allowed it to obtain new equipment and broadened its capabilities to protect lawmakers when they are outside of Washington.

Still, incidents persisted after the changes, including threats to the homes and district offices of members. In 2022, a man was arrested after breaking into Representative Nancy Pelosi’s home in San Francisco and attacking her husband. Another man was arrested in January after it was discovered that he had entered the Capitol and Library of Congress with a concealed handgun.

When lawmakers return to Washington this week, they are expected to continue working on a solution to temporarily fund the federal government and avert a shutdown. Among the funding items to be discussed is increased security spending for lawmakers and their staff.

“The administration supports increasing funding for security and protective measures for the legislative branch and defers to the Congress on the most appropriate way to accomplish this,” the administration’s notice stated.

Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, has been approached by lawmakers in both parties about security and safety, an intensifying concern among lawmakers for years. In an interview on “Fox News Sunday,” he placed part of the blame for the tension on heated political rhetoric.

“People have got to stop framing simple policy disagreements in terms of existential threats to our democracy,” he said. “You can’t call the other side fascists and enemies of the state and not understand that there are some deranged people in our society who will take that as cues to act.”

It was unclear whom Mr. Johnson’s remarks were directed at, but the use of the term “fascist” has been embraced at different points by Democratic and Republican party leaders.

While campaigning for a second term in office, Mr. Trump used the term a number of times to attack officials, many of whom were Democrats, who took part in the criminal prosecutions against him. “Every time the radical left Democrats, Marxists, communists and fascists indict me, I consider it actually a great badge of honor,” he said during a rally in Erie, Pa., in July 2023.

Months earlier when she was heckled by protesters in New York City, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, used the term to describe Democrats who she said were trying to stop her from speaking out against criminal proceedings against Mr. Trump.

“The Democrat party — they’re the fascists,” she said during a Fox News interview in April 2023. “They want to cancel our voices, they want to censor us, and they want to completely force us into complying.”

But so too have Mr. Trump’s rivals used the term repeatedly to attack his policy decisions and actions taken in the White House. During a CNN town hall in 2024, former Vice President Kamala Harris labeled Mr. Trump a fascist. And a number of lawmakers have used the term repeatedly in speeches and media appearances.

Representative Jasmine Crockett, Democrat of Texas, said last week after Mr. Kirk’s killing that sharp attacks against her political rivals did not amount to calls for violence.

“Me disagreeing with you, me calling you, you know, ‘wannabe Hitler’ — all those things are like, not necessarily saying, ‘Go out and hurt somebody,’” Ms. Crockett said during an interview on the “Breakfast Club” radio show.

Mr. Trump’s tariffs have added pressure on inflation, which remains elevated. The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates this week, a move intended to encourage economic growth that can also boost inflation. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, are leading the negotiations on behalf of the United States, and He Lifeng, the vice premier for economic policy, is leading the talks for China.

The talks are focusing on “national security, economic and trade issues of mutual interest, including TikTok and cooperating on money-laundering networks that threaten both the United States and China,” a statement from the Treasury Department said. China’s state media agency, Xinhua, said the two sides would discuss economic and trade issues including “the U.S. unilateral tariff measures, the abuse of export controls and TikTok.”

Mr. Trump has until Wednesday to enforce or delay a law requiring TikTok to be separated from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, or face a ban in the United States.

The president has already delayed enforcing the law three times. Congress passed the bipartisan legislation last year to ban TikTok in the country unless it found a non-Chinese owner because of concerns that the social media app’s ties to China made it a national security threat to the United States.

The talks are expected to continue into Monday or Tuesday. Mr. Bessent plans to join Mr. Trump for a state visit in London on Wednesday.

Officials from countries around the world have been working to reach trade deals with the United States since April, when Mr. Trump imposed “reciprocal” tariffs on virtually all of America’s trading partners.

Talks with China have been more complicated. Mr. Trump imposed 145 percent tariffs on Chinese imports in April, essentially halting trade, before lowering that levy to 30 percent. China put 10 percent tariffs on American products.

On Saturday, China announced that it was opening an investigation into exports of certain microchips that are made in the United States. The day before, the U.S. Commerce Department said it was adding Chinese chip companies to a trade blacklist. The moves are expected to put additional pressure on the talks.

The world’s two largest economies have been discussing further tariff reductions and the status of China’s restrictions on shipments of rare earth minerals and magnets critical to U.S. manufacturers. The Trump administration is also concerned that China has stopped buying American agricultural products, threatening the livelihood of soybean farmers.

Mr. Bessent has criticized China’s excess industrial capacity, describing its economy as unbalanced, and urged his Chinese counterparts to curb purchases of oil from Russia and Iran.

Mr. Trump and Xi Jinping, China’s leader, could meet next month at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in South Korea. Mr. Trump has also suggested that he may visit China at some point at Mr. Xi’s invitation.

The latest round of talks is taking place shortly after Mr. Xi gathered leaders of more than 20 countries in China last month in a show of Beijing’s efforts to reshape a global order without the United States at the center. Mr. Trump’s hardball tactics in trade negotiations have created a rift with allies like India, which has been the target of Mr. Trump’s heavy import tariffs, creating an opportunity for China to push for a closer relationship.

China is relying on increased trade with other countries to offset a sharp decline in exports to the United States. China’s exports to the United States have dropped about 15 percent this year, but trade to Southeast Asia, Africa and other regions is booming. China is on pace to surpass last year’s record nearly $1 trillion trade surplus in 2025.

Despite the robust trade figures, there are signs that China’s domestic economy is feeling the pinch from the ongoing trade war. The Chinese government is discouraging companies from further investments in industries already suffering from overcapacity to prevent cutthroat price competition and ease concerns from trading partners that the deluge of inexpensive Chinese-made exports will decimate local manufacturing.

Many of the fired probationary workers in the 17 agencies covered in the lawsuit have been reinstated to their posts, have found new jobs or do not want to return to their old jobs, Judge Alsup said. And for some workers, agency reorganizations over the past few months have eliminated their positions.

Even so, the plaintiffs saw the ruling as a significant win.

“Judge Alsup’s decision makes clear that thousands of probationary workers were wrongfully fired, exposes the sham record the government relied upon, and requires the government to tell the wrongly terminated employees that O.P.M.’s reasoning for firing them was false,” Everett Kelley, the president of the American Federation of Government Employees, said in a statement on Saturday, using an acronym for the Office of Personnel Management, the government’s human resources arm.

The agency took a leading role in the Trump administration’s early downsizing efforts led by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency.

Judge Alsup found the terminations illegal because they came at the direction of the personnel office and not the agencies where the employees worked, which hold the authority to hire and fire.

He ordered that the personnel office be prohibited from firing federal employees the way it had done earlier this year.

The probationary firings were part of a series of federal worker termination programs launched by the Trump administration, all of which face legal challenges. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit recently ruled that a Maryland case challenging the probationary firings should be sent back to the district court and dismissed, because the plaintiffs did not have standing to sue.

In Friday’s opinion, Judge Alsup chided the administration over its conduct in the monthslong case. He said the government’s evidence was a “sham” that included documents unrelated to the case, leaving a reader “with the feeling that he is being led, blindfolded, along a carefully plotted path through a dense, unseen wood.”

“Here and there, he may hear a rustle in the trees, feel the dark silhouette of a towering form or intuit some other hint at the forest beyond. But never is he afforded an unfettered view of the landscape through which he passes,” Judge Alsup wrote. In some cases, he said, the government offered “fabricated” context and “ersatz” evidence. He called some prosecutor conduct “chicanery,” echoing observations he had shared at times during the case.

He appeared particularly angered by the government’s insistence that the fired workers had ways outside of district courts to challenge their dismissals. Mr. Trump effectively disabled those options when he fired people in key positions, Judge Alsup noted.

The judge singled out the Federal Labor Relations Authority, an independent board that reviews unfair labor practices. Mr. Trump fired the chair of the board, significantly slowing its work. Mr. Trump also fired a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board, where many of the probationary employees turned to challenge their firings. That left the panel without a quorum and unable to make decisions. And the president fired the head of the Office of Special Counsel, which protects whistle-blowers, installing a loyalist in his place.

Judge Alsup ordered 17 agencies to issue letters to each fired probationary worker stating: “You were not terminated on the basis of your personal performance.”

When he issued a similar order earlier this year, some agencies complied but included legal language that the government did not agree with the court’s opinion. Judge Alsup said the agencies were free to disagree with his opinion and appeal the ruling, but that the letters were “not an appropriate medium for the litigation of those disagreements.”

A loan record reviewed by The New York Times suggests that Ms. Cook did not try to deceive lenders about one of the properties, a home in Atlanta, that she purchased before joining the nation’s central bank in 2022.

That document, as well as another submitted as part of Ms. Cook’s nomination process, complicates Mr. Trump’s attempts to remove Ms. Cook, days after the government asked a federal court to block her from participating in the Fed’s meeting this coming week, where the central bank is expected to lower interest rates.

On Saturday afternoon, lawyers for Ms. Cook referenced the newly unearthed documents in urging a panel of judges to allow her to continue serving. They also warned that Mr. Trump’s actions could cause financial havoc and undermine confidence in the central bank.

“This should be case closed on the Cook mortgage issue,” said Adam Levitin, a professor at Georgetown Law. “There is no way to maintain a criminal prosecution in light of the disclosure in Cook’s loan application.”

Ms. Cook bought the property, a condominium in Atlanta, in 2021. The president and his top aides have accused Ms. Cook of incorrectly claiming both the condo and another property in Michigan, purchased weeks earlier, as her primary residence, seemingly in a bid to secure a lower interest rate on a mortgage.

Mr. Trump and his aides contend that this represents fraud, though Ms. Cook has not been charged with any wrongdoing or convicted of a crime. But a set of financial records reviewed by the Times — a preliminary loan estimate from a credit union dated May 2021 — offers a possible competing view.

The documents instead classify that Atlanta residence as a “vacation home.” Similar language appears in a second set of records, furnished later that year to the government ahead of Ms. Cook’s confirmation to the Fed. In those heavily redacted submissions, the Atlanta condo is described as a “2nd home.”

Kathleen C. Engel, an expert on mortgage fraud at Suffolk University’s law school, said that, in order to prove fraud, prosecutors would need to establish that Ms. Cook misled her lender about her intended use of the property.

“The fraud allegation is dramatically weakened by the evidence that this was on her application,” Ms. Engel said. “She was candid about how she was using the property.”

She added: “It actually rebuts any inference that she engaged in fraud.”

Ms. Cook has said little about her own finances even after Mr. Trump took the extraordinary step last month of trying to fire her. Mr. Trump’s actions have touched off a landmark legal battle, which could see him expand his power to dismiss members of the central bank, potentially eroding its independence from political interference.

The disclosures do not appear to be legal documents, and they do not prove that Ms. Cook was transparent about her intended use of the property throughout the loan application process. But they do suggest that she may have told her lender about her plans at least once.

Lawyers for Ms. Cook declined to comment on the disclosures, which were first reported by Reuters. But they referenced a news story about the records in their Saturday filing with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, arguing that Ms. Cook had been “deprived of a forum in which to offer any evidence” in her defense.

The new revelations did not appear to satisfy Ms. Cook’s critics in the Trump administration. The man at the forefront of her ouster — Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who first broadcast allegations of fraud — signaled earlier Saturday that the newly released records did not absolve Ms. Cook of wrongdoing.

“Dr. Cook represents herself as an extremely accomplished financial operator,” Mr. Pulte said in a post on social media. “If Dr. Cook solicited estimates as a vacation home and then entered into a mortgage agreement as a primary residence, that is extremely concerning, and in my opinion, evidences further intent to defraud.”

Mr. Pulte previously referred the matter to the Justice Department, which has opened a criminal investigation into Ms. Cook. He said in a second post on social media this weekend: “The idea that she got estimates and then declared it as a primary on her mortgage agreement is even more concerning for Dr. Cook.”

But Ms. Engel said Mr. Pulte was misunderstanding or misrepresenting the mortgage application process. As long as Ms. Cook disclosed her plans to use the home as a secondary home to her lender, there is no fraud, she said. Ms. Engel said she would not necessarily expect publicly available loan documents to show an acknowledgment from her lender that the property would be used as a second home.

“Pulte would know this, or would have access to people who would know this at F.H.F.A.,” she said.

The new evidence arrived as the Trump administration forged ahead with its attempts to block Ms. Cook from attending a pivotal Fed meeting this coming week, at which the central bank is expected to lower interest rates. The government filed its emergency request with an appeals court on Thursday, seeking to reverse an earlier decision by a lower court, which had blocked the president from firing Ms. Cook.

The lower court judge ruled that Mr. Trump had failed to identify sufficient cause for dismissing Ms. Cook under the Federal Reserve Act, finding that it had to involve behavior while she served as a governor and relate to the job itself. Ms. Cook’s lawyers have argued that any attempt to prevent her from attending the upcoming Fed meeting could rattle financial markets.

Ms. Cook’s counsel repeated those warnings on Saturday. They told the appellate judges that removing Ms. Cook would send a “destabilizing signal to the financial markets that could not be easily undone.”

They also said the government’s request risked undermining the Fed, threatening an “immediate end” to its history of political independence, while opening the door for Mr. Trump to fire other members of the central bank for political reasons.

“Nothing would then stop the President from firing other members of the Board on similarly flimsy pretexts,” Ms. Cook’s lawyers said. “The era of Fed independence would be over.”

The appeals court has given the Trump administration until 3 p.m. on Sunday to respond to Ms. Cook’s legal filing.

Newsweek has contacted DHS, ICE and Villegas-Gonzalez's attorney, Manuel Cardenas, for comment.

Why It Matters

The case touches on larger national debates over immigration enforcement tactics, the use of force by federal agents and community safety during intensified operations such as the agency's recent increased activities in the Chicago area.

It comes as President Donald Trump's administration ramps up its immigration enforcement efforts in Chicago under Operation Midway Blitz—seeking out alleged illegal immigrants with criminal records or charges. Protests have been held in the city against the action, with some seeking to protect immigrants without status.

What To Know

Villegas-Gonzalez, who DHS called a ""criminal illegal alien,"" was approached by ICE agents during a vehicle stop on Friday morning, the department said.

""He refused to follow law enforcement's commands and drove his car at law enforcement officers,"" DHS said. ""One of the ICE officers was hit by the car and dragged a significant distance. Fearing for his own life, the officer fired his weapon.""

The Villegas-Gonzalez family has since started a GoFundMe page, where they said: ""It is cruel what ICE agents did to him shortly after he dropped off his sons at school.""

Illinois U.S. Representative Delia Ramirez, a Democrat, also spoke at a news conference on Saturday about how Villegas-Gonzalez had just dropped his children off at school before he was shot, according to the Chicago Sun Times.

DHS said that ICE was targeting ""a criminal illegal alien with a history of reckless driving"" who ""entered the country at an unknown date and time.""

CBS News Chicago revealed that Villegas-Gonzalez had four traffic violations between 2010 and 2019—his offenses included speeding, an expired driver's license, not having insurance and not having a child restraint seat.

Cardenas, who had represented Villegas-Gonzalez in two of these cases, said they were both resolved ""favorably"" and ""neither of them involved criminal violence.""

The ICE agent involved was injured in the incident, having sustained multiple injuries, but was in stable condition as of Sunday, DHS said.

What People Are Saying

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement: ""We are praying for the speedy recovery of our law enforcement officer. He followed his training, used appropriate force, and properly enforced the law to protect the public and law enforcement.

""Viral social media videos and activists encouraging illegal aliens to resist law enforcement not only spread misinformation, but also undermine public safety, as well as the safety of our officers and those being apprehended.""

Attorney Manuel Cardenas told the Chicago Sun Times: ""They are vilifying him, they're making him look up to be like some monster, which he wasn't. He was just a working man. Probably got startled.

""There was no indication from when I met with him that he was a violent man or that he was interested in hurting anybody.""

Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez's family said in their fundraising message: ""Silverio passed away after ICE agents shot him fatally, leaving behind not only loving family and friends, but also a legacy of warmth, resilience, and deep compassion. He was someone who always extended a helping hand, shared his smile freely, and showed up for those he loved—no matter the circumstances.""

What Happens Next

Federal authorities, including the FBI, are investigating the shooting and will review available evidence, including any surveillance or body-worn camera footage if it exists; not all federal agents are required to wear body cameras. Local lawmakers and advocates have called for the release of all footage and for an independent review of the use of force.

The driver refused to obey orders and drove his car at law enforcement, prompting an ICE officer to open fire, officials said.

Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez was pronounced dead at a local hospital, where the officer also was taken.

“The videos that I’ve seen do not corroborate that story,” Rep. Chuy Garcia, a Chicago Democrat, said of the shooting. “It seems that DHS was quick to put something out that essentially accuses and convicts a person, portrays him as somebody who was a very bad person.

Garcia and other leaders in the Hispanic community on Saturday gathered outside an ICE facility in suburban Broadview to decry federal tactics. The congressman accused immigration officers of “severe racial profiling.”

DHS stood by its mission, saying in a statement that the “ICE operation will target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew Governor Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets.”

But the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that the “roving” patrols of ICE officers could continue.
Sweeney emphasized when speaking to law enforcement, people always have the right to walk away, unless they’re being detained.","As the Trump administration has continued its monthslong immigration enforcement blitz, its tactics – including large-scale workplace raids and the use of masked officers – have sparked condemnation from advocates and civil rights groups.

Amid the ongoing campaign to deport tens of thousands of immigrants, “Know Your Rights” trainings and programs have proliferated, with small fliers popping up on the doors of businesses around the country.

“ICE and Homeland Security cannot enter without a warrant signed by a judge,” read some of the fliers, reflecting a growing movement to educate the public about their rights as immigration authorities have taken increasingly aggressive tactics during President Donald Trump’s second term.

The warrant guidance largely stems from the Fourth Amendment, which protects people – citizens and noncitizens alike – from “unreasonable searches and seizures.”

The amendment “ensures everyone’s privacy is protected, regardless of immigration status,” said Ana Valenzuela, senior attorney at Minsky McCormick & Hallagan, P.C., a Chicago-based immigration law firm.

“Law enforcement does not have the right to just enter” a home or a private business unless they have a warrant signed by a judge, Valenzuela told CNN.

CNN talked with immigration lawyers about the different kinds of warrants – and what an ICE agent needs to enter a person’s home or business.

What is an administrative warrant?

The administrative warrants ICE may serve while making civil immigration arrests are distinct from the criminal warrants local and federal police typically use, immigration lawyers told CNN.

The administrative warrant typically used by ICE, a “Warrant for Alien Arrest,” is a civil document typically issued by the Department of Homeland Security. It usually lists the person the agency is trying to find, according to Valenzuela, and may include the person’s picture. This type of warrant can be used to arrest a person in public, she said.

Administrative warrants are signed by authorized ICE officers – not judges, according to Maureen Sweeney, a professor at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law who specializes in immigration law.

They don’t require the same evidence as a judicial warrant, Sweeney said.

And an administrative warrant doesn’t allow an ICE officer to enter a person’s home or a private business without consent, Charles Kuck, an Atlanta-based immigration lawyer, said.

“If ICE knocks on the door and says, ‘We want to come in,’ you should ask for a judicial warrant,” Kuck explained.

They’re also not enforceable, according to Kuck. That means, for instance, that if an immigration officer uses an administrative warrant to request work documents from an employer, the company doesn’t have to comply, he said.

Valenzuela added during trainings, she emphasizes that people should not open the door to their home or private business to immigration authorities.

“If they even crack the door open to obtain and review the warrant, that cracking of the door is enough to give them consent to enter,” she said.

What is a criminal warrant?

A criminal or judicial warrant, which can allow law enforcement to search a specific location without consent, requires “probable cause that you have committed a crime,” John Gihon, a former ICE attorney and current co-chair of the American Immigration Lawyers Association’s national ICE committee, told CNN. A law enforcement officer must provide sworn testimony to a judge, who then signs the warrant.

And the warrant has to be “very specific in terms of the exact location that they intend to search,” according to Valenzuela – down to the precise apartment number. A criminal search warrant is also only valid for a specific time period.

Being an undocumented immigrant is a civil offense, not a crime. But immigration authorities may still obtain criminal warrants in some cases, like during large-scale workplace raids, including the recent operation at a Hyundai megaplant in Georgia, according to Kuck.

“For example, intentionally hiring individuals to work that don’t have work authorization, that can be a crime,” Kuck said – allowing authorities to obtain a criminal warrant to search a property.

For the Hyundai raid, authorities had obtained a search warrant that named four specific individuals. But in total, 475 people, mostly Korean nationals, were arrested, suspected of living and working in the US illegally. The mass arrest marks the largest sweep yet in the crackdown at US worksites.

Valenzuela described this as “collateral detention” – when immigration authorities target specific people, but end up arresting others as well.

Does ICE need a warrant to arrest you?

But, according to immigration lawyers, ICE can make warrantless arrests. There are two main exceptions through the Immigration and Nationality Act, according to Gihon: If officers have personally witnessed someone violating immigration law, or if there’s reason to believe the person is removable and they may flee before a warrant can be obtained.

“That’s the exception that they almost always use when doing a warrantless arrest – by virtue of being in the country in violation of your status, you’re a flight risk,” he said.

And in practice, officers have needed little pretext to make arrests. Just matching with a photo in an ICE database can lead to an arrest, according to Gihon.

The approach has caused controversy and incurred accusations of racial profiling. In Southern California, a judge said DHS was arresting people without probable cause and ordered the Trump administration to stop detaining people based solely on race, spoken language or occupation. But the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that the “roving” patrols of ICE officers could continue.

ICE says on its website that the agency doesn’t need judicial warrants to make arrests. “Like all other law enforcement officers, ICE officers and agents can initiate consensual encounters and speak with people, briefly detain aliens when they have reasonable suspicion that the aliens are illegally present in the United States, and arrest people they believe are illegal aliens,” reads the website.

Kuck urged people to stay calm and quiet if approached by immigration officers. A person disclosing their immigration status can later be used against them during deportation proceedings, he said.

But even if someone refuses to speak to immigration officers, they can still be arrested, he said.

‘Know Your Rights’

Amidst the ongoing deportation campaign, “Know Your Rights” trainings and programs have spread.

In Chicago, where a federal immigration operation is imminent, public school teachers and union members distributed “Defend Your Rights” flyers to parents and students Friday afternoon outside a west side elementary school.

The union said the goal of the flyering is to inform school families in Latino and Black neighborhoods of their legal rights as the city prepares for the possible deployment of National Guard troops and ICE agents.

“We have so many Black and brown students here, we’ve gotten an influx within the last two years of migrant students, so we want to protect our students,” first grade teacher Latina King told CNN.

Sweeney emphasized when speaking to law enforcement, people always have the right to walk away, unless they’re being detained.

“The advice is always that if you’re approached by an officer who asks you a question, you should respond with a question of your own: ‘Officer, am I being detained?’” she said.

“If the officer refuses to answer, you should repeat the question, because they have an obligation to answer that question and to let you know whether you’re being detained,” she went on.

Gihon, meanwhile, said as the administration pushes to overturn long-standing norms in immigration enforcement, making brazen public arrests and going after immigrants with no criminal background, it’s harder than ever for immigration lawyers to provide universal advice.

“It’s tough because you could give absolutely perfect advice and it could be totally wrong based upon a change in policy or how the courts are enforcing things, unfortunately,” he said.

“It’s hard to try to predict the unpredictable.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2224044281.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-09-14 10:57:34.651119

That’s according to U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., who spoke at a news conference Saturday outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s processing facility in Broadview.

The man — formally identified Saturday by the Cook County medical examiner’s office as Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez — was shot by an ICE officer after the agency says Villegas-Gonzalez tried to flee a traffic stop and struck an officer with his car.

ICE said its agents were conducting “targeted law enforcement activity” in Franklin Park when they stopped the vehicle. The agency said Villegas-Gonzalez resisted arrest and tried to drive his car into officers, dragging one of them.

According to ICE, an officer shot Villegas-Gonzalez, who was taken to a hospital and pronounced dead.

The injured ICE officer, who had been hospitalized, has been released after being treated for “severe back injuries, lacerations to the hand and substantial tears on his knee,” the federal Department of Homeland Security said Saturday.

The Mexican consulate said Villegas-Gonzalez was from Michoacán, Mexico, and worked as a cook. It said it has contacted his family and is requesting more information from ICE about the circumstances of the shooting.

Ramirez said she and other elected officials will demand an investigation into the shooting.

“It is important for people to understand that, yes, we are living in times that perhaps feel unprecedented, but we have seen these attacks before,” Ramirez said. “We will rise from these attacks.”

Cook County court records show Villegas-Gonzalez’s record involved four citations for traffic violations since 2010. The most recent was in 2019 for operating an uninsured vehicle. That case was thrown out within a month. The other three citations were for speeding, driving with an expired license and operating an uninsured vehicle.

Manuel Cardenas, a lawyer who represented Villegas-Gonzalez in a traffic case, said Saturday that his former client wasn’t a violent criminal and that he was shocked to hear of Villegas-Gonzalez’s death.

An Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officer fatally shot a man who tried to evade arrest Friday morning in Franklin Park by driving his car at officers and dragging one of them, officials said. The man, Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, was pronounced dead at a hospital.

On the same day, Willian Gimenez was pulled over while driving in Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood and detained by ICE agents. Kevin Herrera, Gimenez’s attorney, said he believes it was retaliation for his involvement in a lawsuit against Chicago leaders, Home Depot and an off-duty police officer for their actions toward immigrant workers.

Herrera said Gimenez has a work permit and is going through the process of pursuing an asylum claim.

In a statement Saturday, immigration authorities said Gimenez was arrested for being in the country illegally.

“No one is above the law. Gimenez Gonzalez is an illegal alien with charges for criminal trespassing and a history of not showing up to court, including when he failed to appear in immigration court in April of last year, after which an immigration judge ordered him removed from the country,” the statement said.

During a Saturday morning news conference outside an ICE facility in west suburban Broadview, U.S. Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia, a Democrat representing Illinois’ 4th District, said the incidents are troubling.

“These incidents make us all ask, ‘If ICE can kill one of our neighbors in broad daylight … if they can arrest someone for joining a lawsuit or simply for being Latino, what’s to stop them from getting any one of us?'” Garcia said.

A planned 12-hour protest Friday outside the facility included several clashes between participants and officers wearing face coverings, helmets and later gas masks. The facility has seen regular demonstrations in response to increased immigration enforcement.

U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez, a Democrat representing Illinois’ 3rd District, said she will demand a thorough investigation of the traffic stop that led to Villegas-Gonzalez’s fatal shooting and called for community unity.

“The department that is responsible for protecting the people from foreign terror has become the department of state terror,” Ramirez said.

The Department of Homeland Security’s campaign, labeled “ Operation Midway Blitz,” targets so-called sanctuary laws in the state.

“This ICE operation will target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew Governor Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets,” DHS said in a statement.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington on behalf of five migrants, says passengers were awoken in the middle of the night on Sept. 5 and not told where they were going until hours into the flight on a U.S. military cargo plane.

The migrants have been detained for five days in Ghana in ""squalid conditions and surrounded by armed military guards in an open-air detention facility"" called Dema Camp, the complaint says.

Conditions are ""abysmal and deplorable,"" with tents for shelter and little running water.

The migrants are not from Ghana and have been told they will be sent to other countries that have been determined to be too dangerous by U.S. immigration judges -- making it the latest legal challenge to the Trump administration's practice of sending people to countries other than their own, including El Salvador, Panama, Costa Rica and several African nations.

""Defendants have enlisted the government of Ghana to do their dirty work,"" it says. ""Despite the minimal, pass-through involvement of the Ghanaian government, Defendants' objective is clear: deport individuals who have been granted fear-based relief from being sent to their countries of origin to those countries anyway, in contravention to the rulings of U.S. immigration judges and U.S. immigration law.""

The Homeland Security Department and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The lawsuit was filed a day after Ghana's president confirmed the arrival of the 14 deportees.

Ghana joined Eswatini, Rwanda and South Sudan as African countries that have received migrants from third countries who were deported from the U.S., an approach that has had its legality questioned by lawyers and human rights organizations.

President Donald Trump has been aggressively cracking down on immigrants he describes as criminals and ""aliens"" from countries whose nationals have overstayed their visas in the U.S.

Lawyers and activists have said the Trump administration appears to be making such requests to the nations most affected by his policies on trade, migration and aid.

By Vanguard Staff

SAN FRANCISCO – A federal judge on Thursday ordered the Trump administration to comply with his earlier ruling restoring Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelans and Haitians after the government failed to update its systems and blocked TPS holders from re-registering. The order marked another dramatic turn in a high-stakes case that has left hundreds of thousands of immigrants in limbo.

On Friday, Judge Edward M. Chen ruled that the administration’s actions stripping humanitarian protections from more than a million Venezuelans and Haitians were unlawful. Despite that decision, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website continued to state that TPS for Venezuela had been “terminated.” In court filings, the government further argued it had no obligation to comply with the judge’s ruling because it claimed the order was not yet in effect.

During an emergency hearing in San Francisco, Judge Chen flatly rejected that position. “The order was effective immediately,” he said. His ruling made clear that the administration’s refusal to act was not only unlawful but had already caused harm. He directed the government to update the USCIS website by 5 p.m. Friday to reflect the court’s ruling and ordered officials to reopen TPS registration for Venezuelans for 24 hours.

Declarations filed in court illustrated the human consequences of the administration’s failure to comply. TPS holders described losing jobs, being detained, and even facing possible deportation despite still being legally protected under federal law.

“On Wednesday, I lost my job because the government’s website still said that TPS was terminated,” said Noelia, a former Amazon employee. “I even sent them a copy of Judge Chen’s order, but they would not accept it on its own. I hope that today’s order means that I can get my job back so I can support myself.”

Attorneys for the plaintiffs also argued that the government effectively removed the option to register online for TPS for Venezuela during most of the final day of registration, sparking panic among TPS holders. They said the portal was disabled for a significant part of September 10, which was the final day to register under the earlier Mayorkas extension. The government’s attorney acknowledged that the outage occurred but blamed it on a “coding error.”

Judge Chen found that explanation inadequate and concluded that the government’s actions had unlawfully deprived Venezuelans of the opportunity to maintain their status. He ordered that the registration portal must be reopened for at least 24 hours and that Venezuelans who register during this time will be considered to have registered on time. He also required the government to notify plaintiffs’ attorneys at least four hours in advance of reopening the registration window.

In his written order, Chen rejected the government’s claim that it had an automatic stay that excused it from following the ruling. He clarified that the final judgment “went into immediate effect” and emphasized that failing to implement the order would render it meaningless. He further wrote that even if there had been ambiguity, the court had the authority to make the ruling immediately effective, and he was exercising that authority.

Immigrant rights advocates and community leaders celebrated the decision. “The National TPS Alliance was outraged by the government’s refusal to comply with the court’s order. The court made clear again today that the law must be respected,” said Jose Palma, coordinator of the National TPS Alliance, the lead plaintiff in the case. “We will continue to organize our community to fight for TPS and permanent protections.”

Jessica Bansal, an attorney with the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, called the administration’s argument “troubling, to say the least.” She said, “We are pleased the court rejected it and directed DHS to recognize the ongoing validity of Venezuela’s TPS designation.”

Others said the case underscored how much was at stake for immigrant families. “People’s futures are hanging in the balance, and the Trump administration is playing games with their lives and the rule of law,” said Emi MacLean of the ACLU of Northern California. “Court orders are not optional. Human beings are not political pawns.”

Adelys Ferro, executive director of the Venezuelan American Caucus, said that while the decision was a victory, it was only one step in a longer fight. “Today, once again, justice prevailed. Our fight is far from over, but we will face one battle at a time, together with our brothers and sisters of the National TPS Alliance,” she said. “Venezuelans don’t have a safe country to return to, and we depend on our TPS status to provide us refuge in the United States.”

The ruling highlighted the ongoing tension between the judiciary and the Trump administration on immigration policy. The court’s order not only compels immediate compliance but also requires transparency. Judge Chen instructed the government to file a declaration explaining the so-called “technical problem” that shut down the TPS registration portal on the final day, noting the importance of documenting the issue for the record in case of an appeal.

The decision also reaffirmed that the court sees TPS as more than an administrative measure—it is a legal safeguard that protects immigrants from instability, persecution, or unsafe conditions in their home countries. By insisting on compliance, Judge Chen underscored that federal agencies must respect judicial authority, even as the administration pursues its immigration agenda.

For TPS holders, the ruling provides a temporary reprieve but does not end uncertainty. Advocates say the long-term solution must be permanent protections rather than repeated cycles of litigation.

The plaintiffs in the case are represented by the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, the ACLU Foundations of Northern and Southern California, the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at the UCLA School of Law, and the Haitian Bridge Alliance. Together, they said they will continue pressing for stronger protections and permanent status for TPS holders across the United States.

“This kind of racial profiling is unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment,” Cortez Masto said.
People are taking inventory of how similarly they line up with “the stereotype that the Supreme Court is targeting here,” he said.
Though she harshly criticized the conservative members of the Supreme Court, Cortez Masto said she wasn’t in favor of expanding the court should Democrats regain control of the White House and Congress.
Citing the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Cortez Masto said the court shouldn’t be playing politics.","The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for federal agents to stop and detain people based on race, language or even where they work — at least for now. In freezing a lower court’s ruling against the practice, the justices last week signaled a broader reach beyond Los Angeles, sparking alarm that Nevada and other states could soon feel the effects.

“Instead of taking that potential exit ramp on the road to increasing armed aggression against communities, the Supreme Court has basically greenlighted it,” said Michael Kagan, director of the UNLV Immigration Clinic. “When (immigration enforcement agents) do this again in Chicago or Las Vegas or any other community in the country, it would seem a key tool that might have helped constrain the government … has been taken away.”

Kagan and U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., both said the order, despite the case being far from over, is already having a chilling effect among Latino Nevadans.

The 6-3 decision, issued Monday without a majority opinion, allows President Donald Trump’s administration “to racially profile and detain anyone they want,” said Cortez Masto, a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. That includes citizens, she said.

“This kind of racial profiling is unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment,” Cortez Masto said. “We have to shine a light on it. We have to make sure that the American people understand what is going on as well. It’s not just our leaders in Congress that need to take a stand. It is all of us.”

U.S. Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., shared a similar sentiment in a statement, saying “immigration enforcement that relies on racial profiling is unconstitutional, un-American and immoral.”

Tricia McLaughlin, Homeland Security assistant secretary for public affairs, denied Monday that Immigration and Customs Enforcement was targeting people based on “skin color, race or ethnicity.”

Whether it’s a colleague, friend or student, Kagan said he’d had many conversations this past week with people “incredibly scared about” the court’s decision. People are taking inventory of how similarly they line up with “the stereotype that the Supreme Court is targeting here,” he said.

Some of the Latino students that Kagan said he had spoken with don’t fit some of other traits agents can stop people over: They speak “unaccented” English and aren’t in a blue-collar job.

While concerned about themselves, that cohort is more preoccupied with what the decision means for their parents, he said.

“It’s a very ugly kind of conversation to be having,” Kagan said, adding that more people are thinking about carrying documentation proving their citizenship or legal residence.

Cristian Gonzalez-Perez, supervising attorney with immigrant advocacy group Make the Road Nevada, says the “best advice” an attorney can give their Latino clients right now is to carry such documentation, as surreal as that might seem.

That’s more expected in totalitarian countries that many of Gonzalez-Perez’s clients have left, he said.

“The climate and the loss of protections and the active racial profiling that the Supreme Court decision is now allowing will be pretty much requiring people to carry those documents,” he said, adding later that “you wouldn’t expect that to be here.”

Locals attending Make the Road’s monthly family protection plan clinics are increasingly scared, Gonzalez-Perez said. And while the organization has promoted “Know Your Rights” trainings, attendees wonder what would stop the federal government from violating their rights anyway.

People are afraid to go grocery shopping, he said, instead sending their citizen children or a family friend to do it for them.

“And now that this decision came out, it’s just going to explode in the amount of people that we are seeing that are going to be more fearful, especially because of how you look,” Gonzalez-Perez said.

Latino and Asian people feeling compelled to carry documentation proving their legal residency isn’t how the U.S. Constitution is supposed to work, Cortez Masto said.

“Why would you have to carry papers of some sort to prove to some federal agent that you are a United States citizen?” she asked. “That is not how our country is set up, but that’s what the Supreme Court, the conservative members of the court, are basically saying right now.”

Litigation history

On July 2, the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, representing local organizations and a group of people stopped or detained during immigration raids in the region, filed a lawsuit to “end unlawful stops and arrests.”

Nine days later, a federal district judge granted a temporary restraining order preventing immigration agents from stopping people on the basis of only race, language, location and occupation. The order was in effect until last week.

While there was no majority opinion accompanying the Supreme Court’s ruling Monday to temporarily void the lower-court order, conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh clarified his position in a concurring opinion.

“To be clear, apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion,” he wrote. “Under this court’s case law regarding immigration stops, however, it can be a ‘relevant factor’ when considered along with other salient factors.”

Kavanaugh called it “common sense” that “those circumstances taken together constitute at least reasonable suspicion of illegal presence in the United States.”

Kavanaugh also shrugged off concerns organizations involved in the lawsuit have about stops, writing that, if the person stopped is lawfully in the U.S., “that individual will be free to go after the brief encounter.”

“Most people do not carry on them clear documentation of their immigration or citizenship status,” the Immigration Clinic’s Kagan said. “And if you are not Latino, there’s probably still not much reason to worry. But, unfortunately, I think this gives Latinos a very big reason to worry.”

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by her two fellow liberal colleagues, wrote in her dissent that “we should not have to live in a country where the government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job.”

Sotomayor ended her opinion by noting that the Fourth Amendment is supposed to prevent people from “arbitrary interference.”

“After today, that may no longer be true for those who happen to look a certain way, speak a certain way and appear to work a certain type of legitimate job,” she wrote, calling the situation “unconscionably irreconcilable” with the Constitution.

Cortez Masto said Americans should be concerned with what the decision means for the country, asking people to “call out this outrageous abuse of power” by the Supreme Court and the Trump administration.

As Sotomayor noted in her dissent, senior White House officials in June and early July reportedly pushed officers to “turn the creativity knob up” with their tactics and “push the envelope.” White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller also reportedly told officers to target Home Depot and 7-Eleven locations, Sotomayor noted from submissions the plaintiffs’ attorneys made to the court.

Though she harshly criticized the conservative members of the Supreme Court, Cortez Masto said she wasn’t in favor of expanding the court should Democrats regain control of the White House and Congress.

Citing the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Cortez Masto said the court shouldn’t be playing politics.

Cortez Masto said Ginsburg supported keeping the Supreme Court’s makeup at the current nine justices “because it’s about who we put on.”

Meanwhile, the underlying case remains ongoing and actively litigated, with actions unfolding in both district and appellate courts.

“This isn’t the end of the fight,” Cortez Masto said. “This case is going to work its way through the courts. I’ll continue to push for the administration to follow the law. I’m going to monitor this case. My colleagues and I will continue to monitor it.”",https://media.lasvegassun.com/media/img/photos/2025/09/12/0914immigrantsRGB_t1200.jpg?a58a258a4dac404905303588401680fdf3ee23e4,N,,2025-09-14 07:56:24.637540

The changing positions have not only infuriated his far-right allies, but have also confused those aiming to carry out his deportation policies.
In June, Mr. Trump recognized that his immigration agenda was taking a toll on certain industries, including agriculture.
His comments were celebrated by technology executives who said they relied on the program because they could not find enough qualified American workers.
Despite Mr. Trump’s reversals, Mr. Krikorian said he still believed business interests would not curtail the Trump administration’s deportation agenda.","President Trump entered the White House in January promising both the “largest deportation program in American history” and a “golden age” for American businesses.

But in recent weeks, the tension between those two promises has spilled out into the open, leading Mr. Trump to reverse or contradict some of his most significant anti-immigration policies when they threatened to disrupt the economy.

Mr. Trump has celebrated his success in driving down illegal border crossings and in cracking down on immigration more broadly. But he walks a careful line when his hard-line policies collide with his economic agenda — particularly when it comes to foreign workers, student visas and industries that rely on immigrant labor.

The changing positions have not only infuriated his far-right allies, but have also confused those aiming to carry out his deportation policies.

Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement that Mr. Trump “has been incredibly consistent with his immigration policies.” To suggest otherwise, she added, “demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding of the president’s agenda.”

Ms. Jackson said that “while anyone in the country illegally is eligible for deportation, the priority remains criminal illegals who terrorize American communities.”

Mr. Trump last week faced an uproar after immigration agents arrested nearly 500 workers, most of them South Korean citizens, at the construction site of an electric vehicle battery plant in Georgia. The raid caused deep anger in South Korea — a key U.S. ally and trading partner — and had the potential to discourage exactly the kind of foreign investment in U.S. manufacturing that Mr. Trump is trying to achieve.

Even though the Trump administration had argued the workers were in the United States illegally, Mr. Trump temporarily paused the deportations to consider allowing the South Korean workers to stay in the United States and help finish the factory, according to officials in Seoul. Most of the workers did end up returning to South Korea.

Mr. Trump similarly appeared to pull back on his hard-line approach to student visas when it risked upending the finances of American colleges and universities. In May, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the Trump administration would work to “aggressively revoke” visas of Chinese students, and that the administration would “enhance scrutiny” of future applicants from China.

Chinese undergraduates often pay full tuition for their education.

Nearly two months later, Mr. Trump shocked his conservative allies when he said he would let 600,000 Chinese students into American universities. “I like that other countries’ students come here,” Mr. Trump said. “And you know what would happen if they didn’t? Our college system would go to hell very quickly.”

Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, responded by questioning why the administration would allow “600,000 students from China to replace our American student’s opportunities?”

“We should never allow that,” she wrote on X.

Laura Ingraham, the Fox News anchor, pressed Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, on Mr. Trump’s turnabout.

“How is allowing 600,000 students from the communist country of China putting America first?” Ms. Ingraham asked Mr. Lutnick, who argued that Mr. Trump was trying to help support colleges.

“His view is he’s taking a rational economic view,” Mr. Lutnick said.

A White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe the administration’s approach to student visas, said the 600,000 visas were an estimate of the total number of visas expected for Chinese students over the next two years under the government’s existing policy.

In June, Mr. Trump recognized that his immigration agenda was taking a toll on certain industries, including agriculture.

“Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,” he wrote on social media.

That same day, ICE officials sent out guidance telling their agents to largely avoid enforcement at work sites in certain industries, including hotels and restaurants. Days later, officials appeared to backtrack on the guidance, and claimed that all operations would remain on the table.

His comments were celebrated by technology executives who said they relied on the program because they could not find enough qualified American workers. But right-wing activists, including Laura Loomer and Stephen K. Bannon, said the program was harmful because it brought in workers willing to accept lower salaries than Americans.

Last year, in an interview with the hosts of a popular Silicon Valley podcast, Mr. Trump backed permanent residency for immigrants who study at U.S. colleges. “What I will do is: You graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country, and that includes junior colleges,” he said.

Hours later, a spokesman walked the comment back and said Mr. Trump would impose an “aggressive vetting process” for foreign students.

Now in office, the Trump administration has rescinded hundreds of student visas and has moved to rescind green cards from pro-Palestinian protesters or scholars.

Mark Krikorian, the head of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that supports restrictions on immigration, said business interests have for decades swayed Republican administrations, which advocated not just mass deportations but also comprehensive immigration reform.

Despite Mr. Trump’s reversals, Mr. Krikorian said he still believed business interests would not curtail the Trump administration’s deportation agenda.

“There’s no question that the concerns of businesses are going to get a hearing in a Republican administration or a Republican Congress, but it’s not going to be the kind of relationship that existed in the past,” he said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/24/multimedia/14dc-immig-01/24dc-immig-01-vlwg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 07:56:29.440701

Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson favored the Biden administration by 77 percentage points.
Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at Georgetown, said there was a distinct ideological split in rulings on emergency applications filed by the two administrations.
Second, more than two-thirds of the Biden administration’s emergency applications took on rulings from the U.S. Court of Appeals from the Fifth Circuit.
The Biden administration repeatedly asked the Supreme Court to address the issue.","Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh says good judges are like good referees.

“Am I calling it the same way for labor and management, for the business and the environmental interests, for the Republican and the Democrat?” he asked at a judicial conference over the summer. “If you can’t look in the mirror and say, ‘I would do the exact same thing if the parties were flipped,’ then you’re not being a good judge, just like you wouldn’t be a good referee if you were favoring one team over the other.”

A look at the court’s record in emergency rulings does not appear to reflect Justice Kavanaugh’s goal.

Drilling down to individual justices’ votes rounds out the group portrait.

In the 17 cases in which the Biden administration sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court over four years, for instance, Justice Kavanaugh voted in its favor 41 percent of the time, according to an analysis prepared for The New York Times by Lee Epstein and Andrew D. Martin, both of Washington University in St. Louis, and Michael J. Nelson of Penn State.

By contrast, in the 19 cases in which the court has ruled on applications from the second Trump administration, Justice Kavanaugh voted for the administration 89 percent of the time. That amounted to a 48 percentage-point gap in favor of President Trump.

(The analysis ignored withdrawn applications, treated consolidated cases as a single decision and counted orders granting the president partial relief as a victory. It is also theoretically possible that there were dissenting votes in some of the cases that were not made public.)

Testing whether the justices are treating Democrats and Republicans alike presents challenges, as the cases that reach the justices present varied legal issues based on distinctive facts. But a comparison of the court’s treatment of emergency applications, in particular, can be telling.

The justices rule on such applications quickly and almost always without hearing oral argument. Their rulings are provisional, lasting only while the cases proceed through the courts for a final decision. But they can remain in effect for a year or more, meaning they have significant impact and sometimes effectively resolve the disputes.

Rulings on emergency applications filed by the government, moreover, tend to present the same essential questions: how much deference is due the president and whether temporarily blocking a government program challenged as unlawful would cause more harm than letting it proceed.

In their public appearances, the justices try to counter the perception that they favor the agenda of the party of the president who appointed them by noting the many unanimous decisions they issue in argued cases, along with ones featuring unusual coalitions.

On the far left, the size of the gap was identical, but in the other direction. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson favored the Biden administration by 77 percentage points.

By those standards, Justice Kavanaugh’s voting was among the most balanced, though two members of the court had smaller gaps. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. favored President Trump by 21 percentage points, followed by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, at 26 percentage points.

The cases the two administrations pursued were different, of course, making comparison inexact, and the concentrated volume and sheer ambition of President’s Trump’s applications dwarfed those of his predecessor. The court has so far, on a technically temporary basis, let him fire independent agency regulators, cut funding approved by Congress, dismiss transgender troops and remove protections for hundreds of thousands of migrants. Last week, the court allowed him to pursue aggressive roundups of people suspected to be in the country unlawfully.

Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at Georgetown, said there was a distinct ideological split in rulings on emergency applications filed by the two administrations. That is not always the case in argued cases, he said, which sometimes produce unusual alliances after the justices receive full briefing, hear oral arguments and draft long and careful opinions.

The court, as the justices will readily admit, does not do its best work when it must move quickly, and the volume of emergency applications has shifted much of its energy to such fast-moving litigation, often resolved in a matter of weeks instead of in a year or more, as is common for merits cases.

Despite the court’s conservative supermajority, the Biden administration did obtain relief in a slight majority of its emergency applications, including ones involving a commonly used abortion pill and “ghost guns,” which are kits that can be bought online and assembled into untraceable homemade firearms.

But victories like those were influenced by two factors.

Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar, like her predecessor in the first Trump administration and her successor in the current one, made strategic choices about which cases to bring to the court, generally choosing only ones with at least a fair prospect of success.

Second, more than two-thirds of the Biden administration’s emergency applications took on rulings from the U.S. Court of Appeals from the Fifth Circuit. Opponents of the administration’s policies and programs often filed challenges in that circuit, correctly anticipating that they would meet a favorable reception with its especially conservative judges. Still, those rulings often proved too conservative even for a generally conservative Supreme Court.

Moreover, in three cases in which the justices initially turned down the Biden administration’s requests for emergency interim relief from Fifth Circuit rulings, the administration ultimately prevailed when the cases were set down on the merits docket for full briefing and argument.

When the justices are moving fast, without a chance to forge consensus, legal experts said, partisanship may be more apt to influence outcomes. “Their rough-cut assessment and instinct is going to go against the Biden administration and for the Trump administration, even if that doesn’t necessarily track their ultimate disposition of the matter,” said Leah Litman, a law professor at the University of Michigan.

While true apples-to-apples comparisons are hard to come by, as the two administrations have pursued different policies, they were united in their opposition to universal injunctions, a tool federal district courts have used to shut down government programs nationwide.

The Biden administration repeatedly asked the Supreme Court to address the issue. The court’s response to one such request in October 2024 was telling.

When the Fifth Circuit issued a universal injunction blocking a program that helped forgive student debt, the administration sought review of two questions: whether the appeals court’s ruling was correct and whether it had “erred in ordering the district court to enter preliminary relief on a universal basis.”

The Supreme Court granted the administration’s petition. But it said it would consider only the first question, on the student debt issue. (The court ultimately dismissed the case last month.)

Five months after the Biden administration’s petition, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to address universal injunctions on an emergency basis in the context of rulings blocking its efforts to limit birthright citizenship. The court promptly agreed, put the case on a fast track and, in June, ruled for the administration, saying that federal district courts had been abusing such injunctions.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/multimedia/00dc-scotus-ideology1-qgch/00dc-scotus-ideology1-qgch-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 07:56:33.786005

“This kind of racial profiling is unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment,” Cortez Masto said.
People are taking inventory of how similarly they line up with “the stereotype that the Supreme Court is targeting here,” he said.
Though she harshly criticized the conservative members of the Supreme Court, Cortez Masto said she wasn’t in favor of expanding the court should Democrats regain control of the White House and Congress.
Citing the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Cortez Masto said the court shouldn’t be playing politics.","The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for federal agents to stop and detain people based on race, language or even where they work — at least for now. In freezing a lower court’s ruling against the practice, the justices last week signaled a broader reach beyond Los Angeles, sparking alarm that Nevada and other states could soon feel the effects.

“Instead of taking that potential exit ramp on the road to increasing armed aggression against communities, the Supreme Court has basically greenlighted it,” said Michael Kagan, director of the UNLV Immigration Clinic. “When (immigration enforcement agents) do this again in Chicago or Las Vegas or any other community in the country, it would seem a key tool that might have helped constrain the government … has been taken away.”

Kagan and U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., both said the order, despite the case being far from over, is already having a chilling effect among Latino Nevadans.

The 6-3 decision, issued Monday without a majority opinion, allows President Donald Trump’s administration “to racially profile and detain anyone they want,” said Cortez Masto, a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. That includes citizens, she said.

“This kind of racial profiling is unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment,” Cortez Masto said. “We have to shine a light on it. We have to make sure that the American people understand what is going on as well. It’s not just our leaders in Congress that need to take a stand. It is all of us.”

U.S. Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., shared a similar sentiment in a statement, saying “immigration enforcement that relies on racial profiling is unconstitutional, un-American and immoral.”

Tricia McLaughlin, Homeland Security assistant secretary for public affairs, denied Monday that Immigration and Customs Enforcement was targeting people based on “skin color, race or ethnicity.”

Whether it’s a colleague, friend or student, Kagan said he’d had many conversations this past week with people “incredibly scared about” the court’s decision. People are taking inventory of how similarly they line up with “the stereotype that the Supreme Court is targeting here,” he said.

Some of the Latino students that Kagan said he had spoken with don’t fit some of other traits agents can stop people over: They speak “unaccented” English and aren’t in a blue-collar job.

While concerned about themselves, that cohort is more preoccupied with what the decision means for their parents, he said.

“It’s a very ugly kind of conversation to be having,” Kagan said, adding that more people are thinking about carrying documentation proving their citizenship or legal residence.

Cristian Gonzalez-Perez, supervising attorney with immigrant advocacy group Make the Road Nevada, says the “best advice” an attorney can give their Latino clients right now is to carry such documentation, as surreal as that might seem.

That’s more expected in totalitarian countries that many of Gonzalez-Perez’s clients have left, he said.

“The climate and the loss of protections and the active racial profiling that the Supreme Court decision is now allowing will be pretty much requiring people to carry those documents,” he said, adding later that “you wouldn’t expect that to be here.”

Locals attending Make the Road’s monthly family protection plan clinics are increasingly scared, Gonzalez-Perez said. And while the organization has promoted “Know Your Rights” trainings, attendees wonder what would stop the federal government from violating their rights anyway.

People are afraid to go grocery shopping, he said, instead sending their citizen children or a family friend to do it for them.

“And now that this decision came out, it’s just going to explode in the amount of people that we are seeing that are going to be more fearful, especially because of how you look,” Gonzalez-Perez said.

Latino and Asian people feeling compelled to carry documentation proving their legal residency isn’t how the U.S. Constitution is supposed to work, Cortez Masto said.

“Why would you have to carry papers of some sort to prove to some federal agent that you are a United States citizen?” she asked. “That is not how our country is set up, but that’s what the Supreme Court, the conservative members of the court, are basically saying right now.”

Litigation history

On July 2, the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, representing local organizations and a group of people stopped or detained during immigration raids in the region, filed a lawsuit to “end unlawful stops and arrests.”

Nine days later, a federal district judge granted a temporary restraining order preventing immigration agents from stopping people on the basis of only race, language, location and occupation. The order was in effect until last week.

While there was no majority opinion accompanying the Supreme Court’s ruling Monday to temporarily void the lower-court order, conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh clarified his position in a concurring opinion.

“To be clear, apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion,” he wrote. “Under this court’s case law regarding immigration stops, however, it can be a ‘relevant factor’ when considered along with other salient factors.”

Kavanaugh called it “common sense” that “those circumstances taken together constitute at least reasonable suspicion of illegal presence in the United States.”

Kavanaugh also shrugged off concerns organizations involved in the lawsuit have about stops, writing that, if the person stopped is lawfully in the U.S., “that individual will be free to go after the brief encounter.”

“Most people do not carry on them clear documentation of their immigration or citizenship status,” the Immigration Clinic’s Kagan said. “And if you are not Latino, there’s probably still not much reason to worry. But, unfortunately, I think this gives Latinos a very big reason to worry.”

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by her two fellow liberal colleagues, wrote in her dissent that “we should not have to live in a country where the government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job.”

Sotomayor ended her opinion by noting that the Fourth Amendment is supposed to prevent people from “arbitrary interference.”

“After today, that may no longer be true for those who happen to look a certain way, speak a certain way and appear to work a certain type of legitimate job,” she wrote, calling the situation “unconscionably irreconcilable” with the Constitution.

Cortez Masto said Americans should be concerned with what the decision means for the country, asking people to “call out this outrageous abuse of power” by the Supreme Court and the Trump administration.

As Sotomayor noted in her dissent, senior White House officials in June and early July reportedly pushed officers to “turn the creativity knob up” with their tactics and “push the envelope.” White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller also reportedly told officers to target Home Depot and 7-Eleven locations, Sotomayor noted from submissions the plaintiffs’ attorneys made to the court.

Though she harshly criticized the conservative members of the Supreme Court, Cortez Masto said she wasn’t in favor of expanding the court should Democrats regain control of the White House and Congress.

Citing the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Cortez Masto said the court shouldn’t be playing politics.

Cortez Masto said Ginsburg supported keeping the Supreme Court’s makeup at the current nine justices “because it’s about who we put on.”

Meanwhile, the underlying case remains ongoing and actively litigated, with actions unfolding in both district and appellate courts.

“This isn’t the end of the fight,” Cortez Masto said. “This case is going to work its way through the courts. I’ll continue to push for the administration to follow the law. I’m going to monitor this case. My colleagues and I will continue to monitor it.”",https://media.lasvegassun.com/media/img/photos/2025/09/12/0914immigrantsRGB_t1200.jpg?a58a258a4dac404905303588401680fdf3ee23e4,N,,2025-09-14 11:57:14.075431

“We have individuals returning calls every day, but the list doesn’t end,” Harrison said. She runs an apolitical non-profit called Grow Initiative that connects low-income families - immigrant and non-immigrant alike - with food, housing and educational resources.

Since the raid, Harrison said, “families are experiencing a new level of crisis.”

A majority of the 475 people who were detained in the workplace raid - which U.S. officials have called the largest in two decades - were Korean and have returned to South Korea. But lawyers and social workers say many of the non-Korean immigrants ensnared in the crackdown remain in legal limbo or are otherwise unaccounted for.

As the raid began the morning of Sept. 4, workers almost immediately started calling Migrant Equity Southeast, a local nonprofit that connects immigrants with legal and financial resources. The small organization of approximately 15 employees fielded calls regarding people from Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador and Venezuela, spokesperson Vanessa Contreras said.

Throughout the day, people described federal agents taking cellphones from workers and putting them in long lines, Contreras said. Some workers hid for hours to avoid capture, in air ducts or remote areas of the sprawling property. The Department of Justice said some hid in a nearby sewage pond.

People off-site called the organization frantically seeking the whereabouts of loved ones who worked at the plant and were suddenly unreachable.

Like many of the Koreans who were working at the plant, advocates and lawyers representing the non-Korean workers caught up in the raid say that some who were detained had legal authorization to work in the United States.

Neither the Department of Homeland Security nor Immigration and Customs Enforcement responded to emailed requests for comment Friday. It is not clear how many people detained during the raid remain in custody.

Atlanta-based attorney Charles Kuck, who represents both Korean and non-Korean workers who were detained, said two of his clients were legally working under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which was created by former President Barack Obama. One had been released and “should have never been arrested,” he said, while the other was still being held because he was recently charged with driving under the influence.

Another of Kuck’s clients was in the process of seeking asylum, he said, and had the same documents and job as her husband who was not arrested.

Some even had valid Georgia driver’s licenses, which aren’t available to people in the country illegally, said Rosario Palacios, who has been assisting Migrant Equity Southeast. Some families who called the organization were left without access to transportation because the person who had been detained was the only one who could drive.

“It’s hard to say how they chose who they were going to release and who they were going to take into custody,” Palacios said, adding that some who were arrested didn’t have an alien identification number and were still unaccounted for.

Kuck said the raid is an indication of how far-reaching the crackdown by President Donald Trump’s administration is, despite assurances that they are targeting criminals.

“The redefinition of the word ‘criminal’ to include everybody who is not a citizen, and even some that are, is the problem here,” Kuck said.

Many of the families who called Harrison’s initiative said their detained relatives were the sole breadwinners in the household, leaving them desperate for basics like baby formula and food.

The financial impact of the raid at the construction site for a battery factory that will be operated by HL-GA Battery Co. was compounded by the fact that another massive employer in the area - International Paper Co. - is closing at the end of the month, laying off another 800 workers, Harrison said.

Growth Initiative doesn’t check immigration status, Harrison said, but almost all families who have reached out to her have said that their detained loved ones had legal authorization to work in the United States, leaving many confused about why their relative was taken into custody in the first place.

After a summer characterized by masked federal agents detaining immigrants in Los Angeles, the California Legislature passed two measures Thursday that seek to force law enforcement officers to identify themselves.

Senate Bills 627 and 805 were among the most controversial to pass in the final days of this year’s legislative session. They would ban local, out-of-state and federal law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings, as well as require officers to be readily identifiable, respectively.

State Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat and lead author of SB 627: “As we go through this horrific era of mass deportation and a Supreme Court that allows this authoritarian regime to do whatever the heck it wants to do — including straight-up racial profiling of Latino people — California should lead and put a stop to the secret police.”

The measures passed along party lines, with Republicans in opposition. Police unions also oppose the proposed mask ban.

GOP Sen. Tony Strickland of Huntington Beach, in a statement: “This is a reckless anti-law enforcement proposal that puts law enforcement officers and their families at real risk, undermining the safety of the men and women who bravely protect our communities.”

Though Friday was to be the last day of session, lawmakers were expected to extend their work through Saturday to give final votes to some last-minute deals they struck this week. Those that pass will head to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk for his signature or veto, and those that don’t are dead for the year.

Other proposals awaiting Newsom’s decision, include:

Regulate companion bots: SB 243 would put tighter regulations on online chatbots powered by artificial intelligence to limit their risks on young users.

Higher car dealer fees: SB 791 would raise the cap car dealers can charge to process documents from $85 to $260.

Wage boost for incarcerated firefighters: AB 247 would increase the minimum wage for incarcerated firefighters fighting active wildfires to $7.25 an hour.

Abortion pill protections: AB 260 would help protect California pharmacists, doctors and hospitals from penalties for dispensing the abortion pill mifepristone to out-of-state patients and remove the names of patients and providers from abortion medication prescriptions.

Kill mute swans: AB 764 would make it easier for hunters and landowners to kill the invasive species.

Ban plastic glitter: AB 823 would enforce a first-in-the-nation ban on the sale of personal care products that contain plastic glitter or plastic microbeads.

Save the bees: AB 1042 would create a health program for managed honey bees that would provide grants to beekeepers, farmers and others for projects and research supporting the struggling population.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5b72473/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1194x627+0+80/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fc8%2F71%2F7e0c642148da979114f5fecf6291%2Fice-mask-ban.jpg,N,,2025-09-13 22:56:49.668385

The Friday ruling by a three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a lower court order and allows the administration to begin dismantling the program while litigation continues. Humanitarian parole provided temporary legal status and work permits, usually for two years, to people fleeing instability in their home countries.

The court acknowledged the potential consequences for those affected in its ruling. “We recognize the risks of irreparable harm persuasively laid out in the district court’s order: that parolees who lawfully arrived in this country were suddenly forced to choose between leaving in less than a month — a choice that potentially includes being separated from their families, communities, and lawful employment and returning to dangers in their home countries,” the judges wrote. “But absent a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits, the risk of such irreparable harms cannot, by itself, support a stay.”

The ruling marked a legal win for the Trump administration, though it does not immediately alter conditions on the ground. A district court had previously blocked the policy in April, but the Supreme Court lifted that stay in May, signaling that the government had broad discretion to rescind parole programs.

Esther Sung, legal director of the Justice Action Center and co-counsel in the case, criticized the outcome. “People who came here from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela did everything the government asked of them, and the Trump administration cruelly and nonsensically failed to hold up the government’s end of the bargain,” Sung said. “While we are deeply disappointed by this decision, we will continue to advocate zealously for our clients and class members as the litigation continues.”

Government lawyers argued that parole was always intended as a temporary measure and that the Department of Homeland Security has the authority to revoke it without judicial interference. Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the court that reviewing cases individually would be “a gargantuan task” and would obstruct deportation efforts. “The Secretary’s discretionary rescission of a discretionary benefit should have been the end of the matter,” the government’s brief stated.

Plaintiffs countered that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem acted unlawfully by canceling the program wholesale without considering individual humanitarian claims. Attorneys for the migrants urged the appeals court to uphold the district court’s ruling. “The district court applied the law correctly and did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that Secretary Noem’s action inflicted irreparable injury on the class members (among others) and that the public interest and balance of the equities tip sharply in favor of preliminary relief,” they wrote.

Attorneys for the plaintiffs also described the administration’s decision as unprecedented. They called it “the largest mass illegalization event in modern American history,” marking the first time the U.S. government has revoked humanitarian parole for such a large group at once.

The Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Friday their agents were targeting Silvero Villegas-Gonzalez for arrest Friday. They said he was a criminal who was in the country illegally, but his attorney Manuel Carednas said that's not entirely true.

Villegas-Gonzalez's family shared a photo of him to a GoFundMe page after his death on Friday, saying he had just dropped his two sons at school that morning. DHS says an ICE agent was trying to arrest him when he resisted and attempted to drive his car into agents. That's when DHS said an agent fatally shot Villegas-Gonzalez.

""When I realized it was our client, first of all I was upset,"" Cardenas sad. ""It didn't seem to fit the person that I knew.""

CBS News Chicago Investigators found the 38-year-old father had four traffic violations between 2010 and 2019 for offenses including speeding, an expired driver's license, not having insurance, and not having a child restraint seat.

Cardenas said he represented Villegas-Gonzales in two of those cases.

""Both of them were resolved favorably, neither of them involved criminal violence,"" he said.

Homeland Security said Villegas-Gonzalez had a criminal history of reckless driving, and said he entered the U.S. at an unknown date and time. President Trump says anyone in the U.S. illegally is a criminal.

Cardenas disagrees.

""He was undocumented but he was complying with every single law. He was working,"" the attorney said.

Cardenas said Villegas-Gonzalez was respectful, hardworking and willing to comply with what the court required.

""If he had to go to court he would go to court. If he had to pay a fine or he had to do anything the court required, he was very compliant,"" said Cardenas.

Cardenas said he wants to see a full investigation into what happened in Franklin Park to prevent another person from dying over a traffic stop.

Of additional concern is the U.S. deportation of migrants to third countries that have deeply problematic human rights records as clearly delineated in the Human Rights Reports, such as South Sudan, Rwanda and Eswatini.
The country report states that there are “no credible reports of significant human rights abuses,” raising questions about its credibility.
Historically a powerful tool in American policymaking, the Human Rights Reports have traditionally provided an objective source to inform foreign and domestic policy, reflect American values, and project American democratic global leadership.
Any distance between American human rights standards and our handling of migration policy undermines American values and the United States’ position in the world.","The recently released U.S. Department of State Human Rights Reports have stirred significant controversy about notable cuts in length and issue coverage, delayed release, and perceived bias, particularly on countries like Hungary, Brazil and South Africa.

Equally concerning is the disconnect between migration policy and the reports’ coverage of countries like Haiti, Ukraine and Afghanistan and the unduly rosy reporting of countries like El Salvador. Each case highlights this troubling inconsistency, as well as the willingness to deport people to dangerous situations, and — more broadly — a significant divergence from American foreign policy.

The State Department should seriously review the concerns voiced by journalists and democracy defenders about the mischaracterization of human rights situations in countries aligned with the U.S. and those with which tensions exist.

The Department of Homeland Security should carefully review those past or pending deportation cases to highly insecure countries. Given its important oversight responsibility, Congress should investigate whether deported migrants face life-threatening situations due to U.S. deportation, since that would be both inhumane and counter to America’s democratic values.

The inconsistency between U.S. human rights reporting and immigration policy is most clearly seen in efforts to lift protective designations such as temporary protected status for certain foreign nationals in the United States. This provisional legal classification is granted when a home country is considered temporarily unsafe or unable to “adequately” handle the return of its nationals.

Haitians initially received temporary protected status due to a 2010 natural disaster, followed by extensions triggered by extreme security conditions which make return unsafe. The Human Rights Report found that the human rights situation there “worsened significantly” because of “the lack of state capacity to protect civilians from expanding gang violence and individuals’ decreasing rights in areas such as freedom of expression.”

Nevertheless, the administration recently sought to lift temporary protected status for Haitians and has terminated the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela Parole Program that allowed some nationals from those four countries to legally enter and work in the United States temporarily. The courts blocked the effort to remove Haitians’ temporary protected status, but the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela Parole Program termination was allowed to proceed. The administration’s position on these programs illustrates a troubling gap between the reports and humanitarian immigration policy.

Similarly, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced in May that the United States would rescind temporary protected status for Afghan nationals, many of whom supported U.S. objectives in Afghanistan.

“Afghanistan has had an improved security situation, and its stabilizing economy no longer prevent them from returning to their home country,” Noem argued in determining that the conditions “no longer meet the statutory requirements” for temporary protected status.

But the Human Rights Report stated that there was “significant deterioration in respect for women’s rights during the year” and that Taliban members “reportedly killed persons in retaliation for their association with the pre-August 2021 government.”

This is particularly concerning for those Afghans who served U.S. interests and face a heightened threat of retaliation upon return. Leaving aside the moral argument against sending back Afghans who helped the U.S., the State Department’s report makes the case that deporting them would place them in grave danger.

Similarly, Ukrainians who have fled the brutal Russian war were granted a temporary humanitarian status due to the war. The administration withdrew this status which means over 120,000 Ukrainians will be forced to return to their homeland during an active war if they lack an existing asylum request.

Of additional concern is the U.S. deportation of migrants to third countries that have deeply problematic human rights records as clearly delineated in the Human Rights Reports, such as South Sudan, Rwanda and Eswatini.

In the case of El Salvador, whose president is a close partner in the administration’s deportation efforts, the State Department assessments diverged from widespread evidence by respected sources that there are major human rights violations, including against children. The country report states that there are “no credible reports of significant human rights abuses,” raising questions about its credibility.

While deporting people from the United States is within the purview of any American administration and removing people with criminal records is standard policy, sending these individuals to countries where they may face significant abuse and danger is a troubling divergence from traditional U.S. standards and simple decency. So is cutting deals and providing U.S. financial and/or political support to problematic regimes and leaders who host deportees but are also sanctioned by the United States, as is the case with South Sudanese leader Benjamin Bol Mel.

Historically a powerful tool in American policymaking, the Human Rights Reports have traditionally provided an objective source to inform foreign and domestic policy, reflect American values, and project American democratic global leadership. Immigration enforcement, including removals, is a necessary component of immigration policy. But it should not undermine American values and foreign policy objectives.

Any distance between American human rights standards and our handling of migration policy undermines American values and the United States’ position in the world. It also damages America’s credibility and ability to secure its interests globally at a time where these interests are threatened by global competitors.

Judge Timothy J. Kelly's decision Saturday keeps the government from removing Guatemalan children who came to the U.S. alone and are currently living in government shelters and foster care through Sept. 16.

Kelly's order said he needed a brief extension to continue to study the issue because up until a hearing on Sept. 10 the facts of the case were still changing. His decision comes after the government during that hearing backtracked on previous claims that the children's parents requested them back.

The court decision stems from a Labor Day weekend operation when the Trump administration attempted to remove dozens of Guatemalan migrant children who had come to the U.S. alone and were living in U.S. government shelters and foster care.

In a late night operation on Aug. 30, the administration notified shelters where migrant children traveling alone initially live after they cross the southern border that they would be returning the children to Guatemala and that they needed to have the kids ready to leave in a matter of hours.

Contractors for Immigration and Customs Enforcement picked up the Guatemalan children from shelters and foster care and transported them to the airport. The government has said in court filings that it identified 457 children for possible removal to Guatemala although that list was eventually whittled down to 327. In the end, 76 got as far as boarding planes in El Paso and Harlingen, Texas, early morning on Aug. 31 and were set to depart to Guatemala in what the government described as a first phase.

Immigration and children’s advocates, who had been alerted of possible efforts to remove Guatemalan minors, immediately sued the Trump administration to prevent the children’s removal. The advocates argued that many of these children were fleeing abuse or violence in their home countries and that the government was bypassing longstanding legal procedures meant to protect young migrants from being returned to potentially abusive or violent places.

A federal judge in Washington granted advocates a 14-day temporary restraining order largely preventing the Trump administration from removing migrant children in its care except in limited circumstances where an immigration judge had already ordered their removal after reviewing their cases. Kelly's Saturday order extends that protection three more days.

The government has argued that it has the right to return children in their care and it was acting at the behest of the Guatemalan government.

The Guatemalan government has said that it was concerned over minors in U.S. custody who were going to turn 18 and would then be at risk of being turned over to adult detention facilities.

Children who cross the border alone are generally transferred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which falls under the Health and Human Services Department. The children usually live in a network of shelters across the country that are overseen by the resettlement office until they are eventually released to a sponsor, usually a relative.

Children's advocates have also asked the Washington court for longer-term protections preventing the government from removing all children in government custody, with a few limited exceptions, while the lawsuit plays out in court. Advocates made that request after hearing reports that the government was intending to remove Honduran children as well. The court has yet to rule on that request.

There are also temporary restraining orders in separate cases in Arizona and Illinois also filed during the Labor Day weekend where advocates sued to restrict the government from removing Guatemalan and later Honduran children, but those cases are more narrow in scope of children they cover than the Washington case.

The new preliminary injunction — signed by the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island — blocks the Trump administration from implementing the changes indefinitely while litigation continues.
“With today’s decision, vital education, nutrition and health programs like Head Start — and the families who rely on their services — can breathe a sigh of relief,” said Attorney General Bonta.
“The Trump Administration continues to pull the rug out from under California families just trying to get by, but we’re fighting back.
We’re grateful that a district court has put a stop to this cruel new directive while our litigation continues.”","California has secured a court order temporarily blocking the Trump administration from barring immigrants living in the country illegally from accessing dozens of federally funded programs, including child care, health care and education services.

As part of the Trump administration’s proposed change, federally funded programs would be required to verify recipients’ immigration status — reversing a Clinton administration policy that extended “public benefit” programs to people living in the country without legal permission. The Trump administration said the change was necessary to ensure taxpayer-funded “public resources are no longer used to incentivize illegal immigration.”

The new court order comes a few months after California Attorney General Rob Bonta and 20 other state leaders sued the administration over the policy change in July.

In July, the California-led coalition secured a temporary pause preventing the administration from implementing the changes before Sept. 10. The new preliminary injunction — signed by the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island — blocks the Trump administration from implementing the changes indefinitely while litigation continues.

Programs included in the Trump administration’s restriction would include childcare services for low-income families, adult education, mental health and substance use disorder programs, temporary housing assistance, food banks, cooling centers and shelters for at-risk youth and domestic violence survivors, among others.

The proposed restriction would also include Head Start — a national program that serves more than 750,000 low-income children aged 0 to 5-years old across the U.S. The program provides free school meals and medical screenings, child care, and support and job assistance for parents.

Bonta and state leaders said that in addition to causing irreparable harm to vulnerable families, the proposed restrictions barring some immigrants from participation would have a “chilling effect” on all participants of the programs, regardless of immigration status. The states’ lawsuit also said the proposed verification requirements would cost states’ economies hundreds of millions of dollars.

“With today’s decision, vital education, nutrition and health programs like Head Start — and the families who rely on their services — can breathe a sigh of relief,” said Attorney General Bonta. “The Trump Administration continues to pull the rug out from under California families just trying to get by, but we’re fighting back.

While Kirk’s assassination feels like a watershed moment, America is not experiencing its most violent political era.
Yet even the 1960s pale before the Reconstruction Era, America’s true apex of political violence.
What these three eras share isn’t just political violence — it’s the pattern that creates it.
If we let fear of the stranger govern us, it will destroy not only those we despise — it will destroy us too.","Robert F. Kennedy and Charlie Kirk could not have been more different. One was a liberal lion from Massachusetts who championed civil rights and fought poverty; the other was a conservative firebrand from Illinois who built a movement around limited government and traditional values. Kennedy came from political royalty; Kirk rose from suburban obscurity. Kennedy quoted Greek poetry; Kirk quoted the Constitution. They would have disagreed about almost everything.

But on Wednesday, they joined the same tragic American tradition: political leaders killed by bullets. Both men died doing what democracy demands — standing before crowds, speaking their convictions, willing to risk their personal safety for causes they believed in.

The two men defy comparison, but their deaths illuminate something identical: Both lived and died in eras when America’s political divisions became so toxic that disagreement repeatedly turned to violence.

The question haunting us now is the same one that faced America after 1968: Will we let fear of the other side destroy the country we’re all trying to save?

Today’s divisions feel unprecedented, but the nation has been here before — and survived far worse.

While Kirk’s assassination feels like a watershed moment, America is not experiencing its most violent political era. Today’s political violence, troubling as it is, does not approach the systematic bloodshed of the 1960s, when assassins killed President John F. Kennedy, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy within five years. That decade saw 43 people die in riots following King’s murder alone, with hundreds of cities erupting in violence that required federal troops to contain.

Yet even the 1960s pale before the Reconstruction Era, America’s true apex of political violence. Between the end of the Civil War and 1877, organized white supremacist groups systematically terrorized the freed Black population, killing at least 1,000 Black Americans in what amounted to a campaign of political terrorism. The Ku Klux Klan and allied groups overthrew democratically elected governments and drove Black officials from office at gunpoint.

What these three eras share isn’t just political violence — it’s the pattern that creates it. Each period coincided with massive technological and cultural upheavals that fundamentally threatened existing power structures. The Reconstruction Era brought railroads, telegraphs and the end of slavery — changes that remade American society and economy. The 1960s saw television brought into living rooms, while social movements challenged everything from racial hierarchies to gender roles. Today’s era features social media, globalization and demographic shifts that are reshaping American identity itself. In each case, the violence emerged in part from fear of losing a familiar way of life.

The divisions that seem insurmountable today are amplified by new technologies that spread both information and misinformation at unprecedented speed, creating the conditions where political disagreement turns into existential warfare.

Look at what we’re actually fighting about today: artificial intelligence, TikTok ownership, climate policies, gender roles and identities, immigration levels, educational curricula. These are policy questions, not holy wars. But we have let fear merchants transform them into tribal battles where compromise becomes treason and listening becomes weakness.

But history shows us the antidote. It is the same one that built the railroad, won two world wars, put a man on the Moon and created the internet: the radical American idea that strangers can become neighbors, that different voices strengthen rather than threaten the whole, that our diversity is our superpower when we choose cooperation over conquest.

This means our media must reward bridge-building over bomb-throwing. Our laws must protect democratic norms even when breaking them might benefit our side. Our approach to technology must prioritize human connection over corporate profit. Most importantly, we must recommit to the hardest American ideal: listening to those we disagree with, not to change their minds, but to understand why they fear what they do.

Kirk’s assassination is a warning. If we let fear of the stranger govern us, it will destroy not only those we despise — it will destroy us too. But if we choose the harder path of empathy and engagement, if we remember that America’s strength has always come from making room for the next wave of newcomers and their ideas, then, even now, America can remain what it has always been at its best: a country that moves forward together.

Immigration authorities also stated that Silverio Villegas González had no criminal convictions or violent offenses.
These tactics have led to repeated confrontations including fatalities like the death of Silverio Villegas González in Franklin Park, Illinois.","Silverio Villegas González, a 42-year-old Mexican immigrant and father of three, was shot and killed by an ICE officer in Franklin Park, Illinois, late on Wednesday afternoon.

According to authorities, González was initially stopped by ICE agents who claimed that his vehicle matched the description of one purportedly involved in a prior immigration-related investigation.

Friends and family contested this account, emphasizing that González’s only offense was a minor traffic infraction—an expired license plate sticker—in the quiet suburb just west of Chicago.

The shooting of González took place within days of President Trump’s immigration crackdown campaign launched in the Chicago area. Although Cook County officials did not identify him, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Mexican consulate in Chicago identified the ICE victim as Silverio Villegas González.

Eyewitness accounts taken down and reported by WBEZ Chicago said events escalated rapidly after ICE agents approached González, whose fear and panic were clearly visible to everyone nearby.

The WBEZ quoted several people who were on the scene. Maria Martinez, a neighbor, told reporters, “He was just sitting in his car when two men came up out of nowhere, shouting at him in English. Silverio looked scared—he didn’t understand everything they were saying. We heard them yelling, then, all of a sudden, I heard gunshots.”

Another onlooker, Samuel Ramos, recalled: “After the first shot, Silverio tried to get out of the car, but he stumbled into the street. The officers kept shouting at him—telling him to ‘stay put’—but he was holding his hands up, trying to talk. People started gathering, screaming for help, but we were pushed back by the officers.”

The WBEZ account describes confusion and fear among local residents, many of whom did not realize the men in plain clothes were federal agents until after the incident. María Santiago, who resides across the street, said: “Nobody knew they were ICE. They didn’t identify themselves clearly. It looked like a robbery at first, but then they started dragging Silverio away and blocking anyone from getting close.”

As in every act of police brutality that workers are all too familiar with in American cities, ICE released a statement Thursday morning, claiming González “failed to comply with lawful orders” and “acted in a manner that posed a threat to officers.”

The agency also said the use of deadly force was justified, stating: “The incident is under review by ICE’s Office of Professional Responsibility. We regret any loss of life, but our officers were confronting an individual believed to be involved with recent fraudulent document activity and suspected of prior immigration violations.”

The Department of Homeland Security claimed that Silverio Villegas González was an undocumented immigrant. Official statements say he entered the country at an unknown date and was the subject of a targeted ICE enforcement operation in Franklin Park, Illinois. Immigration authorities also stated that Silverio Villegas González had no criminal convictions or violent offenses. The only record with law enforcement against him was a minor traffic violation.

Meanwhile, residents contradicted the ICE narrative of what happened on Wednesday, saying Silverio was not physically threatening anyone. “He wouldn’t hurt anybody,” said Rosa Villegas, his mother. “Silverio was afraid. He was just trying to go home to his kids. I watched his last moments from across the street. There were no weapons, no threats—just confusion and panic. They shot him because they could, not because they had to.”

A next-door neighbor, Jorge Hernández, described Silverio as “a quiet man, a hard worker. He didn’t know what to do when those agents came for him. He was scared for his life, and now he’s gone.”

People close to González spoke of a loving father who had never had trouble with the law. His eldest son, Marco, told reporters: “He worked two jobs, would do anything for us. When those men came for him, he panicked—that’s not a crime. My dad always said he was worried ICE would come someday. He was terrified of being taken away, but he never imagined they would kill him.”

Friends described how González had grown increasingly anxious since the launch of Trump’s immigration sweeps in recent months and took careful steps to avoid trouble. “He stopped going out after dark, just in case,” said family friend Nancy Ríos. “He was just living his life, scared every day.”

Democratic Party Illinois Governor JD Pritzker issued a statement Thursday afternoon, saying “Our state will not allow the unchecked use of deadly force against residents by federal agents,” and “Illinois remains committed to protecting immigrant communities and ensuring accountability for the loss of life.”

Pritzker called for a suspension of ICE raids pending an independent review, but there is no indication that the White House or Department of Homeland Security is going to halt any of the police-state measures being meted out in Chicago and surrounding suburbs.

The Resurrection Project, a Chicago-based immigrant advocacy group, released a statement Thursday evening that read: “Silverio Villegas González is yet another victim of Operation Midway Blitz, a campaign that has placed immigrant families in constant fear and exposed them to violence at the hands of federal agents. … This killing must not go unanswered.”

The shooting comes amid the Trump administration’s escalating immigration enforcement strategies, particularly “Operation Midway Blitz,” a policy announced last year deploying both federal police and National Guard troops in Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, and other major cities.

The operation, justified by the White House as a measure to crack down on violent crime, is part of the war on immigrants and in neighborhoods across the US with aggressive tactics by federal agents against all residents including US citizens, green card holders and others with legal status to live and work in the US. These tactics have led to repeated confrontations including fatalities like the death of Silverio Villegas González in Franklin Park, Illinois.

The deployment of federal troops in Chicago has sparked protests throughout the last year, with comparisons to the “shock-and-awe” methods used during the illegal wars of conquest carried out by US imperialism over the past three decades.

According to statistics compiled by the American Immigration Council and the Chicago Tribune, shooting deaths of immigrants by ICE officers have been on the rise since 2018 . Over the past five years, according to cases that have been identified by advocacy groups, ICE officers have shot and killed at least 14 unarmed individuals nationwide, with four fatal shootings in Illinois since 2021.

Meanwhile, as of September 2025, at least 14 immigrants have died while in ICE custody this year. This is on track to be one of the deadliest in ICE’s history. By comparison, police killings in the US remain at staggering levels, with over 1,100 deaths per year reported by the Mapping Police Violence project, the majority of whom are working-class, poor and people of color.",https://www.wsws.org/asset/4df29ac0-933c-4061-be41-727a755a9bdf?rendition=1600x900,N,,2025-09-13 20:56:58.263851

The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a ruling by U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani, who had decided that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem lacked the discretion to end the immigration ""parole"" granted to about 430,000 migrants under Democratic former President Joe Biden.

The U.S. Supreme Court in May put Talwani's April ruling on hold, allowing the parole terminations to take effect while the litigation played out.

Judge Gustavo Gelpí, writing for a three-judge 1st Circuit panel, said Noem's action forced parolees who entered the United States lawfully to have to choose suddenly between returning to the dangers in their home countries or staying in the United States and risk being detained and deported.

But Gelpí said lawyers for a class of migrants pursuing the case had failed to make a strong showing that Noem lacked authority under a law called the Immigration and Nationality Act to categorically end their parole. All three judges on the panel were appointed by Democratic presidents.

The Biden administration, starting in 2022, let Venezuelans who entered the United States by air request a two-year parole if they passed security checks and had a U.S. financial sponsor. His administration in 2023 expanded that to Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans.

Between October 2022 and January 2025, about 532,000 people received grants of parole through those programs. But in March, Noem moved to terminate the parole programs, affecting about 430,000 migrants.

Esther Sung, a lawyer for the plaintiffs at the immigrant rights group Justice Action Center, called Friday's ruling ""devastating"" but narrow, adding that ""there's still room for us to prevail as the litigation continues and moves to final judgment.""

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

According to lawyer Willy Allen, cited by Café Fuerte, “the most affected will be Venezuelans, Haitians, and Nicaraguans, but Cubans may also suffer the consequences of this decision.”

By 14ymedio

HAVANA TIMES – The humanitarian parole program (CHNV), created to offer legal entry to migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, could be definitively dismantled following a new judicial setback. A ruling issued this Friday by the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Massachusetts authorizes Donald Trump’s Administration to prematurely cancel the permits granted since 2022 to more than half a million people.

The decision confirms that the government has the authority to end migration programs without reviewing cases individually, even if they are still pending in the courts, something that, in practice, was already happening, with migrants being arrested even at courthouse doors, and allows for immediate detention and deportation of those who have not managed to regularize their status.

“We recognize the risks of irreparable harm, convincingly laid out in the district court’s order: that parolees who arrived legally in this country were suddenly forced to choose between leaving in less than a month, a decision that potentially includes being separated from their families, communities, and legal jobs, and returning to dangers in their countries of origin,” the judges explained.

Nonetheless, they concluded that there was “no strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits” and that “the risk of such irreparable harms alone cannot justify halting the suspension” of parole.

Asked about the ruling by Café Fuerte, immigration lawyer Wilfredo Allen lamented that “we are witnessing the burial of humanitarian parole.” He explained that the measure will particularly impact Venezuelans, Haitians, and Nicaraguans, though Cubans “may also suffer the consequences of this decision.”

Allen reminded that Cuban migrants who arrived in the US through humanitarian parole have the option, after one year and one day of presence on US territory, to apply under the Cuban Adjustment Act, still considered a form of legal admission in the US, but he warned that this does not protect them from “being detained and placed in deportation proceedings.” For this reason, he recommended “that everyone avoid problems while waiting for their legal residency.”

According to official figures, more than 110,000 Cubans have arrived in the US through parole. Most are already in the process of applying for residency, but around 600—who entered between September and December 2024, under the last rounds of parole approvals, have not yet obtained a legal status and are in the most vulnerable position.

The appeals court ruling backs the actions of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which last March abruptly canceled the migration program and revoked all valid permits with just 30 days’ notice. The measure was blocked by a federal judge in Boston, but in May the Supreme Court overturned that protection.

Friday’s ruling sets a precedent by establishing that the Immigration and Nationality Act allows this type of program to be canceled without the need for case-by-case review.

The humanitarian parole program was launched in 2022 with the aim of providing a legal pathway for citizens of crisis-stricken countries to enter the US, and its cancellation was one of Trump’s main objectives in implementing his migration policy upon taking office.

The attempt at mass revocation has been criticized by multiple NGOs and migrant rights advocates, who argued—among other points—that if parole was granted on a case-by-case basis, it should also be revoked in the same manner.

The litigation is not yet over, and lawsuits for violations of due process continue in federal courts. However, in practice, the Trump Administration now has the legal tool to detain and deport those who have not yet secured another legal status in the United States.

On Wednesday, a federal district court judge in Los Angeles issued a sweeping preliminary injunction barring Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officers from “dispersing, threatening, or assaulting” journalists or legal observers, or using crowd control weapons on or shooting projectiles at anyone who doesn’t “pose a threat of imminent harm.”

The Los Angeles area has been rocked by protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids since June 6, when the Trump administration first targeted it for a crackdown on undocumented immigrants.

DHS officers have “unleashed crowd control weapons indiscriminately and with surprising savagery” in “retaliation” for those “constitutionally protected” protests and the related activities of journalists and observers, Judge Hernán Vera, a Biden appointee, stated in his ruling.

DHS does not have “carte blanche to unleash near-lethal force on crowds of third parties in the vicinity. Indeed, under the guise of protecting the public, federal agents have endangered large numbers of peaceful protestors, legal observers, and journalists—as well as the public that relies on them to hold their government accountable,” Judge Vera wrote. “The First Amendment demands better.”

The judge concluded that “federal agents’ indiscriminate use of force … will undoubtedly chill the media’s efforts to cover these public events and protestors seeking to express peacefully their views on national policies.”

As the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) reported in August, journalists in Los Angeles have been repeatedly and severely injured by the actions of DHS, the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department (LASD), and the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) while covering protests against ICE raids and the Trump administration’s deployment of Marines and the National Guard to the city.

“Since the federal government began its violent, chaotic invasion of Southern California, our communities have risen together to bear witness and to speak out for their neighbors and loved ones,” said Adrienna Wong, senior staff attorney at the ACLU Foundation of Southern California, in a statement. “This ruling affirms their constitutional rights to do just that.”

“By granting this relief, the court has affirmed the journalistic duty to our communities and the essential role of a free press,” said Ryanne Mena, a journalist and one of the plaintiffs.

“I’ve spent countless hours compiling evidence of police misconduct toward journalists in Los Angeles. The attacks this summer have been relentless,” said Adam Rose, press rights chair of the Los Angeles Press Club, the lead plaintiff in the case. “It was a relief to hear Judge Vera acknowledge a ‘mountain of evidence’ as we sat in his courtroom last month. This decision affirms our right to be free from violence while doing our jobs.”

The court’s disturbing factual findings about the violence committed by DHS officers include specifically targeting members of the press with “less lethal” rounds even when they were far from protesters; firing on the media even after most protesters had left; and shooting tear gas canisters and pepper balls directly at reporters and others who posed no threat.

“In a disturbing number of cases,” DHS officers shot people in the head, Judge Vera wrote, noting that “less lethal” projectiles are meant to be aimed at the ground and “can—and have—caused severe trauma and death” when “aimed at the head.”

Judge Vera rejected DHS’s “baseless accusations that Plaintiffs themselves participated in violent riots,” saying the agency had failed to produce “a shred of evidence” to support that claim.

The court found that the injunction was necessary because of “strong and persuasive evidence of retaliatory intent” and the likelihood that DHS would continue to violate the First Amendment rights of journalists, legal observers, and peaceful protesters. DHS officers “have injured three members of LA Press Club and NewsGuild” since the denial of a temporary restraining order by a different judge on June 20, Vera noted.

Still, real questions remain as to whether or not DHS will comply with the order. In May, a federal judge in Boston found that DHS had violated a court order by deporting eight men to South Sudan. Members of the LAPD brutalized journalists even after being enjoined against doing so. Nick Stern, who was attacked by officers from both the LAPD and the LASD, said that he is not optimistic that DHS will comply with the preliminary injunction.

“These rulings come down, but when you’re on the ground, they are ignored much of the time,” Stern told CMD. “It seems to make very little difference in behavior. It’s a good administrative success, but whether or not it makes a difference on the streets remains to be seen.”

BOSTON (Reuters) -A federal appeals court rejected on Friday a challenge by immigrant rights advocates to the decision by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to revoke the temporary legal status of hundreds of thousands of Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans living in the United States.

The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a ruling by U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani, who had decided that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem lacked the discretion to end the immigration ""parole"" granted to about 430,000 migrants under Democratic former President Joe Biden.

The U.S. Supreme Court in May put Talwani's April ruling on hold, allowing the parole terminations to take effect while the litigation played out.

Judge Gustavo Gelpí, writing for a three-judge 1st Circuit panel, said Noem's action forced parolees who entered the United States lawfully to have to choose suddenly between returning to the dangers in their home countries or staying in the United States and risk being detained and deported.

But Gelpí said lawyers for a class of migrants pursuing the case had failed to make a strong showing that Noem lacked authority under a law called the Immigration and Nationality Act to categorically end their parole. All three judges on the panel were appointed by Democratic presidents.

The Biden administration, starting in 2022, let Venezuelans who entered the United States by air request a two-year parole if they passed security checks and had a U.S. financial sponsor. His administration in 2023 expanded that to Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans.

Between October 2022 and January 2025, about 532,000 people received grants of parole through those programs. But in March, Noem moved to terminate the parole programs, affecting about 430,000 migrants.

Esther Sung, a lawyer for the plaintiffs at the immigrant rights group Justice Action Center, called Friday's ruling ""devastating"" but narrow, adding that ""there's still room for us to prevail as the litigation continues and moves to final judgment.""

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Justice Department, in asking the 1st Circuit to overturn Talwani's decision, pointed to the Supreme Court's action staying her ruling and urged the appeals court to ""reject the plaintiffs' brazen request to defy the Supreme Court.""

Sign up for the free Mother Jones Daily.

When it passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in June, Congress handed nearly $75 billion to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Some $30 billion of that money will be spent on enforcement and deportation—hiring spree incoming—and another $45 billion will go toward new detention centers, including 50 by the end of the year.

The OBBB immediately supercharged President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign, which already had been terrorizing immigrant communities and sending asylum seekers to a hellish prison in El Salvador. But an important part of the detention state ramp-up has flown under the radar: ICE’s increased cooperation with local law enforcement agencies.

On Friday, ICE hit a new milestone: The agency has now signed more than 1,000 so-called 287(g) agreements nationwide. These agreements, which deputize local police and jails to perform certain immigration enforcement functions, have exploded under Trump. At the end of the Biden presidency, ICE had just 135 287(g) deals in place; now there are 1,001—a 641 percent increase.

About half of these agreements are what ICE calls task force agreements, which allow state and local cops to essentially act as immigration agents while fulfilling their regular police duties. If these sound familiar—and familiarly problematic—it’s because they were discontinued in 2012, following a Department of Justice investigation the year before that found widespread racial profiling by Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office, then led by the notorious Joe Arpaio. The Trump administration brought task forces back this year, and ICE has signed more than 500 of these particular agreements across 33 states.

As my colleague Laura C. Morel wrote in July, Florida has led the way in signing 287(g) agreements, as part of its larger push to be a leader in Trump’s deportation efforts (see also: the Alligator Alcatraz tent city). In fact, state legislators even passed into law a bill that requires county jails and the sheriff’s offices running those facilities to participate in 287(g). Local advocates told Laura they were worried about what all this would mean for immigrant communities across Florida:

Growing cooperation between ICE and police in Florida will affect the day-to-day lives of immigrant families. “It’s not just about [an immigrant asking]: ‘What happens if I have to have an interaction with a police officer in some sort of criminal context?’” Greer says. “Living your life and existing in this community is now an extreme risk to being able to come home and see your kids, being able to come home and see your family. It is incredibly frightening.”

State cooperation with federal immigration authorities can lead to “rippling harm” on the communities that police are meant to serve and protect, says Shayna Kessler, director of the Advancing Universal Representation Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice. “It increases distrust in law enforcement. It increases fear in immigrant communities, it decreases the ability of immigrants to take care of their families, to support the economy, and to be strong and stable members of their communities.”

The federal government is already pumping billions of dollars into Trump’s anti-immigration crackdown, unleashing masked agents all across America. But in many places, undocumented immigrants will now also have to worry that any encounter with a police officer could lead to their deportation.",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20250913_287g.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-09-13 15:56:38.914984

“ It made me sick and made me cough, and I fell down to the ground,” the retired UC Irvine medical professor said.

He still doesn't know what hit him. And he wasn't the only one.

Injured journalists and protesters together with the Los Angeles Press Club and the media union the NewsGuild sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in June, arguing that federal agents' use of force during anti-ICE protests ""punishes and suppresses the exercise of First Amendment-protected rights."" The press club also sued the Los Angeles Police Department, citing violations of journalists’ rights while covering protests.

In back to-back rulings this week, a federal judge issued preliminary injunctions against the LAPD and DHS, restricting their use of force against the press. The ruling against DHS also protects legal observers and protesters, such as Detrano, from indiscriminate force.

About the ruling against DHS

“The First Amendment demands better,” Judge Hernán Vera of the Central District Court of California wrote in his 45-page opinion.

The judge’s injunction applies to Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Riverside and San Bernardino counties.

Peter Eliasberg, chief counsel at the ACLU Southern California, called the judge’s decision “incredibly thorough.”

LAist has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment and to see if the government intends to appeal the injunction.

The judge said that federal agents used “the guise of protecting the public” to endanger large swathes of protesters and media.

Agents' indiscriminate use of force “will undoubtedly chill the media’s efforts to cover these public events and protestors seeking to express peacefully their views on national policies,” the judge wrote in his opinion.

He acknowledged that there are actors in protests who look to incite violence, but he wrote that “the actions of a relative few does not give DHS carte blanche to unleash near-lethal force on crowds of third parties in the vicinity.”

In his opinion, Vera wrote that federal agents also used weapons such as tear gas and pepper balls even when protesters tried to comply with orders to disperse.

The indiscriminate use of weapons, he wrote, supports the idea that agents were using force in retaliation against protesters.

About the ruling against the LAPD

In the ruling against the Los Angeles Police Department, the judge wrote, “It is déjà vu all over again.”

Vera wrote the latest protests presented “the latest chapter in a long and unfortunate saga of the LAPD’s use of unlawful force against members of the media.”

The judge wrote that the LAPD appeared to use projectiles to target journalists wearing visible gear that identified them as press.

In an emailed statement in response to the ruling, LAPD said the agency will continue to comply with the court order.

""The LAPD trains our officers to identify and respect working journalists during protest and we remain committed to protecting the rights of the press,"" the statement said.

A win for the First Amendment

The decisions were seen as a massive win for First Amendment advocates. It also comes as local law enforcement agencies — such as the Los Angeles Police Department, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department and the Santa Ana Police Department — are under scrutiny for the way they interact with the public during protests.

The judge wrote that the role of the journalist is “critical” in this moment where “the federal government is engaged in sudden and secretive immigration raids, which the public has limited opportunity to observe firsthand and so must rely upon the press.""

Adam Rose, the press rights chair at the Los Angeles Press Club applauded the judge for upholding First Amendment protections.

“ When a reasonable person is afraid to go out and to speak freely, that is about as un-American and unpatriotic as it gets,” he said. “And when DHS is responsible for that, someone has to police the police. That's what the judge here is doing.”

The judge’s preliminary injunction, Rose said, is the first time he “ felt that someone with power and authority was taking this seriously and really trying to act to address the problems” with law enforcement intentionally targeting journalists as retaliation for informing the public.

When law enforcement indiscriminately targets protesters with less lethal weapons, Rose said, it has the effect of “chilling of rights.”

Rose said the LAPD’s response to protests this summer were “painfully familiar” to similar misconduct at protests over the years, including those that followed the death of George Floyd in 2020 and those linked to the Black Lives Matter movement.

“LAPD has failed to police itself for 25 years,"" Rose said. ""Elected officials have failed to police LAPD too.

This announcement comes only two days after Louisiana officials confirmed that 51 male immigrant detainees had already been transferred to a new detention center on the grounds of the notorious Louisiana State Penitentiary, nicknamed “Angola”. Angola is on the grounds of a former slave plantation, and the mostly-Black prisoner population is still forced to do the same agricultural labor once performed by enslaved Black people on the very same land.

Grassroots activists are organizing a rally in New Orleans on September 16 to protest the deployment of the national guard, comparing the move to the Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard troops in other parts of the country, such as Washington, DC and Trump’s ramped up immigration crackdown in the Chicago area. The enforcement operations in Chicago escalated to fatal levels on September 12: On Friday, ICE agents fatally shot undocumented immigrant Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez after he allegedly drove his vehicle towards the agents.

“Just as in DC, Los Angeles, and now Memphis, Louisiana’s communities will continue to resist this racist police takeover,” said Jade Woods, another New Orleans-based organizer part of the planning for the rally on Tuesday.

“The deployment of the National Guard to assist ICE in Louisiana, it is the latest escalation in an ongoing attack against our immigrant communities,” said Cecilia Paz, one of the organizers planning Tuesday’s rally. “We know that the National Guard only makes bad situations worse just from history.

“In terms of Angola being used as an isolation facility, we know that Angola prison is literally a site of modern day slavery. It is a former plantation that has been turned into a massive prison. It’s notorious for human rights violations. Prisoners are forced to endure forced labor through the Angola farm,” Paz continued. “At the same time, Louisiana has the second highest number of ICE detention facilities in the country. So this latest attack is an escalation and affirms how the far right uses Louisiana as a black site,” Paz said referencing how pro-Palestine students such as Mahmoud Khalil and Rumesya Ozturk were held in ICE detention facilities far from where both were originally from in the Northeast of the United States.",https://peoplesdispatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ice-dhs-louisiana-national-guard.jpeg,N,,2025-09-13 15:56:43.751563

The Trump administration's push for deportations isn't deterring the Mexican American community in Chicago from coming out and celebrating their culture.

From downtown to Pilsen and Little Village, expect parades, car caravans, street closures, and large crowds.

Mexican Americans said they feel it's extra-important to show up this year.

With the Mexican flag flying behind his truck, Ricky Medina was getting ready on Friday to lead a car caravan throughout the city.

""I understand they say we fly another country's flag, but it's not another country, it's our culture,"" he said.

It's his way of celebrating Mexican Independence Day.

""We're born here, we're American, but we're proud of our culture as Mexican Americans, and we're going to be out here. You're not going to scare us. We're still going to celebrate,"" he said.

Medina said he's encouraging a weekend of peaceful caravans – long lines of cars that he said started with car clubs in Chicago, and has expanded in recent years to take over much of Chicago's downtown.

In spite of increased fears of enhanced immigration enforcement under ""Operation Midway Blitz,"" while some are staying home, Medina said plenty of crowds will still be outside.

""They're scared that ICE is going to come out,"" Medina said. ""So the more united we are, the less they can with us.""

Last year, the city temporarily closed streets in downtown Chicago to most traffic to avoid the gridlock that had been caused by the car caravans in previous years. They're prepared to do so again, if needed, between Friday and the official holiday on Tuesday.

Depending on the size of any car caravans driving through the city, it's possible the city will limit cars headed into the downtown area by setting up access points at the following intersections:

Chicago Avenue and Green Street

Halsted Street and Washington Boulevard

Halsted and Madison streets

Halsted Street and Jackson Boulevard

Division Street and LaSalle Drive

Roosevelt Road and Canal Street

Taylor and Desplaines streets

18th and State streets

18th Street and Michigan Avenue

18th Street and Indiana Avenue

The city's Office of Emergency Management and Communications said people who live or work in the downtown area should be prepared to show a driver's license or employee ID at one of those access points. Anyone coming downtown for an event or reservation should be prepared to show proof of that, such as a ticket, electronic reservation confirmation, or other documentation.

Meantime, Lincoln United Methodist Church pastor Emma Lozano said many of her congregants have been participating in mass virtually, and she is encouraging anyone else with concerns about ICE activity to do the same for the Little Village parade on 26th Street on Sunday.

""We're telling people that if you feel afraid or at risk, then stay home. We'll try to livestream, it if possible, but we're standing in solidarity for you,"" she said.

The Boston-based First US Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a ruling by US District Judge Indira Talwani, who had decided that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem lacked the discretion to end the immigration ""parole"" granted to about 430,000 migrants under Democratic former President Joe Biden.

The US Supreme Court in May put Talwani's April ruling on hold, allowing the parole terminations to take effect while the litigation played out.

Judge Gustavo Gelpi, writing for a three-judge First Circuit panel, said Noem's action forced parolees who entered the United States lawfully to have to choose suddenly between returning to the dangers in their home countries or staying in the United States and risk being detained and deported.

But Gelpi said lawyers for a class of migrants pursuing the case had failed to make a strong showing that Noem lacked authority under a law called the Immigration and Nationality Act to categorically end their parole. All three judges on the panel were appointed by Democratic presidents.

The Biden administration, starting in 2022, let Venezuelans who entered the United States by air request a two-year parole if they passed security checks and had a US financial sponsor. His administration in 2023 expanded that to Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans.

Between October 2022 and January 2025, about 532,000 people received grants of parole through those programs. But in March, Noem moved to terminate the parole programs, affecting about 430,000 migrants.

Esther Sung, a lawyer for the plaintiffs at the immigrant rights group Justice Action Center, called Friday's ruling ""devastating"" but narrow, adding that ""there's still room for us to prevail as the litigation continues and moves to final judgement"".

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The new preliminary injunction — signed by the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island — blocks the Trump administration from implementing the changes indefinitely while litigation continues.
“With today’s decision, vital education, nutrition and health programs like Head Start — and the families who rely on their services — can breathe a sigh of relief,” said Attorney General Bonta.
“The Trump Administration continues to pull the rug out from under California families just trying to get by, but we’re fighting back.
We’re grateful that a district court has put a stop to this cruel new directive while our litigation continues.”","California has secured a court order temporarily blocking the Trump administration from barring immigrants living in the country illegally from accessing dozens of federally funded programs, including child care, health care and education services.

As part of the Trump administration’s proposed change, federally funded programs would be required to verify recipients’ immigration status — reversing a Clinton administration policy that extended “public benefit” programs to people living in the country without legal permission. The Trump administration said the change was necessary to ensure taxpayer-funded “public resources are no longer used to incentivize illegal immigration.”

The new court order comes a few months after California Attorney General Rob Bonta and 20 other state leaders sued the administration over the policy change in July.

In July, the California-led coalition secured a temporary pause preventing the administration from implementing the changes before Sept. 10. The new preliminary injunction — signed by the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island — blocks the Trump administration from implementing the changes indefinitely while litigation continues.

Programs included in the Trump administration’s restriction would include childcare services for low-income families, adult education, mental health and substance use disorder programs, temporary housing assistance, food banks, cooling centers and shelters for at-risk youth and domestic violence survivors, among others.

The proposed restriction would also include Head Start — a national program that serves more than 750,000 low-income children aged 0 to 5-years old across the U.S. The program provides free school meals and medical screenings, child care, and support and job assistance for parents.

Bonta and state leaders said that in addition to causing irreparable harm to vulnerable families, the proposed restrictions barring some immigrants from participation would have a “chilling effect” on all participants of the programs, regardless of immigration status. The states’ lawsuit also said the proposed verification requirements would cost states’ economies hundreds of millions of dollars.

“With today’s decision, vital education, nutrition and health programs like Head Start — and the families who rely on their services — can breathe a sigh of relief,” said Attorney General Bonta. “The Trump Administration continues to pull the rug out from under California families just trying to get by, but we’re fighting back.

“But absent a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits, the risk of such irreparable harms cannot, by itself, support a stay,” they added.

With the ruling, the appeals court will lift the stay issued by the district court and allow the Trump administration to target thousands of migrants for deportation.

Esther Sung, the legal director of Justice Action Center and a co-counsel in the case, says the decision will “hurt everyone.”

“People who came here from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela did everything the government asked of them, and the Trump administration cruelly and nonsensically failed to hold up the government’s end of the bargain,” Sung said. “While we are deeply disappointed by this decision, we will continue to advocate zealously for our clients and class members as the litigation continues.”

The Justice Department had argued that it has the power to revoke the temporary protections and that the Department of Homeland Security should be able to do so without court interference.

The Guardian has reviewed leaked data from charter airline Global Crossing (GlobalX) that detailed the journeys of tens of thousands of immigrants who have been shuttled around the country before deportation. We also took a close look at an Alexandria, Louisiana, facility run by the Geo Group, a private contractor, that has emerged as Trump’s deportation hub. Here are our findings after a four-month investigation:

44,000 immigrants, 1,700 flights, 100 days

GlobalX carried out more than 1,700 flights for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the vast majority of them between domestic US airports, between January and May. The airline transported nearly 1,000 children, including nearly 500 children under the age of 10, and 22 infants.

For many immigrants, the flight paths were long, with multiple legs and layovers. Nearly 3,600 people were moved around repeatedly, forced to board five or more GlobalX flights.

Immigrants were also moved between detention facilities more than before. The average number of transfers per person has markedly increased in the past six months, and some detained immigrants have been moved as many as 10 or 20 times.

Detainees were moved around the US without notice, to locations far from their families, communities and legal counsel – leading to apparent violations of constitutional due process rights.

Along their journeys, immigrants say they were repeatedly kept in the dark about where they were going. Some say they were threatened by immigration agents with long-distance transfers and separation from their families if they did not accept voluntary deportation.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said that immigrants in custody are informed about their transfers and allowed to contact their families throughout their detention. “Claims that transfers of detainees are being ‘weaponized’ or ‘hidden’ are also categorically false,” the DHS said.

The ‘black hole’ where immigrants disappear

The GlobalX flight manifests show that a small regional airport in Alexandria, Louisiana, has become the transfer and deportation hub of Trump’s mass deportation program. Twenty thousand migrant detainees passed through the Alexandria airport at a rate of almost 200 a day during the first 100 days of Trump’s second term.

The Alexandria staging facility, which opens up directly on to the airport tarmac, allowing immigration authorities easy access to Ice charter flights, is supposed to hold detainees for a maximum of 72 hours.

The Guardian reviewed detailed DHS data, interviewed 10 former Alexandria detainees or their loved ones, and reviewed legal filings and contract documents to reveal that the center is routinely holding people for longer than 72 hours, is accused of a pattern of due process violations, and has been abruptly absolved of certain healthcare standards.

Former detainees told the Guardian they could not change their clothes or underwear at all while detained there, experienced lengthy delays in receiving medication and medical care, and in some cases had no telephone access to call their loved ones or legal representatives. The center does not provide any space for legal visitation or confidential legal phone calls, leading some lawyers to label it a “black box”.

The Trump administration has denied that immigrants are being mistreated in detention and said “Ice has higher detention standards than most US prisons”. The Geo Group said its facility is never “overcrowded”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/004ee3640db0bf92eda6cf52094082fdf4d9fca3/318_0_3175_2540/master/3175.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=896ed9bc85499a434f8f28c866f0e42d",N,,2025-09-13 12:57:45.316987

Her family says Kaur has no criminal record and has complied with immigration check-ins every six months for more than a decade.

About 200 people gathered at the intersection of Appian Way and San Pablo Damn Road Friday evening. Demonstrators carried signs that read ""Hands off our grandma"" and ""She’s no criminal,"" as several cars honked in support.

Family fights for answers and access to care

Kaur has lived in the Bay Area since the early 1990s. Her family says she has worked as a seamstress in Berkeley for decades and has complied with every immigration check-in in San Francisco, every six months, for the past 13 years.

But on Monday, without warning, she was detained at the San Francisco ICE office while returning a travel application requested by ICE. Her family says no explanation was given when she was detained, and they are worried she has not had access to all of her medication.

The family noted that for the first time, during a routine check-in in August, ICE did not allow any family members to accompany her inside the building.

During a rare phone call this week, her daughter-in-law, Manjit Kaur, described Harjit’s deteriorating condition.

""Just the sound in her voice yesterday, I could hear the anxiety, I could hear that she's losing her strength, breaking down, I'm very concerned as far as her health. She's not getting her medication,"" Manjit said. ""Emotionally, she's a mess.""

Harjit was moved from San Francisco to a detention center in Bakersfield, and the family has yet to receive any information on why she was detained.

""She’s been here over 30 years, working, paying taxes. I don’t even think she has a speeding ticket, any type of violation like that. She’s a part of the community,"" Manjit said.

Ikjot Sandhu is her first grandchild.

""My grandmother, she was more like a mother to me. For the last 26 years, she’s been taking care of me,"" Sandhu said.

Her niece, Sukhjit Kaur, expressed frustration and sadness over the situation.

""I feel very sad, I feel helpless, I feel like there’s nothing we can do and this is our only voice,"" Sukhjit Kaur said. ""There are thousands of Harjits locked up, everyone’s grandmas, mothers, families, children whose parents have been taken away from them, innocent people.""

Congressman John Garamendi said his office has sent an inquiry to ICE requesting that Kaur be reunited with her family. In a statement, Garamendi said:

""President Trump initially promised to go after the ‘worst of the worst’ in his immigration policy. Yet this administration’s decision to detain a 73-year-old woman—a respected member of the community with no criminal record who has faithfully reported to ICE every six months for more than 13 years is one more example of the misplaced priorities of Trump’s immigration enforcement. Our office will do everything possible to support her case and her family.""

The migrants have been detained for five days in Ghana in “squalid conditions and surrounded by armed military guards in an open-air detention facility,” called Dema Camp, the complaint says.
The complaint, filed by lawyers for Asian Americans Advancing Justice, asks a judge to immediately halt deportations to their countries of origin.
The lawsuit was filed a day after Ghana’s president confirmed the arrival of the 14 deportees.
The lawsuit says 14 West Africans were taken from their cells at an ICE detention center in Alexandria, Louisiana.","(AP) — Some West Africans who were deported from the U.S. to Ghana were held in “straitjackets” for 16 hours on a flight during which all passengers were shackled and given only bread and water, according to a lawsuit filed Friday.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington on behalf of five migrants, says passengers were awoken in the middle of the night on Sept. 5 and not told where they were going until hours into the flight on a U.S. military cargo plane.

The migrants have been detained for five days in Ghana in “squalid conditions and surrounded by armed military guards in an open-air detention facility,” called Dema Camp, the complaint says. Conditions are “abysmal and deplorable,” with tents for shelter and little running water.

The migrants are not from Ghana and have been told they will be sent to other countries that have been determined to be too dangerous by U.S. immigration judges — making it the latest legal challenge to the Trump administration’s practice of sending people to countries other than their own, including El Salvador, Panama, Costa Rica and several African nations.

The complaint, filed by lawyers for Asian Americans Advancing Justice, asks a judge to immediately halt deportations to their countries of origin.

“Defendants have enlisted the government of Ghana to do their dirty work,” it says. “Despite the minimal, pass-through involvement of the Ghanaian government, Defendants’ objective is clear: deport individuals who have been granted fear-based relief from being sent to their countries of origin to those countries anyway, in contravention to the rulings of U.S. immigration judges and U.S. immigration law.”

The Homeland Security Department and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The lawsuit was filed a day after Ghana’s president confirmed the arrival of the 14 deportees. Ghana joined Eswatini, Rwanda and South Sudan as African countries that have received migrants from third countries who were deported from the U.S., an approach whose legality has been questioned by lawyers and human rights organizations.

President Donald Trump has been aggressively cracking down on immigrants he describes as criminals and “aliens” from countries whose nationals have overstayed their visas in the U.S.

Lawyers and activists have said the Trump administration appears to be making such requests to the nations most affected by his policies on trade, migration and aid.

None of the 14 deportees were originally from Ghana and the five West-Africans who filed the lawsuit did not have ties with the country or designate it as a potential country of removal, according to the complaint.

Plaintiffs are identified only by initials in the complaint. Four are “in immediate danger of being sent on, within hours, to their countries.” One has already been removed to The Gambia and is in hiding, despite having “repeatedly stated his fear” of returning to his country.

Three plaintiffs are from Nigeria and two from The Gambia. The lawsuit says 14 West Africans were taken from their cells at an ICE detention center in Alexandria, Louisiana.

Reid, along with Nastasia Lawton-Sticklor of Leominster and Nathan Phillips of Newton, had approached the field office with baskets of sandwiches, granola bars, fruit and other snacks.
The ICE field office is a large two-story building located in a busy office park near the Burlington Mall.
They were arraigned in Woburn District Court and released on the condition they stay away from the Burlington office.
Since details about the conditions inside the Burlington field office first emerged this summer, several groups of protesters gather outside the building weekly.","Three people were arrested outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Burlington on Friday, after they tried to deliver food to people detained there.

""We've heard some pretty compelling evidence that people are not being given enough food, not being given sanitary supplies, blankets,"" said Eleanor Reid of Hanover, N.H., before the arrests. ""And since our government is not doing that, we are here to do it ourselves.""

Reid, along with Nastasia Lawton-Sticklor of Leominster and Nathan Phillips of Newton, had approached the field office with baskets of sandwiches, granola bars, fruit and other snacks. They said they were concerned about the welfare of immigrants held at the facility, based on reports from former detainees that they weren't given much to eat while in ICE custody there.

""We're here to deliver food and care packages to the people being held here, and visit with them, if possible, to make sure they're doing okay,"" Lawton-Sticklor told WBUR. ""We have some deep concerns about food, basic necessities, being withheld from them.""

The ICE field office is a large two-story building located in a busy office park near the Burlington Mall. As the agency's New England regional headquarters, it's primarily a place where immigrants go for regular check-ins with officials. But it also serves as an intake center, where people get booked in after an ICE arrest.

Former detainees and immigration lawyers have described conditions inside the field office as ""abysmal"" and ""inhumane."" People were crowded into windowless rooms where, if they even had room to lie down, they had to sleep on cement floors. There was little privacy and no access to showers. And food rations were meager.

ICE has insisted that it provides adequate food and medical care to detainees.

Around 10:30 am Friday, the three activists knocked on the glass door of the building and asked to go inside to deliver the food.

A man wearing a navy jacket with the words ""Police E-R-O"" on the back — which stands for Enforcement and Removal Operations, a division of ICE — told them no visitors are permitted inside the building and they weren't accepting deliveries.

What then unfolded was a tense back-and-forth between the activists and a few federal agents. Officials tried to get the three to leave the front entryway, but they refused. They sat on the far edge of the stairway entrance, where they said they weren't obstructing people from access to the building.

During the 90-minute standoff, several people entered and exited the building. At one point, a man in plain clothes stuck his head out of the front door and told the activists, onlookers and the media to ""go f*ck off.""

A little while later, several Burlington police officers arrived. They also tried to convince the protesters to leave, but the trio sat tight. About 45 minutes later, the officers handcuffed and arrested them.

The trio were charged with one count of trespassing. They were arraigned in Woburn District Court and released on the condition they stay away from the Burlington office. They have a pre-trial hearing scheduled for October.

""We notified them that they were to move, to remove themselves from the operational area of the main doors, and they refused to do that,"" said Captain Hanafin, a Burlington Police Department officer who responded to the scene. ""It's disruptive, and it's frankly a security issue to have people there in protest when there's operational things that happen.""

Demonstrators say agents allegedly detained Willian Gimenez on Friday as he was entering a Little Village barbershop near Cermak and Washtenaw with his wife.

His attorney describes him as kind, hardworking and someone seeking asylum in the United States.

""My client's detention and my inability to speak with him and to assure his well-being is intact is not a mistake. He is exactly who the administration fears and targets,"" said Kevin Herrera, Gimenez's attorney.

Gimenez's advocates say the Department of Homeland Security has not notified them where exactly he was taken.

They say when they tried to find him at the Broadview processing facility, but immigration officials would not open the door.

""The community assembled here knows that people hold the powerful to account. We will fight for Willian and see to it that he is free to be with us in Chicago,"" Herrera said.

Advocates say Gimenez's arrest was not an accident, noting that he is reportedly outspoken against targeted arrests on day laborers allegedly carried out by Home Depot and off-duty Chicago police officers working as private security.

""This is a chilling step and a political obsession to round up as many immigrants as they can, mostly hardworking, law-abiding people,"" said Rep. Chuy Garcia.

Gimenez's supporters, who say he is a day laborer himself, said he was denied due process, calling his alleged detainment an abuse of power and an act of retaliation.

""The Department of Homeland Security has become the department of state terror. The department that is responsible for protecting the people from foreign terror has become the department of state terror,"" said Rep. Delia Ramirez.

ABC7 reached out to DHS regarding the allegations made by Gimenez' advocates but did not immediately hear back.

Gimenez's attorneys say they plan to file a petition calling for justice in his case in the coming days.

Saturday's press conference came after protesters gathered outside that ICE detention center on Friday, with video showing what appears to be pepper balls being used against some of the demonstrators that evening. Video also shows at least one demonstrator being dragged away.

Demonstrations were also seen in other northwest suburbs on Friday night after an ICE agent allegedly shot a man to death in Franklin Park earlier in the day.

Federal agents say they were trying to make a traffic stop when Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, a man DHS says was undocumented with a criminal history of reckless driving, allegedly drove at the officer, dragging him in the process.

That's when, officials say, the officer fired shots, striking Villegas-Gonzalez, who later died at the hospital.

Cellphone video obtained by ABC7 shows the moment ICE officers removed the man from his crashed car near Grand and Elder Lane. ABC7 froze the video since it is too graphic to show.

DHS said in a statement, in part, ""We are praying for the speedy recovery of our law enforcement officer. He followed his training, used appropriate force, and properly enforced the law to protect the public and law enforcement.""

Villegas-Gonzalez' girlfriend and stepdaughter, who asked ABC7 not to show their faces, say he was a working 38-year-old father of three from Mexico who has lived in the United States for more than 20 years.

U.S. District Judge Edward Chen ordered Trump’s Republican administration to change its U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website after plaintiffs’ lawyers said temporary protected status holders were still in detention centers or unable to return to work even after his Sept. 5 judgment in favor of plaintiffs. Chen said on Thursday his Sept. 5 order in favor of TPS holders went into effect immediately.

That ruling found Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had unlawfully canceled temporary protected status, or TPS, extensions granted by President Joe Biden’s Democratic administration for 1.1 million Venezuelans and Haitians.

TPS is a designation that can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary to people in the United States if their homelands are deemed unsafe for return due to a natural disaster, political instability or other dangerous conditions.

William Weiland, an attorney with the Department of Justice, said the judge had not ordered the government to update its website. Weiland also argued in court documents that the Sept. 5 judgment did not take effect immediately unless specifically ordered.

Chen said in his Thursday order that the rule cited by the government did not apply to these types of cases. The previous day, he denied the government’s request to stay his judgment while it appeals.

Lawyers for plaintiffs say people with temporary protected status are at risk of losing their jobs and more. They submitted a court declaration stating that a San Antonio man detained in May was told he will not be released until the website is updated.

Another declaration is from a TPS holder who has worked in an Amazon warehouse for three years. The person was told by human resources that a copy of the Sept. 5 court order and letter from an immigration attorney was not enough to authorize employment.

A federal judge ruled on Friday ICE agents can continue making courthouse arrests in New York City, shutting down a challenge brought by the ACLU and immigrant rights groups.

District Judge P. Kevin Castel, a George W. Bush appointee, found there was not enough evidence to suggest that ICE's courthouse arrest policy changes were ""unexplained, arbitrary and capricious"" after 2021 guidance allowed arrests at or near immigration courts.

Noting the 2025 guidance is more ""expansive and permissive,"" Castel acknowledged ICE made the changes because local correctional facilities and prisons, which are considered ""safe"" locations due to security screenings, are not available due to state and local policies regarding immigration detainers.

FEDERAL JUDGE REJECTS MILWAUKEE JUDGE'S IMMUNITY CLAIM IN ICE OBSTRUCTION CASE

However, the judge did block a Department of Justice policy encouraging immigration judges to dismiss cases so ICE could immediately arrest migrants.

The Trump administration in June launched an initiative to arrest illegal immigrants after asylum hearings.

The tactic stirred controversy, with critics claiming migrants seeking legal citizenship would be less likely to show up to hearings, and those who are arrested after hearings may not have additional criminal histories.

Videos of the arrests went viral on social media, with some going so far as accusing ICE of ""kidnapping"" migrants.

""In its fervor to expel as many immigrants as possible from the country, the Trump administration is targeting immigrants in the very place set up to adjudicate their status: immigration court,"" Diana Konaté, deputy executive director of Policy and Advocacy at African Communities Together, wrote in a statement published by the ACLU.

""Every day, our members are forced to choose between being kidnapped and/or put into expedited removal or risking deeper legal consequences because they're too scared to go to court.

""This is exactly what the administration intended — for people to be so fearful of enforcement that they forfeit the very resources and systems in place to protect them. We’re bringing this lawsuit on behalf of our members and fighting for justice.""

The new preliminary injunction — signed by the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island — blocks the Trump administration from implementing the changes indefinitely while litigation continues.
“With today’s decision, vital education, nutrition and health programs like Head Start — and the families who rely on their services — can breathe a sigh of relief,” said Attorney General Bonta.
“The Trump Administration continues to pull the rug out from under California families just trying to get by, but we’re fighting back.
We’re grateful that a district court has put a stop to this cruel new directive while our litigation continues.”","California has secured a court order temporarily blocking the Trump administration from barring immigrants living in the country illegally from accessing dozens of federally funded programs, including child care, health care and education services.

As part of the Trump administration’s proposed change, federally funded programs would be required to verify recipients’ immigration status — reversing a Clinton administration policy that extended “public benefit” programs to people living in the country without legal permission. The Trump administration said the change was necessary to ensure taxpayer-funded “public resources are no longer used to incentivize illegal immigration.”

The new court order comes a few months after California Attorney General Rob Bonta and 20 other state leaders sued the administration over the policy change in July.

In July, the California-led coalition secured a temporary pause preventing the administration from implementing the changes before Sept. 10. The new preliminary injunction — signed by the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island — blocks the Trump administration from implementing the changes indefinitely while litigation continues.

Programs included in the Trump administration’s restriction would include childcare services for low-income families, adult education, mental health and substance use disorder programs, temporary housing assistance, food banks, cooling centers and shelters for at-risk youth and domestic violence survivors, among others.

The proposed restriction would also include Head Start — a national program that serves more than 750,000 low-income children aged 0 to 5-years old across the U.S. The program provides free school meals and medical screenings, child care, and support and job assistance for parents.

Bonta and state leaders said that in addition to causing irreparable harm to vulnerable families, the proposed restrictions barring some immigrants from participation would have a “chilling effect” on all participants of the programs, regardless of immigration status. The states’ lawsuit also said the proposed verification requirements would cost states’ economies hundreds of millions of dollars.

“With today’s decision, vital education, nutrition and health programs like Head Start — and the families who rely on their services — can breathe a sigh of relief,” said Attorney General Bonta. “The Trump Administration continues to pull the rug out from under California families just trying to get by, but we’re fighting back.

Citizen and advocacy groups in New Jersey say they are frustrated by the Democratic legislature’s inaction to protect the state’s vulnerable populations.

Louise Walpin, co-leader of WADEIn New Jersey, said there has been a “blue trifecta of failure” because Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, Democratic State Senate President Nick Scutari and Democratic Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin have collectively failed to enact laws shielding the state’s immigrant, transgender and disabled communities from the “White House’s draconian policies.”

“It’s time to stand up like other states have, like California has, like Illinois has,” she said.

She said Garden State residents have been harmed by the ongoing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids, President Donald Trump’s directive to cancel gender affirming care for transgender federal employees and White House policies denying disabled people access to needed care.

The three stalled bills

The Immigrant Trust Act, first introduced one year ago, aspired to codify protections currently in place through the Immigrant Trust Directive, a set of rules that limits how much local and state law enforcement officials can cooperate with federal immigration officials. The directive may be revoked, depending upon who the next governor is.

After it was formally introduced, the Immigrant Trust Act was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Assembly Oversight, Reform and Federal Relations Committee, but hearings have not been scheduled in either house.

In June 2024, a bill was introduced to codify protections for necessary healthcare for transgender patients and their providers. It was referred to the Senate Health, Human Services and Senior Citizens Committee, and the Assembly Health Committee, but hearings have not been scheduled in either house.

Last October, legislation to help those with developmental disabilities was introduced in the Assembly. It was referred to the Aging and Human Services Committee, but no hearing has been scheduled, and the measure has not been assigned to a committee yet in the Senate.

Walpin said it’s disturbing that all of these bills have stalled in Trenton.

“Our legislature and our governor are not exercising the power that they do have to protect the most vulnerable among us,” she said. “We need to do this before the election because we do not know for sure whether we will still have a blue trifecta come the election.”

Spokespersons for Murphy and Coughlin declined to comment on pending legislation. Scutari’s office did not immediately respond.

A long and winding road

Ben Dworkin, director of the Rowan University Institute for Public Policy and Citizenship, said it’s not surprising that there has not been movement on these bills because the legislative process is frequently long and complicated.

“There’s some 10,000 bills that are introduced in the New Jersey Legislature each year, and first they have to go to a committee. If it spends money, it goes to an additional committee,” he said.

He said a variety of factors may be considered before a bill can move forward, and that can take weeks or months.

“The Senate president and the Assembly speaker, the two top ranking officials in each body, have the authority to either post or not post the bill,” Dworkin said.

He added that some measures must be considered by two committees, then the bill may have amendments and need to be revisited. Legislation that is passed in committee may also be frozen by the Senate president or Assembly speaker for strategic reasons.

If a bill makes it to the full Senate or the Assembly, it must pass by a majority vote, and the process must be repeated by the other house. He said different issues may be raised in one house that were not considered controversial in the other, and those must be ironed out.

After both the Senate and Assembly pass a measure, it’s sent to the governor for consideration. The governor may sign the measure into law or he can ignore it, or he may conditionally veto it and send it back to lawmakers for one or more changes in language or policy, which can take even more time.

A question of priorities?

Walpin rejects the notion that getting things done legislatively in New Jersey has to be a long, complicated process.

She said when legislators wanted to raise their own salaries from $49,000 to $82,000 last year, a bill was introduced and passed in two weeks.

“When it comes to passing bills that benefit minority citizens,” she said, “then all of a sudden there’s an outcry that these [bills] are controversial and they just can’t possibly pass it.”

Maura Collinsgru, the director of policy and advocacy for New Jersey Citizen Action, agreed that state leaders are not doing enough.

“You know we have people taking to the streets to protect their loved ones, who are being unfairly and inhumanely rounded up, discriminated against, and people are having their health benefits and more cut and taken from them,” she said. “We really need elected leaders to stand up with us and speak out, and engage more directly in the fight.”

Dworkin said the job of legislators is to respond to the voters, but there are different constituencies that have many different agendas.

“The New Jersey Legislature can move quickly when it absolutely has to, but other than that, no, they tend to go pretty slow,” Dworkin said. “While any number of different groups will be advocating on behalf of their worthy causes it doesn’t mean that the legislature will move.”

He said politicians usually want to make sure the public is behind the actions they take.

“They want to make sure they don’t get too far ahead, because that’s when you stop being in the majority,” he said.

Collinsgru commended New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin for initiating or joining 33 lawsuits against the Trump administration since Trump was sworn into office in January.",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/murphy-NJ-legislature-AP-110723.jpg,N,,2025-09-13 13:56:36.144657

The ruling by a three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is the latest twist in a legal fight over Biden-era policies that created new and expanded pathways for people to live in the United States, generally for two years with work authorization. The Trump administration announced in March it was ending the humanitarian parole protections.

""We recognize the risks of irreparable harm persuasively laid out in the district court's order: that parolees who lawfully arrived in this country were suddenly forced to choose between leaving in less than a month — a choice that potentially includes being separated from their families, communities, and lawful employment and returning to dangers in their home countries,"" the judges wrote. ""But absent a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits, the risk of such irreparable harms cannot, by itself, support a stay.""

In a two-page ruling, the court lifted a stay issued by a district court and is allowing the administration to end humanitarian parole for those groups while the lawsuit plays out. The ruling Friday is a victory for the Trump administration but doesn't change anything on the ground.

Esther Sung, the legal director of Justice Action Center, a co-counsel in the case, said the ruling ""hurts everyone.""

""People who came here from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela did everything the government asked of them, and the Trump administration cruelly and nonsensically failed to hold up the government's end of the bargain,"" Sung said. ""While we are deeply disappointed by this decision, we will continue to advocate zealously for our clients and class members as the litigation continues.""

A district court issued a stay in April halting the administration's decision, but the Supreme Court lifted the lower court order at the end of May with little explanation.

The Trump administration had argued the appeals court should follow the Supreme Court and reverse the district court ruling.

The protections for people fleeing turmoil in their home countries were always meant to be temporary, and the Department of Homeland Security has the power to revoke them without court interference, the Justice Department said in a court filing.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that ending parole on a case-by-case basis would be a ""gargantuan task"" that would slow the government's efforts to press for the removal of the migrants.

""The Secretary's discretionary rescission of a discretionary benefit should have been the end of the matter,"" lawyers for the government wrote in their brief.

Plaintiffs, including people who benefited from the legal protections, urged the appeals court to endorse the district court ruling, which found that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem could not categorically end protections for these groups, but instead had to evaluate each case individually. They also cited the district court's finding that Noem ignored the humanitarian concerns that led to the legal protections in the first place.

""The district court applied the law correctly and did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that Secretary Noem's action inflicted irreparable injury on the class members (among others) and that the public interest and balance of the equities tip sharply in favor of preliminary relief,"" attorneys for the plaintiffs wrote in a brief.

Republican President Donald Trump promised on the campaign trail to deport millions of people. Since taking office, he has sought to dismantle Biden administration policies that expanded paths for migrants to live legally in the U.S.

The Trump administration's decision was the first-ever mass revocation of humanitarian parole, attorneys for the migrants said in court papers, calling it ""the largest mass illegalization event in modern American history.""",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/haiti_migrants_AP_25014405482822_NAT_0913,N,,2025-09-13 11:00:33.431122

And the Biden administration used parole to welcome tens of thousands of Afghans and Ukrainians amid turmoil in their countries.","A federal appeals court said that President Trump likely has the power to revoke Biden-era “parole” programs that had granted illegal immigrants tentative permission to be in the U.S., rejecting a lower court decision that had tried to tie his hands.

The three-judge panel of the First U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals — all of them Democratic appointees — said the law does, in fact, give Mr. Trump the power to revoke parole programs root and branch.

The judges also said Homeland Security adequately explained why it was altering course from the Biden administration to revoke the programs early.

Circuit Judge Gustavo Gelpi, writing for the court, said they were cognizant of the potential impact on half a million Venezuelan, Cuban, Nicaraguan and Haitian migrants at issue in the case, but Mr. Trump appears to be following the law in ordering them to wrap up their time here and leave.

The judges’ decision Friday was a significant victory for Mr. Trump, blessing one of his more consequential immigration policy changes.

President Biden had used parole to allow millions of illegal immigrants who lacked visas or formal permission to enter the U.S. to do so anyway.

Previously, parole had usually been used on a case-by-case basis in instances where there was an urgent humanitarian interest or the government had a particular need to let someone in — such as to serve as a witness in a criminal case.

Mr. Biden created near-categorical programs that doled out passes at a rate of thousands a day, justifying it by saying they were going to come illegally anyway and this way they could be funneled into safer and more orderly pathways.

He also suggested some might claim asylum later.

When Mr. Trump took office, he had Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem end the parole programs and go back to only limited grants in specific cases.

District Judge Indira Talwani, an Obama appointee to the court in Massachusetts, said the new administration should have revoked each of the hundreds of thousands of paroles separately.

Judge Gelpi said that’s not the way the law reads.

“The district court held that the statutory text ‘contemplate[s] termination of parole on an individual, rather than categorical, basis.’ We read the statute differently,” Judge Gelpi wrote.

The specific parole program in the case — known by the acronym CHNV for the four nations involved — allowed the migrants to enter as long as they sought someone to promise to be a financial sponsor, and they agreed to fly into U.S. airports, bypassing the actual border.

Other Biden parole programs allowed migrants massed in northern Mexico to enter along the southern boundary as long as they pre-scheduled their arrivals. And the Biden administration used parole to welcome tens of thousands of Afghans and Ukrainians amid turmoil in their countries.

Immigrant rights groups were dismayed by the decision, saying it could undercut all of those programs.

The legislation, introduced as part of President Trump’s broader immigration crackdown, was among the first taken up after Congress returned from its August recess. While it passed, the margin was close, with dozens of lawmakers breaking from earlier support for mandatory detention bills and signaling growing resistance to the administration’s hardline agenda.

The measure would shift many immigration violations from the civil system into the federal criminal system, expanding penalties to levels normally reserved for violent crimes such as murder. Under its provisions, asylum seekers who attempt to re-enter the United States after being denied could face up to 10 years in prison, and individuals with prior convictions — even for minor offenses such as shoplifting — could face life sentences.

Critics argue that the bill represents one of the most extreme expansions of federal sentencing in modern history, effectively transforming the immigration system into another driver of mass incarceration. Supporters contend it strengthens border security and creates stronger deterrents against repeated illegal entry.

Mike Zamore, National Director of Policy and Government Affairs at the American Civil Liberties Union, condemned the legislation. “H.R. 3486 would supercharge President Trump’s reckless deportation drive, which is already damaging our economy and destabilizing communities,” Zamore said. “This legislation would hand the Trump administration more tools to criminalize immigrants and terrorize communities at the same time they are deploying federal agents and the military to our streets. It would also undermine public safety by diverting more resources away from youth services and prevention programs that actually improve community safety.”

Zamore added that the narrow margin in the House offered some encouragement. “While the House narrowly passed this bill, we thank the Members of Congress who held the line and voted against this harmful legislation. At a time when a president is threatening American cities and the Supreme Court is greenlighting racial profiling, it is vital that a growing number of elected officials are standing together in rejecting Stephen Miller’s dystopian agenda to criminalize and demonize people who come to this country seeking a better life.”

Immigrant rights organizations echoed the alarm. Advocates for Human Rights called the bill “costly, dangerous, and a violation of foundational human rights principles,” warning that it would criminalize asylum seekers fleeing violence and persecution, force trafficking survivors into prolonged detention, and separate families for decades or even life over immigration status.

The group said the legislation would undermine public safety by driving immigrant communities further into the shadows. Victims and witnesses of crimes, they said, would be less likely to report to police, while law enforcement would be forced to divert resources away from serious investigations to pursue immigration violations. They warned that building new prisons to accommodate the bill’s mandates would cost billions, further fueling what is already the highest incarceration rate in the world.

The American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) also urged a “no” vote, describing the bill as “extreme” and “disproportionate.” In its analysis, AILA said the legislation would equate nonviolent immigration violations with crimes such as murder, resulting in incarceration “for long periods of a decade or even life” for people who have no history of violent offenses.

AILA noted that illegal entry and reentry prosecutions are already among the most common federal charges, with more than 40,000 people prosecuted in the first nine months of 2025. Imposing longer sentences, the group said, would massively expand the federal prison population without improving border security. It pointed to earlier estimates from the U.S. Sentencing Commission that similar proposals, such as “Kate’s Law,” could have increased the federal prison population by nearly 60,000 within five years.

The group also questioned the deterrent effect of such penalties, citing a 2015 Department of Homeland Security report that concluded Customs and Border Protection (CBP) could not demonstrate that its “Operation Streamline” program — which rapidly prosecuted unlawful border crossers — was effective in preventing future entries.

AILA warned that the legislation would have far-reaching consequences. Under the bill, the penalty for unlawful reentry after deportation would increase from two years to 10 years. Anyone committing a nonviolent felony or even a minor offense such as shoplifting after reentering could face a mandatory 10-year sentence and possible life imprisonment. Someone denied asylum three times at the border who attempted to return a fourth time could also face up to 10 years in prison.

Advocates argue that rather than expanding criminal penalties, Congress should pursue comprehensive immigration reform that provides legal pathways, invests in immigration courts to reduce backlogs, and focuses enforcement on genuine threats to public safety such as drug and weapons smuggling.

“HR 3486 represents what’s wrong with our current approach to immigration: exceedingly harsh, expensive, and ineffective,” Advocates for Human Rights said in a statement. The organization urged lawmakers to vote no and instead “support comprehensive immigration reform that actually addresses our challenges.”

For immigrants, the stakes are high. Survivors of torture and trafficking could be imprisoned for acts they were forced to commit. Families could be torn apart for decades. And asylum seekers fleeing life-threatening violence could face prosecution simply for attempting to find safety.

Opponents see the bill as a dangerous fusion of mass incarceration and anti-immigrant politics. They say it threatens not only immigrant communities but also broader principles of due process and human rights.

Despite strong opposition, the legislation now moves to the Senate, where its prospects are uncertain. Immigration hardliners have pledged to push the measure through, while advocates are mobilizing to stop what they describe as one of the most extreme immigration laws in U.S. history.

PROVIDENCE, R.I. — Two housing advocacy groups have filed a sweeping federal lawsuit accusing the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development of unlawfully hijacking $75 million in permanent supportive housing funds to advance the Trump administration’s social agenda.

The National Alliance to End Homelessness, a Washington-based nonprofit, and the Women’s Development Corporation of Rhode Island filed the 33-page complaint on Sept. 11 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. They are seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to stop HUD from carrying out what they describe as an unlawful and rushed award process.

The lawsuit argues that HUD was prepared to award the funds to qualified projects, having already reviewed applications and even notified members of Congress about which projects were selected. Days before the money was set to expire, however, HUD issued a new notice of funding opportunity with dramatically different criteria. The complaint says the change came with only a one-week application deadline and imposed “an ideological threshold” on applicants.

According to the filing, the new notice “disqualifies from consideration any entity seeking to build housing in a jurisdiction with policies the Administration disfavors.” That includes states and cities that have not adopted Trump administration positions on homelessness, immigration enforcement, and drug policy. The lawsuit alleges that the agency has gone even further by requiring applicants to renounce harm reduction practices such as safe consumption sites, and to affirm the administration’s stance that “sex is binary and immutable.”

The complaint said, “HUD does not have authority to do this—and the Constitutional does not permit it. In our constitutional system, Congress controls the purse strings and decides what funding to provide, for what purposes, and under what criteria. And states and localities decide what policies to adopt and implement in their own local jurisdictions. HUD has transgressed both these bounds.”

The plaintiffs said HUD’s new rules not only intrude on state and local powers but also violate federal statutes, the Administrative Procedure Act, the Spending Clause, the Tenth Amendment, and the First Amendment. The lawsuit contends the new requirements amount to “coercing” states and localities to abandon their own policies in order to secure federal funds.

The groups point to a series of executive orders issued earlier this year by President Trump, which directed agencies to withhold or condition funding from jurisdictions deemed uncooperative on immigration enforcement or insufficiently punitive toward people experiencing homelessness. HUD’s new criteria, the complaint argues, are a direct extension of those orders.

The filing details how the administration’s approach frames homelessness as a criminal issue rather than a social challenge, penalizes jurisdictions with sanctuary policies, and cuts off funding for organizations that provide gender-affirming services or harm reduction programs. The lawsuit alleges these conditions are unrelated to the purpose of the funding Congress appropriated and instead serve to enforce the administration’s political ideology.

The National Alliance to End Homelessness, which represents a broad coalition of providers, government entities, and advocates, said many of its members have been rendered ineligible either because of where they operate or because they refuse to abandon inclusive policies. The Women’s Development Corporation, a nonprofit that develops affordable housing in Rhode Island, was specifically identified. HUD had notified Congress earlier this year that WDC was selected for an award under a prior notice of funding opportunity, but under the September 5 notice, the group is now excluded because Rhode Island is listed among jurisdictions deemed noncompliant on immigration and sex offender registry enforcement.

The complaint describes the timeline as unworkable. Applications were due September 12, just one week after the notice was published, and HUD intends to distribute the funds to the first eight applicants who pass its new “threshold” and “merit” criteria. Plaintiffs argue that such a process leaves virtually no opportunity to redesign projects, secure local approvals, or line up funding partners, especially since the new criteria also narrow eligibility to projects focused on medical respite for elderly and disabled individuals.

The groups also argue that the new “sex binary” requirement directly conflicts with federal civil rights law, including the Fair Housing Act and Title VII, as well as HUD’s own regulations that guarantee access to housing and services based on gender identity. They say HUD’s conditions unlawfully target applicants based on viewpoint and suppress speech outside the scope of federally funded programs.

The plaintiffs warn that unless the court intervenes, they and their members will be irreparably harmed because the funds will be obligated to others by September 15, effectively shutting them out of competition. They are asking the court to block HUD from enforcing the new criteria, preserve the $75 million beyond its expiration date, and allow the funds to be awarded under lawful conditions.

The complaint notes the broader stakes, arguing that the administration is leveraging homelessness funding to reshape local policy nationwide. It says the criteria amount to a blacklist of jurisdictions — including California, New York, Rhode Island, and dozens of other states — and a loyalty test for nonprofits that operate programs serving unhoused people.

The case is being led by attorneys from Democracy Forward Foundation, the National Homelessness Law Center, the ACLU of Rhode Island, and cooperating local counsel. They contend the new HUD process is “shockingly unlawful” and must be halted before it causes further harm to providers and the communities they serve.

Except it never happened. There was no ruling that the foreign offender should be allowed to stay in Britain because his child was a picky eater. An immigration tribunal did initially decide that it would be “unduly harsh” for the boy to be sent to Albania because of his special educational needs, but this judgment was later overturned. A more senior judge rejected the man’s appeal and made absolutely clear that an aversion to chicken nuggets should never be enough to prevent deportation.

‘Withdrawing from the ECHR would have little bearing on stopping asylum seekers from coming’

Prof Francesca Klug

This was not an isolated case. There was the Iranian criminal “spared deportation so he can cut his son’s hair”, the mass murderer who claimed that having access to hardcore porn was his human right and the Afghan migrant who could not be extradited to Belgium “because of mosquitoes” in the prison.

The political debate around human rights law is shot through with myths and misinformation, going back to former prime minister Theresa May’s suggestion in 2011 that an ­illegal immigrant could not be deported because “he had a pet cat”. In fact, the critical factor was his long-term partner.

The ECHR is held up by politicians on the left and the right as the block on everything from tackling the small boats crisis to deporting foreign criminals. But a recent report by the University of Oxford’s Bonavero Institute found that only 0.73% of foreign national offenders had successfully appealed against deportation on human rights grounds.

The number of successful appeals based on human rights is tiny as a proportion of the number of foreign criminals who are deported from the UK each year – around 3.5%, and just 2.5% when looking at appeals on private and family life grounds. The ECHR in Strasbourg, which interprets the convention, has ruled against the UK only three times in the past 45 years in cases relating to immigration rules.

The ECHR, drafted in the aftermath of the second world war mainly by British lawyers and signed in 1950, protects fundamental rights including freedom from torture, free speech, liberty and family life. The Human Rights Act, which embeds the ECHR in UK law, has helped secure justice for the families of those killed in the Hillsborough disaster and uphold the rights of disabled people and care home residents during the pandemic.

Keir Starmer, pictured at his graduation, long considered the ECHR his ‘lode star’, says his biographer

Now, however, the convention has become a defining dividing line at Westminster – a test of ideological purity on the right and a way of demonstrating radicalism on the left. For Eurosceptics, withdrawing from a treaty overseen by a Strasbourg court is unfinished business after Brexit. For Labour MPs with “red wall” constituencies in the north of England and the Midlands, hostility to the ECHR is a way of signalling intent to deal with illegal immigration.

The issue is set to dominate the party political conference season – which kicks off this week with the Liberal Democrats gathering in Bournemouth – as Labour and the Conservatives attempt to see off the threat from Reform UK. Farage has promised that if he becomes prime minister, the “first thing” he will do is “get rid of the ECHR”. Last week Richard Tice, Reform’s deputy leader, pledged to set up an immigration “department of believers” staffed by civil servants who favour severing links with the convention.

Senior Tories expect Badenoch, the Conservative leader, to use her conference speech to announce her support for withdrawal as part of a broader package of reform. Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, has long advocated leaving, insisting last year that his party would “die” unless it promised to pull out.

The shadow attorney general David Wolfson, who has been conducting a review of the impact of the ECHR, has produced more than 200 pages of closely argued legal analysis, including around 500 footnotes, which will set out the problems created by the convention and other international treaties. The conclusion is understood to be that leaving the ECHR is “necessary but not sufficient” for the UK to take back control of its borders. “It’s certainly legally possible, and it will make a difference, but it’s not a silver bullet on its own,” one senior Tory says.

The government is close to ann­ouncing its own reforms. Shabana Mahmood, the new home secretary, is planning a “twin track” approach and intends to move fast, according to an ally. She will introduce legislation within weeks to clarify the interpretation of the ECHR in British courts, particularly the “right to private and family life” protections covered by article 8 of the convention. Over time, she is determined to work with other countries that also want to see wider changes to the ECHR and the way in which it is applied.

Richard Hermer, the attorney general, has become convinced that the government needs to act to deal with growing public concern over human rights laws. He told the Lords constitution committee last week that “nothing sensible or practical or effective will be off the table” to deal with the small boats crossing the Channel.

“There’s definitely scope for reform,” one source close to the government’s main legal adviser says. “His view would be that a lot of the challenges we are facing are about how our domestic courts apply the law, and clarificatory legislation could help... But there is also a longer-term agenda here, as we know mass migration is going to continue, which we should be open to exploring.”

Alex Chalk, the former Conservative lord chancellor, says that when he was in government he detected a “palpable enthusiasm” for change among other countries, including the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany. “There’s no reason why the UK can’t be really quite forward leaning on this and say: ‘This is what we think should happen.’ I know from being in Strasbourg that we have enormous influence there.

“The fallacy is to assume that this is all about the ECHR and you don’t need to worry about the broader context. The truth is the refugee convention needs updating, the international covenant on civil and political rights needs updating, and several other pieces of international law besides. Although there is currently a fashionable fixation on one piece of international law, it would be a great mistake to assume that’s where all the problems reside. Urgent and wholesale reform is required – but it’s got to be coherent and wide-ranging.”

Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice wants to set up an immigration civil servant ‘department of believers’

Professor Francesca Klug, a human rights expert, says: “Withdrawing from the ECHR is like a sacrifice to the gods. It would have little bearing on stopping asylum seekers from coming over on small boats, but it would severely reduce cooperation with other European states.”

There are also practical difficulties. The ECHR is embedded in the Good Friday agreement, which underpins peace in Northern Ireland. Akiko Hart, the director of Liberty, argues that the ECHR has become a “useful political scapegoat”, with rival parties offering “disingenuous solutions”.

David Blunkett, the former Labour home secretary, has called for elements of the convention to be suspended temporarily, while Jack Straw, the former foreign secretary, has suggested that the Human Rights Act could be amended to state that British courts do not have to take account of the ECHR.

But Charlie Falconer, the former Labour lord chancellor, says the idea of suspending or withdrawing from the ECHR is “very dangerous” because it makes human rights conditional rather than fundamental.

“The political pressure now is to abandon rights for immigrants, but if the government feels they can do that for asylum seekers then there is essentially no limitation on what the government may do in other areas where there is political pressure. The ECHR is the guarantor.”

Charles Clarke, the former Labour home secretary, believes it would be “madness” to break with the ECHR. “I think this is an entirely false debate. I don’t believe that if we withdraw from the ECHR it would change a thing in the sense that the rights which the ECHR gives to people are broadly speaking the same rights that existed under British law before the Human Rights Act.”

For prime minister Keir Starmer, a human rights lawyer, this is personal. His biographer Tom Baldwin says he “often described the ECHR and the conception of human dignity defined within it as his ‘lode star’ that had guided him through every major decision in his life”.

The PM’s maiden speech as an MP was about how the ECHR can help people with issues such as housing, and he used his first foreign summit at Blenheim – the birthplace of Winston Churchill, who had been instrumental in drawing up the document – to reaffirm his own and the UK’s commitment to the ECHR.

“Both in public and in private since, Starmer has said he has no intention of joining Russia and Belarus as the only countries on the European continent who are not signatories to it,” Baldwin says.

“Those in the Labour party now suggesting that the prime minister should leave the ECHR either have no knowledge of who their prime minister is or perhaps just don’t care.”",https://cdn.observer.co.uk/media/original_images/52966.jpeg,N,,2025-09-13 08:57:40.680285

By Reuters

A federal appeals court rejected on September 12 a challenge by immigrant rights advocates to the decision by US President Donald Trump's administration to revoke the temporary legal status of hundreds of thousands of Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans living in the United States.

The Boston-based 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a ruling by US District Judge Indira Talwani, who had decided that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem lacked the discretion to end the immigration ""parole"" granted to about 430,000 migrants under Democratic former President Joe Biden.

The US Supreme Court in May put Talwani's April ruling on hold, allowing the parole terminations to take effect while the litigation played out.

Judge Gustavo Gelpí, writing for a three-judge 1st Circuit panel, said Noem's action forced parolees who entered the United States lawfully to have to choose suddenly between returning to the dangers in their home countries or staying in the United States and risk being detained and deported.

But Gelpí said lawyers for a class of migrants pursuing the case had failed to make a strong showing that Noem lacked authority under a law called the Immigration and Nationality Act to categorically end their parole. All three judges on the panel were appointed by Democratic presidents.

The Biden administration, starting in 2022, let Venezuelans who entered the United States by air request a two-year parole if they passed security checks and had a US financial sponsor. His administration in 2023 expanded that to Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans.

Between October 2022 and January 2025, about 532,000 people received grants of parole through those programs. But in March, Noem moved to terminate the parole programs, affecting about 430,000 migrants.

Esther Sung, a lawyer for the plaintiffs at the immigrant rights group Justice Action Center, called Friday's ruling ""devastating"" but narrow, adding that ""there's still room for us to prevail as the litigation continues and moves to final judgment.""

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Justice Department, in asking the 1st Circuit to overturn Talwani's decision, pointed to the Supreme Court's action staying her ruling and urged the appeals court to ""reject the plaintiffs' brazen request to defy the Supreme Court.""

The Board of Immigration Appeals published the decision, which applies nationwide, on Friday, Sept. 5.
Gabriel Harrison, lawyer for the detained resident, said the ruling was a major departure from decades of precedent.
The recent immigration board decision upheld the administration’s stance.
In the nationwide lawsuit, the Northwest Immigrants Rights Project is suing with lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union.","Immigrants in the United States “without admission” cannot be granted bond by a judge, a federal immigration board ruled in the case of a Whatcom County resident, currently detained.

That means up to millions of people will have to wait in detention for potentially prolonged periods as they face deportation proceedings. The Board of Immigration Appeals published the decision, which applies nationwide, on Friday, Sept. 5.

Gabriel Harrison, lawyer for the detained resident, said the ruling was a major departure from decades of precedent.

Previously, he said, those who had entered without authorization but “established a life” for themselves in the U.S. could get released on bond based on whether a judge thought they were “a flight risk or a danger to society.”

Aaron Korthuis, attorney at the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, agreed. Until recently, the law was long interpreted to allow people who entered the U.S. without inspection and weren’t initially apprehended to have bond hearings, he said.

Immigration judges must comply with the appellate board’s ruling unless it is overturned by the Attorney General or a federal court.

In an email, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin wrote the decision was a “[b]ig win for our [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] attorneys securing our ability to detain illegal aliens until they are deported.”

She added, “The One Big Beautiful Bill includes significant funding for new ICE lawyers.”

The Trump Administration announced in July that immigrants who entered the country without authorization would have to wait in detention for their deportation case to be resolved. The recent immigration board decision upheld the administration’s stance.

Korthuis noted that because so few people are currently entering the U.S., those impacted by the policy are often those who have lived in the country for years — even decades.

“They have U.S. citizen children, maybe even U.S. citizen spouses or family members, and have worked for years or decades in our agriculture or construction industries,” he said, “and simply are people whose home and identity is here in the United States.”

He added that judges in Tacoma Immigration Court have interpreted the law this way for the past couple years, “out of sync with literally the rest of the country.”

Korthuis and other attorneys at the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project have two pending class action lawsuits filed earlier this year, challenging the policy on behalf of those detained in Washington and on behalf of those who entered the U.S. without inspection nationwide.

In the nationwide lawsuit, the Northwest Immigrants Rights Project is suing with lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union. Suing the government in federal court is “the only means for relief for people at this point,” Korthuis said.

The Tacoma Immigration Court’s website directs media inquiries to the Executive Office for Immigration Review, an agency of the federal Department of Justice.

In an email, Executive Office for Immigration Review spokesperson Kathryn Mattingly wrote, “Immigration judges adjudicate all matters before them on a case-by-case basis.”

“Immigration judges consider all evidence and arguments presented by both parties and decide each case in a manner that is timely, impartial, and consistent with applicable law, regulations, and case precedent, and consistent with due process,” she continued.

She declined to comment on the recent immigration board decision, writing that “the decision speaks for itself.”

Harrison said the immigration board’s ruling “will affect every single person that comes to us now” who entered without inspection and is detained. He expects many people to give up on their case instead of appealing if they lose initially, rather than wait in detention for potentially years.

Korthuis thinks so, too. Detention, he said, is likely the “single most effective means to force people to leave the country.”",https://www.cascadiadaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/01-Lelo-Vanderhoef-Tacoma-20250513-SO.jpg,N,,2025-09-13 04:56:23.668135

The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a ruling by U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani, who had decided that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem lacked the discretion to end the immigration “parole” granted to about 430,000 migrants under former Democratic President Joe Biden.

The U.S. Supreme Court in May 2025 put Talwani’s April ruling on hold, allowing the parole terminations to take effect while the litigation played out.

Judge Gustavo Gelpí, writing for a three-judge 1st Circuit panel, said Noem’s action forced parolees who entered the United States lawfully to have to choose suddenly between returning to the dangers in their home countries or staying in the United States and risking being detained and deported.

But Gelpí said lawyers for a class of migrants pursuing the case had failed to make a strong showing that Noem lacked authority under a law called the Immigration and Nationality Act to categorically end their parole. Democratic presidents appointed all three judges on the panel.

The Biden administration, starting in 2022, allowed Venezuelans who entered the United States by air to request two-year parole if they passed security checks and had a U.S. financial sponsor. His administration in 2023 expanded that to Cubans, Haitians, and Nicaraguans.

The ruling by a three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is the latest twist in a legal fight over Biden-era policies that created new and expanded pathways for people to live in the United States, generally for two years with work authorization. The Trump administration announced in March it was ending the humanitarian parole protections.

“We recognize the risks of irreparable harm persuasively laid out in the district court’s order: that parolees who lawfully arrived in this country were suddenly forced to choose between leaving in less than a month — a choice that potentially includes being separated from their families, communities, and lawful employment and returning to dangers in their home countries,” the judges wrote. “But absent a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits, the risk of such irreparable harms cannot, by itself, support a stay.”

In a two-page ruling, the court lifted a stay issued by a district court and is allowing the administration to end humanitarian parole for those groups while the lawsuit plays out. The ruling Friday is a victory for the Trump administration but doesn’t change anything on the ground.

Esther Sung, the legal director of Justice Action Center, a co-counsel in the case, said the ruling “hurts everyone.”

“People who came here from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela did everything the government asked of them, and the Trump administration cruelly and nonsensically failed to hold up the government’s end of the bargain,” Sung said. “While we are deeply disappointed by this decision, we will continue to advocate zealously for our clients and class members as the litigation continues.”

A district court issued a stay in April halting the administration’s decision, but the Supreme Court lifted the lower court order at the end of May with little explanation.

The Trump administration had argued the appeals court should follow the Supreme Court and reverse the district court ruling.

The protections for people fleeing turmoil in their home countries were always meant to be temporary, and the Department of Homeland Security has the power to revoke them without court interference, the Justice Department said in a court filing.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that ending parole on a case-by-case basis would be a “gargantuan task” that would slow the government’s efforts to press for the removal of the migrants.

“The Secretary’s discretionary rescission of a discretionary benefit should have been the end of the matter,” lawyers for the government wrote in their brief.

Plaintiffs, including people who benefited from the legal protections, urged the appeals court to endorse the district court ruling, which found that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem could not categorically end protections for these groups, but instead had to evaluate each case individually. They also cited the district court’s finding that Noem ignored the humanitarian concerns that led to the legal protections in the first place.

“The district court applied the law correctly and did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that Secretary Noem’s action inflicted irreparable injury on the class members (among others) and that the public interest and balance of the equities tip sharply in favor of preliminary relief,” attorneys for the plaintiffs wrote in a brief.

Republican President Donald Trump promised on the campaign trail to deport millions of people. Since taking office, he has sought to dismantle Biden administration policies that expanded paths for migrants to live legally in the U.S.

The Trump administration’s decision was the first-ever mass revocation of humanitarian parole, attorneys for the migrants said in court papers, calling it “the largest mass illegalization event in modern American history.”",https://www.wkbn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2025/09/68c4a33cab6d18.06367320.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-13 11:00:41.550330

In an interview on Friday evening, the lawyers said the case bore similarities to that of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man who was wrongfully deported to his home country of El Salvador earlier this year and who continues to fight a labyrinthine legal battle as the administration tries to deport him to various African countries. As in his case, the suit, filed in the Federal District Court in Washington, raised the question of whether the administration had defied judges’ orders protecting the migrants.

The Trump administration has brokered deals with several African nations, Rwanda, Uganda, Eswatini and — most recently — Ghana, to accept deported migrants, many of whom have no connection to those countries. Administration officials, under pressure from President Trump to carry out his promised mass deportation operation, have moved swiftly on these so-called third-country deportations.

Lawyers with Asian Americans Advancing Justice, representing the five migrants, accused the administration of using its agreement with Ghana to ignore the legal protections that prevent deportation to their home countries because they fear torture or persecution. In essence, they argued, the administration has enabled an “end run” around those prohibitions, by first removing them to Ghana, and then claiming it is powerless to stop Ghana from sending them to their home countries.

“Defendants have enlisted the government of Ghana to do their dirty work,” the lawyers said in their filing. “Despite the minimal, pass-through involvement of the Ghanaian government, defendants’ objective is clear: Deport individuals who have been granted fear-based relief from being sent to their countries of origin to those countries anyway, in contravention to the rulings of U.S. immigration judges and U.S. immigration law.”

One type of legal protection for those migrants includes a status called “withholding of removal,” the same protection that should have prevented Mr. Abrego Garcia’s deportation to El Salvador.

ET: This article has been updated to note the case was decided by an appeals court, not the Supreme Court.","An appeals court ruled on Friday that the Trump administration can begin deporting around 500,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

Newsweek reached out to the White House and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) via email on Friday evening for comment.

Why It Matters

DHS ordered half a million migrants to self-deport, issuing termination notices to nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who had entered the country under ""humanitarian parole"" programs that started under the administration of former President Joe Biden.

This marked the first mass revocation of humanitarian parole, according to the Associated Press (AP).

The initial effort affected over 500,000 migrants across the nation, and DHS advised that those who did not leave voluntarily ""may be subject to enforcement actions, including but not limited to detention and removal, without an opportunity to make personal arrangements and return to your country in an orderly manner.""

The Supreme Court in May issued a single-paragraph decision, unsigned, that granted a stay against an initial order issued by a judge that halted the deportations pending a decision in appeals court. Democrat-appointed Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.

What To Know

Today's two-page decision lifts a district judge's ruling that blocked the Trump administration from canceling the ""humanitarian parole"" programs.

The administration sought to continue its deportations while the legal question played out in courts, which the initial order blocked.

Following the Supreme Court's decision, the administration urged the appeals court to make a similar decision, writing in a brief that ""the Secretary's discretionary rescission of a discretionary benefit should have been the end of the matter.""

The three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston delivered a final decision Friday evening. Immigrants who entered the U.S. under the program will now lose their permits to work and are at immediate risk of deportation.

""We recognize the risks of irreparable harm persuasively laid out in the district court's order: that parolees who lawfully arrived in this country were suddenly forced to choose between leaving in less than a month — a choice that potentially includes being separated from their families, communities, and lawful employment and returning to dangers in their home countries,"" the judges wrote.

""But absent a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits, the risk of such irreparable harms cannot, by itself, support a stay,"" they added.

Lawyers for plaintiffs maintain the district court that issued the initial block ""applied the law correctly and did not abuse its discretion.""

We start today's other headlines outside Chicago.

The Department of Homeland Security says an ICE officer shot and killed a suspect who had tried to avoid arrest by driving his car into officers. Authorities say the incident took place in the Franklin Park suburb about 18 miles west of Chicago. One officer was hit by the vehicle, was taken to a hospital, and is now in stable condition.

DHS says the suspect was in the country illegally and had a history of reckless driving. The shooting comes amid a broader federal immigration crackdown in the Chicago area.

Meantime, President Trump says he's sending National Guard troops to Memphis to address crime there. On FOX News this morning, the president said the state's Republican governor and the city's Democratic mayor are, in his words, happy about the plan.

Later, at a news conference, Mayor Paul Young confirmed his commitment, but made clear he doesn't necessarily agree with the approach.

Paul Young, Mayor of Memphis, Tennessee: I did not ask for the National Guard, and I don't think it's the way to drive down crime. However, that decision has been made. My commitment is to make sure that we work strategically to ensure that this happens in a way that truly benefits and strengthens our community.

Geoff Bennett:

Other Tennessee officials are more critical. The mayor of Shelby County, which includes Memphis, criticized the move in a social media post, saying: ""No one here is happy, not happy at all with the occupation, armored vehicles, semiautomatic weapons, and military personnel in fatigues.""

This week, Memphis police reported a decrease across all major crime categories in the first eight months of 2025 compared to previous years.

Missouri's Senate passed a redistricting plan today that could help Republicans pick up an additional seat in Congress. Once signed by the governor, it would make Missouri the third state to change its maps ahead of next year's midterm elections. Texas has already passed a measure that would help Republicans pick up five seats. California countered with a similar plan to aid Democrats, though it still needs voter approval.

Opponents of Missouri's measure are trying to push back, though. They have launched a petition effort to try to force a statewide referendum on the new map.

The Environmental Protection Agency moved today to stop the collection of emissions data from some 8,000 U.S. facilities. The proposal, which still needs to be finalized, would end a program that requires coal-burning power plants and other industrial facilities to report their greenhouse gas emissions. Since 2010, the government has used this data to assess the environmental impact of those sites.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the requirement is — quote — ""nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality."" Critics say the proposal could hurt efforts to fight climate change.

Many of the nation's universities are on heightened alert heading into the weekend after a series of fake threats led schools to cancel classes and even send students home. At least six historically Black colleges and universities have been the targets of such threats in recent days. A similar incident happened at the University of Massachusetts, Boston.

At the U.S. Naval Academy in Maryland, a midshipman and law enforcement officer were injured after a false report of an active shooter caused confusion on that campus. Both are now in stable condition. The threats come amid heightened tensions following the murder of Charlie Kirk on a campus in Utah, though the FBI says there have been no credible threats so far.

The U.N. General Assembly says it's endorsing what it calls tangible and irreversible steps for a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians. Today's declaration was boycotted by the U.S. and Israel. It comes ahead of a gathering by world leaders at the U.N. later this month, where Britain, France, and others are expected to formally recognize a Palestinian state.

Ahead of that, Secretary of State Marco Rubio is heading to Israel next week to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to Israeli security. Meantime, in Gaza today, health officials say Israeli strikes killed at least 40 people, most of them in Gaza City. Residents say they are caught in the crossfire.

The latest Gaza strikes come amid ongoing anger among Arab nations over Israel's strike this week targeting Hamas leaders in Doha. Qatar's prime minister was in Washington today meeting with top U.S. officials to discuss the strike. He's also set to meet with President Trump in New York. Qatar will host an emergency summit of Arab leaders on Sunday.

Nepal has a new interim prime minister following that country's worst upheaval in years. Former Supreme Court Justice Sushila Karki took her oath on live television today. She's the first woman ever to head that nation's government. Karki takes the helm after violent protests over a short-lived social media ban forced her predecessor to resign. Protesters torched government buildings and clashed with police. Officials now say at least 51 people were killed.

Why It Matters

The Court currently has a 6-3 conservative majority and has ruled in favor of the Trump administration on many key issues including immigration enforcement and cuts at federal government agencies. Over a dozen emergency requests from the Trump administration have been granted by the Court this term.

The cases examine executive power, including the lawfulness and precedent governing removal of FTC commissioners, and whether a president may withhold congressionally appropriated foreign aid.

What To Know

In Trump v. Slaughter, the administration is requesting the Court to halt a ruling that reinstatesan FTC commissioner that Trump fired, Rebecca Slaughter.

Trump first sought to oust the Democratic commissioner in the spring. She sued, and lower courts ordered her reinstated, citing laws that restrict removal of FTC commissioners to cases involving misconduct or neglect of duty.

The Justice Department has maintained that the FTC and similar agencies fall squarely under presidential authority, allowing Trump to remove commissioners without cause. Slaughter, however, argues that her position is protected by law and by decades of legal precedent.

Earlier this month, Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily paused lower rulings and directed Slaughter's attorneys to file their response to the government's arguments by September 15.

The second case, Department of State v. AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, the administration is seeking to block billions of dollars in foreign aid. Since inauguration day, Trump has worked to pause foreign aid, issuing an executive order on the matter, which led Secretary of State Marco Rubio to freeze payments from the State Department and then now-dismantled U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).

A judge ordered the administration to spend $4 billion in foreign aid by September 30; however, Trump's legal team argues the president has the right to propose a rescission, a cancellation of previously approved funds.

Roberts ordered a response to the application be filed by 4 p.m. on Friday.

Amicus briefs have been filed for both cases. Representative Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, filed against the Trump administration in the latter case regarding foreign aid.

What People Are Saying

Representative Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, in an amicus brief filed in Trump v. Slaughter: ""Because the President's limited authority to temporarily withhold funds proposed for rescission under the ICA does not permit the President to withhold those funds through their date of expiration without action from Congress, the district court's injunction imposes no greater burden on the government than already exists under that law. The stakes for Congress and the public, however, are high. The fiscal year ends on September 30, less than three weeks from today.""

Justice Brett Kavanaugh at the 6th Circuit Judicial Conference last week: ""We all fall short at times, but I think redoubling our efforts on tone, especially when the tone around us is in the public sphere, in the political world, on all sides, is loud, it's probably important.""

Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democratic wrote on X in March: ""Donald Trump just illegally fired two independent commissioners at the FTC who fight big corporations that abuse consumers and workers. Why? Trump's billionaire donors expect a return on their investment. He works for them, not you. The courts must reinstate the commissioners.""

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said earlier in September regarding a Court case pertaining to mass federal firings, per Reuters: ""Yet another win for the Trump administration affirming the president's lawful actions and dismissing the unlawful ruling by a lower court judge.""

The city is “not aware of federal enforcement activity targeting the parade, a large and very public event,” but decided to cancel it at the request of First District Councilmember Mary Zendejas, city spokesperson Jen De Prez wrote in an email.

The decision comes after months of immigration raids across Southern California, during which several thousand people have been arrested or detained by federal agents.

Civil rights groups and activists allege many of the stops are indiscriminate or based on profiling, including raids at Long Beach car washes.

A federal judge and an appeals panel recently agreed, barring officials from conducting “roving patrols” that the court found were targeting people based solely on their perceived ethnicity, language, location or type of work they were performing, but last week, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling that sided with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, reversing the lower court and clearing the way for operations to resume.

Long Beach’s vibrant Día de los Muertos parade typically draws hundreds of visitors to downtown, with dozens of floats, folklórico ensembles and mariachi bands traveling along Pine Avenue to celebrate Day of the Dead, a Mexican tradition that involves people paying respects to their deceased friends and family members.

This year’s parade would have marked the 10th in Long Beach. The Arte y Ofrendas Festival at Rainbow Lagoon Park, a two-day, separate ticketed event organized by an outside vendor, will also not take place this year.

Roberto Carlos Lemus, the marketer for last year’s festival and cofounder of Latino Restaurant Week in Long Beach, said the decision to cancel was “unfortunate.”

But, he said, “I get why they’re doing it.”

While organizing next week’s kick-off event for Latino Restaurant Week, Carlos Lemus said he had to take extra precautions himself.

He ultimately decided to hold it at a private venue “because it’s easier to control who comes in and who goes out,” Carlos Lemus said.

At its meeting on Tuesday, the Long Beach City Council approved a motion from Mayor Rex Richardson to push the funding for this year’s parade to next year, making $100,000 available for the 2026 event.

At the same meeting, the City Council approved a $1.85 million budget for the Long Beach Justice Fund, which provides legal representation to residents facing immigration cases.

“The city deeply values the vibrant cultural diversity of its community and is looking forward to continuing our Día de los Muertos Parade next year,” De Prez wrote.

BOSTON — The First Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the Trump administration today in Svitlana Doe v. Noem, ruling that the administration’s termination of humanitarian parole was lawful. This ruling impacts the lawful parole status and work authorization for half a million “CHNV” humanitarian parole recipients from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. This is the first ruling in Svitlana since the Supreme Court granted the Trump Administration’s extraordinary request on May 30 to reverse the district court’s order blocking the termination — even before the First Circuit heard the case on appeal in July.

This decision is specifically about CHNV humanitarian parole, but it has significant implications for the other humanitarian parole programs at issue in the Svitlana litigation, such as Uniting for Ukraine and Operation Allies Welcome — jeopardizing the lawful status of hundreds of thousands more currently living and working in the U.S.

The lawsuit was filed by 18 welcomers, newcomers, and service members, in addition to organizational plaintiff Haitian Bridge Alliance. They are represented by Justice Action Center and Human Rights First.

“The Trump administration is fighting tooth and nail to delegalize as many people as possible, actively creating a larger class of people who are subject to deportation — made up even of those who followed the exact processes the U.S. government required of them,” said Karen Tumlin, Founder and Director of Justice Action Center. “Today’s ruling is an urgent and grave threat to all of us who believe in due process and equal protection under the law, and it has immediate consequences for hundreds of thousands humanitarian parole beneficiaries, their U.S. sponsors, and the communities throughout the country who have benefited greatly from their contributions. Our fight cannot — and will not — end here. We have already returned to the district court to seek a final ruling in this case finding this premature termination unlawful.”

“This has never actually been about ‘legal’ or ‘illegal’ immigrants, rather it’s about stripping the lawful rights from as many vulnerable communities as possible in order to advance a cruel and lawless agenda. Let us not forget that we are talking about people who have done everything the U.S. government has asked of them, yet continue to be targeted by the calculated cruelty of the Trump administration,” said Guerline Jozef, Executive Director and Founder of organizational plaintiff Haitian Bridge Alliance. “To our brothers and sisters in the CHNV program: we see you, we are with you, and we will continue to stand by you as we fight for justice.”

“This ruling is a devastating blow to hundreds of thousands of lawful immigrants and their U.S.-based sponsors who welcomed them into their homes and communities, but this is not the end of our legal fight,” said Anwen Hughes, Legal Director of Human Rights First. “We remain firm in our belief that the Trump administration is needlessly and flagrantly flouting U.S. law, and we won’t let this setback keep us from fighting in the courts to pursue justice for our communities.”

For more than 70 years, Republican and Democratic administrations alike have established parole processes to advance important American interests, including promoting family unification, advancing urgent humanitarian interests, and enhancing migration management.

Rep. Mike Thompson, whose district surrounds the base on three sides, said he was relieved to get a letter last month from the Department of Defense confirming the proposal has been taken off the table, following strenuous opposition.

“I’m pleased, as is Travis, that they decided not to move forward with the detention center on the base. Nobody wanted it,” the North Bay Democrat said. “The base was against it, the community was against it, two members of Congress from there were against it.”

The push to build a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center on the air base came to light in April through internal federal emails obtained by KQED. The emails showed significant coordination among Department of Defense and Homeland Security officials to expedite the plans and tee them up for approval by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

The plan came as a shock to Thompson and Rep. John Garamendi, another Democrat whose district includes the base. They expressed outrage that the Trump administration had not informed them of the plan and concern that using military resources for civilian law enforcement could violate the Posse Comitatus Act and divert from missions such as supplying weapons to Ukraine and allies in the Pacific.

On May 5, the pair fired off a letter to Hegseth saying: “The decision to use Travis AFB as a migrant detention center would both constitute a dangerous militarization of immigration enforcement and unnecessarily degrade military readiness.”

For weeks, opposition mounted, with protests outside the base, constituents calling the congressmen and many local elected officials speaking out, including the mayor of Fairfield.

At a May 29 meeting of the Travis Community Consortium, Travis’ commanding officer, then-Col. Jay Johnson, reported that there had been talks about establishing an ICE facility on the base, but he said that plan had been taken off the table, at least for the time being, according to Garamendi staff who attended the meeting.

Finally, on Aug. 6, the congressmen received an official reply from Assistant Secretary of Defense M. Roosevelt Ditlevson that read, in part: “While DoD remains committed to supporting the Department of Homeland Security within the framework of applicable legal authorities and through approved requests for assistance, Travis AFB will not be designated for migrant detention-related activities at this time.”

Garamendi and Thompson spoke about the shift in plans to KQED this week.

“The argument that Mike Thompson and I made carried the day. Travis is a critical element in our national security,” Garamendi said. “The role that Travis has as an international distribution center for military supplies, equipment, and personnel is critical to everything the military must do. And a detention facility would degrade that mission.”

Garamendi and Thompson called it a win but said they would remain vigilant, as defense officials have approved immigration jails on military bases in other states, including New Jersey and Indiana and a 5,000-bed installation at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas.

“With this administration, you don’t really have a clear understanding of what is going to change from one moment to the next,” Thompson said. “So we’re watching it. We’re in constant communication with the base personnel.”

Situating ICE jails on military bases can facilitate the swift removal of immigrants from the country. Although most deportation flights are conducted with ICE Air charter planes, the administration has also conducted at least 85 removal flights on military cargo planes, a new report from Human Rights First found.

Over the last year in California, ICE has held an average of roughly 3,600 people a day across six facilities, all of them private prison operations in Southern California.

ICE officials have been seeking a detention center in Northern California, which has a major ICE field office and three immigration courts — in San Francisco, Concord and Sacramento.

BOSTON (AP) — A federal appeals court ruled Friday that the Trump administration can end legal protections for around 430,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

The ruling by a three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is the latest twist in a legal fight over Biden-era policies that created new and expanded pathways for people to live in the United States, generally for two years with work authorization. The Trump administration announced in March it was ending the humanitarian parole protections.

“We recognize the risks of irreparable harm persuasively laid out in the district court’s order: that parolees who lawfully arrived in this country were suddenly forced to choose between leaving in less than a month — a choice that potentially includes being separated from their families, communities, and lawful employment and returning to dangers in their home countries,” the judges wrote. “But absent a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits, the risk of such irreparable harms cannot, by itself, support a stay.”

In a two-page ruling, the court lifted a stay issued by a district court and is allowing the administration to end humanitarian parole for those groups while the lawsuit plays out. The ruling Friday is a victory for the Trump administration but doesn’t change anything on the ground.

Esther Sung, the legal director of Justice Action Center, a co-counsel in the case, said the ruling “hurts everyone.”

“People who came here from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela did everything the government asked of them, and the Trump administration cruelly and nonsensically failed to hold up the government’s end of the bargain,” Sung said. “While we are deeply disappointed by this decision, we will continue to advocate zealously for our clients and class members as the litigation continues.”

A district court issued a stay in April halting the administration’s decision, but the Supreme Court lifted the lower court order at the end of May with little explanation.

The Trump administration had argued the appeals court should follow the Supreme Court and reverse the district court ruling.

The protections for people fleeing turmoil in their home countries were always meant to be temporary, and the Department of Homeland Security has the power to revoke them without court interference, the Justice Department said in a court filing.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that ending parole on a case-by-case basis would be a “gargantuan task” that would slow the government’s efforts to press for the removal of the migrants.

“The Secretary’s discretionary rescission of a discretionary benefit should have been the end of the matter,” lawyers for the government wrote in their brief.

Plaintiffs, including people who benefited from the legal protections, urged the appeals court to endorse the district court ruling, which found that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem could not categorically end protections for these groups, but instead had to evaluate each case individually. They also cited the district court’s finding that Noem ignored the humanitarian concerns that led to the legal protections in the first place.

“The district court applied the law correctly and did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that Secretary Noem’s action inflicted irreparable injury on the class members (among others) and that the public interest and balance of the equities tip sharply in favor of preliminary relief,” attorneys for the plaintiffs wrote in a brief.

Republican President Donald Trump promised on the campaign trail to deport millions of people. Since taking office, he has sought to dismantle Biden administration policies that expanded paths for migrants to live legally in the U.S.

The Trump administration’s decision was the first-ever mass revocation of humanitarian parole, attorneys for the migrants said in court papers, calling it “the largest mass illegalization event in modern American history.”",https://www.mcall.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Trump_Venezuela_Immigrants_21434_18ef51.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2025-09-12 21:57:45.864848

The government’s appeal of the order will continue to move forward at the Court of Appeals. Below is a statement from the legal team in CHIRLA v. Noem:

“An estimated two million people who did everything the government asked of them to come to the U.S. through parole can breathe a sigh of relief today,” said Hillary Li, counsel for Justice Action Center. “The district court issued its ruling after reviewing hundreds of pages of legal filings and overseeing hours of oral argument, and that order is as carefully reasoned as it is accurate. The district court recognized the importance of the declarations from direct service providers detailing the horror and harm of courthouse arrests on people all across the country and the urgency of this case. While we are grateful for this outcome, we will remain vigilant to continue to defend the district court’s win and ensure the government’s compliance.”

“We welcome the court’s decision signaling to the Trump administration that it cannot abduct paroled community members and separate them from their families, violating clear, established due process under the guise of expedited removal,” said Ama Frimpong, CASA’s legal director. “We will continue to fight against the administration’s cruel enforcement tactics to ensure that our entire community is protected from its overreach and abuse of power.”

“We will remain vigilant to ensure that our members and others on whose behalf we sued are not being subjected to expedited removal,” said Carl Bergquist, general counsel for CHIRLA. “This administration has tried to use these policies to cruelly and illegally shuttle people out of the country, and we will fight for people who lawfully entered under parole to be treated in the way that the statute demands.”

The ruling by a three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is the latest twist in a legal fight over Biden-era policies that created new and expanded pathways for people to live in the United States, generally for two years with work authorization. The Trump administration announced in March it was ending the humanitarian parole protections.

“We recognize the risks of irreparable harm persuasively laid out in the district court’s order: that parolees who lawfully arrived in this country were suddenly forced to choose between leaving in less than a month — a choice that potentially includes being separated from their families, communities, and lawful employment and returning to dangers in their home countries,” the judges wrote. “But absent a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits, the risk of such irreparable harms cannot, by itself, support a stay.”

In a two-page ruling, the court lifted a stay issued by a district court and is allowing the administration to end humanitarian parole for those groups while the lawsuit plays out. The ruling Friday is a victory for the Trump administration but doesn’t change anything on the ground.

Esther Sung, the legal director of Justice Action Center, a co-counsel in the case, said the ruling “hurts everyone.”

“People who came here from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela did everything the government asked of them, and the Trump administration cruelly and nonsensically failed to hold up the government’s end of the bargain,” Sung said. “While we are deeply disappointed by this decision, we will continue to advocate zealously for our clients and class members as the litigation continues.”

A district court issued a stay in April halting the administration’s decision, but the Supreme Court lifted the lower court order at the end of May with little explanation.

The Trump administration had argued the appeals court should follow the Supreme Court and reverse the district court ruling.

The protections for people fleeing turmoil in their home countries were always meant to be temporary, and the Department of Homeland Security has the power to revoke them without court interference, the Justice Department said in a court filing.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that ending parole on a case-by-case basis would be a “gargantuan task” that would slow the government’s efforts to press for the removal of the migrants.

“The Secretary’s discretionary rescission of a discretionary benefit should have been the end of the matter,” lawyers for the government wrote in their brief.

Plaintiffs, including people who benefited from the legal protections, urged the appeals court to endorse the district court ruling, which found that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem could not categorically end protections for these groups, but instead had to evaluate each case individually. They also cited the district court’s finding that Noem ignored the humanitarian concerns that led to the legal protections in the first place.

“The district court applied the law correctly and did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that Secretary Noem’s action inflicted irreparable injury on the class members (among others) and that the public interest and balance of the equities tip sharply in favor of preliminary relief,” attorneys for the plaintiffs wrote in a brief.

Republican President Donald Trump promised on the campaign trail to deport millions of people. Since taking office, he has sought to dismantle Biden administration policies that expanded paths for migrants to live legally in the U.S.

This week, Tracey Gronniger, Justice in Aging’s Managing Director of Economic Security and Housing, testified in Congress for a hearing on removing barriers to work and supporting opportunity for people with disabilities. Tracey testified on behalf of both Justice in Aging and the Consortium for Constituents with Disabilities (CCD) Social Security Task Force, which Justice in Aging co-chairs.

During the hearing, Tracey urged Congress to ensure access to vital Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits for older and disabled people who are able to and want to work. She pointed to bipartisan solutions for removing barriers to work, such as the SSI Savings Penalty Elimination Act. This bill would increase SSI asset limits, allowing more SSI recipients to keep their benefits while working and saving money for basic expenses and emergencies. Tracey also highlighted the need for adequate staffing at the Social Security Administration.

New Census Data on Senior Poverty and Health Insurance Coverage

The U.S. Census Bureau recently published its annual reports on Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the U.S. While other demographics saw poverty rates fall or remain flat, poverty rates for older adults increased and continued to be especially high for older adults of color.

Data confirms that safety net programs like Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) are critical for reducing senior poverty, with Social Security lifting over 28.7 million older adults above the poverty line. In 2024, under the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM), the poverty rate for older adults was 15%, with older adults having the highest poverty rate among all age groups.

Seniors of color also experienced higher poverty rates. Approximately 24% of Black older adults, 19% of Asian older adults, 22.5% of American Indian and Alaska Native older adults, and 28% of Hispanic older adults were living in poverty. These numbers highlight the need to strengthen and expand the programs low-income older adults rely on, including Social Security, SSI, federal rental assistance, Medicaid, and Medicare so that older adults can age with dignity and the resources they need.

As for health insurance coverage, the Census data shows that in 2024 8.2% of people were uninsured. This is an increase from 2023, when the uninsured rate was at a record-low 7.9% due to COVID-related continuous coverage protections for people with Medicaid and enhanced premium tax credits for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplaces.

The uninsured rate, especially among immigrants, is likely to climb more steeply in the next few years due to H.R. 1, which will take Medicaid, Medicare, and ACA coverage away from 10 million people. Another 4.2 million people—including many low-income older adults—will become uninsured next year if Congress allows the enhanced premium tax credits to expire in 2025.

Preliminary Injunction Stops Federal Agencies from Excluding Older Immigrants from Programs and Services

On September 10, a U.S. District Court issued a preliminary injunction in State of New of York vs. Department of Justice. The lawsuit was brought by 21 states and the District of Columbia against four federal agencies that issued reinterpretations of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA).

The reinterpretations were issued by the Department of Justice, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of Education, and Department of Labor in July 2025 and redefined the term “federal public benefit,” thereby excluding immigrants from eligibility for over a dozen federal programs.

Older immigrants are already severely restricted in the types of public benefits they can access. The HHS notice reinterpreting PRWORA would further impede immigrant older adults’ ability to access health care and other supports by implementing immigration verification requirements for programs such as Federally Qualified Health Centers and recipients of Community Services Block Grants.

The agency received over 500,000 comments from advocates and stakeholders over this action. The preliminary injunction enjoins the federal agencies from enforcing their reinterpretations of PRWORA in the states that are part of the lawsuit.

New Memo Issued on Public Charge, but Underlying Regulations Remain Unchanged

On September 5, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) issued a policy memo to USCIS officers on public charge. The guidance does not change the benefits considered under the public charge test, and the Biden Administration’s public charge rule remains in place.

The new memo emphasizes that officers must strictly follow the relevant authorities when making inadmissibility determinations and reminds immigration officers to be critical of an applicant’s propensity to be dependent on government support. For example, if information is missing from an application for lawful permanent residency or adjustment of status, officers must request that information, and a failure to provide it will result in a denial.

Protecting Immigrant Families (PIF) has created an explainer resource about the memo. Justice in Aging will continue to monitor developments regarding public charge and educate our network about the impacts for older immigrants.

Jennie Mauer, the executive director of the Wisconsin Head Start Association, said she was relieved and ""really thankful"" the judge applied his decision nationwide.
It included Head Start as a program that must enforce immigration status as a requirement to participate.
Then in July, the Head Start associations amended the complaint to include stopping HHS' immigrant directive.","The head of the Wisconsin Head Start Association is praising a recent court ruling that prohibits the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from barring immigrant families from accessing Head Start services due to their immigration status.

A federal judge in the state of Washington granted a preliminary injunction Sept. 11 that blocks the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from implementing or enforcing its directive that would prevent immigrant families from participating in Head Start based on their immigration status, a Sept. 11 news release from the American Civil Liberties Union said.

The decision applies to any Head Start agencies, program providers, student or family participants or other similar persons and applies to Head Start nationwide, according to the ruling.

Jennie Mauer, the executive director of the Wisconsin Head Start Association, said she was relieved and ""really thankful"" the judge applied his decision nationwide.

""I think it makes tremendous sense,"" Mauer said. ""It really just, frankly, allows Head Start to keep doing what it's been doing, which is to serve kids and to allow parents to keep going to work.""

The Department of Health and Human Services said it disagrees with the court's decision and is evaluating next steps, according to an emailed statement from HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon.

Head Start programs are federally funded. They provide child care and health care services to children from birth to age 5, their families, as well as to pregnant women, who meet federal low-income guidelines or participate in public assistance services like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

In July, the HHS announced on its website it rescinded a 1998 interpretation of the federal Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 that HHS said ""improperly extended certain federal public benefits to illegal aliens."" It included Head Start as a program that must enforce immigration status as a requirement to participate. Previously, Head Start and certain other services were exempt from doing so.

In April, the ACLU filed a lawsuit on behalf of parent groups and Head Start associations in Washington state, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The lawsuit challenged the Trump administration's actions against Head Start such as stopping funding, closing regional offices, laying off staff and banning activities related to ""diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility,"" according to an April 28 ACLU news release.

In May, the ACLU filed a motion asking a judge to grant a preliminary injunction to stop the administration's efforts.

A district court issued a stay in April halting the administration's decision, but the Supreme Court lifted the lower court order at the end of May with little explanation.

The Trump administration had argued the appeals court should follow the Supreme Court and reverse the district court ruling.

The protections for people fleeing turmoil in their home countries were always meant to be temporary, and the Department of Homeland Security has the power to revoke them without court interference, the Justice Department said in a court filing.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that ending parole on a case-by-case basis would be a “gargantuan task” that would slow the government’s efforts to press for the removal of the migrants.

“The Secretary’s discretionary rescission of a discretionary benefit should have been the end of the matter,” lawyers for the government wrote in their brief.

Plaintiffs, including people who benefited from the legal protections, urged the appeals court to endorse the district court ruling, which found that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem could not categorically end protections for these groups, but instead had to evaluate each case individually. They also cited the district court’s finding that Noem ignored the humanitarian concerns that led to the legal protections in the first place.

“The district court applied the law correctly and did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that Secretary Noem’s action inflicted irreparable injury on the class members (among others) and that the public interest and balance of the equities tip sharply in favor of preliminary relief,” attorneys for the plaintiffs wrote in a brief.

Republican President Donald Trump promised on the campaign trail to deport millions of people. Since taking office, he has sought to dismantle Biden administration policies that expanded paths for migrants to live legally in the U.S.

The Trump administration’s decision was the first-ever mass revocation of humanitarian parole, attorneys for the migrants said in court papers, calling it “the largest mass illegalization event in modern American history.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/2Mc0MpiJcbH4M3exlBG3NA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/bb1cda3643e5fba0aa2007e09b11376d,N,,2025-09-12 19:57:54.215949

“It is interesting that since the administration has put a large amount of emphasis on all kinds of liberty right, including religious liberty, that we find ourselves in this conflict on some of these court cases recently,” Bishop Mark J. Seitz of El Paso, Texas, told reporters before a roundtable discussion on migration issues hosted by the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life at Georgetown University.

Trump in May signed an executive order creating a religious liberty commission, which includes Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan of New York and Bishop Robert E. Barron of Winona-Rochester, Minnesota. Bishop Seitz noted their presence on the commission, saying, “a couple of our bishops belong to it; and there’s also an advisory committee, more bishops belong to it.”

“So we’re happy for the opportunity to dialog about these issues and to point out where we see inconsistencies that are damaging to an effort to really preserve those First Amendment rights,” he said. “And we hope, maybe, we’ll have a hearing.”

Religious liberty clashes over church’s need to serve migrants, faithful

The church has faced a number of recent situations where religious liberty challenges have intersected with immigration issues.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has waged an attempt to shut down El Paso’s Annunciation House, a Catholic nonprofit serving migrants.

Another flashpoint occurred over the effort to ensure that detainees at “Alligator Alcatraz,” a controversial immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades, have access to the sacraments.

Catholic entities also were among the nongovernmental organizations that appeared subject to a probe by the U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security about their work with migrants, although that suggestion was later walked back.

Additionally, the nature of immigration enforcement under the Trump administration has affected the participation of some Catholics in worship and seeking the sacraments, with Catholic churches reporting emptier pews as a consequence.

In May, the Diocese of Nashville, Tennessee, issued a reminder to the faithful that they are not required to attend Sunday Mass if they fear for their well-being according to the church’s own teaching and canon law. But in July, over in California, Bishop Alberto Rojas of San Bernardino issued a dispensation from the obligation to attend Sunday Mass for the faithful if they fear for their well-being amid concern over immigration enforcement raids in the area.

Additionally, a joint report issued in March by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops‘ Migration and Refugee Services, the Center for the Study of Global Christianity at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, and World Relief, found that more than 10 million Christians living in the U.S. would be vulnerable to deportation under Trump administration policies implemented in 2025, and that a majority of them were Catholic.

Sensitive locations policy raises church’s stakes

Ashley Feasley, the legal expert in residence at the Immigration Law and Policy Initiative at The Catholic University of America Columbus School of Law, noted there is bipartisan support for long-standing restrictions on Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from making arrests at what are seen as sensitive locations, including houses of worship, schools and hospitals.

But when the Trump administration tried to alter that policy, they changed it for a policy that is “less clear.”

“I think this is an area, particularly if the Trump administration is talking about religious liberty, that would go a long way to talk to the bishops about, you know, what is this policy?” Feasley said. “What can be done, particularly as it relates to houses of worship and access to … the sacraments?”

“I think there are decision-makers there who would understand it that way,” she said.

At the roundtable discussion, Nichole Flores, an associate professor of religious studies at the University of Virginia who studies the relationship between Catholicism and democracy, said the principles that “guide our reflection on immigration are threefold, one that human beings do have the right to to migrate, but also that countries such as the United States have the right and even the duty to regulate our borders.”

“But a third principle helps us to hold together those two principles that seem to some to be contradictory, that the work of immigration enforcement should be guided by justice and mercy,” said Flores, who is the author of “The Aesthetics of Solidarity: Our Lady of Guadalupe and American Democracy.”

Pastoral challenges and need for immigration reform

Panelists discussed the policy and pastoral challenges presented by a mass deportation effort.

Archbishop Thomas G. Wenski of Miami discussed traveling with the Knights of Columbus by motorcycle to pray the rosary outside “Alligator Alcatraz.”

“The Knights of Columbus was formed for immigrant Catholics, by the founder, Father Michael McGivney,” he said. “So immigration is part of our Catholic story, and that’s to our shame as Catholics that we forget that our grandparents, our great grandparents, were discriminated against precisely because they were Catholic.”

Archbishop Wenski said immigration critics sometimes claim the bishops support immigration “because they want to fill up their emptying pews.”

But he noted they have consistently advocated for comprehensive immigration reform, because “we have a problem in which we have people being broken by the law, not breaking the law.”

“The administration can say that they are enforcing the laws, and they are,” he said. “They are enforcing the laws, laws that are inadequate and antiquated.”

The rulings come amid this week’s escalation of federal enforcement against immigrants in Chicago, stemming from Trump campaign promises to deport anyone without legal status.

Bush.","Head Start preschool programs will continue to welcome all immigrant children regardless of legal status, federal judges ruled in two separate lawsuits this week as it blocked efforts by the Trump administration to restrict enrollment.

The Department of Health and Human Services announced in July that Head Start and other programs it administered would be limited to U.S. citizens and certain immigrants with legal status, upending decades where the rule has been not to check the immigration status of the participating babies and children too little for preschool.

The Illinois Head Start association filed a lawsuit, along with other Head Start and parent advocate groups and the American Civil Liberties Union, to halt the changes to the rules announced by the Trump administration. Another suit was filed by Illinois and 19 other states with Democratic attorneys general, plus the District of Columbia.

This week in both cases, Republican-appointed federal judges agreed to block the changes.

The rulings come amid this week’s escalation of federal enforcement against immigrants in Chicago, stemming from Trump campaign promises to deport anyone without legal status.

On Wednesday, in the case filed by the attorneys general, U.S. District Court Judge Mary McElroy of Rhode Island, halted the new rules while the lawsuit makes its way to trial.

“The Government argues that it has somehow interpreted this statute incorrectly for the nearly 30 years that it has been the law. In its view, everyone (from every past administration) has

misunderstood it from the start — at least until last month, when the right way to read it became clear to the Government,” wrote McElroy, a Trump appointee, in her 60-page ruling. “The Court is skeptical of that.”

Then on Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Ricardo Martinez of Washington ruled in favor of the Head Start advocates, issuing a nationwide injunction that prevents the proposed changes from taking effect.

Congress changed the rules of Head Start since its founding in 1965 several times, but never included any immigration or citizenship requirements for Head Start eligibility, Martinez wrote in a 26-page ruling.

“The Directive imposes new obligations on Head Start agencies and strips away rights from

On behalf of the Illinois Head Start Association and other plaintiffs, Allison Siebeneck, director of the Women’s and Reproductive Rights Project at the ACLU of Illinois, wrote in a statement that the ruling “protects essential early childhood education for families across the country.

""This climate of fear increases the likelihood of circumstances that threaten our community's safety and the safety of our public safety officials, too,"" said Rep. Brad Schneider (D-Ill.).

An ICE agent shot and killed Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, who was trying to evade arrest and resorted to driving his car into the officers and dragging one of them, the Associated Press reported. The officer shot Villegas-Gonzalez, who was pronounced dead at a local hospital, where the agent was also taken to be treated for serious injuries.

ICE agents had stopped Villegas-Gonzalez and said he had a history of ""reckless driving"" and was an undocumented immigrant.

Erendira Rendón, chief program officer at immigration and economic justice group The Resurrection Project, said in a statement that the ""horrific incident in Franklin Park shows us the real danger that militarized enforcement creates in our neighborhoods.""

""A community member is dead, and an officer was injured,"" Rendón said. “These are outcomes that serve no public safety purpose and leave entire communities traumatized. Safe neighborhoods depend on trust, not fear. When federal agents conduct unaccountable operations in our communities, everyone becomes less safe.”

The shooting forced administrators at a nearby junior high school to place the school on lockdown.

The local news outlet Block Club Chicago reported that video of the incident was not immediately available.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat who has vehemently condemned Trump's deployment of federal agents—and potentially troops—to Chicago, called for the Department of Homeland Security to release ""a full, factual accounting of what’s happened today to ensure transparency and accountability.""

Thousands of Chicago residents have marched against Trump's decision to deploy ICE—possibly followed by the National Guard—to the city in an operation that the White House has claimed is being carried out in honor of a woman allegedly killed in a drunk driving accident by an undocumented immigrant around 140 miles away.

Also on Friday, residents protested at ICE's Broadview Village processing facility, where Block Club Chicago reported ""pushing and shoving"" took place between about 30 demonstrators and ICE agents in riot gear.

Like Trump's broader mass deportation agenda, the White House has claimed Operation Midway Blitz is aimed at carrying out the arrests of the ""worst of the worst"" violent criminals, but an analysis by the CATO Institute found that 93% of immigrants booked into ICE facilities in the first months of Trump's term have no history of violent crime convictions, and 65% have no criminal convictions at all.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61597583&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C84%2C0%2C85,N,,2025-09-13 02:56:49.461509

""I feel very confident that we're going to have a great parade,"" Rita Rodriguez, one of the Fiestas Patrias organizers, told Houston Public Media.

The Fiestas Patrias parade, which celebrates the cultures of several Latin American countries and serves as a kickoff for Hispanic Heritage Month, is expected to have around 100 moving parts, with as many as 3,000 people participating, Rodriguez said.

This will be Houston’s first Fiestas Patrias parade in four years after a hiatus organizers attributed to COVID-19. Rodriguez said the break has contributed to ""a lot of buzz"" on social media.

The event also comes as the Trump administration ramps up immigration enforcement at other Latino-centric events. This week, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that immigration officers may take race into consideration when stopping individuals in the Los Angeles area.

""There's always that possibility because of that recent Supreme Court decision that pretty much gives ICE [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] the green light to arrest anyone that they suspect as being illegal,"" said Sergio Lira, president of a Houston council of the League of United Latin American Citizens, or LULAC. ""That really raises the concerns, raises the bar in terms of our Latino community. Anyone can be suspect and arrested.""

During a weeklong operation in August, ICE agents in Houston arrested more than 800 people, according to a news release the agency shared on Monday.

Plaintiffs challenging the revocation of parole for migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela hadn’t made a strong showing the move was arbitrary and capricious, the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held Friday in reversing a lower court.

The US Supreme Court has allowed the government to move ahead with revoking CHNV parole grants, approving an emergency request by DHS to ignore a district court order blocking removal of those immigrants while litigation unfolds.

Thousands of requests for green cards or other temporary relief are still pending at DHS.

The agency has moved to dismantle a broad swathe of temporary humanitarian programs, discontinuing refugee resettlement, restricting asylum, and suspending entry through several parole pathways besides the CHNV process. It’s also sought to eliminate humanitarian relief for hundreds of thousands of immigrants in the US as part of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda, including many Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans shielded by Temporary Protected Status.

Although it’s fighting multiple court challenges over TPS terminations, the parole litigation is one of the first cases involving temporary immigrant protections to advance to the appellate level.

A Boston district court judge found the terminations were likely unlawful because Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem issued a blanket termination of protections. But the Immigration and Nationality Act “favors an interpretation that the ‘case-by-case’ requirement only limits the Secretary’s discretion to grant parole,” and doesn’t limit terminations, Appeals Court Judge Gustavo Gelpí Jr., a Biden appointee, wrote in the opinion.

The case was also heard by William Kayatta Jr., an Obama appointee, and Lara E. Montecalvo, a Biden appointee. The panel focused on whether the termination decision was shielded from judicial review during July oral arguments. Because the appeals court decided in the government’s favor, it didn’t address questions about reviewability in Friday’s opinion.

The decision vacated a district court stay on parole terminations and remanded the case for further proceedings.

With President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda and ramped up immigration enforcement, they said, many families are wary of taking their children to school, going to work or church for fear of being detained and deported.

“The way that the immigration policies are enforced these days are not only destabilizing the life of the particular immigrant, but whole families, businesses, the life of children, whole communities, neighborhoods,” said Auxiliary Bishop Evelio Menjivar-Ayala, of Washington, D.C. “What I’m seeing in people’s eyes, is pain and a deep confusion. … Where do we go from here if we’re not welcome.”

Adding to those fears is a change made at the start of Trump’s second term that gave immigration officers more leeway to make arrests at schools and houses of worship — long considered off limits. This is being challenged in court by teachers and faith groups.

“For me, it’s very personal because I was a stranger and you welcomed me,” said Menjivar-Ayala. He crossed the U.S. border illegally in 1990 after leaving his native El Salvador during the country’s civil war. Now a U.S. citizen, he became the first Salvadoran bishop in the United States.

Helping keep hope alive in struggling families is a critical part of providing support, said Sister Norma Pimentel, a leading migrant-rights activist along the U.S.-Mexico border who spoke on the panel. She runs Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley, a respite center for beleaguered migrants in McAllen, Texas.

She recalled visiting immigrant families at a detention center in a “terrible condition,” and being moved to tears.

“I saw Border Patrol agents looking at us, and they, too, were moved and were crying,” she said. “When I walked out of there, the officer turned to me and said, ‘Thank you, sister, for helping us realize they’re human beings.’”

Department of Homeland Security officials have maintained there will be no safe spaces for those who are in the country illegally, have committed crimes, or tried to undermine immigration enforcement. They have consistently said their efforts are intended to safeguard public safety and national security.

Catholic leaders at odds with Trump over immigration

Catholic leaders follow the church’s core doctrine against abortion and same-sex marriage, priorities they share with many political conservatives. But they’ve been at odds with the Trump administration on immigration.

Earlier this year, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops announced the end of a half-century of partnerships with the federal government to serve refugees and migrant children, saying the “heartbreaking” decision followed the Trump administration’s abrupt halt to funding.

In February, the late Pope Francis also issued a major rebuke to the administration’s plans for mass deportations of migrants, warning that the forceful removal of people purely because of their illegal status deprives them of their inherent dignity.

At the panel, Miami Archbishop Thomas Wenski highlighted the contributions of immigrants to the country’s economy.

“If you ask people in agriculture, you ask in the service industry, you ask people in health care, you ask the people in the construction field, and they’ll tell you that some of their best workers are immigrants,” said Wenski, who has served on the USCCB’s migration committee. “Enforcement is always going to be part of any immigration policy, but we have to rationalize it and humanize it.”

Wenski joined the “Knights on Bikes” ministry, an initiative led by the Knights of Columbus that draws attention to the spiritual needs of people held at immigration detention centers, including the one in the Florida Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” He recalled praying a rosary with the bikers in the scorching heat outside its walls. Days later, he got permission to celebrate Mass inside the facility.

“The fact that we invite these detainees to pray, even in this very dehumanizing situation, is a way of emphasizing and invoking their dignity,” he said. “More importantly that God has not forgotten them.”

Los Angeles archdiocese suffers after immigration raids

In Los Angeles County, the Trump administration’s ramped up arrests of people suspected of living in the country illegally has upended life for tens of thousands of people. About a third of the county’s 10 million residents are foreign-born, and many are now trying to live without being noticed.

Los Angeles Archbishop José Gomez said on the panel that the fear-inducing effect of immigration raids lowered attendance at Mass, and affected valuable church programs that mostly serve immigrants. The archdiocese is helping those being detained and facing deportation with legal and financial assistance.

“People are really afraid of going out of their homes,” said Gomez, the first Latino to serve as USCCB president. “A lot of the priests are telling me here in the archdiocese that at least 30% of the people attending Mass are not coming anymore.”

Panelists warn of fallout from immigration crackdown

The panel, which included academics and legal experts, lamented the suffering of children separated from their parents. Legal expert Ashley Feasley, who is with Catholic University of America’s Columbus School of Law, noted the millions of children who are U.S. citizens and have parents and other family members in the country illegally.

“When we think about the level of enforcement that is starting, occurring, and will intensify … we have to think about these families. What will they do? How will they handle it if a parent gets detained?” Feasley said.

Trump has portrayed his federal law enforcement surge in Washington as focused on tackling crime. But data from the federal operation, analyzed by The Associated Press, shows that more than 40% of the arrests made over the monthlong operation were in fact related to immigration.

“The president says that he’s enforcing these policies to make our cities safer, but if immigrants, if people are afraid of interacting with law enforcement, with police, reporting crimes, obviously they’re going to become targets of crimes,” said Menjivar-Ayala.

“This is not going to help to make our streets, our communities safer.”

Ministering to immigrants at the border

Mark Seitz, the bishop of El Paso, Texas, said it is crucial to continue informing immigrant communities about their rights

“We don’t stop at praying,” Seitz, chair of the USCCB’s Committee on Migration, told the panel.

“Prayer moves us to action, and that’s what we ought to be doing — to abide by our support, our love, our accompaniment, by being present to people who’ve been terrorized by the actions of the government.”

At end of the panel, Gomez said it’s important to remember that the United States is a country of immigrants.

“I think we’ll have immigrant reform very soon. That’s my prayer and my dream -- that we can get something done, finally, as a solution of these challenges,” he said.

Wearing face masks, they disembarked a chartered plane at Incheon airport and were greeted with cheers from officials, including the presidential chief of staff, before being taken by bus to meet family members.

Their return capped a week of intense negotiations by Seoul to win their release and bring them home after they were taken into custody in handcuffs and shackles — images that shocked many in South Korea, a key US ally.

Presidential Chief of Staff Kang Hoon-sik said he had come to the airport to highlight how seriously President Lee Jae-myung was taking the incident that had affected ""innocent people of Korea"".

""We're in an age of new normal in dealing with the United States,"" Mr Kang told reporters.

South Korean businesses have long struggled with obtaining proper visas for specialist staff needed at project sites for months at a time, which has led to some workers relying on grey areas in US visa enforcement.

The two countries are looking at establishing a working group to consider a new type of visa for Koreans, according to South Korea's foreign minister who visited Washington this week.

The workers were met by family members and officials from battery company LG Energy Solution (LGSE), who is partnering with Hyundai Motors to build the plant in the US state of Georgia.

The raid has threatened to destabilise ties at a time when the countries are seeking to finalise a trade deal, which includes a $US350 billion ($527 billion) investment fund to support strategic US industries.

At the arrival gate, a man unfurled a large poster depicting US President Donald Trump wearing an outfit with the initials of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) service and carrying a bag full of dollar bills with a machine gun slung across his chest. The caption read: ""We're friends!""

Workers shackled and put in handcuffs

Returning workers said they were horrified by the September 4 raid conducted jointly by US immigration authorities, the FBI and the Justice Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives that rounded up 475 workers at the plant's site.

""It started to look serious because we thought we would be taking the transport vehicle, but then they started putting handcuffs and shackles, and that's when we thought 'Oh, this is not going to be a simple transport,'"" LG Energy Solution engineer Choi Young-hee said.

In a sign that Washington recognises the importance of South Korean investment and the skills of the country's workers needed to get plants operational, Mr Trump earlier this week offered to allow the workers to stay to train Americans.

Returning from Washington, South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said the workers' return home, initially planned for Wednesday, was halted when the US president intervened, saying it was ""not right"" and asked if there was a different ending to the case.

THIS WEEK IN BRIEF:

Supreme Court upholds “roving patrols” and profiling: A September 8 Supreme Court “shadow docket” decision gave DHS a green light to resume carrying out sweeps and patrols targeting individuals based solely on “profiling” criteria like apparent race, ethnicity, language, location, or employment. The underlying lawsuit seeking to halt this practice continues, but six Supreme Court justices decided to allow profiling to proceed while the case moves through lower courts.

Elsewhere in the courts: Updates on the administration’s effort to swiftly deport unaccompanied Central American children; its agreement with El Salvador for paid imprisonment of deported Venezuelan people; a decision calling for detention of all who entered the U.S. illegally while their immigration cases proceed; and a bit of good news—perhaps—for Venezuelan TPS recipients.

Mass deportation in the U.S. interior: Updates on immigration enforcement surges in Chicago, Boston, and Washington; a new report on abuse suffered by deported Mexican citizens; a surge in ICE deportation flights to Mexico; conditions and deaths in ICE custody; the U.S. military’s role; and the economic impact of administration migration policies.

THE FULL UPDATE:

Supreme Court upholds “roving patrols” and profiling

In a brief September 8 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court gave its approval, pending further consideration by lower courts, for aggressive immigration enforcement targeting individuals based solely on their apparent race, ethnicity, language, location, or employment. The decision lifts a July federal district court order to halt such enforcement in Los Angeles, which an appeals court had kept in place during its ongoing review.

As a result, the New York Times explained, “For American citizens of Hispanic descent in Los Angeles—especially people who speak with an accent or work as manual laborers—that means they will continue to risk being stopped and questioned whenever they go out. They may see it as a necessary precaution to always carry documents with them in a way that other Americans need not.”

The high court’s six Republican-nominated judges voted to undo the stay on roving patrols and sweeps by armed, masked agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and supporting agencies, with Justice Brett Kavanaugh writing a concurring opinion. The three Democratic-nominated judges voted to keep the stay in place and wrote a dissenting opinion.

An aggressive operation, halted

Between June 6, when the Trump administration launched a large-scale operation, and late August, ICE and affiliated agencies arrested 5,210 presumably undocumented people in the Los Angeles area, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) stated. Especially during its first month, the operation featured frequent “roundups of random Hispanic people by armed agents,” as the New York Times described it, many of them caught on mobile phone videos shared widely on social media. Agents paid repeated visits to the same sites, while U.S. citizens of Latino descent reported being stopped more than once within spans of just a few days.

Analyzing ICE data obtained by the Deportation Data Project, the Cato Institute’s David Bier found in early August that fully one-fifth of ICE arrests since January 20 were of Latino individuals taken off the streets with no prior criminal records and no removal orders. “This policy is a threat to the rights of all people in the United States,” Bier warned.

On June 20, several people caught up in these sweeps, along with Los Angeles-area legal defense groups, filed a potential class-action lawsuit in federal court. (The case is Vásquez Perdomo v. Noem.) On July 11, District Court Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong, a Biden appointee, granted the plaintiffs’ request for a temporary restraining order, noting a “mountain of evidence” that the sweeps were violating people’s constitutional rights.

This order halted all “detentive stops” by immigration personnel without “reasonable suspicion” of undocumented presence in the United States. It specified that reasonable suspicion cannot be based solely on four criteria indicative of racial profiling: “(1) apparent race or ethnicity; (2) speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent; (3) presence at a particular location (e.g. bus stop, car wash, tow yard, day laborer pick up site, agricultural site, etc.); or (4) the type of work one does.”

On July 28, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously kept the restraining order in place, denying the government’s request to stay it. The four listed factors, the two Clinton-appointed and one Biden-appointed judges found, “describe only a broad profile and ‘do not demonstrate reasonable suspicion for any particular stop,’” legal analyst Chris Geidner explained.

ICE arrests dropped by 66 percent in the Los Angeles area following the restraining order, according to mid-August analysis of Deportation Data Project statistics by Cato’s Bier.

The Supreme Court lifts the restraining order

The restraining order is now lifted. The entire Supreme Court majority did not explain the reasoning behind its September 8 decision, which it rarely does when ruling, on its “emergency” or “shadow” docket, whether to keep policies in place while lower courts decide on their legality.

In his solo concurring opinion, though, Justice Kavanaugh asserted that a person’s ethnicity can be used as a “relevant” factor in determining whether an agent might stop someone. Kavanaugh voiced the view that when U.S. citizens are stopped, “questioning in those circumstances is typically brief, and those individuals may promptly go free after making clear to the immigration officers that they are U.S. citizens or otherwise legally in the United States.” This does not describe the experience of plaintiffs in the Vásquez Perdomo case, and appears to imply that people at risk of racial profiling must never avoid going out in public without proof of citizenship.

“Countless people in the Los Angeles area have been grabbed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed simply because of their looks, their accents, and the fact they make a living by doing manual labor,” read a dissenting opinion written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor and joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson. “Today, the Court needlessly subjects countless more to these exact same indignities.”

The case (not the restraining order) continues to move through the courts, with an appellate court hearing set for September 24.

“Going hard”

In the meantime, sweeps and patrols are resuming. Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol sector chief placed in charge of “at large” mass deportation operations in Los Angeles, tweeted, “quite frankly the poorly written ( very poorly) temp restrainig [sic.] order was the worst i’ve ever seen. We are going hard in Los Angeles today and are hitting a location as I write this.“ A DHS tweet promised to “continue to FLOOD THE ZONE in Los Angeles.”

Geidner, the legal analyst who authors the Law Dork newsletter, warned that the high court’s move “makes a mockery of the Fourth Amendment’s protections against unreasonable searches or seizures, with significant worrying consequences for all people in America—whether you lack documentation to be in this country or are a citizen of it.”

A statement from California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s (D) office went further: “Trump’s hand-picked Supreme Court majority just became the Grand Marshal for a parade of racial terror in Los Angeles. This isn’t about enforcing immigration laws—it’s about targeting Latinos and anyone who doesn’t look or sound like Stephen Miller’s idea of an American, including U.S. citizens and children, to deliberately harm California’s families and small businesses. Trump’s private police force now has a green light to come after your family.”

“When ICE grabbed me, they never showed a warrant or explained why,” read a statement from the named plaintiff in the case, Pedro Vásquez Perdomo, a U.S. citizen. “I was treated like I didn’t matter–locked up, cold, hungry, and without a lawyer. Now, the Supreme Court says that’s okay? That’s not justice. That’s racism with a badge.”

Elsewhere in the courts

Unaccompanied Guatemalan children

In Washington DC federal district court on September 10, government lawyers retracted their earlier claims that, when they sought to send 76 unaccompanied Guatemalan children back to their country in the pre-dawn hours of the Sunday before Labor Day, they were granting the children’s families’ wishes to reunite them. Presented with evidence that virtually all of the children feared or were unwilling to return to Guatemala, Justice Department attorneys backed off from “family reunification” claims that they, and other Trump administration officials, had forcefully—and, it turns out, falsely—made on August 31. (See WOLA’s September 5 Border Update for a full narrative.)

The restraining order preventing the Guatemalan kids’ deportation expires on September 14. Attorneys representing the children asked Judge Timothy Kelly, a Trump appointee assigned to the case, to keep the deportations on hold more firmly with a preliminary injunction. They are also asking Kelly to add unaccompanied children of other nationalities to the class of plaintiffs. That includes a group of Honduran children who, according to the Arizona-based Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project, are at risk of a similarly swift removal.

In a detailed analysis at LawFare, Anna Bower contrasted the August 31 response of emergency on-call Judge Sparkle Sooknanan, who kept the Trump administration on a tight leash to prevent planes from departing with the Guatemalan children, with the energetic but ultimately unsuccessful performance of Washington DC Judge James Boasberg in March, during a similar administration attempt to carry out a secretive, high-speed removal to a prison in El Salvador. Bower argued that the judiciary is on a “learning curve” regarding the executive branch’s overreach and basic trustworthiness.

Venezuelan men rendered to El Salvador

Also before Judge Boasberg is a suit from several migrant defense organizations that seeks to halt and reverse the State Department’s transfer of funds to El Salvador to imprison migrants there after their removal from the United States.

Between March 15 and July 18, 252 Venezuelan men were held in that country’s notorious Center for Confinement of Terrorism (CECOT) prison after the Trump administration sent them there, 137 under the little-used Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Since their release and return to Venezuela, the men have shared harrowing accounts of beatings, physical torture, sexual abuse, and other mistreatment.

On September 9, a filing in the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights v. Department of State case revealed a key piece of information: the March 22 written agreement between the Trump administration and the government of El Salvador governing the use of the CECOT.

This document committed the State Department to providing El Salvador $4.76 million from the account of its Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, which is legally authorized to fund anti-drug, crime-fighting, and justice programs—not the foreign imprisonment of migrants without charge. The money is meant to help El Salvador cover “law enforcement and anticrime needs, which may include costs associated with the detention of members of the Foreign Terrorist Organization Tren de Aragua”—approximately 300 of them.

The agreement “did nothing to meaningfully ensure that individuals disappeared from the U.S. to El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison were protected from torture, indefinite confinement, or other abuses,” noted a statement from Skye Perryman of Democracy Forward, one of the plaintiff groups. However, it did “go to lengths to ensure that the funds the U.S. provided to El Salvador not be used to provide reproductive health care or to assist asylum seekers in accessing resources and counsel.”

In a reference to “section 620M of the Foreign Assistance Act,” the agreement with El Salvador signaled diplomats’ awareness that the State Department money had to comply with the Leahy Law, which prohibits U.S. assistance to foreign security-force units that grossly violate human rights with impunity. The Venezuelan men’s accounts of what they suffered in the CECOT (several cited in WOLA’s August 8 Border Update) indicate rather vividly that Salvadoran units did commit gross human rights violations after receiving U.S. aid.

At the New Yorker, reporter Jonathan Blitzer published a thorough narrative of the Venezuelan men’s experience, from their decisions to migrate to what they endured in U.S. and Salvadoran custody. The lengthy article explored the efforts of the Trump campaign and administration to portray Venezuelan migrants as a national security threat, often building on atypical or isolated cases.

Blitzer’s piece includes some new details and elements. It reports that, going back to the Biden administration, Border Patrol was “taking the lead” in elevating the Tren de Aragua threat, voicing a view that may not have been shared by investigative agencies like ICE Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). It also recounts a “blond and light skinned” ICE agent grabbing by the hair, punching in the face, and swearing at a Venezuelan woman aboard one of the El Salvador-bound planes until another guard restrained him (the Salvadoran government rejected the rendition of a handful of women aboard the March 15 flights). And it includes further accounts of the constant beatings the CECOT guards administered: they “became so routine that the Venezuelans scored them on a scale of one to five—the higher the number, the worse the treatment.”

The most well-known of the Venezuelan ex-prisoners, Andry Hernández, gave a September 11 interview to Andrea Castillo of the Los Angeles Times. Hernández, a gay makeup artist apparently accused of gang membership because he had tattoos, recalled his six-month stay at ICE’s Otay Mesa Detention Center outside San Diego. “Immigrant detainees are given blue, orange, or red uniforms, depending on their classification level,” Castillo reported. “A guard once explained that detainees wearing orange, like him, could be criminals. Hernández Romero said he replied, ‘Is being gay a crime? Or is doing makeup a crime?’”

Prohibition of bond

Within the Justice Department, the Board of Immigration Appeals—which can review immigration judges’ decisions and set precedents—issued a decision that could signal a massive shift in immigration policy. The Board upheld a Trump administration policy requiring judges to detain all migrants who entered the United States illegally—such as those who crossed the border between ports of entry—while their cases proceed. This prohibition on bond releases could apply to millions of people.

The decision “is likely to send an immediate chill through immigration courts where judges for decades have released individuals on bond whom they did not deem a flight risk or danger,” the Los Angeles Times reported. In the past, detaining all improper border crossers would have vastly stretched ICE’s detention system far beyond capacity. Now, however, a $45 billion appropriation for ICE detention, part of the “big bill” that Congress passed in early July, has significantly expanded that capacity.

TPS for Venezuela

In a Northern District of California court on September 5, Judge Edward Chen ordered the restoration of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for about 600,000 citizens of Venezuela. This reverses, for now, the Trump administration’s termination of TPS for Venezuelans. Chen argued that the administration did not follow procedure, including a careful review of conditions in Venezuela, when it curtailed TPS.

Judge Chen’s ruling “means 600,000 Venezuelans whose temporary protections expired in April or whose protections were about to expire Sept. 10 have status to stay and work in the United States. It also keeps protections for about 500,000 Haitians,” the Associated Press reported.

“Protections and employment authorization for Venezuelans are back in place until October 2026,” Bloomberg Law reported. “But they’ll have to re-register for TPS by Sept. 10.” However, that has been impossible to do, as DHS “hadn’t updated its website to show that the Venezuelans were still covered by T.P.S. and wasn’t allowing many of them to re-register as they needed to by a Sept. 10 deadline,” the New York Times reported on September 11. A government lawyer cited a “coding issue.”

On September 11, Judge Chen ordered that the website be operational within a day and that TPS recipients have sufficient time to re-register. It is not clear what, if anything, can be done for any Venezuelans who were deported after losing this now-restored status.

Mass deportation in the U.S. interior

As funding from the giant budget legislation approved in July continues to come online, the administration’s operations to arrest, detain, and deport migrants from the U.S. interior continue to accelerate. In what has become a regular component of WOLA’s Border Updates, this section offers links to coverage of some of the principal developments.

Operations in cities

As noted above, agents from ICE, CBP, and other federal law enforcement agencies poured into Los Angeles in June. In August, a surge began in Washington, DC. In both of these cities, the civilian law enforcement deployments came with contingents of military personnel, mainly National Guard, who have been less directly involved in migrant apprehensions.

Now, the administration is launching operations—so far, just with civilian law enforcement agencies, not military personnel—in Chicago and Boston. These are reportedly modeled on the Los Angeles operation. (ICE also carried out a large-scale raid last week at a big Hyundai manufacturing plant in Georgia, detaining hundreds of mostly Korean citizens and triggering diplomatic tensions with South Korea.)

The administration has officially launched what it is calling “Operation Midway Blitz” in Chicago. President Trump publicized it with a social media post featuring an AI image depicting himself in the role played by Robert Duvall in the movie Apocalypse Now, twisting Duvall’s famous line into “I love the smell of deportations in the morning” and threatening, “Chicago is about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR.”

So far, though, there is no indication that Department of Defense personnel are deployed to Chicago, although ICE, CBP, and other civilian personnel who have moved from elsewhere, mainly Los Angeles, are operating out of Naval Station Great Lakes, north of the city. In the operation’s first days, the Chicago Sun-Times reported, “Details were scarce as videos surfaced of masked federal agents taking people into custody, with a smattering of arrests from the South Side to the west suburbs.”

Gregory Bovino, the politically outspoken Border Patrol agent who began 2025 as the chief of the agency’s El Centro Sector and was tapped to lead the Los Angeles operation, is now in Chicago. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a vocal Trump opponent who has called Bovino “a guy who desperately wants to be a reality TV star,” said that the Chief’s reported arrival is “evidence that they have terrible plans for the communities of Illinois.”

Bovino tweeted a photo of himself accompanied by dozens of uniformed agents with the Hollywood sign in the background, with the text “The mean green team is not going anywhere. We are here to stay.” The Chief’s face is the only one not blurred out.

In the past two weeks, Bovino has been profiled by the New York Times, CBS News, and the Associated Press, which noted, “Bovino carefully hones his image, both his own and the one projected to the country that shows well-armed officers moving swiftly into place to make arrests.”

In Boston and elsewhere in Democratic-governed Massachusetts, the administration has launched what it calls “Operation Patriot 2.0”; the “1.0” version was a surge that led to 1,500 arrests in Massachusetts during the spring. “The operation began late this week and was expected to last several weeks,” two sources told the New York Times for a September 6 report.

The most visible aspect of the Boston operation so far has been a war of words with the city’s popular mayor, Michelle Wu, who ordered that “no Boston police or local resources will be co-opted into federal immigration enforcement and their mass deportation agenda.” In a September 6 statement, DHS retorted, “Sanctuary policies like those pushed by Mayor Wu not only attract and harbor criminals but also place these public safety threats above the interests of law-abiding American citizens.”

Washington “has transformed from a place that proudly welcomed immigrants into one primed for their deportations,” with DC Metropolitan Police now working closely alongside ICE agents “who have detained people in front of schools and restaurants,” noted a Washington Post analysis that featured the heavy hands-on role of White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller in directing the operation.

In the Virginia suburbs, where most out-of-state National Guard personnel are sleeping in hotels, an ICE raid on a construction site near the Central Intelligence Agency’s (CIA) headquarters led some fleeing workers to try to scale the spy agency’s perimeter fence. The CIA, which ICE did not inform about the nearby operation, closed its gates for more than an hour.

With the school year now well underway, the Washington Post reported on a “walking school bus” that parents have organized to help children from mixed-status families feel at least somewhat safe on their way to and from classes.

Arrests

At her Beyond the Border newsletter, San Diego-based reporter Kate Morrissey noted that, since a court ruling against nationwide “expedited removal” has slowed ICE’s detentions of migrants reporting to immigration court (see WOLA’s September 5 Border Update), agents are now strapping electronic ankle monitors onto thousands who show up for their cases.

Now that it is no longer common for agents to start their workdays with specific individuals to target, NBC News reported that ICE no longer requires agents to complete a “field operations worksheet” with details about their targets. Instead, “broad street sweeps” with no specific targets are becoming the norm. “It’s hard to fill out a worksheet that just says, ‘Meet in the Home Depot parking lot,’” a former ICE official told the network.

Among the many federal agencies losing personnel to the mass deportation effort is the State Department’s Diplomatic Security Service, Wired reported. Of the 2,500 officers on the force, which protects embassies and other U.S. installations, 600 have been deputized “to help with arresting and deporting illegal immigrants” and now must log the time they are spending on that mission.

Deportations

The Kino Border Initiative (KBI), which maintains a shelter near the border in Nogales, Sonora, Mexico, released a report on the experience of deported Mexican citizens. Since April, the Mexican government has granted KBI personnel “regular access” to the shelter for deported individuals that it set up in Nogales at the beginning of the year, in anticipation of the Trump administration’s “mass deportation” campaign.

KBI staff conducted 278 brief surveys of returned migrants “to document patterns of repatriation, testimonies, and reports of mistreatment,” and the results are troubling. Fifty-seven percent of them had been living in the U.S. interior at the time of their arrest, as opposed to being apprehended upon arrival at the border: that is up from 5 percent of deported people last year. Of those apprehended in the interior, 57.5 percent had lived in the United States for more than five years, and 56 percent reported being separated from their families, “leaving behind children, partners, and other dependents.”

Since the Trump administration all but dismantled DHS’s Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) and Office of Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO), the last five complaints—and nine of the previous 16 complaints—that KBI has filed on behalf of migrants who suffered abuse in U.S. custody have gone without even a response. “We have not even received the typical automatic acknowledgment of receipt that was standard in the past.”

At the Guardian, Maanvi Singh and Will Craft dug into leaked flight records and passenger manifests from ICE’s largest aerial deportation charter contractor, Global Crossing Airlines (GlobalX). In just over 100 days, they found, GlobalX operated 1,700 ICE flights, carrying 44,000 people, including nearly 1,000 children and 22 infants; nearly 3,600 individuals were moved five or more times. Secretive transfers, family separations, and flights to third countries complicate the defense of cases in immigration court, including access to attorneys.

The August report of Human Rights First’s ICE Flight Monitor, which takes up the work of recently retired Tom Cartwright of Witness at the Border, found a sharp rise in ICE deportation flights last month. The project recorded 240 removal flights in August, the most in a month since Cartwright began tracking in 2020. This included a striking 72 flights into Mexico’s interior, up from a January-July average of 21 per month. That is the most flights this project has ever recorded to a single country in one month.

ICE Flight Monitor observed that starting August 28, ICE flights into Mexico ceased and have not resumed. In a likely correlated development, Border Report noted a surge in land-border deportations into Tijuana during the first eight days of September: 74 deported individuals from San Diego each day, up from a February-August average of 36 per day.

Also in Tijuana, Border Report reported, the head of the non-governmental Migrant Pro Defense Council in Baja California, José Moreno, publicly accused municipal police of extorting deported people. Moreno alleged that corrupt cops are shaking down returned migrants outside the federal and Salvation Army shelters.

Spain’s El País reported on the secrecy and opacity of ICE’s deportations to third countries. July flights to Rwanda, South Sudan, and Eswatini “were not reported until weeks after they occurred, and the administration did not provide the identities of the deportees, who remain imprisoned in high-security facilities.” A Jamaican man sent to Eswatini despite the Kingston government’s willingness to take him, Orville Etoria, has disappeared: his lawyers “have been unable to contact him and fear for his safety.”

Eswatini, the monarchy formerly known as Swaziland, is the latest nation to which the Trump administration is threatening to send Salvadoran man Kilmar Abrego García. The Maryland father whom the Trump administration mistakenly sent to the CECOT in March remains in ICE custody in Virginia with a judicial order not to deport him, as he considers applying for asylum: having left and re-entered the country, Abrego García may now be eligible to do so. The administration has stated its view that an asylum application would void Abrego García’s existing withholding of removal status, enabling his deportation to his home country, which he fled due to threats.

The government of Belize (population 400,000) has acknowledged that it is reviewing a proposal from the Trump administration to sign a “Safe Third Country” agreement, which would allow the U.S. government to send asylum seekers from third countries to seek protection within the Belizean system. “As of now, Belize has not agreed to the proposal, and further consultations are expected before any decision is made,” reported the local Love FM.

NBC News reported that downloads of CBP’s “CBP Home” app are dwindling as migrants are apparently choosing not to use it to “self-deport.” During five weeks in March and April, 356 people used the app to register their departures and, at least in some cases, to receive a $1,000 stipend, according to data NBC obtained through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. However, DHS “didn’t respond to repeated requests” for updated figures. An estimated 91,000 people downloaded the app from within the United States, with most of them doing so during its first weeks.

Detention

At the 19th, Chabeli Carrazana documented the detention and deportation of Colombian mother Nicolle Orozco Forero, her husband, and their two young sons from Seattle after spending 21 days in the Dilley Immigration Processing Center, a “family detention” facility that the Trump administration has reopened in Texas. Orozco Forero’s son has a serious kidney condition, but she said that Dilley staff only offered him ibuprofen.

CNN reported on the grim, even subhuman, conditions prevailing in what are meant to be temporary “hold rooms” at ICE facilities, particularly in Miami and New York. The agency’s “policies for decades have required the agency to keep migrants in cramped hold rooms like this for no longer than 12 hours,” but 18 percent of detainees are now in those spaces for more time than that. At the troubled Krome Detention Center in Miami, hold room stays now average more than three days. Mobile phone videos show “Men sleeping head-to-toe on a crowded floor, exhausted detainees blocking out fluorescent lights with face masks, and dozens of people using cardboard boxes as mattresses.”

Lorenzo Antonio Batrez Vargas, a 32-year-old Mexican man who had lived in Flagstaff, Arizona, for so long that he had graduated high school there, died on August 31 while in custody at the state’s Central Arizona Correctional Complex in Florence. He had been in ICE custody for three weeks. The cause of death is unknown, though a family member alleged at a GoFundMe page that Batrez Vargas died “alone, likely from complications of COVID-19, and without the medical attention he deserved.” He appears to be the 13th person to die in ICE custody since the Trump administration began.

At the Atlantic, Conor Friedersdorf interviewed George Retes, a 25-year-old Army veteran and U.S. citizen who spent days in custody after Border Patrol agents violently arrested him—he said he tried to comply with their orders—in California. “Held in a jail cell for three days and nights, he was not allowed to make a phone call, see an attorney, appear before a judge, or take a shower to wash off pepper spray and tear gas that the agents had used.”

The Washington Post reported on the Trump administration’s plans to reopen prisons and detention centers “that were closed by the federal government years ago over concerns about violence, medical neglect, and systemic understaffing.” Many are located in very remote rural areas, where hiring is challenging, requiring significant overtime, and oversight is difficult. The Atlantic’s Nick Miroff reported on the administration’s fascination with “megaprisons,” guided by a hope that the facilities’ cruel reputations might succeed in “scaring more immigrants into voluntarily self-deporting to their home countries.”

The U.S. military role

The Washington Post and CNN reported on potential morale issues among National Guard personnel deployed to Washington DC. (While President Trump has ostensibly sent the soldiers on a crime-fighting mission, their arrival coincided with the ICE-led migrant detention operations discussed above.) An Army survey of media attitudes about the Guard deployment, accidentally sent to the Post, noted that September 5 social media posts “were assessed to be 53 percent negative, 45 percent neutral and 2 percent positive,” and highlighted “Mentions of Fatigue, confusion, and demoralization—‘just gardening,’ unclear mission, wedge between citizens and the military.” A soldier anonymously told CNN, “We haven’t gotten critically low on morale, but we’re falling fast” as they remain away from jobs and families with little to do in the nation’s capital.

The Trump administration’s plan to use military lawyers as immigration judges is unlawful and “should raise all sorts of alarms,” three former U.S. military Judges Advocate General (JAGs) turned law professors told Ilya Somin of George Mason University Law School. At the Bulwark, Adrián Carrasquillo saw the proposal to transfer them to immigration courts on six-month missions as “an obvious effort to expedite removals.” Seven active-duty and reserve JAGs told the New York Times of their “concern that they would be expected to simply rubber-stamp deportations of migrants as the White House’s desired outcome.”

Public opinion

A local Times-Tribune report from Hazleton, Pennsylvania, one of the state’s three largest majority-Latino cities to vote for Donald Trump, finds residents “grappling with their decision” and objecting to arrests and deportations of undocumented immigrants without criminal records. Despite those misgivings, however, many “still largely stand by the president.”

Podcaster Derek Thompson, co-author of the bestseller Abundance, told Vox that, amid deportations and self-deportations, 2025 could be the first year in history to see a decline in the U.S. population. A shrinking immigrant labor force could hit critical economic sectors: “little in life is more fundamental than the right to food, shelter, and medicine. So, it’s pretty important that immigrants play a disproportionate role in each.”

The mass exit of employed immigrants could be masking a deeper weakness in the U.S. economy, the New York Times observed: their involuntary abandonment of paid jobs may be creating openings at the same time that employers are cutting back on other hiring.

At his newsletter, journalist and author Garrett Graff warned that ICE’s recent expansion and unleashing mark a fundamental shift in American democracy. “We have never in US history seen a federal law enforcement agency operate the way ICE has operated this summer—it marks the arrival of a new style of domestic policing” marked by prioritization of immigration goals alongside weakening of due process, oversight, and accountability.

At the New York Times, Sabrina Tavernise adopted a globally comparative view of ICE and other federal agents’ insistence on wearing masks to hide their identity. “In Russia in the 2000s, I thought of masking as a peculiar feature of a wobbly post-Soviet state. Over time it became clear that it was a harbinger of a new era,” she wrote. “I cannot think of a democratic country with a reliable rule of law where security forces mask themselves,” said Harvard University’s Steve Levitsky, co-author of How Democracies Die. “It just doesn’t happen.”

They are referred to as D.A., T.L., I.O., and D.S in court documents.
Ghana is planning to remove them to their countries of origin by Friday, according to court records.","WASHINGTON — A Friday lawsuit from a civil rights group accused the Trump administration of bypassing deportation restrictions on immigrants slated for removal by sending them to Ghana and having the West African nation deport them to their countries of origin, despite credible findings they could face harm there.

The move violates not only the due process rights of immigrants, but circumvents deportation restrictions placed by immigration judges who determined those immigrants could not be returned to their home country, attorneys from the Asian Americans Advancing Justice, wrote in their suit.

“Defendants know that they may not, consistent with U.S. immigration law, directly deport non-citizens to countries from which they have been granted fear-based protection,” according to the brief. “As an end-run around this prohibition, Defendants have enlisted the government of Ghana to do their dirty work.”

The Department of Homeland Security and government of Ghana did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.

Ghana President John Dramani Mahama confirmed to Business Insider Africa this week that the country struck a deal with the U.S. to accept a group of 14 deportees and send some back to their countries of origin.

The attorneys argued that immigration judges granted their five plaintiffs fear-based deportation protections to their home country under the Immigration Nationality Act and Convention Against Torture.

They are asking U.S District Judge Tanya Chutkan to require the return of the plaintiffs to the U.S.

Chutkan sits on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. She was appointed by former President Barack Obama.

The plaintiffs are nationals of Nigeria and The Gambia.

Third-country removals

A deportation protection, such as a ""withholding of removal,” doesn’t create blanket protections from removal. It requires the U.S. to find what is known as a third country that will accept the deportee.

Certain other requirements do apply. The government must notify the deportee of the country of removal and give them a chance to object if they fear persecution there.

The U.S. government must ensure that a third country that accepts a deportee won’t then conduct a removal to their home country, where U.S. immigration officials have found they could face harm.

The suit says that none of the plaintiffs were notified they would be removed to Ghana and instead they were placed on a U.S. military plane and none were given a credible fear interview of being sent to the West African country.

They were placed in straitjackets and remained on the plane for 16 hours, according to the suit.

The plaintiffs are referred to by initials in court documents.

One, referred to as K.S., “is hiding and fears for his life” in The Gambia.

K.S. was granted protections under the Convention Against Torture, a United Nations treaty, because he is bisexual and fears returning to The Gambia where he could face harm, according to court records. The Ghanaian government deported him to The Gambia on Wednesday, according to the suit.

Four others are detained in Ghana. They are referred to as D.A., T.L., I.O., and D.S in court documents.

Ghana is planning to remove them to their countries of origin by Friday, according to court records.

“The comments by U.S. officials on the plane on the way to Ghana, combined with news reports about Ghana’s involvement in a deal with the U.S. about repatriating non-citizens to their countries of origin in Africa, indicate that the U.S. is deporting people to Ghana with the intention that they be deported to their countries of origin,” according to the suit.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/2025-09/prettyman.jpg?h=9ce42887&itok=cjwvBeJ6,N,,2025-09-12 17:57:27.067366

It’s just one of many lawsuits California has filed against the Trump administration regarding the treatment of immigrants.
Many Californians, including those with legal status, are shying away from public services out of fear.","California’s soup kitchens, homeless shelters and preschools can continue to serve those without legal status, at least temporarily, according to a decision today by a U.S. district court judge in Rhode Island.

In July, four federal departments — Education, Justice, Health and Human Services and Labor — directed California to deny many immigrants access to federally funded public services, including health care, education and job training. The new policies apply to certain classes of immigrants, including those without legal status as well as those who have it, such as asylum seekers or those with student visas.

California quickly joined 20 other states and the District of Columbia in a lawsuit, arguing that the policy changes were illegal. The ruling today, which is a preliminary injunction, means that the federal government can’t enforce the new policies in these states until the lawsuit is decided, which could take months or years to resolve.

“With today’s decision, vital education, nutrition, and health programs like Head Start — and the families who rely on their services — can breathe a sigh of relief,” said state Attorney General Rob Bonta. Head Start offers free preschool to low-income children across the state.

“The Trump Administration continues to pull the rug out from under California families just trying to get by, but we’re fighting back,” he said. “We’re grateful that a District Court has put a stop to this cruel new directive while our litigation continues.”

The four federal departments said in July that the new policies were an effort to fulfill one of Trump’s executive orders, which claims that public benefits fuel “illegal immigration.” The executive order asks federal departments to ensure that “no taxpayer-funded benefits go to unqualified aliens.”

A lawyer for the Justice Department, Sean Skedzielewski, said the new policies also reflect the proper interpretation of federal law, despite the fact that the Justice Department has used a different interpretation for nearly 30 years.

In her written decision issuing the preliminary injunction, U.S. district judge Mary McElroy said she’s skeptical of Skedzielewski’s legal argument. “The (federal) Government argues that it has somehow interpreted this statute incorrectly for the nearly thirty years that it has been the law. In its view, everyone (from every past administration) has misunderstood it from the start—at least until last month, when the right way to read it became clear to the (federal) Government.”

McElroy wrote the new policies, which are now paused, would mean that “fewer people will get critical antipoverty resources due to immigrant communities avoiding services but also because, generally, people living in poverty at times lack government identification.”

Who qualifies for public benefits?

In 1996, Congress passed a law restricting most federally funded public benefits to U.S. citizens or those with certain legal statuses, such as a green card. Later, when clarifying the law, the federal government carved out certain exceptions.

Any person, regardless of their legal status, can access a crisis call center and any neglected or abused child can receive public assistance because these services are “necessary for the protection of life and safety,” according to federal guidance from 1996, which clarified the meaning of that year’s law. Homeless and domestic violence shelters, public hospitals and programs that support mental health or substance use recovery are also available to all.

As a result of a 1982 Supreme Court decision, the federal government allows all students under 18 years old, regardless of legal status, to attend public school. Immigrants without legal status are also able to access Head Start and to enroll in adult education classes, which include English as a second language and high school equivalency programs.

In Santa Clara County, which encompasses San Jose, roughly 40% of residents are foreign-born and more than half of all children in the county have a foreign-born parent. The county receives about $3.7 billion in federal funding each year, most of which supports its public hospital system, according to a court declaration by Greta Hanson, the chief operating officer of the county.

Verifying patients’ legal status isn’t feasible, she said, but even if it were, it would “have extremely detrimental impacts and deter individuals from seeking much needed care.” If an individual has a contagious disease but avoids seeking care, for example, they could jeopardize the health of their entire community.

Although the new policies went into effect in July, the health system has yet to turn away any patients. The states in the lawsuit and the four federal departments came to an agreement that they would delay enforcing the new policies until Sept. 11. Because of today’s preliminary injunction, it will now take months or years before the policies are enacted, and if the judge ultimately rules in favor of California, the policies may never take effect at all.

It’s just one of many lawsuits California has filed against the Trump administration regarding the treatment of immigrants. In an attempt to implement a different presidential executive order, which asked federal departments to stop “waste, fraud and abuse,” the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) asked California to share private data about people who receive food stamps.

In July, Democratic attorneys general, including California Attorney General Rob Bonta, sued the USDA, saying it’s an attempt to target mixed-status families, where U.S. citizens may have a non-citizen relative. California has also sued the Trump Administration over its deployment of the National Guard after federal immigration raids led to protests in Los Angeles this summer.

All told, California has sued or joined other states in suing the federal government roughly 40 times since the president’s inauguration. During the first Trump administration, California sued the president 123 times and won about two-thirds of those cases.

Many of the lawsuits filed this year have already led to preliminary injunctions, temporarily halting the Trump administration’s new policies, but advocates for immigrants say the president’s actions have had an impact nonetheless.

Many Californians, including those with legal status, are shying away from public services out of fear. Some are afraid to leave their house at all.

At an adult school in Huntington Beach, principal Steve Curiel said few immigrants are showing up for English-language classes this summer. He said he’s heard that other schools across the state are seeing the same trend.

U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement officials said that the man they were attempting to arrest ignored commands from federal agents and drove his car into an officer attempting to arrest him. The agent suffered multiple injuries and is in stable condition, according to an agency statement.

DHS said in a statement that the situation arose from an ""enforcement operation targeting a criminal illegal alien"" and that agents had ""conducted a vehicle stop to arrest"" the man.

""We are praying for the speedy recovery of our law enforcement officer. He followed his training, used appropriate force, and properly enforced the law to protect the public and law enforcement,"" said Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. ""Viral social media videos and activists encouraging illegal aliens to resist law enforcement not only spread misinformation, but also undermine public safety, as well as the safety of our officers and those being apprehended.""

The fatal shooting of Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez comes about a week into Operation Midway Blitz, a crackdown on immigration enforcement in the Chicago area ordered by President Donald Trump. The White House has said a crackdown is aimed at ""the worst of the worst"" criminal immigrants.

Villegas-Gonzalez’s known criminal background included a history of reckless driving, immigration officials said. Immigration officials said it was unclear how long he had been in the country.

Manuel Antonio Cardenas, a Chicago-area attorney who represented Villegas-Gonzalez in his traffic cases, is calling for a full investigation into the fatal shooting.

""His charges were all driving related; they were not violent crimes,"" Cardenas told USA TODAY. ""There should be a full investigation. The tactics that are being used by ICE are leading to situations that can result in the loss of life and injury to people.""

Cook County court records show Villegas-Gonzalez had traffic violations in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2019. Charges against him included driving nearly 40 mph over the speed limit, operating an uninsured vehicle and driving on the left side of the road.

Cardenas said that when he last represented Villegas-Gonzalez in 2019 his client worked in construction.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/12/USAT/86118450007-d-697-dab-710-ad-49-d-3-a-73-ebb-53190-b-54-e-8.jpg?crop=799,450,x0,y42&width=799&height=450&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-12 17:57:43.120016

Tensions escalated further as protesters and Ice officers began facing off directly.","A man was fatally shot during a vehicle stop on the outskirts of Chicago by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers after attempting to flee the scene, according to officials, and another officer was injured during the altercation.

Ice released the following statement after the shooting: “This morning in Chicago, Ice officers were conducting targeted local enforcement activity during a vehicle stop, the suspect resisted and attempted to drive his vehicle into the arrest team, striking an officer and subsequently dragging him as he fled the scene, fearing for his life, the officer discharged his firearm and struck the subject. Both the officer and subject immediately received medical treatment and were transferred to a local hospital.”

It continued: “The suspect was pronounced dead at the hospital, the officer sustained severe injuries and is in stable condition, viral social media videos and activists encouraging illegal aliens to resist law enforcement not only spread misinformation, but also undermine public safety, the safety of our officers and those being apprehended.”

The target of the stop in Franklin Park, to the west of Chicago, was Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, who was an undocumented immigrant with a history of reckless driving, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

“We are praying for the speedy recovery of our law enforcement officer. He followed his training, used appropriate force and properly enforced the law to protect the public and law enforcement,” said Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary. She then echoed the statement by Ice regarding the dangers of social media videos.

The incident was first reported on X by the CBS immigration correspondent Camilo Montoya-Galvez.

He wrote: “An Ice operation turned deadly in Chicago today, after a suspect resisted arrest and tried to drive his vehicle into agents, prompting an officer to shoot the suspect, who has been pronounced dead, a DHS official tells me. The officer suffered severe injuries but is stable.”

The incident involved a traffic stop to check on what Ice said was an undocumented immigrant. It happened about six miles from where, separately, a day-long protest had been unfolding outside an Ice processing center in Broadview, Illinois, where demonstrators clashed with federal government agents on Friday morning. There were reports a demonstrator was shot in the leg with a pepper ball by enforcement officers.

A worker at a tire shop across the street from where Villegas-Gonzales was killed spoke to BreakThrough News, according to the outlet, saying: “I thought it was your run-of-the-mill car crash, because car crashes have been here all the time, so I thought nothing of it. That’s when my boss came out and told me, ‘Hey, something happened here.’ And I saw a huge police presence, military presence and FBI presence.

“So right now, the community is a bit scared about Ice and the military operations here in Chicago,” he added. “Franklin Park is heavily Latino and Polish, so I didn’t know that they were going to come here one day. It’s just, once it happens, you’re in shock, like you can’t believe your eyes.”

He also provided reporters with security footage from outside the shop, which included audio of what sounds like gunshots.

Police taped off the area and behind patrol vehicles a grey sedan could be seen that the man had been driving. It had crashed into a parked truck, and it could be seen that the driver’s side window was open.

A video taken by a bystander and uploaded to Chitown Crimechasers on Facebook shows Ice agents trying to get into Villegas-Gonzalez’ car. Yanking the car handle and eventually breaking the glass and unlocking the car from the inside.

The Ice agent lays Villegas-Gonzalez’ body on the ground before dragging it to a nearby sidewalk. Another Ice agent joins and both are kneeling next to him. He is seen moving Villegas-Gonzalez’ legs before the video ends.

A neighbor who did not want to be identified spoke highly of Villegas-Gonzalez with a small group of reporters and mentioned that Villegas-Gonzalez was a hard worker and a good neighbor.

One time, the neighbor recalled, Villegas-Gonzalez scraped the neighbor’s car, came over and offered to fix it. The neighbor said it’s been distressing to see social media posts about Villegas-Gonzalez.

“It’s such a sickening world that everybody’s celebrating his death,” the neighbor said. It’s just wrong, you know? He’s a human being.”

When asked about Ice’s arrest of Villegas-Gonzalez and the agency having said Villegas-Gonzalez tried to drive into officers, the neighbor said Villegas-Gonzalez “was scared 100%” and didn’t speak English.

Meanwhile, in nearby Broadview, demonstrations began at dawn and were set to continue until the evening. By late morning, several dozen people had assembled outside the facility, according to CBS News Chicago.

These incidents and some others are part of a surge of immigration enforcement into parts of the Chicago area in the last week as part of a crackdown pledged by Donald Trump, as neighborhoods have braced. He has threatened to send in troops to deal with crime in the kind of unilateral action taken by the administration in WashingtonDC, ongoing, and Los Angeles earlier in the year following protests there against Ice raids.

This would be expressly against the wishes of Chicago’s mayor, Brandon Johnson, and the state governor, JB Pritzker, both Democrats, who have condemned the saber rattling and called for resistance. By Friday troops had not been sent.

The ruling came after Head Start associations in multiple states sued over the Trump change from this spring.

The directive “results in parents losing childcare, risking missed work, unemployment, forced dropouts, and inability to pay life expenses and support families,” Judge Ricardo Martinez said in his ruling.

The Hill has reached out to the Department of Health and Human Services, which runs the early childhood program from low-income families, for comment.

The ruling accompanied another lawsuit by Democratic attorneys general that challenged the policy and won a temporary injunction in their own states Thursday.

Head Start has faced a chaotic situation since the Trump administration’s directive and threats to take away federal money from the program.

“As Plaintiffs enumerate, this chilling effect results in the immediate harm of childhood education loss, disability support, dual language instruction, and stable learning environments, leading to long-term harms in development,” Martinez wrote in his ruling.

Those running Head Start programs were encouraged not to take action when the directive first came out due to all the confusion behind it.

“But I think an important point is that it has a chilling effect, regardless, and that if you’re [an] immigrant family, regardless of what your status is in terms of legal permanent residence, or mixed status family or refugee or whatever it is, you’re legitimately scared of sending your child to an Early Head Start or Head Start program,” Melissa Boteach, chief policy adviser for Zero to Three, previously told The Hill.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/school_classroom_teacher_arizona_10262022_GettyImages-1244462780.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-12 16:56:27.339778

ICE officers conducted a traffic stop in Franklin Park, Ill., to detain Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez on Friday morning. Villegas-Gonzalez allegedly resisted arrest and tried to flee the scene, dragging an ICE officer a “significant” distance with his car. The officer opened fire, fatally shooting the immigrant.

“We are praying for the speedy recovery of our law enforcement officer. He followed his training, used appropriate force and properly enforced the law to protect the public and law enforcement,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement Friday.

“Viral social media videos and activists encouraging illegal aliens to resist law enforcement not only spread misinformation, but also undermine public safety, as well as the safety of our officers and those being apprehended,” McLaughlin added.

An ICE spokesperson said both the officer and immigrant “immediately received medical treatment and were transferred to a local hospital.”

“The suspect was pronounced dead at the hospital,” the spokesperson added. “The officer sustained severe injuries and is in stable condition.”

The DHS said Villegas-Gonzalez, who the department said was a “criminal illegal” immigrant with a “history of reckless driving,” was the target of the enforcement operation.

Villegas-Gonzalez entered the U.S. at an “unknown date and time,” the DHS added.

The incident took place as President Trump’s administration is intensifying immigration enforcement in Chicago this week as part of the so-called Operation Midway Blitz.

Democratic state lawmakers have opposed federal intervention and at a press conference on Friday decried the traffic stop that resulted in the death of Villegas-Gonzalez.

“We need to find out exactly what happened here today. This is a perfect example of why we don’t need military action in this city,” Illinois House Speaker Emanuel Chris Welch (D) said. “This was an avoidable tragedy.”

“What happened today should never have happened. ICE’s tactics have led to a loss of life in our community. Trump has created this chaos,” State Rep. Norma Hernandez (D) told reporters. “We will not stand for the lawlessness of these ICE agents.”

Immigration advocates said they will ramp up local community trainings to prevent adverse interactions with law enforcement agents.

“The Trump deportation machine is out of control. We need to remain vigilant in our community,” said Lawrence Benito, executive director for the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. “ICE’s aggressive actions do not keep our community safe.”

The protest began at 7 a.m., and is scheduled to last until 7 p.m.

Protesters and agents clashed intermittently throughout the day. While agents have mostly stayed on facility property, at times groups of heavily armed officers have emerged from the entrance gates to push protesters back and allow vans carrying detainees in.

During those moments, protesters and agents have clashed. CBS News Chicago saw agents fire a couple of pepper balls into the protesters as well.

Uniformed officers have also been on the roof of the building, armed with long guns.

The demonstrators said the immigrant community is being unfairly targeted. They have chalked the street outside the facility with messages including ""America was built by immigrants"" and ""Love thy neighbor.""

""It is my duty to use my privilege to try to connect those who are most vulnerable,"" said Francis, a protester who did not want to share her last name. ""And I'm here to show that it is inhumane to be snatching people off the streets and using this office building as a detention facility. These are human beings, and we need to show our support and solidarity with them in getting ice out of Chicago and out of our streets.""

A single counterprotester is also at the facility, carrying an American flag.

He said he's here to promote peace and stand up for ICE agents, who he has heard are getting death threats.

Officers will see the headline, not the nuance, and interpret this as a green light to profile Latino communities across the country.
It is an American tradition, one that resurfaces whenever politicians and courts give law enforcement permission to indulge it.
Real safety requires trust between communities and law enforcement.
Information-sharing with local police is routine, which means the culture of profiling will bleed into local law enforcement, spreading fear even further.","Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court quietly made one of the most dangerous immigration rulings in decades. In a 6-3 decision in Noem v. Vasquez-Perdomo, the Court used its “shadow docket” to lift a lower court ban on ICE’s “roving patrols” in Los Angeles.

What does that mean in plain language? This means that ICE agents now have the legal cover to stop, question, and detain people based on appearance, language, accent, workplace, or any other marker that “looks suspicious” to them. In other words, the Court just gave its blessing to racial profiling on a massive scale—and they did it without a full briefing or hearing and without explaining their reasoning.

This is not just about undocumented immigrants. This is about every Latino in this country—citizen, resident, or otherwise—who now has to wonder if going to work, speaking Spanish, or standing outside a Home Depot makes them a target. And if the history of racial profiling in this country tells us anything, it’s that law enforcement will almost always lean on the “easiest” factor—skin color, accent, or language—rather than a combination of subtle clues. The Court knows this, and it green-lit it anyway.

The way the Court issued this ruling makes it even more dangerous. It wasn’t through a full hearing or a published majority opinion. The ruling was issued on the “shadow docket,” a process for issuing procedural orders and deciding rare emergency requests for relief but increasingly used to decide major issues—abortion, voting rights, and now immigration profiling.

Unlike cases on the “merits docket,” shadow docket rulings bypass the transparency of full briefing from the parties and oral arguments, and the accountability of written explanations. Without reasoning, there’s no clear legal guidance for lower courts or law enforcement. That vagueness is the point. It allows agents to abuse power while hiding behind the ambiguity of the Court’s silence. Officers will see the headline, not the nuance, and interpret this as a green light to profile Latino communities across the country. When justice is delivered in the dark, rights disappear in the daylight.

The Fourth Amendment is supposed to protect all of us from unreasonable searches and seizures. Immigration enforcement has always lived in a gray zone where “reasonable suspicion” was enough to trigger an investigation. Reasonable suspicion was never supposed to mean race, accent, or the neighborhood you’re standing in. But this ruling opens the door for exactly that.

In his concurring opinion, Justice Kavanaugh even wrote that ICE can consider those factors in combination, as if law enforcement officers don’t already default to race alone when given permission. His argument that people will be fine as long as they carry identification shows a profound detachment from reality. How many of us walk around with a passport, a birth certificate, or even a Social Security card? And even if we did, what prevents ICE from detaining or assaulting someone before they get the chance to show it?

That is exactly what happened to Jason Gavidia, a U.S. citizen born in Los Angeles, who was thrown against a fence and assaulted by ICE agents despite screaming that he was an American. They confiscated his ID and never gave it back. Next time he’s stopped, what proof does he have left? Kavanaugh doesn’t have to worry about being profiled. His race, class, and position shield him. His arguments ignore the reality for millions of people who do not share his privilege.

And we have seen this all before. Arizona’s “Show Me Your Papers” law created open season for Sheriff Joe Arpaio to harass Latinos on nothing more than skin color and accent. New York City’s stop-and-frisk program turned Black and Latino men into daily suspects until courts declared it unconstitutional. Japanese Americans were interned en masse based solely on ancestry. Slave patrols once prowled for free Black people, re-enslaving them on the presumption they “must” be runaways. Racial profiling is not an aberration. It is an American tradition, one that resurfaces whenever politicians and courts give law enforcement permission to indulge it.

Justice Sotomayor understood this when she wrote her dissent. She warned that ICE should never be allowed to stop people just for being Latino. She called the ruling a betrayal of constitutional values and a dangerous normalization of discrimination. She knows that the so-called “combination of factors” argument is just a slippery slope toward the same abuses we have always seen. She knows that this decision will not just sweep up undocumented immigrants but citizens and permanent residents alike. And she knows that once law enforcement is trained to see a community as suspect, that stigma does not disappear—it spreads and infects every part of policing.

Some people will dismiss this case as “just about immigration,” but they are wrong. This ruling destabilizes public safety itself. Real safety requires trust between communities and law enforcement. When entire neighborhoods fear that an accent, a workplace, or a face is enough to trigger detention, cooperation evaporates. Victims and witnesses stop calling 911. Families stop reporting crimes. Neighborhoods retreat inward, not because they don’t care about safety, but because the police have made it unsafe to come forward. ICE does not act alone. Information-sharing with local police is routine, which means the culture of profiling will bleed into local law enforcement, spreading fear even further.

The Supreme Court knows how unpopular racial profiling is when exposed to daylight. That is why they buried this case in the shadow docket, why there was no full hearing, and why there was no majority opinion. They know that if people truly understood what had been decided, the outrage would be overwhelming. Instead, they normalized it quietly, trusting that the next election cycle and the next culture-war distraction would keep most people from noticing.

But we cannot afford to look away. This is not the final word—cases will continue, advocates will fight, communities will resist. But we need to be clear-eyed about what just happened. The Court sent a message to ICE: you are free to profile. And unless we push back, ICE agents will take that freedom and run with it, in Los Angeles, in Chicago, in Queens, and beyond. The question now is not just what ICE will do with this ruling—it is what we will do in response.

Will we accept a country where Latino citizens are forced to prove their citizenship on demand? Where language, accent, or workplace can be turned into suspicion? Where the Constitution bends depending on who you are and how you look? Or will we demand a country where rights are not contingent on appearance, where law enforcement cannot terrorize communities under the excuse of “reasonable suspicion”?

But leaked GlobalX and detention data indicates the Alexandria facility remains Ice’s primary deportation hub.","He arrived in Alexandria exhausted and sick.

It was early April, and Amilcar Lisser-Posadas – shackled at his hands and feet – had been transferred from a nearby immigration detention center to this remote US immigration facility in Louisiana. He feared it would be his last stop before deportation.

He remembered the stench of the place. The packed jail rooms where hundreds of men were warehoused together with little access to showers, which sometimes spouted brown, rusty water – when they worked.

The 29-year-old, a father of two young daughters who are US citizens, had come to the US from Honduras and had previously been protected under the Obama-era program known as Daca (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), which halted deportation for many undocumented people who arrived in the US as children. He had entered as a nine-year-old but his Daca protection had lapsed.

In March, Lisser-Posadas was apprehended by police in Shelby county, Tennessee, for driving with an expired license and was turned over to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). He had no prior criminal record. For four weeks he was moved around various Ice detention centers. He filed a legal request to Ice for permission to remain in the country, citing fears of targeted violence in Honduras. He received no response.

The Alexandria Staging Facility – as it is formally called – was “just not a place for human beings”, he said in a phone interview.

The isolated, Ice staging facility in rural central Louisiana has emerged as a hub of the Trump administration’s deportation machine. The center, which has operated since 2014, is run by the private corrections giant Geo Group. It is considered a “black hole”, by many lawyers, advocates and former detainees interviewed by the Guardian. Living conditions are deplorable, many former detainees have alleged, and there is almost no legal access to the center.

A four-month Guardian US investigation into the Alexandria facility has revealed a pattern of alleged due process violations, previously unreported accounts of neglect and abuse, documented health emergencies and long stays, despite the center’s intended use as a short-term detention facility. It also found that the facility adopted a temporary and unexplained change to normal medical standards earlier this year that protect detainees’ welfare. Reporters relied on court documents, public records, internal Department of Homeland Security (DHS) statistics, 911 calls and interviews with 10 people either formerly detained or deported from the Alexandria facility, or those with loved ones held there.

The investigation also reviewed leaked flight manifests from Ice’s largest airline contractor, Global Crossings (GlobalX). They underscore the critical role the Alexandria facility, which is within the grounds of a small regional airport, has played in Ice’s mission of rapidly transferring and deporting hundreds of thousands of immigrants. The data, which covers roughly 100 days from Donald Trump’s second inauguration, shows that more than 20,000 migrant detainees passed through the Alexandria airport on Ice charters operated by the carrier at a rate of almost 200 a day.

“Louisiana is where people go to be disappeared,” said Nora Ahmed, legal director of the ACLU of Louisiana. “My concern about the Alexandria facility is [that] it is a black box.”

Visitors are not permitted, and it is the kind of place where mistakes can happen, giving officials “a convenient excuse to wrongly deport people”, Ahmed added.

“The only way to stop that is for people to have access to attorneys.”

In response to the Guardian’s findings, the DHS assistant secretary, Tricia McLaughlin, did not address specific questions but said in a statement: “Any claim that there are inhumane conditions at Ice detention centers are false. Ice has higher detention standards than most US prisons that hold actual US citizens.”

She added: “All detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with lawyers and their family members.”

A spokesperson for Geo Group also did not respond to specific questions, but said in a statement that the company was “proud” of the role it had played for over 40 years “to support the law enforcement mission” of Ice.

The statement added that all the company’s “support services” were monitored by Ice and the DHS to ensure “strict compliance” with the agency’s detention standards. When issues are identified by Ice, a company spokesperson said they were “quickly” resolved.

The Alexandria staging facility is supposed to be a short-term center that holds detainees for a maximum of 72 hours. It has a 400-person capacity, and detains only men. It is divided into four large shared rooms holding about 80 people and a separate cell block.

But the center is routinely holding people for longer than the three-day maximum, a Guardian review of anonymized immigration enforcement data reveals. Of the more than 28,000 people who were detained in Alexandria from January 2025 until late July, 20% were held longer than 72 hours. Since October 2023, analysis shows that 742 people have been held there for 10 days or more.

While immigration detention standards are not uniform, centers detaining people for longer than 72 hours are generally required to provide more services – ranging from personal hygiene to recreation to legal visitation rights – than those designated as short-term.

“What this analysis tells us is that there is a requirement for the government to provide 24-hour attorney access at this facility forthwith,” said Ahmed of the ACLU of Louisiana. “It is clearly not a short-term facility any more, if it ever was one.”

Lisser-Posadas was one of those held for an extended period.

He was detained in Alexandria for about 12 days, according to a family member who remained in contact with him throughout, and a review of dated Ice detainee locator screenshots. He described routine lockdowns and a lack of food. He was unable to change his clothes or underwear. He arrived in Alexandria with chest congestion, a fever and an ear infection that worsened over time. He received no medication until the last two days of his stay, he said.

Medical care at the facility is provided by Ice’s health service corps, which is a part of the agency’s enforcement and removals operation.

Lisser-Posadas remembered asking Geo Group guards repeatedly for an update on the status of his legal request to remain in the country.

“I was trying to make sure that I got an explanation. Why I was being brought there? Why they wanted to deport me? Why they were holding me there for so many days?”

Instead, he said, one staff member, a detention lieutenant, looked at him through a secure window. “She would look at me straight, and then start laughing,” he recalled.

Eventually, after staging a small protest by refusing to return to his cell, Lisser-Posadas was moved back to another Louisiana facility in the nearby town of Jena for about four days. He was then brought back to Alexandria and quickly deported to Honduras on a series of GlobalX flights that left Louisiana at 6am on 23 April. His request for deferred removal citing fear of persecution was never resolved.

“My heart broke,” he said. “I saw kids [on the plane], some were still in their school uniform. They were being deported with their families. There were pregnant women as well.”

The leaked flight records confirm there were eight children under the age of 16 booked on the same plane.

Lisser-Posadas spoke to the Guardian from a federal prison where he was being held after he was apprehended at the southern border trying to re-enter the US in May to reunite with his family. He is now facing deportation again.

The Alexandria staging facility is operated under the performance-based national detention standards, an extensive set of guidelines designed to ensure a “safe and secure detention environment for staff and detainees”. The standards reflect that immigration detention is designed to be non-punitive as it relates to civil rather than criminal charges.

Alexandria has been found deficient in a number of these standards, according to a review of Ice inspection reports from 2022 onwards, including specific shortcomings over medical care and the use of force.

But because the standards are not legally binding, deficiencies rarely lead to meaningful consequences.

The facility was inspected by Ice in February this year – the first such examination in Trump’s second term.

A contract seen by the Guardian, agreed between Ice and the local district authority, shows the site was granted a special waiver four days before the DHS inspectors arrived, which absolved it of certain medical screening standards. The standard – which states that all detainees must receive a medical, dental and mental health intake screening as soon as possible, but no later than 12 hours after their arrival at a detention facility – was waived from 21 February to 22 May, according to the contract.

The document notes “there shall be no public disclosures regarding this agreement” without approval by Ice and offers no rationale for the decision.

John Roth, the DHS inspector general between 2013 and 2017, described the revelation as “highly troubling for the population of detainees there”.

“The reason they wrote the performance-based standards is partly to avoid constitutional challenges on the conditions of confinement,” Roth said. “To the extent you are deviating from that in any way, you run into trouble.”

The DHS declined to provide a comment on Roth’s statement.

Alexandria passed the February inspection without any deficiencies. Inspectors with the DHS’s office of professional responsibility noted in their report that 13 detainees had been interviewed who all “reported satisfaction with facility services”.

Roth argued the facility should face an immediate independent audit, describing the most recent inspection as holding “no validity because there is no detail behind it”.

A review of 911 calls, released by local emergency authorities, reveals that the facility has seen a spike in emergency call-outs since 2023, under the Biden administration. This year, between January and the end of May, there was an average of more than two 911 calls per month, a rate that – if it persists – would put 2025 on track as the year with the most calls in recent history. On 19 March, a staff member frantically called 911 to report a detainee had attempted to hang themselves. “We need an ambulance, emergency ASAP,” says a panicked staffer at the facility. “What’s going on in there?” Another person can be heard shouting in the background. Five days earlier the center called to report a man with a history of stroke had passed out. Next month, the facility called requesting an ambulance for a detainee with low oxygen and high heart rate. In May, a call was made after an apparent episode of self-harm.

McLaughlan, the DHS assistant secretary, said: “It is a longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters Ice custody. This is the best healthcare that many aliens have received in their entire lives.”

She added: “The Alexandria Staging Facility is in strict accordance with its National Detention Standards (NDS) to ensure the safety, security, and humane treatment of individuals in custody.”

The Alexandria facility began operations over a decade ago, costing about $20m to construct, at the end of a deportations peak during Barack Obama’s second term. Louisiana now detains more migrants per capita than any state in the US. The facility, one of nine privately operated centers, sits as the effective nucleus in the middle of “detention alley”, the network of remote immigration detention centres that stretch between Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.

Geo Group, which manages the Alexandria facility, donated $1m to a Trump supporting political action committee during the 2024 election. Its CEO predicted the new administration’s mass deportation agenda could increase revenue by an additional $400m annually. It was reported in May that Trump’s hard-right border czar, Tom Homan, was a paid consultant for Geo Group before joining the administration. A White House spokesperson has said Homan abides by “the highest ethical standards”.

The former acting head of Ice, Todd Lyons, has said the administration wanted to turn Trump’s deportation machine into “[Amazon] prime, but with human beings”. It has already begun attempting to replicate Alexandria’s functionality in other states, with new detention centers in Florida and Texas constructed in close proximity to runways. But leaked GlobalX and detention data indicates the Alexandria facility remains Ice’s primary deportation hub. On 21 July 2025, the facility saw its highest detained population since 2023, with nearly 500 people held there – almost 100 people above its stated capacity.

A spokesperson for Geo Group did not dispute the Guardian’s findings on capacity numbers but said that the company’s facilities “are never overcrowded”.

The detention center is set within the grounds of a second world war-era airpark, once an air force base, and now a minor regional airport complex that sees a small handful of commercial flights each day. In July, the Guardian observed from a third-floor observation deck inside a red-bricked terminal building as a cluster of large Ice charter jets landed in quick succession and taxied towards the detention center out of public view.

Although the entrance to the center is situated on a restricted road, the site is partially surrounded by an 18-hole golf course. From the vantage point of the 13th hole, a reporter observed as dozens of shackled detainees, including a line of young women, were driven on to the tarmac in minibuses and escorted under guard to a queue of six planes. The asphalt shimmered in the searing heat and many bent their heads as they walked towards their flights. Golfers teed off just a few hundred feet away.

Of the 39 Ice flights that day, 23 July, over half either departed or landed in Alexandria, according to tracking data shared with the Guardian by the immigration advocate Tom Cartwright, highlighting its centrality to the mass deportation agenda.

Baldomero Orozco-Juarez, an immigrant community leader and father of one, remembered taking a similar walk across the tarmac when he was deported in the early hours of 14 May 2025.

He had been arrested by Ice less than 24 hours earlier and driven at extraordinary speed from Carthage, Mississippi, 250 miles to Alexandria – the sole passenger in the back of a government SUV.

He repeatedly asked staff in Alexandria to call his family or a lawyer, but was denied telephone access, he claimed. Emails reviewed by the Guardian confirm he was deported before his lawyer could find him. Although facing a removal order, Orozco-Juarez held a valid work permit and a pending legal application to remain in the US.

“They made us walk slowly,” he said in a phone interview from Guatemala. “They just laughed. Laughed at the way we walked. The way we got on the plane. They treated us so badly.”

His attorney, Jeremy Jong, described the deportation as “a targeted kidnapping”.

“And I would ask: is this the system that we want? Where someone can be deported in the middle of the night, without access to their lawyer.” Jong added. “Is that a system that treats everyone with dignity and respect?”

Badar Khan Suri remembered landing in Alexandria with little comprehension of where he was.

He was marched single file in shackles from a jet parked about 50 meters from the detention center and held in a waiting area lined with metal benches for over an hour. He claimed in an interview that a security guard forcefully spread his legs and punched him in the ankles as they eventually removed his restraints and took him to a cell block.

Leaked flight manifests confirm Suri was flown to the staging facility on 18 March 2025 on a packed GlobalX flight from Richmond, Virginia, in mid-afternoon.

Suri, an Indian postdoctoral fellow at Georgetown University in the US on a valid academic research visa, was one of a group of immigrant students targeted by the Trump administration for their criticism of Israel’s war in Gaza. He had been arrested in Virginia, detained, and then flown over a thousand miles to Louisiana without the ability to contact a lawyer or his family.

He was held in Alexandria for three days, inside a windowless cell under rolling lockdown, which intensified his claustrophobia and panic. He said he could not recall speaking to a government representative for his entire time in Alexandria and was given no official answers about why he had been detained or where he was being sent. He feared deportation at any moment.

He had not been fully processed into Ice detention, he said, and so was unable to use a phone within his cell block for longer than 20 seconds. He would ring his family back in Virginia at regular intervals and hear their panicked voices, but they were unable to hear him speak as his line was muted, he said.

“I was able to hear my wife’s voice, my children in the background. But they never responded to my call,” he said. “‘Who is there? Can you hear me?’ they would say. And if I wasn’t able to connect to them, I would think: ‘What has happened? Maybe someone has also taken them away too.’”

The staging facility has no space for confidential legal calls, no visitation capacity, or attorney client meeting room, according to multiple attorneys who have visited the center on Ice approved tours. Lawyers who have tried contacting clients held in Alexandria have said the only way to do so is to directly contact the Ice field office director for the entire region to facilitate a phone call.

Ice’s national detention standards on telephone access state detainees and legal counsel should “be able to communicate effectively with each other” and that privacy for legal phone calls “shall be ensured”.

Geo Group said it provides “in-person and virtual legal visitation”, but declined to comment on Alexandria specifically.

Suri’s immigration attorney Hassan Ahmad confirmed he was eventually able to contact him via the Ice field office director. The phone call was brief and the two spoke in Urdu as Ahmad “couldn’t be assured of confidentiality” and could hear an Ice officer present in the background.

Suri was transferred from Alexandria by van to a detention center in Alvarado, Texas, the next day. Eventually, on 14 May, he was released and continues to fight his immigration case back in Virginia. It was the same day that Orozco-Juarez was removed from the US.

“This [center] should not exist,” said Suri. “There should be detention centers with due process.

“At that time [in Alexandria], I realized there is nothing called rights. It was a real black hole. A real disgrace.”

He continued: “Who are the people detained there? Those people are married to American citizens. They have American children. They are an integral part of American society.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2de4ab980efb18c5541f5f95f2224a4efd5d8a70/0_1032_2400_1920/master/2400.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=22bce75bb2643a0b7081b0c768509ff1",N,,2025-09-12 17:57:48.060536

Everett Mayor Carlo DeMaria said it was supposed to be a day of celebration. ""Those who were going to be cooking for us, the food, the restaurants and the entertainment, just felt very uncomfortable,"" Mayor DeMaria said.

""Everybody gets excited to have one month to celebrate the beauty of Latin America. The colors, the flavors, and rhythms,"" said Veronica Robles, executive director of the Veronica Robles Cultural Center.

Earlier this month, ICE began targeting Massachusetts with another immigration crackdown called ""Patriot 2.0."" The Justice Department has sued neighboring Boston over its ""sanctuary city"" policies and the city's refusal to cooperate with immigration enforcement.

""We believe it would not be right to hold a celebration at a time when members of our community may not feel safe attending,"" the city of Everett said.

Homeland Security said the ""Patriot 2.0"" operation would ""target the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens"" in the state. However, advocates for local immigrant groups have said that the people they serve are scared.

DeMaria said the decision came after a local resident posted a video online showing ICE agents at Rivergreen Park, where the event was scheduled to be held. ""I guess they were using that as a spot to meet,"" DeMaria said.

DeMaria said he was assured by ICE officials that they would not have been in the city on the date of the festival, but with the number of cancellations they received, there would not be enough vendors to have the event.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/09/12/a072dc25-2aee-453c-910f-926921fec259/thumbnail/1200x630/96ef55e94fe2d3ed07d410a8c4a33c5a/everett-ice.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 18:57:24.296561

Yet that pledge didn’t exempt South Korea from the machinations of Trump’s mass deportation campaign.
It wasn’t even so much that the South Korean workers were detained — it was how they were detained.","On Thursday afternoon, a Korean Air flight carrying more than 300 South Korean workers who’d been previously detained by U.S. immigration officials left Atlanta for South Korea. The flight ended a weeklong diplomatic tussle between the United States and the South Korean government that began when ICE officials raided a Hyundai-LG battery factory in Savannah, Georgia, and arrested nearly 500 people including hundreds of South Korean nationals.

The Trump administration’s obsessive focus on mass deportations is undermining its larger political agenda.

The ICE raid, which came just 11 days after President Donald Trump sat down with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, is having far-reaching implications — and is a glaring example of how the Trump administration’s obsessive focus on mass deportations is undermining its larger political agenda.

Homeland Security officials boasted that the Hyundai raid was the “largest single-site enforcement operation” in the agency’s history. But, not surprisingly, in South Korea the detentions were met with outrage from across the country’s political spectrum.

South Korea is reportedly the largest foreign direct investor in the United States and the country’s sixth largest trading partner. As part of a recently reached trade deal, South Korea agreed to invest $350 billion in the U.S. to help revitalize the country’s manufacturing sector.

Yet that pledge didn’t exempt South Korea from the machinations of Trump’s mass deportation campaign.

It wasn’t even so much that the South Korean workers were detained — it was how they were detained. ICE officials released videos of the workers with shackles on their arms and feet. “Is this any way for the US to treat an ally?” asked the left-leaning South Korean news outlet Hankyoreh, while the country’s most prominent conservative outlet, Chosun Ilbo, labeled the raid a “merciless arrest operation … that cannot happen between allies.”

These were workers with visas that allowed them to be in the United States, but the ICE videos made it appear that they were nothing more than common criminals. In fact, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Seoul’s foreign ministry said the Trump administration wanted to transport the workers in handcuffs but yielded when South Korea objected that they weren’t criminals.

President Lee has suggested that the raid is creating a “very confusing” situation for Korean companies and may lead some to question whether they should be doing business in the United States.

That’s already happening. Korean companies are freezing travel to the United States and recalling staff over concerns about new raids.

But of far greater significance, South Korean businesses have suspended at least 22 U.S. projects in the United States, many of them geared toward opening new manufacturing facilities.

South Korean engineering companies are frequently hired by American companies to set up new manufacturing facilities because it can be difficult to find American workers with the necessary skills.

But once that initial work is done, U.S. employees work the factory floors. The Hyundai-LG facility in Georgia is supposed to employ 8,500 workers. Now, all of that is on hold. Multiply that disruption across nearly two dozen factories, and potentially hundreds of thousands of new manufacturing jobs could be affected.

Korean companies are freezing travel to the United States and recalling staff over concerns about new raids.

Part of the challenge for South Korean companies is that they have struggled to get long-term visas for their employees to enter and work in the United States. Indeed, many of those who were picked up may have been bending visa rules, but rather than look for ways to resolve this issue, the Trump administration sent ICE in.

According to a spokesman for the South Korean foreign ministry, since Trump’s inauguration, it reached out 52 times to administration officials regarding visas for highly skilled workers — but to no avail.

According to Jenny Town, director of the Korea program at the Stimson Center, a think tank in Washington, “the longer this situation goes on, the less likely [South Korean] companies will want to bring their employees into the United States. It’s completely self-defeating for what the Trump administration has been lobbying other countries to do as far as investing in the U.S.”

While the repatriation of the South Korean workers is an essential first step, the Trump administration is making little effort to smooth things over with Seoul. When the South Korean foreign minister met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio earlier this week, the State Department readout made no mention of the LG raid. Kristi Noem, the secretary of Homeland Security, even went so far as to claim that the raid is “a great opportunity for us to make sure that all companies are reassured that when you come to the United States, you’ll know what the rules of the game are.”

Suffice it to say, that is not the view in South Korea. It’s not hard to imagine that other countries looking to invest in the United States will look at what happened in Georgia and decide that the risk to their workers is not worth it.

But there are also larger political implications as well. According to Town, polling in South Korea ahead of the Trump-Lee summit showed little public support for the trade deal with the United States, with many asking, “What does South Korea get out of it?” Those views have metastasized since the LG raid. These events put “greater and greater pressure on Lee’s presidency,” said Town, “and give him less political space to address the U.S. bilateral relationship.” Moreover, the U.S. is South Korea’s largest foreign direct investment destination. “Much of that,” says Town, “may be in jeopardy.”

The Trump administration is making little effort to smooth things over with Seoul.

Or more directly, the Trump administration’s moves to increase manufacturing jobs are taking a back seat to the laser-like focus on deporting as many people as possible. It’s hard to separate the zealousness of the LG-Hyundai raid from the White House diktat, per deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, that ICE meet a quota of three thousand arrests a day.

In fact, Tori Branum, a MAGA congressional candidate in Georgia, is taking credit for tipping off ICE about the alleged issues at the LG-Hyundai plant. For wannabe MAGA politicians, pointing the finger at potential immigration violations takes precedence over the creating jobs and growing the economy.

This is the political bind in which Trump and his supporters have put themselves. They have placed mass deportation at the top of the president’s agenda and seem utterly indifferent to the consequences of that decision. It’s bad enough that ICE is creating a climate of fear across America — though that’s not something that upsets the White House. But the obsessive focus on a never-ending cycle of deportations is undermining one of the country’s key bilateral relationships and undercutting Trump’s stated aim of rebuilding American manufacturing.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250908-hyundai-plant-vl-117p-c91063.jpg",N,,2025-09-12 18:57:28.628998

Despite the long-standing policy and practice of USCIS to allow corrections for deficient signatures, USCIS has shifted its approach.
There are multiple reasons USCIS should restore the cure to deficient signatures: There is lack of clarity on the USCIS signature requirement.
USCIS has historically allowed a petitioner or beneficiary to correct a deficient signature when USCIS deems a signature deficient during the adjudication process.
The Covid-era requirement to retain an original was not carried forward in the updated guidance in the USCIS Policy Manual.","Unlike most federal agencies, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has not transitioned to electronic filing on a widespread basis, but still relies heavily on paper-based filings for most petitions involving work authorization, extension of legal status, and permanent residence. For these paper-based filings, USCIS does not allow electronic signatures such as DocuSign or other electronic services that allow a person to type a name or accept terms which then inserts a script font signature on the document. Instead, USCIS requires a handwritten signature, consistent with how a person signs their name.

USCIS has long recognized that a signature on immigration petitions does not have to be legible, in English, or in cursive so long as it is handwritten1. Also, the USCIS policy has historically recognized that the regulations do not require an “original” or “wet ink” signature on a petition, although in practice USCIS was inconsistent, often requiring original signatures for some petitions but not others2. With the emergence of remote work during the Covid-era, USCIS began universally accepting reproduced copies of signatures for “all benefit petitions.”

Recently there has been an increase in denials, preceded by USCIS issuing a Request for Evidence or Notice of Intent to Deny where USCIS has requested “the original signed document…..that consists of the original wet signature3”. However, these requests are less about USCIS not accepting “scanned” copies of the signed forms and more about USCIS’ interpretation of “handwritten” signatures. Specifically, USCIS requests the “original” form signed by a party to determine whether the person wrote their signature directly on the form or instead applied their handwritten signature.

When a petitioner cannot produce the form with the original handwritten signature directly on the form, the USCIS has denied such petitions, concluding that a handwritten signature that a petitioner digitally “affixes” to a form is not comparable to a petitioner handwriting the signature directly on the form. Even when a petitioner submits replacement pages with a newly-signed original handwritten signature, along with a sworn statement affirming that the original filing contained their signature and they agreed to the petition’s contents, USCIS has still refused to accept it as sufficient to prevent denial.

Unfortunately, a denied case can have severe consequences. While some parties may refile a case by resubmitting a new petition and repaying the filing fees, others have no recourse because of missed deadlines. Even cases where refiling is possible, the consequences can be severe: a foreign national losing employment authorization or valid status. Although those affected by USCIS denials based solely on technical signature issues may seek legal action in court, the real solution lies with USCIS to ensure fairness to the public and avoid additional administrative burden for the agency.

The problem behind the increase in denials based upon signatures is USCIS’s refusal to allow a party to correct alleged signature deficiencies during the adjudication process. This action contradicts long-standing USCIS policy and practice.

In 2016 USCIS issued the “first formal written guidance on the meaning of the regulatory requirement with respect to signatures4”. Among other things, that guidance recognized a distinction between signatures which USCIS deemed deficient upon intake compared to signatures USCIS deemed deficient during adjudication. Thus, USCIS announced its policy that USCIS would reject a petition and return it to the person with the refunded fees; however, if the USCIS had reason to question a signature after a case is accepted for processing, USCIS may ask the person to sign the petition. This recognized that impact of a denied case: non-refundable filing fees, lost time, and personal consequences such as loss of status, employment authorization, and eligibility for certain immigration options.

Despite the long-standing policy and practice of USCIS to allow corrections for deficient signatures, USCIS has shifted its approach. USCIS is referencing updated guidance in the USCIS policy manual which states, “USCIS does not provide an opportunity to correct (or cure) a deficient signature.5” Although that statement in the updated Policy Manual immediately follows the sentence about USCIS rejecting petitions at the time of filing, where fees are fully refunded, USCIS has extended that interpretation to cases where it determines a signature is deficient while adjudicating a petition that has been pending for months or even years.

The solution to the current uptick in denials for deficient signatures is simple: USCIS should reinstate its longstanding policy and practice allowing a party to correct deficient signatures. This would ensure otherwise meritorious cases are not denied solely for technical errors, subjective interpretations, or confusion about the signature requirement.

There are multiple reasons USCIS should restore the cure to deficient signatures:

There is lack of clarity on the USCIS signature requirement. Beginning with Covid-19 and the transition to remote-work, USCIS began accepting reproduced copies of signatures for all petitions6. Some interpreted “reproduced copies of signatures” to mean that a handwritten signature could be reproduced and affixed on a form, whereas USCIS apparently intends it to mean only that a form can be reproduced after a petitioner handwrites their signature directly on the form. Assuming arguendo that USCIS is correct, it’s reasonable for the public to be confused about the meaning of reproduced copies of signatures especially since the USCIS Regulations, the binding authority on signatures, simply state the signature must be “handwritten”, not that it has to be handwritten directly on the form.

The USCIS stance on signatures is more stringent than courts. Courts in the U.S. generally accept electronic signatures because federal laws like the E-Sign Act and state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA) give electronic signatures the same legal effect as pen-to-paper or “original” signatures7. In contrast, the USCIS does not allow electronic signature services such as DocuSign, which is why some petitioners who work remotely or otherwise don’t have easy access to a printer and scanner have resorted to handwriting their name and digitally affixing it to a form when needed.

The USCIS stance on signatures is more stringent than other federal immigration agencies. The Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR) allows handwritten, digital, and electronic signatures on all documents filed with an immigration court or the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), regardless of whether the filing is by mail, in person, or electronically. The EOIR Policy states that a signature can be a “reproduction of the signer’s handwritten signature.""8 Similarly, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) allows both electronic signatures and reproduced copies of a handwritten signature for Form I-20 and Form I-983, documents related to legal status and work authorization of international students. The ICE policy guidance includes “reproduced copies of a signature,” meaning “a digitally reproduced copy may be a scanned image of a physical signature.” These same forms, I-20 and I-983, are included in immigration petitions with USCIS as evidence of a foreign student’s legal status.

The ability to correct a deficient signature has been long-standing USCIS policy. USCIS has historically allowed a petitioner or beneficiary to correct a deficient signature when USCIS deems a signature deficient during the adjudication process. This policy was memorialized in USCIS Policy Memorandum in 2016, recognizing that an ability to cure does not apply to petitions rejected in the USCIS mailroom and returned to petitioners with a refund, but does apply when USCIS questions a signature in the course of adjudicating a pending application.

The ability to correct a deficient signature has been long-standing USCIS practice. For almost a decade since the USCSI written policy to allow a party to correct a signature during adjudication, USCIS followed that practice. USCIS issued countless requests for evidence and notice of intent to deny requesting the petitioner or beneficiary to “create replacement pages and submit with the original signatures.”

The ability to cure a deficient signature during the adjudication process is equitable. Under current USCIS practice, USCIS timely returns a petition and refunds filing fees for those who are “lucky” enough to have USCIS reject a case upon filing for a deficient signature but retains the filing fees for those deemed deficient during adjudication, not to mention the harm in the time of processing. Due to USCIS processing times, certain cases that are subject to this new USCIS opinion that deficient signatures cannot be corrected during adjudication are cases filed when USCIS was operating under the long-standing policy to allow corrections.

The ability to cure a deficient signature is necessary to prevent irreparable harm. The filing fees for immigration petitions are costly, often thousands of dollars. Refiling a denied petition involves repaying the fees. Worse yet, sometimes refiling is not an option. For example, if USCIS denies an H-1b cap petition after the filing deadline, the petitioner loses the opportunity for that H-1b for the entire fiscal year. Moreover, the impact escalates if the beneficiary does not get selected in the H-1b lottery the following year. Similarly, in immigrant petitions where the priority date is based on the receipt date at USCIS, a denial results in loss of the filing date, which can delay the permanent residence process by several years. With processing times more than one year for I-140 petitions and multiple years for I-130 petitions, having to “restart” the clock by refiling is significant. A denial may also jeopardize a foreign national’s legal status, work authorization, or ability to include a dependent child nearing the age limit on permanent residence application.

The ability to correct a deficient signature is efficient for USCIS. The USCIS denials for alleged deficient signatures results in refiled petitions or appeals - adding work to an agency that is already understaffed and overburdened with volume of cases. Moreover, parties with cases that are not eligible to refile or appear – such as H-1b cap cases that are deadline-sensitive – may opt to sue USCIS, burdening not only USCIS but the court system.

The ability to correct a deficient signature recognizes substance over form. The purpose of a signature is to validate the identity of the signer and the intent/consent of the signer. For petitions with USCIS, a signature signifies the requester’s consent to three things: (1) the person knows of the content of the request and any supporting documents; (2) the person has reviewed and approves of any information contained in such request and any supporting documents; and (3) the person certifies under penalty of perjury that the request and any supporting documents are true and correct. The method of signature should not override the identity and intent of a party.9 Immigration law - including the right to live and work in the United States - should not hinge on a technicality involving the method of a signature when the intent of the signer is clear and verifiable.

Black’s Law Dictionary defines “sign” as “to affix one’s name to a writing or instrument, for the purpose of authenticating it, or to give it effect as one’s act”.10 If USCIS deems a party’s handwritten signature unacceptable because he affixed it to the USCIS form, USCIS should, at a minimum, allow the party to correct the deficiency by re-signing the form during the adjudication process. does not recognize a person’s handwritten signature that he affixes to a petition as acceptable, USCIS should at least allow such a person to correct a deficient signature during adjudication. The real solution – addressing not only denials but also the additional workload on USCIS from re-filings and appeals– is for USCIS to allow a party to correct a deficient signature during adjudication.

This report is part of “Upheaval Across America,” an examination of immigration enforcement under the second Trump administration produced by Carnegie-Knight News21. For more stories, visit https://upheaval.news21.com/.

In the months leading up to the 2024 presidential election, US Army veteran Sae Joon Park kept in mind a warning from an immigration officer: If Donald Trump were elected, Park would likely be at risk for deportation.

Park was just 7 when he came to the US from Seoul, South Korea. A green card holder, he joined the Army at 19 “to serve the country that I believed in,” he said. He received a Purple Heart after being shot twice while deployed in Panama, but after leaving the military, he lived with PTSD. That led to an addiction to crack cocaine and, ultimately, trouble with the law.

In 2009, he was arrested for drug possession. After he jumped bail, afraid he would fail a drug test, he served time in prison and was told he would be deported. However, because he was a veteran, he was granted deferred action upon his release, which allowed him to remain in the US as long as he checked in with immigration officials annually.

For 14 years, he did just that while raising children and building a new life in Honolulu. In June, everything changed.

When Park went in for his regular appointment, he was told he had a removal order against him. After talking things over with his family and lawyer, he decided to self-deport because, he said, he worried he could not survive extended time in detention while fighting deportation.

“I could have ended up in ‘Alligator Alcatraz,’” Park said, referring to the Florida detention center that has come under fire for alleged inhumane conditions. “I was a legal resident. They allowed me to join, serve the country—front line, taking bullets for this country. That should mean something.”

Instead, he said, “This is how veterans are being treated.”

During his first term in office, Trump enacted immigration policies aimed at a group normally safe from scrutiny: noncitizens who serve in the US military. His administration sought to restrict typical avenues for immigrant service members to obtain citizenship and make it harder for green card holders to enlist—actions that ultimately were unsuccessful.

Now, as the second Trump administration engages in a campaign to detain and deport immigrants living in the US, military experts and veterans say service members are once again targets.

“President Trump campaigned on a promise of mass deportations, and he didn’t exempt military members, veterans and their families,” said retired Lt. Col. Margaret Stock, a lawyer who helps veterans facing deportation. “It harms military recruiting, military readiness and the national security of our country.”

Under the Biden administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued a policy stating a noncitizen’s prior military service was a “significant mitigating factor” that must be considered in enforcement decisions, including deportation orders. The policy also offered protection to noncitizen family members of veterans or those on active duty.

In April, under the Trump administration, that policy was rescinded and replaced with one saying that while “ICE values the contributions of all those who have served in the US military … military service alone does not automatically exempt” one from enforcement actions.

The new policy directs agents to ask about military service during intake interviews and to document service. However, local ICE leaders have the authority to proceed with deportations of those who have served, though they may consider factors such as community ties and employment history.

Both policies barred enforcement actions against active-duty service members, absent significant aggravating factors. Under the new policy, noncitizen relatives of service members are not addressed at all.

In the wake of all of this, some service members, like Park, are choosing to self-deport. In other instances, immigrant family members of soldiers or veterans have been detained; those include Narciso Barranco, a father of three US Marines who was arrested in Santa Ana, California, while working the landscaping job he had held for three decades.

“Thousands of families like ours are being ripped apart,” Barranco’s son, veteran Alejandro Barranco, testified in July to a US Senate subcommittee on border security. “I want this committee to understand the human impact of the immigration policies of this administration. I want them to know that the people being ripped from our communities are hardworking, honest, patriotic people who are raising America’s teachers, nurses and Marines.

“Deporting them doesn’t just hurt my family,” he added. “It hurts all of us.”

There is no publicly available data on how many veterans are being affected, though ICE is supposed to track removals of service members and veterans and the Department of Homeland Security is typically required to share that information with Congress.

A 2019 federal report found at least 250 veterans had been placed in removal proceedings between 2013 and 2018, with at least 92 ultimately deported. The report said that while ICE had policies for handling cases of noncitizen veterans, it did not consistently identify and track actions against those individuals.

News21 could find only two DHS reports tracking removals of veterans. One, covering the first six months of 2022, said five veterans had been deported; another, for calendar year 2019, said three veterans had been deported.

In June, US Rep. Yassamin Ansari, an Arizona Democrat, and nine other members of Congress wrote to the secretaries of defense, veterans affairs and homeland security seeking the number of veterans currently facing deportation—noting “some estimates” put the overall number of deported veterans at 10,000.

In a news release, Ansari said all veterans “deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, not abandoned by an administration that turns their backs on their sacrifice.” Her office did not return messages from News21. DHS and ICE also did not respond to questions.

In past years, bills to do more to protect immigrant service members and their relatives have been introduced in Congress. One measure, introduced in May, would give green cards to parents of service members and allow those already deported to apply for a visa from abroad. It’s still in committee.

US Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat and Army veteran, has proposed several measures related to immigrant service members, but those bills have gone nowhere. Last year, for example, she reintroduced a bill to allow deported veterans who have completed the preliminary naturalization process to attend citizenship interviews at a port of entry, embassy or consulate instead of having to obtain parole to come back into the US. It died in committee.

For Duckworth, deported veterans are not a partisan issue.

“This is about the men and women who wore the uniform of our great nation, many of whom were promised a chance at citizenship by our government in exchange for their service,” she told News21. “It’s about doing the right thing and keeping our nation’s promise.”

‘I wanted to serve this country, this beautiful country’

As of February 2024, more than 40,000 foreign nationals were serving in active and reserve components of the Armed Forces, according to the Congressional Research Service. Another 115,000 were veterans living in the US.

Serving in the military has long been a pathway to citizenship, with provisions providing expedited naturalization for noncitizen service members dating back to the Civil War.

During World War I, according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services, foreign-born soldiers made up 18% of the Army. Some units even became known for their immigrant members; for example, the 77th Infantry Division was nicknamed the “Melting Pot Division.”

Since the end of World War I, more than 800,000 people have gained citizenship through military service, according to the CRS report. Since fiscal year 2020, service members from the

Philippines, Jamaica, Mexico, Nigeria and Ghana accounted for over 38% of service member naturalizations.

Generally, noncitizens who are permanent legal residents and who speak, read and write English fluently may join the armed forces. And during designated periods of hostility, noncitizens who serve honorably for any period of time—even one day—are eligible to apply for naturalization if they meet all criteria. The US is still considered to be in a period of hostility because of the post-9/11 war on terrorism.

Despite that longstanding policy, the Department of Defense, during Trump’s first term in office, tried to make it harder for service members to naturalize by forcing them to complete six months—rather than one day—before obtaining the “certification of honorable service” required to apply for citizenship. Naturalization applications subsequently plummeted by 72% from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2018.

The American Civil Liberties Union sued, and in 2020, a federal judge struck down the change.

Plaintiffs, including then-Army Pfc. Ange Samma, celebrated. Samma, originally from Burkina Faso, had lived in the US on a green card since he was a teenager. In 2018, he enlisted in the Army.

“I wanted to serve this country, this beautiful country,” Samma told News21.

Over 14 months, even after he’d been assigned to Camp Humphreys in South Korea, Samma tried over and over to obtain certification of his honorable service—to no avail. He finally became naturalized not long after the 2020 court ruling.

This year, Samma earned his bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering. He’s living in Statesboro, Georgia, while hunting for jobs. Because he now has citizenship, “There are many more opportunities that are open for me,” he said. “It’s very rewarding to have it. You feel proud.”

The Biden administration wound up rescinding the six-month policy, according to ACLU attorney Scarlet Kim. As of now, military members can once again apply for naturalization as soon as their service begins.

However, Kim notes, “If you don’t get your citizenship while you’re serving and then you’re discharged, what has happened is that you can potentially become vulnerable to deportation … despite having served our country in the military for however long.”

That’s exactly the situation facing Army veteran Marlon Parris.

Parris, who was born in Trinidad, has been in the US with a green card since the 1990s. He served in the Army for six years, including two tours in Iraq, and received the Army Commendation Medal three times, according to records filed in federal court.

Before his discharge in 2007, he was diagnosed with acute post-traumatic stress disorder, which was cited when Parris pleaded guilty in 2011 to conspiracy to distribute cocaine and was sentenced to federal prison.

Upon his release in 2016, he received a letter from the government stating he would not be deported, according to the group Black Deported Veterans of America. But on Jan. 22, just two days after Trump’s inauguration, agents detained Parris near his home in Laveen, outside of Phoenix. In May, a judge ruled that he was eligible for deportation.

His wife, Tanisha Hartwell-Parris, told News21 the couple plan to self-deport and bring along some of the seven children, ranging in age from 8 to 26, who are part of their blended family.

“I’m not going to put my husband in a situation to where he’s going to be a constant target, especially in the country that he fought for,” she said, adding that most people have no idea what immigrant service members face.

“People think that just because you’re a veteran … you should automatically have gotten status as a United States citizen,” she said. But the military, she added, “is different for immigrants. …. You’re fighting the same fight, but it’s not the same battle.”

A report published last year by the Veterans Law Practicum at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law noted the connections between PTSD, criminal behavior and the deportation of noncitizen veterans.

More than 20% of veterans with PTSD also have a substance use disorder, the report found, which can result in more exposure to the criminal justice system.

That situation is “the most common scenario in terms of how deportation is triggered,” said Rose Carmen Goldberg, an expert in veterans law who oversaw completion of the report and now teaches in the Veterans Legal Services Clinic at Yale Law School.

The report also noted that even though deportation does not disqualify veterans from health care and other benefits earned through service, “Geographic and bureaucratic barriers may ultimately stand in the way.”

In 2021, the Biden administration launched the Immigrant Military Members and Veterans Initiative (IMMVI) to ensure deported veterans could access Veterans Affairs benefits. The program offered parole on a case-by-case basis to those needing to return to the US for legal counsel or to access care, and it sought to facilitate naturalization services for immigrant service members.

In the program’s first year, 143 veterans living outside of the US reached out to IMMVI staff, according to congressional testimony. A 2022 story by the nonprofit newsroom The War Horse said 102 veterans had been allowed back to the US via the IMMVI parole program, and “over 30” had obtained citizenship.

In response to questions about the status of the IMMVI program, USCIS directed News21 to its website about the program.

Jennie Pasquarella, a lawyer with the Seattle Clemency Project, said the biggest flaw of the IMMVI program is that parole into the US is temporary – a “dead end” if a veteran doesn’t have a legal claim to restore legal residency or to naturalize.

“We had asked the Biden administration to do more to ensure that there was a further path towards restoring people’s lawful status beyond parole,” she said. “Basically, we didn’t succeed.”

A ‘lifeline’ for deported vets

In the absence of aid in the US, more and more veterans are turning to help elsewhere.

After serving in the Vietnam War with the Army, José Francisco Lopez, a native of Torreón, Mexico, experienced PTSD and struggled with addiction. He eventually went to prison for a drug-related crime and in 2003 was deported back to his home country.

For years, Lopez thought he was the only deported veteran in Mexico—until he met Hector Barajas, a deported Army veteran who in 2013 founded the Deported Veterans Support House in Tijuana.

Inspired, Lopez opened his own Deported Veterans Support House in Ciudad Juárez, across the border from El Paso.

Today, Lopez, 80, is a legal resident of the US but splits his time between El Paso and Juárez, providing deported veterans housing, food and advice about how to apply for VA benefits. Since opening the support house in 2017, he’s helped about 20 people.

On a Saturday in June, four veterans stopped by to visit Lopez at the place they call “the bunker.” The gathering felt like a family reunion, with laughter filling the house as they shared memories of holidays spent together and other moments, both good and bad.

Said Ricardo Munoz, who came across Lopez and the bunker in 2019: “It’s kind of like being out in the ocean and someone throws a lifeline at you.”

US Air Force veteran Alfonso, who enlisted in 1976, said he was shocked when he was deported in 2001 after being charged with driving under the influence in El Paso. He said he mistakenly thought he had automatically earned citizenship for serving. Alfonso asked that his last name not be used because he is now trying to naturalize and fears publicity could hurt those efforts.

After living and working in Juarez for decades, Alfonso, with Lopez’s support, obtained parole back to the US in 2024 via the IMMVI program. He got his green card and now lives in El Paso, near his daughter.

For Alfonso, military service was a family affair. His brother served in Vietnam, his niece has done multiple tours in the Middle East, one nephew is in the Coast Guard and another is a Marine.

Citizenship or not, he said, “I was an American already, because I was willing to give my life for it.”

He added, “When you’re willing to give your life for something that, you don’t know, in one second you might be dead—it’s something. It’s important.”

‘It’s a whole new world’

Back in Seoul, Park, 56, is adjusting to life in a country he hadn’t even visited in 30 years. When he first arrived, he said, he cried every morning for hours.

“I just couldn’t stop,” he said. “It’s a whole new world. I speak the language, but I don’t read or write, so I’m trying to really relearn everything.”

For now, he’s staying with his father, but he worries about his family back in the US. His daughter works for the state of California. His son—also a military veteran—lives in Hawaii, where he works in cybersecurity and helps care for Park’s 85-year-old mother.

“I don’t know how many more years she’s got,” Park said. “My daughter, if she ever gets married, I won’t be there for a wedding.”

Park’s attorney started a petition to urge prosecutors to dismiss his criminal convictions, part of an attempt to cancel his deportation order and allow him to return to the United States. More than 10,000 people have signed.

Park said he’s grateful for the support but has little faith that the country he fought for will ever allow him to come back.

“I’m not blaming the military or VA – it’s literally the Trump administration,” he said. “What they’re doing is crazy.

“This is not the country that I volunteered and fought for,” he added. “This is just really wrong.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Immigrant_Troops_01.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-09-12 16:56:37.982446

Terry Gerton That’s really helpful.
Federal, state, and local decisions depend on accurate census data.
Talk us through what kinds of programs and policies use the census count to make decisions.
Terry Gerton That’s really helpful.","Terry Gerton So Ms. Anand, let’s begin with you. As a refresher for the listeners, can you remind us of the legal and constitutional requirements that drive how we conduct our census?

Meeta Anand Yeah, absolutely. So the census is actually mentioned in Article One of the Constitution. It does not use the word census. It calls for an enumeration of all people, which is then used to apportion, or think of the word allocate, the number of seats that each state gets in the House of Representatives. It is further mentioned in the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, which mandates that every person living in the United States is counted for the purposes of apportionment. Additionally, we have Title 13, which is the portion of the United State’s code which delineates exactly how a census is to be conducted. And as we all know, it happens once every 10 years in the year ending in zero.

Terry Gerton So how did those guardrails shape what’s possible when you think about redesigning the census if you wanted to?

Meeta Anand So, one thing we know is that the 14th Amendment tells us that it’s a count of every person. It doesn’t say every citizen. It doesn’t say every voter. So right there, that’s one guardrail, which is that it uses the term person and not the term citizen or some other term. The other thing we know is that it has to happen every 10 years. And the first one occurred in the year 1790, per the Constitution. So we know that that happens every decade in the year ending in zero. What we also know is that it calls for an actual enumeration of people. So historically that has been interpreted as not a statistical sampling or a administrative records effort, but rather requires this effort of going out and doing a count of each person, which is why you have that familiar trope of census door knockers, where you have people going out and attempting to do that count of each and every person.

Terry Gerton That’s really helpful. So Mr. Fienberg, let me turn to you. President Trump has issued a directive that calls for a new census that excludes undocumented immigrants and uses data from the 2024 election. What would that shift mean for the integrity and the independence of federal data collection?

Howard Fienberg So there are some complications there. So from the perspective of the Insights Association, where I also hold my hat in addition to the Census Project, we responded right away very excited about the prospect that the President would be interested in investing more resources into the census, because it’s a massive obligation of federal resources that takes an entire decade to put together in preparation and development. And so we looked at it from that angle. If you take it from a specific angle of holding a mid-decade census — which might be what he was suggesting, we don’t know that for certain — if that is the case, there are restrictions on doing a mid-decade census that present just a simple legal problem in that you can only do it in year five and we’re already running out of time in year five, certainly in the fiscal year, that’s almost over. But also just in the practical year, and putting together and conducting a census, as I said, takes a whole decade. That would be an extremely complicated thing to put together on very short notice, no matter how you’re going to do the count exactly, whether or not it has anything to do with questions of citizenship and immigration status, it doesn’t really matter. It would still be a Herculean task. And on top of that, there is a legal impediment already existing that such a mid-decade census, if you ran it, could only be used for purposes of, say, the divvying up of federal funds, of which trillions of dollars every year are guided by census data. So yeah, that would make sense. You want to get more accurate data for that purpose. That’s cool, but the law says that you can’t use it for purposes of apportionment and redistricting. So based on what presumably he would be looking to do with the data, he would not be able to do that under the course of the law.

Terry Gerton Got it. So, Ms. Anand, let me come back to you. From a practical standpoint, if we did a new census, we probably couldn’t get the mid-year done in 2025, as Mr. Fienberg has just said, but it takes a long time to prepare to do each census. You have the rules, you align everything. If we change the rules in 2025 for the 2030 census and don’t count undocumented immigrants, what does that mean for the actual process, and then what does it actually mean in communities that are already hard to count?

Meeta Anand Thank you for that question. Firstly, any change that historically, any change the Census Bureau makes, it has to do research on the impact of that change on the overall accuracy of the census. The Census Bureau itself says its mandate is to count every person once and only once and in the right place. So you have to see how changes impact that mandate. So if you start doing changes such as looking to exclude people from the count, you would need to add in questions, whether it be a citizenship question or an immigration status question. And that could have the chilling effect. And in fact, we have research that shows that this then has a chilling effect on immigrant communities, regardless of their status, undocumented, long-term permanent resident, children of immigrants. So right there, you start seeing this pressure on response rates that they start to decline with the addition of such questions. To your other point, any change has flow-through effects. So once you add a question, you also have to consider you’re changing the length of the form, you’re changing how the form is designed. And a lot of those things often get researched as well. So there are many steps involved in this. And as you said, and as Howard said, planning takes a long time, the planning for the 2030 census started in 2019. So to the elite person, 2025 may seem like a lot of time, but in 2026, the Census Bureau is extensively conducting field tests. And we also have to prepare for those tests now, which allow for the implementation of new technologies in 2030. So there is a deliberately deliberate process to get everything in place in time.

Terry Gerton I’m speaking with Meeta Anand. She’s Senior Director, Census and Data Equity at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and Howard Fienberg, who’s the co-director of the Census Project and Senior VP for Advocacy at the Insights Association. So Mr. Fienberg, let me come back to you. Assuming that it was possible to change the questions for the 2030 census, what are the risks of discontinuity in the data at this point? If you have not had a question in all along and now you have a new question about citizenship or immigration status, what does that imply or what impact might that have on long-term data trends and compatibility?

Howard Fienberg There will be issues, and such things can be worked out methodologically and on the back end. It certainly changes up depending on the accuracy of what you’re collecting in the census itself. I think Meeta touched on that quite directly, and I think that’s where you would be most concerned in terms of the comparability of the output from the census. We don’t have a specific position one way or another on asking about citizenship or immigration status at the Census Project or at the Insights Association. But there are obviously, like you’ve pointed out, there are some concerns about what you’re going to get in terms of usefulness of data across time. And being able to make those comparisons, yes, very important. And certainly if you’re going to go talk to a statistician, they’re going to be very focused on that issue specifically. I think there were a couple of things I wanted to circle back, if we could, on when we were talking about setting up the new census. It’s not just where we are in the planning stages. And the interesting thing that the President raised in his Truth Social post was the concept that there were ways to improve the census overall with new kinds of data, new kinds of collection, while not knowing what it is exactly that he would have in mind. That is an exciting prospect that the administration would want to be involved in improving the overall count. And yeah, it’s certainly something to be encouraged. And yes, we are already at a stage where we’re rolling out field tests in 2026. This is kind of the last stop where you can do any kind of innovation because once you hit into the 2026 census test, you’re already ramping up really fast from there. So this would be a great time for the administration to engage with the Census Bureau, with the Commerce Department overall, and with stakeholders to talk about what would be involved in improving the census. What kind of things would they like to see and improve? Because now is really the last chance to get in something really meaty.

Terry Gerton And do you see any evidence of that collaboration door swinging open at this point?

Howard Fienberg Not yet, but that might need to wait for at least the nomination of a new director of the Census Bureau, because we have an acting director in Ron Jarmin, but I assume that they would be most comfortable with their own nominee. That hasn’t happened yet, but hopefully that’s something that will happen soon.

Terry Gerton Ms. Anand, I want to come back to you. You mentioned at the very beginning, counting every person, much depends on that census count. Federal, state, and local decisions depend on accurate census data. Talk us through what kinds of programs and policies use the census count to make decisions.

Meeta Anand Sure, absolutely. And I do want to say, while Howard stated the position of his organizations, I do want to say the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights is opposed to the addition of a citizenship or immigration status question, on the basis that it would lead to an undercount of many of our communities that we want to ensure are accurately represented in the data. And that goes to your question directly. Why do we care that people are appropriately represented in data? Well, firstly is representation, as we went through, the number of seats you get in the House, but so many states and localities use the same data to draw district lines within their communities. Then you have the notion of $2.8 trillion of federal funds going to states every year for federally guided programs. So we’re looking at programs like SNAP, we’re looking at Medicaid, we’re looking at Medicare. We’re looking at hospitals. We’re looking at schools. I could go on forever. We’re looking at roads and public transportation decisions. So understanding how many people are in a community and who they are is really important to making these types of decisions about the programs and services they can get. And I would argue there’s a third point, which is less policy and more personal, which is data are the story we tell about our communities and about our country. So in order to truly understand who we are as a country and to tell the story of ourselves, we need to have that accurate and complete representation of who is on the ground.

Terry Gerton That’s really helpful. People, regardless of their immigration status, draw services, I guess is where you wind up. Mr. Feinberg, let’s wrap it up with you. How do you see this proposal playing out? And what should folks be watching for as the conversation unfolds?",https://federalnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Census_Bureau_DOGE_26971-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 13:56:39.033443

“Partnering with the federal government for Seneca County has been going on for 25 years,” Stevens said at the time.
The Advertiser-Tribune has also submitted a public records request seeking all communications and contracts between the Seneca County Sheriff’s Office and ICE dating back to 1996.","TIFFIN — A legal and political dispute over immigration detention in Seneca County is intensifying following a recent opinion from Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and a letter from the ACLU Ohio demanding the release of detainees held under sheriff-executed contracts with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The ACLU argues that county sheriffs lack the legal authority to enter immigration detention agreements and that individuals held under such contracts may be unlawfully detained. In a letter sent to multiple counties, including Seneca, Geauga, Butler, Lake and Portage, the organization demanded the immediate release of detainees and a halt to local enforcement actions tied to ICE.

“To the extent that any individual was arrested, is currently being held, or was at one time held without lawful authority, they may have grounds to bring a lawsuit,” the ACLU said in a statement to The Advertiser-Tribune. The organization also criticized the lack of transparency, noting that several sheriff’s offices have refused to release ICE contracts, prompting lawsuits in the Ohio Supreme Court.

The legal debate was sparked by Yost’s formal opinion issued Aug. 26, which concluded that only county commissioners, not sheriffs, have the authority to contract with ICE for detention services. The opinion was requested by Butler County Prosecutor Michael Gmoser after a sheriff there signed a new ICE agreement earlier this year.

Seneca County Sheriff Fred Stevens responded by stating that the county’s ICE contract was originally signed by the Board of Commissioners in 1996 and amended in 2003 to remain in effect indefinitely. Stevens said the jail currently houses 60 ICE detainees and emphasized that the contract is valid under Ohio law.

“We are in full compliance with the Attorney General’s opinion,” Stevens said. “Under no circumstance would any detainees be released into our county. ICE would come and pick them up if we ever ended the contract or if they did.”

Stevens declined to release a copy of the contract, citing federal regulations and the Federal Records Act. He directed inquiries to the federal Freedom of Information Act process, the same route he recommended to the ACLU earlier this year.

In June, The Advertiser-Tribune reported that the sheriff’s office had expanded its federal partnership by joining two additional ICE programs under the 287(g) initiative. These programs, the Task Force model and the Warrant Service Officer model, authorize trained deputies and jail staff to arrest individuals with immigration detainers and serve administrative warrants.

“Partnering with the federal government for Seneca County has been going on for 25 years,” Stevens said at the time. “I see this as just another step of partnering with the federal government to assist with the law.”

The sheriff emphasized that deputies would not actively seek out unauthorized immigrants but would use the training when encountering individuals with detainers during routine calls or traffic stops. He also cited liability protection as a key reason for joining the programs.

The Seneca County Board of Commissioners issued a brief statement via County Administrator Barb Patterson acknowledging Yost’s opinion and said it had asked the sheriff and county prosecutor to review the matter and advise on any necessary changes. The board did not comment on the validity of the current contract or whether it plans to take further action.

The ACLU maintains that without access to the contracts, the public cannot determine whether agreements are valid, who executed them or what they authorize. The organization has filed a public records lawsuit against the sheriff’s office in the Ohio Supreme Court, which is currently in mediation. The most recent action in the case was the court’s referral to its mediation program on Aug. 20. All filing deadlines are currently stayed while both parties attempt to resolve the dispute outside of formal proceedings.

While Yost’s opinion did not direct counties to release detainees, it clarified that only commissioner-approved contracts are valid and that detainees may be held beyond the typical 48-hour limit if such agreements are in place. The ACLU interprets the opinion as reinforcing its position that sheriff-executed contracts are unlawful.

“The collaboration between federal and local law enforcement and exactly what they are doing and if it is lawful is of great public interest,” said Sheila Smith, senior public relations strategist for ACLU Ohio. “The fact that these agencies are going to great lengths to keep these documents hidden should be a matter of great concern to everyone.”

Sheriff Stevens said no changes are expected to transportation or detention procedures, and the jail will continue operating under its current arrangement.

“County jails, particularly ours, should be partnering with the federal government to assist with any housing needs,” Stevens said. “We have a quarter century of partnering with the federal government.”

The Ohio Attorney General’s Office did not respond to a request for comment by The Advertiser-Tribune’s publication deadline.

The Advertiser-Tribune has also submitted a public records request seeking all communications and contracts between the Seneca County Sheriff’s Office and ICE dating back to 1996. ICE has indicated a goal of responding within 20 business days, though the agency noted that processing may take longer due to the high volume of requests it is currently receiving.",http://d3i5p6znmm9yua.cloudfront.net/360_FindlayCourier_Live/0/0/0/0/744/49/744049_1,N,,2025-09-12 17:57:57.900023

The federal court’s ruling against the Trump administration’s use of the National Guard troops in California does not automatically apply to other states.

Gavin Newsom’s legal challenge to President Donald Trump’s deployment of the National Guard and Marines in Los Angeles.

“In Denver, our residents are connected with police who live on the same streets they patrol and with officers who grew up in the same communities they’re sworn to protect. That’s why our crime rates are plummeting,” Mayor Mike Johnston said in a statement. “What the Trump Administration is doing in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. isn’t a strategy for fighting crime. It’s a federal police state meant to sow chaos, cause disruption, and strip rights away from local governments and citizens.”

An amicus brief is a legal document that allows a party to provide an outside perspective on an issue under litigation.

In the brief filed on Tuesday, Denver argues that the deployment of military troops for policing purposes “dramatically increases the risk of irreparable injury to constitutional sovereignty promised by the 10th Amendment, the fundamental constitutional rights of residents, and the general welfare of the public.”

The city also asserts to the court that local police departments are better suited to serve residents while protecting their rights under local, state and federal laws.

During an Aug. 27 Reddit “Ask Me Anything” session, Johnston called Trump’s “militarization” of the nation’s cities “unprecedented” and “dangerous.” He promised to take the administration to court “on Day One” should the White House send federal troops to Denver.

“Any first-year law student in America could tell you that deploying the U.S. military on the streets of American cities in times of peace to enforce domestic law is clearly illegal,” the mayor posted. “Denver does not need any help from the National Guard, as we are seeing the largest decrease in violent crime of any top 50 city in the country.”

After the Trump administration deployed thousands of National Guard soldiers and Marines to Los Angeles following protests over immigration raids, Newsom, a Democrat, sued, arguing the president’s actions violated federal law.

On Sept. 2, U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer ruled in a 52-page opinion that Trump’s decision to deploy troops in Los Angeles was illegal.

The federal court’s ruling against the Trump administration’s use of the National Guard troops in California does not automatically apply to other states.

Republican strategists contend Democrats are in a bind over how to react to Trump’s directive based on high crime rates in Democrat-led cities. FBI data show that 19 of the 20 cities with the highest murder rates and at least 100,000 residents in 2024 had Democratic mayors.

The National Police Association earlier said it welcomes more “boots on the ground,” referring to Trump’s executive order creating a series of specialized military units within the National Guard that, under the direction of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, would be “specifically trained and equipped to deal with public disorder issues.”

The Trump executive order is a positive step toward rectifying a decrease in “boots-on-the-ground law enforcement” over the past decade, National Police Association spokesperson Betsy Brantner Smith told technology publication Smart Cities Dive.

“The order declares that safe communities depend on a tough and well-equipped police force,” she told the publication. “That’s something that the president has said with some frequency — let cops be cops.”

Denver recently filed a motion to dismiss the Trump administration’s lawsuit against the city and state, claiming it was an unlawful attempt to overturn local policy on immigration. The city has also filed four lawsuits against the administration.

This summer, the city was granted a preliminary injunction preventing Trump’s threats to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in allocated transportation funding.

The city also joined Chicago and Pima County, Arizona, in seeking to recover $24 million in FEMA dollars allocated for the purposes of sheltering and assisting migrants.

That case is still pending.

The city has also received a favorable ruling in two other cases where the administration has threatened to withhold federal dollars – one over so-called “sanctuary jurisdictions” and the other over funding to prevent large-scale security threats.",https://www.coloradopolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/johnston-profile.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 17:58:01.856986

NPR's Anthony Kuhn reports from Seoul that the incident shocked South Koreans and could have damaged one of the U.S.' most important economic relationships.

ANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, released a video of their raid last week on the battery factory in Bryan County, Georgia, run by South Korean firms Hyundai and LG.

(SOUNDBITE OF HELICOPTERS FLYING OVERHEAD)

KUHN: The most jarring images were of Korean workers being handcuffed and chained at the waist and ankles. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung told a press conference that if such problems can't be resolved, it could impact South Korean investment in the U.S.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT LEE JAE MYUNG: (Speaking Korean).

KUHN: ""Korean companies will inevitably have to consider,"" he said, ""whether it's worth establishing local factories in the U.S. if it means facing all sorts of disadvantages or difficulties in future."" South Korea has recently emerged as one of the biggest foreign investors in the U.S. Ahead of a summit with President Trump last month, President Lee pledged to invest $350 billion in exchange for lower tariffs on South Korean exports. At that summit, Trump praised South Korea's role in helping to rebuild American manufacturing, but he later defended the raid on the Hyundai plant.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They were illegal aliens, and ICE was just doing its job.

KUHN: President Lee says the U.S. wanted to transport the workers to the Atlanta airport in handcuffs, but South Korean officials flatly refused, and the U.S. side eventually backed down. In South Korea's parliament this week, lawmaker Yoon Hu-duk deplored the raid on the factory.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

YOON HU-DUK: (Through interpreter) In negotiations, the U.S. has encouraged us to invest, and then they stabbed us in the back, to be frank.

KUHN: Hur Jung is an economist at Sogang University in Seoul. He says the Hyundai factory in Georgia was still testing its production lines.

HUR JUNG: (Through interpreter) To make this stage progress efficiently, Korean workers and technicians familiar with the system do test runs and get the line rolling. The factory will eventually hire and transition to a local workforce.

KUHN: Hur explains that the U.S. does not have visa quotas for skilled South Korean workers, so the Hyundai technicians came to the U.S. on short-term visas and got caught in ICE's crackdown. Jang Sang-sik is head of the International Trade Research Institute at the Korea International Trade Association, a private trade lobby group. He sees the raid as a quirk.

JANG SANG-SIK: (Through interpreter) We see this as an unusual clash between U.S. state and federal governments, which are hungry for foreign investment, and the immigration agencies and American public, who view illegal employment or immigration very negatively.

KUHN: Jang adds that South Korea is tamping down its anger at the raid because it needs a lot from the U.S., not just lower tariffs but also help countering threats from North Korea and China. He adds that if the issues raised by the factory raid are properly resolved, it could even boost South Korean investments in the U.S.

The agency now projects 290,000 immigrants will be removed from the country between 2026 and 2029. Economists warned less immigration and negative net migration could create woes for the U.S. labor force and inflation.

President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown is resulting in the U.S. population growth shrinking faster than anticipated, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)—a phenomenon economists have warned will lead to a labor shortage, drive up inflation, and, under some circumstances, shrink U.S. GDP growth.

The nonpartisan budgetary agency published a revised demographic outlook on Wednesday, projecting death will exceed births in the U.S. beginning in 2031, two years earlier than it previously projected, as a result of a diminished immigrant population as well as lower fertility rates.

The CBO attributed the revisions in large part to Trump’s 2025 reconciliation act, or “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which provides a total of $170 billion for immigration and border enforcement, including a lump sum of $29.9 billion to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations and the hiring of 10,000 ICE officers.

About 290,000 immigrants will be removed from the country between 2026 and 2029 as a result of the law, the CBO said, and about 50,000 immigrants will be detained per day in the same period. An increase in ICE personnel will lead to 5,500 more arrests in 2026 and 100,000 more in 2029 than if the policy had not been enacted. Another 30,000 are projected to leave voluntarily between 2026 and 2030.

This crackdown will have a direct effect on labor, according to the agency.

“CBO estimates that the additional detentions resulting from the law will have two effects,” the report said. “First, people who are detained will not be available to work and will therefore not be in the labor force. Second, detention increases the likelihood that immigrants who receive an order of removal will be successfully removed.”

The White House did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.

The economics impact of an immigration crackdown

Trump’s anti-immigration efforts have led economists to sound the alarms about the policy’s impact on the U.S. workforce and subsequent economic health.

While the CBO still expects a positive net migration for 2025, economists have also warned that a negative net migration—which Trump has actively worked for as a result of his policies—could hinder U.S. GDP growth.

A working paper published in July from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), a conservative economics policy center, found negative net migration could lead to a loss in consumer spending and a diminishing labor force that could shrink U.S. GDP growth by 0.3% and 0.4%, or roughly between $70.5 billion to $94 billion in annual lost economic output.

“Our workforce is disproportionately made up of immigrants relative to their share of the population, and because of that we…really can’t sustain a high level of job growth with the U.S.-born population alone, because there just aren’t enough bodies, essentially, to do that,” report co-author Tara Watson, a Brookings Institute economist and professor of economics at Williams College, previously told Fortune.

Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi said last month the labor force shrinkage, as a result of a narrowing immigration population, could even have inflationary effects, predicting inflation could rise from 2.5% to around 4% early next year if deportations continue at their current rate.

The U.S. Department of Labor reported last month that the producer price index (PPI), which measures wholesale inflation, rose 0.9% from June to July, up 3.3% compared to the period a year ago. The core consumer price index increased 0.2% from June to July. Inflation continued to rise in August as new job numbers slumped.

“Foreign-born labor force is declining, and the overall labor force has gone flat since the beginning of the year,” Zandi told Fortune last month. “That’s causing tightening in a lot of markets, adding to costs and inflation.”

“You can see it in meat prices, agriculture, food processing, haircuts, dry cleaning,” he added. “The fingerprints of the restrictive immigration policy are all over the CPI and PPI numbers we got this week.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/eOjihlhJ3TBzpoRnIWZgng--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDI7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fortune_175/a58f144cf071a8c0302282871fcb324b,N,,2025-09-12 13:56:42.559756

Texas Department of Public Safety officers have helped arrest more than 3,000 undocumented immigrants across the state this year, according to public records obtained by The Texas Tribune that provide the most detailed glimpse yet of how state police are shifting their focus from the border toward aiding the Trump administration’s mass deportation crusade — an effort that state officials have kept largely under wraps.

From late January through early September, DPS recorded 3,131 previously unreported arrests connected to specialty teams created at the direction of Gov. Greg Abbott to help President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, the agency’s records show. Roughly 88% of the people arrested were picked up on suspicion of violating federal immigration laws like improper entry into the country, marking what may be an unprecedented use of state resources for a role once performed exclusively by federal authorities.

“Operation Lone Star 2.0 is underway statewide — with DPS personnel working to combat and interdict criminal activity with a nexus to the border,” DPS spokesperson Sheridan Nolen said in an email, referring to Texas’ border initiative under the Biden administration for which thousands of troopers were dispatched to the border.

Amid a sharp fall in illegal border crossings, DPS has moved some of its troopers and investigators onto “strike teams” that work with federal agencies across Texas — including in each of the largest metro areas — to arrest people “who have entered the United States illegally and then gone on to commit crimes in the state,” according to the agency.

The federal government has sole authority to enforce immigration violations under federal law. State and local police can’t arrest someone simply for being undocumented without agreements that extend them limited power to do so. As of late July, DPS had no such agreements in place with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security or U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency under DHS’ umbrella that oversees much of the nation’s immigration policing, according to DPS records and an ICE database of active partnerships.

Nolen said DPS officers have jurisdiction across Texas to “protect and serve every corner” of the state, though she noted that officers “must have probable cause” to apprehend someone.

The agency has otherwise remained tight-lipped about its deportation efforts, having yet to offer details about how the strike teams function, how they decide who to target or where the people who have been arrested are located now.

Nolen declined to directly respond to a list of questions about the operations, citing the agency’s policy of not disclosing “operational specifics.”

Department officials do not know the whereabouts of those arrested by DPS’ strike teams because they do not keep track of them once they leave the agency’s custody, Nolen said, also deferring to federal authorities for details about their criminal histories.

The Trump administration has said it would prioritize deporting violent criminals, and DPS’ leader has said state authorities working with the feds share the focus. As of mid-August, DPS had identified nearly 6,500 “criminal illegal immigrants with active felony warrants in Texas for a variety of offenses,” Nolen said, including murder, drug and sex crimes, and human smuggling. Officers from all DPS divisions arrested roughly 30,000 people from the start of the year through July.

“Right now, we're going after the migrants that pose the largest threat to the communities,” DPS Director Freeman Martin told the Public Safety Commission, which he answers to, in February. “And there's a lot of them.”

Reports for seven of the arrests, also obtained through a public information request, suggest DPS officers are using a broad range of tactics to apprehend people and, at least for this limited sample size, targeting those with a mix of serious and nonexistent criminal history.

Among them was a Honduran man in Austin who was riding in the passenger seat of a car stopped for an expired registration after DPS apparently staked out his home. An ICE agent with DPS at the scene detained the man upon confirming he had overstayed a visa. Court records show he had been accused of domestic violence in 2022, but the case was later dropped.

In another case, a man was arrested at a Dallas home, where officers arrived after tracking GPS data, according to an arrest report that provided no further details about the tracking. The man had no previous criminal cases listed in federal or local databases.

Two others were arrested in a targeted probe with the feds that led authorities to $16,000 worth of marijuana, cocaine and meth. Both had faced drug charges in the past, Harris County court records show.

Many of the immigration arrests occurred hundreds of miles from the border. Nearly 700 — at least one in five — took place in either Austin, Dallas or Houston, where left-leaning local officials have historically resisted cooperating with federal immigration authorities. Those figures are almost certainly an undercount because the DPS records did not say where more than 1,000 of the arrests took place.

The focus on crackdowns far away from the border “raises red flags,” said Osvaldo Grimaldo, a policy and advocacy strategist with the ACLU of Texas, which has accused DPS of using racial profiling and focusing on migrants accused of low-level offenses in its recent border policing.

“As DPS is expanding these efforts into parts of the interior of the state, what are the intentions?” Grimaldo asked. “Are they being lawful? Are they collaborating with other agencies at the municipal level?”

Operation Lone Star without the fanfare

The regional tactical strike teams mark the latest plunge into immigration enforcement for Texas’ main public safety agency, whose troopers have long been known for dishing out speeding tickets and warnings for busted tail lights. The sprawling agency also issues driver’s licenses, among other regulatory duties, and often takes the lead on major criminal probes, including the bungled response to the deadly Uvalde school shooting in 2022.

DPS had already ramped up its presence at the Texas-Mexico border over the last decade. Abbott escalated things to new levels four years ago, when he ordered thousands of troopers to be dispatched to the state’s 1,254-mile southern border as part of his Operation Lone Star program to deter border crossings.

At the time, DPS was not making federal immigration arrests. Instead, officers arrested thousands of asylum-seeking immigrants for trespassing on private property, a state offense, as the number of illegal border crossings hit record highs.

Those novel misdemeanor arrests carried a maximum penalty of one year in jail, and became a source of controversy as Texas escalated its immigration enforcement unlike any state had ever done, drawing questions about whether migrants were being denied due process and other constitutional rights.

The number of illegal crossings began tanking last summer and has continued to plunge under the Trump administration. Still, the Legislature earmarked another $3.4 billion for border security earlier this year, giving about one-third of it to DPS with an eye toward immigration enforcement in the state’s interior.

Eight days after Trump took office for his second term, Abbott directed DPS to deploy strike teams that could help the Trump administration “locate and arrest criminal illegal immigrants in the state.”

“After four years of failed policies, Texas finally has a partner in President Trump,” Abbott said. “Together, we will end this crisis and make America safe once again.”

Since then, DPS has issued statements acknowledging individual arrests conducted by the teams but said nothing about their overall productivity — a stark contrast to the highly publicized accomplishments touted under Operation Lone Star.

The governor and agency frequently shared updates on arrests and drug seizures stemming from the border program. They posted photos and videos of migrants being arrested, held press conferences in cities along the border to unveil new initiatives, and along the way drew the Biden administration into a constitutional fight over how much authority a state has to enforce immigration laws.

In comparison, little information is being released or celebrated about the strike teams.

That includes one team’s major raid of a party in Hays County earlier this year, initially detailed by DPS as a bust of alleged gang members and their associates carried out with various federal agencies. Authorities arrested almost four dozen people during the raid, children among them.

But party guests have denied having gang affiliations and said they had rented a big house with a swimming pool to celebrate a pair of birthdays — including that of a kid who instead turned 5 in ICE detention, the Tribune previously reported.

All 35 detainees identified by the Tribune were arrested on suspicion of illegally entering the country. None had previous criminal cases listed in federal or local databases.

An uncertain scope

Such state apprehensions are only part of the deportation efforts underway across multiple layers of government. The tally of immigrants arrested by DPS’ strike teams doesn’t account for those picked up after being stopped by local law enforcement or instances where federal immigration authorities are working on their own.

There are also signs that the scope and scale of DPS' deportation operations extend beyond the more than 3,100 strike team arrests. The DPS spokesperson noted that the agency aided a massive ICE operation last month that led the feds to arrest more than 800 suspected undocumented immigrants; it was not clear if such efforts are counted toward DPS' strike team arrest tally. Additionally, records obtained by the Tribune show that at least one of the detainees was deported along with family members who were not counted among the apprehensions.

That arrest began when a state trooper followed Omar Gallardo Rodriguez’s white truck for about two minutes before pulling him over next to Dobie Middle School in North Austin over a traffic infraction. His wife, Denisse Parra Vargas, was in the passenger seat, according to video recorded by the DPS trooper’s dash camera. The footage showed that, within an hour of being pulled over, Rodriguez was whisked away by a masked officer accompanying five DPS troopers to the scene.

Within a week, federal agents also deported Parra Vargas — who had entered the country illegally seeking protection from a previous abusive partner, advocates say — and their kids, two of whom were born in the United States.

DHS officials have labeled Rodriguez a “serial lawbreaker” in past statements for previous accusations of assaulting a family member, driving under the influence and entering the country illegally four times.

The family’s lawyers declined to comment and Rodriguez did not respond to an email.

Arrests like Rodriguez’s could become more frequent as DPS and its federal partners gain reinforcements next year under a new Texas law that will require most sheriffs in the state to enter agreements with ICE. Roughly 11% of all Texas sheriffs have already inked agreements with the federal agency — according to ICE records from early September — for a controversial program that extends deputies the authority to ask people about their legal status during their routine patrols.

Approximately 2.1 million undocumented immigrants call Texas home, second in the nation only to California. The Trump administration has not regularly published data about its deportation efforts, but recent independent research suggests that for the first time in decades, more immigrants have left the U.S. than arrived so far this year.

Outside of Houston, members with FIEL — an acronym that translates to Immigrant Families and Students in the Fight — have recorded accounts of DPS troopers waiting to stop people for traffic violations off Highway 59 near a massive subdivision north of the city that has been a lightning rod among Republican officials because its developer sells land to undocumented people.

“It’s happening every day,” said Alain Cisneros, a FIEL organizer who knocked doors in the neighborhoods to conduct a survey that found many of the residents are living in great fear.

He said it appeared like a replica of Operation Lone Star — but 400 miles from the Mexican border.

Soliman and his fate have become a rod among faith groups and activists in Ohio amid Trump's mass deportation effort.
Ayman Soliman, a former chaplain at Cincinnati Children's Hospital, was detained by ICE agents July 9.
""That's why we're here today in support of Imam Soliman.","When U.S. immigration authorities detained Imam Ayman Soliman at a routine check-in July 9, the outcry was swift. Known as the ""interfaith imam"" for his work at Cincinnati Children's Hospital and a local mosque, Soliman's case has inspired hundreds to protest, pray and plead for his release.

""We are just a country that is breaking promises,"" said Dominican Sr. of Peace Gemma Doll of Columbus, Ohio.

Doll joined faith leaders and other community advocates decrying the detention Aug. 25 at the Ohio Statehouse. The group — which included The Undivided, a racial justice group; Center for American Islamic Relations-Ohio; Young United Souls for Revolutionary Action, a Muslim-led group; Ohio Immigrant Alliance — delivered a letter signed by 1,166 people to Ohio Governor Mike DeWine urging him to intervene in Soliman's case.

""Governor DeWine, you have the ability, the opportunity to make Ohio shine as a righteous state, a moral state, not one that gives way to immoral and unfair treatment of a person,"" Doll said in a press release from the Ohio Immigrant Alliance.

Soliman and his fate have become a rod among faith groups and activists in Ohio amid Trump's mass deportation effort. Faith leaders said that for those who believe in human dignity, Soliman's case has become a test not just of one man's fate, but of the values his supporters say America — and people of faith — are called to defend.

""I think our whole sense of human dignity and the individual rights, human rights, enter into this,"" said Franciscan Fr. Al Hirt, pastor of St. Francis Seraph Catholic Church in Cincinnati. ""It seems wrong. The bishops have been pretty good about support for immigration reform and doing it justly but it would sure be nice to see a little bit more Catholic voice supporting a person like this.""

Hirt signed an interfaith clergy letter backing Soliman. The Franciscan priest said it is important for Catholics to speak up in the face of all injustice, but particularly cases like Soliman's.

""I just could not find any reason why this imam lost his asylum status,"" said Hirt, who has worked in parishes in Cincinnati for 35 years. ""It just doesn't make sense. It's just another good person being rounded up, detained, not a criminal. He's not done anything wrong.""

Soliman, 51, came to the United States in 2014, fleeing Egypt after he was jailed and beaten for his journalism during the Arab Spring, pro-democracy and anti-government protests that started in 2011.

Soliman won asylum in the U.S. in 2018 under the first Trump administration. In the final month of the Biden presidency, immigration authorities moved to revoke it. Officials cited Soliman's past work with an Egyptian charity with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, though neither Egypt nor the U.S. lists the group as a terrorist organization. Court records show after Trump returned to office officials formalized the terrorism charges and his asylum was revoked on June 3.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detained Soliman at a routine check-in in July. He is challenging the change in his asylum status in court and has won a legal battle to remain in the Butler County Jail near Cincinnati, Ohio, while his case progresses.

Soliman's most recent hearing took place Sept. 3 in Cleveland Immigration Court. An immigration court hearing Sept. 25 will address the merits of his asylum claim.

Doll cited her faith in calling for help for Soliman.

""Our Catholic faith that unites us, Governor DeWine, stands firmly that every human person has the right to life, has a right to dignity,"" Doll said. ""That is not what Ayman is getting. He is being dismally treated and it's wrong. It's morally wrong, and you know it. So please, in the name of God, stand up for this human life.""

Rev. Joel Miller of the Columbus Mennonite Church invoked Scripture stories that call for fair treatment of immigrants, and Jesus' admonition to love our neighbor as ourselves.

""Our faith absolutely compels us to remember who we are and to act accordingly,"" Miller said. ""That's why we're here today in support of Imam Soliman. He is both the good Samaritan and the foreigner, who as a chaplain has tended to the needs of the hurt and even the dying, the very model of a neighbor.""

Bilal Ahmed, an attorney with the Center for American Islamic Relations in Ohio who has worked on Soliman's case, noted that earning asylum status is no easy feat.

""Getting asylum is a yearslong process. There's a number of different hoops you have to go through,” Ahmed said. “You're vetted at every single level. He had passed the asylum threshold and was on the verge of getting his green card, but it was stalled for a number of years … It is concerning to say the least.""

Ahmed said the support Soliman has received from the local community has been heartening.

""I went down to Cincinnati on the day that he was unfortunately detained and just everyone was coming out of nowhere,"" Ahmed said. ""All these people were showing up in support … Since then, there's been a whole coalition in Ohio trying to get him released.

""I was shocked that all these people knew Imam Ayman,"" Ahmed added. ""That's a testament to his interfaith work in the community. He's just going out and helping people regardless of their religious backgrounds.""

Among the many speaking out for Soliman was Rev. Adam Allen, a former Cincinnati Children's Hospital chaplain who said he lost his job after participating in a July 17 prayer vigil for Soliman. He worked side by side with Soliman, visiting children and families experiencing difficult times.

""I proudly worked to be the best chaplain that I can be, but Ayman is on a whole other level that I can only aspire to be,"" Allen said.

During his first week at the hospital, Allen shadowed Soliman.

""He moved fast,"" Allen said. ""He was hard to keep up with. We'd meet with one family, he'd calmly assess their spiritual needs, learn what they were going through, pray with them, and bring them hope. He would move so fast.""

Allen noted Soliman has a pacifying impact on patients. ""Once he had entered the room, all this calm and peace would come with him,"" Allen said. ""Then we'd move on immediately to the next patient. It felt like we were running.""

Soliman speaks Arabic, Spanish and English.

""When an Arabic-speaking family was approaching a difficult prognosis, he would leave the team a note saying, call me anytime, no matter what hour, and I will come in to support this family and he meant it,"" Allen said. ""I would have to tell new people. He really means it. That's what he wants. He'll be upset if you don't call him.""

Outside the hospital Soliman led a biweekly halaqah, or study circle, for Muslim students at the University of Cincinnati, taught the Quran to young Muslims and worked to make sure other volunteers at his mosque were recognized for their contributions.

Soliman also served on Cincinnati Children's ethics committee. Soliman holds master's degrees in Islamic studies and Muslim chaplaincy and is a doctoral candidate in the same field. His focus is on interfaith, islamophobia and bioethics. Soliman has served as an imam for over two decades and is a member of the Assembly of Muslim Jurists of America.

Tala Ali, a close friend who attended the same mosque and worked with Soliman in the Association of Muslim Chaplains, said she speaks to Soliman in jail every day. She said he has good and bad days but is encouraged by those telling his story.

""He said, 'I just want you to talk about me; to remember me.' Knowing he's not forgotten is what's keeping him alive and hanging on. He's got so many letters from people who have sent him Quran verses, Bible verses, sharing stories, sharing their prayers. … That has meant the world to him.""

Ali was there when Soliman was taken into custody and has been at the forefront of supporters telling his story ever since.

""I shouldn't have to sell a person for them to have their basic human dignities and rights recognized,"" she said. ""He fights so hard and cares so hard for everyone else's kids, and he has been through what he's gone through and he's so soft.”

As Soliman awaits his next hearing, his friends and supporters say they will continue to speak out, pray and rally for his release.

""He just gives and gives and gives,"" Ali said. ""He holds himself up to a standard that is so high without demanding those standards of others.""",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-09/9.12.25%20Ayman%20DeWine%20Press%20Conference.jpg?h=520a578a&itok=CNXYqsPH,N,,2025-09-12 12:56:43.278851

""Within the first few days of the [second] Trump administration they rescinded the policy and put forth a policy that is much less clear.""","The dreams of immigrants are ""just collapsing,"" Bishop Evelio Menjivar said before joining a panel of Catholic activists critical of the Trump administration’s immigration policy.

Menjivar, a Washington auxiliary bishop who himself is an immigrant, said immigrants' imploding dreams are because of instability caused by President Donald Trump's pervasive threat of deportation.

The government's immigration policy is among the biggest pastoral challenges in trying to attend to the needs of Catholics, the bishop said.

Speaking to journalists at Georgetown University on Sept. 11, Menjivar said most immigrants to the United States left their home countries because of political or economic instability — just as he did. Menjivar came to the United States as a young adult to escape civil war in El Salvador.

Menjivar was one of the immigration specialists and Catholic leaders participating in a panel held by Georgetown's Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life. The legal and Catholic social teaching specialists noted that Trump's aggressive pursuit of immigrants near churches and schools was frightening migrants away from religious services — a form of breach of religious liberty that the administration purports to champion.

The Washington bishop said he sees fear in the eyes of fellow immigrants and that it plays out in ways such as children not being sent to school, or not allowed to participate in after-school activities. They are opting out of school and activities because their parents ""don't want to risk"" their possible exposure to immigration enforcement, Menjivar said.

Miami Archbishop Thomas Wenski has spent time ministering at Alligator Alcatraz, the hastily assembled detention center in Florida that housed immigrants in conditions decried as unsafe and unsanitary as well as for environmental concerns.

In August, a federal District Court judge ordered the administration to wind down operations there by the end of October. On Sept. 4, a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals put that ruling on hold, pending the administration's appeal.

Wenski said the Trump administration's approach is ""to paint all immigrants as lawbreakers. But the reality is the law is breaking them. The law is inadequate to meet the needs of the nation. The law is antiquated, the law is ineffective and because of the ineffectiveness we have people living in this country for 20 years, 30 years, many with a legal work permit.""

Many have started businesses and become established. Now they are being told to go ""home,"" Wenski said.

Wenski and Bishop Mark Seitz of El Paso, Texas, who chairs the Committee on Migration of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, also spoke to reporters about the challenge of trying to explain Catholic teaching about immigration and human rights in ways that are heard by the people in the pews.

Nichole Flores, an associate professor of religious studies at the University of Virginia, said it is ""important to know the prevalence of misinformation about Catholic teachings. There is really straightforward Catholic teaching on this matter and it is misconstrued, bent and folded in lots of ways that are convenient for various political interests.""

Seitz said one way to persuade the Trump administration on inconsistencies on immigration might be through the topic of religious liberty.

""It is interesting, since the administration has put a large amount of emphasis on all kinds of rights including religious liberty, that we find ourselves in this conflict,"" the El Paso bishop said. ""We're happy for the opportunity to dialogue on these issues and to point out where we see inconsistencies that are damaging.""

Ashley Feasley, who is in residence at the Immigration Law and Policy Initiative at the Columbus School of Law at the Catholic University of America, pointed to what has been known as the ""sensitive locations"" policy started during the Obama administration and kept during the first Trump administration.

""It allows for, absent exigent circumstances, you cannot do immigration enforcement at schools, hospitals, places of religious worship,"" she said. ""Within the first few days of the [second] Trump administration they rescinded the policy and put forth a policy that is much less clear.""

Feasley said many bishops have spoken nationally about their concern about the ability for immigrants and refugees to receive the sacraments, to come to church.

Feasley noted that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection officers have pursued migrants into church grounds. Bishops have reported that immigrants are afraid to go to church.

""This is an area where, if the Trump administration is talking about religious liberty, that would go a long way to talk to the bishops about what is this policy, what can be done, particularly as it relates to houses of worship and people's ability to go about their daily lives and attend to the sacraments,” Feasley said.

""Particularly in this time,"" she said, ""our ability to be with our church and our faith is just so crucial. I think there are decision-makers who would understand this.""",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-09/IMG_0378.JPG?h=71976bb4&itok=a4m3TcDh,N,,2025-09-12 14:56:48.984234

Last week, protestors successfully turned an ICE vehicle away as it attempted to enter the facility. The facility became a focus of the efforts of immigration rights advocates ever since the town's mayor confirmed that the location was slated to be the main processing center for expanded ice operations in the Chicago area.

The facility is supposed to operate pretty much 24-hours a day for the next month and a half because of the start of operation Midway Blitz, which federal officials say targets undocumented people with criminal records.

Local immigration rights leaders say although they've not seen a mass surge in arrests by immigration agents, supporters do say there's been an increase in calls for legal help because of the immigration crackdown.

""Hotline call volume has been higher than at any point since January,"" Lawrence Benito, of Illinois Coalition of Immigrant & Refugee Rights. ""This indicates that ICE agents are present throughout the Chicagoland area and we need to remain vigilant with or without the National Guard present.""

The protest is scheduled to begin at 7 a.m. and last until 7 p.m..

Faith leaders, Broadview community members and concerned residents are expected to be out protesting. They said they refuse to be intimidated by what they say is the trump administration's efforts to target and mistreat immigrant communities.

Federal agents arrived on the scene, and Lopez said Funes was taken away.
Family members spoke to Funes Thursday morning, Lopez said, adding, “he gets mistreated verbally.
Meanwhile, Lopez said Funes’ daughter hasn’t been able to sleep.
“He is the main provider for his family, and I think he was just ripped apart from his family, and in a very unfair way,” Lopez said.","The goal was to have his daughter, who’s autistic and non-verbal, get rid of a bit more energy.

On Monday, they left the park and were on their way home when D.C. police pulled Funes over in Northwest D.C.

His sister, Estrella Lopez, said the stop was for an alleged failure to fully stop at a stop sign.

Neighbors, Lopez said, told another family member who got to the scene that they “witnessed my brother calmly asking questions as the officers were pulling him out of the car. My brother was trying to explain to them that my niece is autistic, and if he got out of the car, she was going to be crying in the car, and it was going to put her in a bad place.”

The stop came days before President Donald Trump’s crime emergency in D.C. was scheduled to end. Federal agents arrived on the scene, and Lopez said Funes was taken away.

He’s originally from Honduras, but has lived in D.C. for over 10 years and has applied for asylum. A judge recently gave him a year to find a lawyer and return to court.

“It’s been horrible,” Lopez said. “The only brother I have from mom and dad was taken like a criminal.”

According to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement records, Funes is in ICE custody and is currently at the Caroline Detention Facility in Caroline County, Virginia. Family members spoke to Funes Thursday morning, Lopez said, adding, “he gets mistreated verbally. It’s very cold. He says it almost feels like a freezer.”

Relatives are concerned, Lopez said, because Funes has asthma and needs medication “because he gets very anxious. And when he gets anxious, he triggers his asthma attacks.”

Now, they’re contacting various community groups and raising money to hire a lawyer, “so that we can potentially just get him out of there, where he is right now,” Lopez said.

Meanwhile, Lopez said Funes’ daughter hasn’t been able to sleep. She cries a lot, because she’s used to her dad telling her stories around bedtime, Lopez said.

“He is the main provider for his family, and I think he was just ripped apart from his family, and in a very unfair way,” Lopez said.

“He was trying to speak to the officers, telling them that he wanted to stay silent when they asked him for his status. He didn’t want to answer that question, because he felt discriminated. They didn’t stop him to ask him that, he thought they stopped him for something else.”

And no senior aide to Mr. Trump has as long a history working on Latin America policy.
Over 14 years as a Republican senator from Florida, Mr. Rubio pressed three administrations to go on the offense across the region.
But on Latin America, Mr. Trump and Mr. Rubio have long been in sync.
Later that day, Mr. Rubio hailed Mr. Bukele for transforming El Salvador from a country “known for violence” into “one of the most secure in the hemisphere.” The key, Mr. Rubio said, was Mr. Bukele’s leadership, and “the difficult decisions that had to be made.”","For decades across Latin America and the Caribbean, U.S. drug enforcement officials have tried to cut off narcotics trafficking by intercepting boats, trucks and even horses laden with drugs and arresting the smugglers.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said those efforts are not bold enough. He has helped steer the Trump administration toward a much more aggressive — and deadly — tactic: use military force to destroy suspected drug boats and kill the people on board, without a legal process.

“Interdiction doesn’t work,” Mr. Rubio said at a news conference in Mexico City last week when asked about the U.S. attack on a boat in the Caribbean. President Trump had boasted that the strike had killed at least 11 people.

“What will stop them is when you blow them up, when you get rid of them,” Mr. Rubio added. “And it’ll happen again. Maybe it’s happening right now, I don’t know, but the point is the president of the United States is going to wage war on narco-terrorist organizations.”

Mr. Rubio has cast himself as a top general in that war.

No senior Trump official has spoken more forcefully about the new campaign of violence against Latin American criminal groups and their allies. And no senior aide to Mr. Trump has as long a history working on Latin America policy.

Over 14 years as a Republican senator from Florida, Mr. Rubio pressed three administrations to go on the offense across the region. The son of anti-Communist immigrants from pre-revolutionary Cuba, he was motivated by his loathing for the Castro government and its allies, notably Venezuela — a stance well rewarded by Florida’s sizable population of expatriates from those countries.

Now, as both secretary of state and White House national security adviser, he is seizing his chance to turn words into action.

Mr. Rubio has long sought the ouster of leftist strongmen in the region, particularly leaders of Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua, whose governments he has called “illegitimate.” He has also helped engineer the administration’s mass deportations of immigrants, including to a notorious prison in El Salvador.

And the push for military action and the ouster of national leaders could draw criticism from a vocal wing of Mr. Trump’s movement that advocates greater military restraint in foreign policy. Those conservatives criticize “forever wars” and “regime change,” and some already view Mr. Rubio with suspicion, pointing to a history of “neocon” positions.

However, there are those Trump supporters and aides who applaud Mr. Rubio’s approach. They see him as reasserting an updated version of the Monroe Doctrine, an early-19th-century concept that justified U.S. intervention in Latin America.

Mr. Rubio hopes to “define a real new paradigm in the Western Hemisphere,” said Juan Gonzalez, who served as the top National Security Council official for the region in the Biden White House.

Mr. Gonzalez said Mr. Rubio’s scathing rhetoric — he has branded Nicaragua’s government “an enemy of humanity” — was meant to establish a “predicate” for further military action in the hemisphere.

His top target for now appears to be Venezuela, whose criminal groups the Trump administration has linked to the country’s autocratic leader, Nicolás Maduro.

Last month, Mr. Rubio ordered the State Department to increase a reward to $50 million for any information leading to Mr. Maduro’s arrest and conviction on U.S. drug charges.

During the first Trump administration, Mr. Rubio played a leading role in pushing the president to try to oust Mr. Maduro from power. Now, a recent U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean has prompted speculation over whether the administration will try to invade Venezuela and seize Mr. Maduro.

Mr. Rubio said last week that Mr. Maduro was a fugitive from American justice, after having been indicted by a grand jury in a New York federal court on drug trafficking charges in 2020.

“Nicolás Maduro is not a government or political regime,” he told reporters in Quito, Ecuador. “They are a terrorist organization and organized crime organization that have taken over a country so that they can become the leaders, so that they can become billionaires. And that is why they were indicted by the courts in the U.S.”

Mr. Maduro, who has pointed to Mr. Rubio as his main nemesis in Washington, issued his own warning on Sept. 1, before Mr. Trump announced the strike on the boat.

“Mr. President, Donald Trump, watch out, because Mr. Rubio wants to stain your hands with blood,” he said.

‘Blow Them Up’

Mr. Rubio’s Senate record stands at odds with Mr. Trump’s approach to some key issues. So since joining the administration, Mr. Rubio has softened some of his hawkish views, at least in public, on issues such as Russia and the promotion of democracy.

But on Latin America, Mr. Trump and Mr. Rubio have long been in sync.

“Rubio and Trump dovetail particularly well on Latin America,” said Mike Watson, the deputy director of the conservative Hudson Institute’s Center for Strategy and American Statecraft.

The two men share a drive to tackle what Mr. Watson called the region’s “chaos and disorder” in the form of narcotics and migrants.

“Under Secretary Rubio, the State Department is working to implement President Trump’s vision to make our region secure, stable and prosperous,” Tommy Pigott, the department’s deputy spokesperson, said when asked for comment for this article. “That means eliminating the cartels, ending illegal mass migration and pushing out China’s exploitative practices.”

When it comes to narcotics, Mr. Trump and Mr. Rubio cast the flow of fentanyl, cocaine and other drugs into the United States as a matter of national security that justifies the use of deadly force.

During his visit to Ecuador, Mr. Rubio said the Trump administration was ready to help partner governments “blow up” criminal groups.

“There’s long been a bipartisan consensus around treating cartels as a law enforcement matter rather than a military matter,” Mr. Watson said. “Trump and Rubio are no longer treating this issue that way. They are happy to use the military.”

And while past U.S. presidents have discussed migration from Central and Latin America mostly in social and economic terms, Mr. Rubio has embraced the notion that the flow of people also “poses a national security threat.”

Citing his own parents, Mr. Rubio once argued for more compassionate federal immigration policies before shifting right on the issue perhaps most dear to the Republican Party’s base: immigration.

Mr. Rubio and his aides argue that migrant trafficking will ebb if crime groups and their allies in governments are dismantled, and that clamping down on migration will choke off a key income source for the gangs.

In keeping with Mr. Trump’s imperial approach to the Western Hemisphere, Mr. Rubio wants to roll back Latin America’s growing economic ties with China. For years, he spoke of Beijing’s global influence as a security threat, though he has tempered that language recently as Mr. Trump seeks a summit with China’s leader.

After becoming secretary of state, Mr. Rubio began his first official trip with a visit to Panama, where he toured the Panama Canal and pressed Panamanian leaders over the operation of two ports on the waterway by a Hong Kong company. Following Mr. Trump’s threats to seize control of the canal, the company agreed in March to sell the ports to a U.S.-led investment group, although the Chinese government has objected.

Mr. Rubio also raised the issue of China’s presence during his second trip to the region, visiting Jamaica, Guyana and Suriname in March.

And Mr. Rubio is on a mission to bolster the standing of right-wing figures in the region. He has taken up a pet cause of Mr. Trump: the defense of Jair Bolsonaro, the conservative former president of Brazil who was officially charged with plotting a coup. Mr. Rubio announced on social media on Thursday that the United States would respond to the decision earlier that day by Brazil’s Supreme Court to convict Mr. Bolsonaro and sentence him to 27 years in prison.

Mr. Rubio has tried to quell concerns among some leaders who worry the United States is once again flexing its imperial muscle. In Mexico, where Mr. Rubio has designated several cartels as terrorist groups, President Claudia Sheinbaum has warned Washington for months against any attempt at unilateral U.S. military action on Mexican soil.

During his visit to Mexico City last week, Mr. Rubio stressed that the two governments had “reached a level of historic cooperation” in recent months — one he said “respects the integrity and the sovereignty of both countries.”

Drugs and Deportations

As a senator, Mr. Rubio was a passionate champion of human rights and the rule of law abroad.

In a speech a decade ago, he called for a U.S. foreign policy built on military and economic strength, along with “clarity regarding America’s core values,” which he said included “a passionate defense of human rights” and “the strong support of democratic principles.”

But in going on the offensive in Latin America, Mr. Rubio has muted those views.

In addition to the boat attack, Mr. Rubio has played a major role in other aggressive policies that encompass actions without due process, including the deportation of hundreds of people he and the president say are members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuela-based gang that they have designated a foreign terrorist organization. A vast majority did not have criminal records or clear, documented links to the gang, and courts have blocked further summary removals for now.

Under a deal Mr. Rubio reached with President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador in February, many of those deported have been sent to a prison that human rights groups call dangerous and “inhumane.”

Mr. Rubio has flatly dismissed the criticism as “anti-Bukele propaganda.”

A U.S. government document released in court this week said the Trump administration agreed to pay $4.76 million to El Salvador to temporarily accept up to 300 “members” of Tren de Aragua.

Rights groups have also harshly condemned Mr. Bukele’s government more broadly for what they call mass detentions, torture and a crackdown on democratic institutions.

His approach, though, has drastically reduced once-rampant crime and gang activity in the country.

That makes Mr. Bukele a model leader, in Mr. Rubio’s view.

After visiting Panama in February, Mr. Rubio traveled on to El Salvador to greet Mr. Bukele. The 44-year-old president, who projects a casually cool image, wore aviator sunglasses and a shirt unbuttoned low on his chest as he hosted the American diplomat at his bucolic lakeside compound.

Later that day, Mr. Rubio hailed Mr. Bukele for transforming El Salvador from a country “known for violence” into “one of the most secure in the hemisphere.”

The key, Mr. Rubio said, was Mr. Bukele’s leadership, and “the difficult decisions that had to be made.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/11/multimedia/00dc-rubio-01-tqfb/00dc-rubio-01-tqfb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 10:57:59.750857

UNHCR issued comprehensive guidance in affirmance of sex or gender based social groups in its 2002 Gender Guidelines.
The BIA’s first published gender decision in 1996, Matter of Kasinga, was consistent with both Acosta and UNHCR guidance.
The BIA’s only positive social group decision following the adoption of these criteria was Matter of A-R-C-G- in which the government stipulated to the cognizability of the social group.
Allowing the social group ground to function as intended—filling gaps in protection—is not equivalent to adding a new protected ground.","On July 18, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), the highest administrative immigration tribunal in the United States, issued a decision, Matter of K-E-S-G-, holding that a “particular social group” (PSG), a key term in the legal definition of a refugee, cannot be defined by sex (the term used in the decision in lieu of “gender”), whether alone or in combination with nationality.

The asylum seeker in this case, a young Salvadoran woman, was terrorized by members of the MS-13 intent on forcing her to submit to them sexually. She fled the country only after the police refused to respond to her pleas for help, and her efforts to shake off her tormentors by relocating twice were unsuccessful.

The ruling in K-E-S-G- is unpersuasive, yet it is also entirely consistent with a decades-long trajectory in BIA jurisprudence. As someone who has litigated these cases since the 1990s, I can say that for years, the Board has pursued two related objectives – rendering the PSG ground virtually impossible to satisfy by imposing ever-more rigid and illogical requirements, while ensuring an interpretation that would place most women fleeing gender violence outside the ambit of refugee protection. These goals have the full support of the Trump administration, which took aggressive steps during its first term to do the same. The administration’s position is especially significant because immigration and BIA judges are not independent decision-makers, as are Article III judges, but are employees of the Department of Justice, required to follow Attorney General rulings. In his second term, the Trump Justice Department has continued its restrictive rulings on social group and gender. Following shortly on the heels of the BIA’s decision in Matter of K-E-S-G-, Attorney General Bondi issued two additional rulings which continue this trend by limiting social group and gender claims; respectively, Matter of R-E-R-M & J-D-R-M- and Matter of S-S-F-M-.

Moving Goalposts of the “Particular Social Group” Definition

Under U.S. law, derived from the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol, a refugee is an individual with a well-founded fear of persecution “on account of” race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. The Convention drafters did not elaborate on the meaning of “particular social group,” but international refugee scholars have commented that its inclusion was to fill a possible gap in protection for claims not captured by the other four grounds, and subsequent case law in the United States and other jurisdictions has been consistent with that reading.

In 1985, the BIA had its first opportunity to interpret particular social group in Matter of Acosta. Noting the absence of interpretive guidance, the Board applied the doctrine of ejusdem generis which provides that a general term, included in a list of more specific terms, should be construed consistently with the specific terms. Reasoning that the other four Convention grounds refer to traits that a person cannot change, or should not be required to change to avoid persecution, the Board concluded that a “particular social group” is defined by immutable or fundamental characteristics, giving examples such as “sex, color, or kinship ties” or “shared past experience such as former military leadership or land ownership.”

Acosta’s immutable/fundamental approach, often referred to as the “protected characteristics” test, was cited approvingly by tribunals in other countries, including Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. At the same time as Acosta was decided, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) began highlighting the relevance of the particular social group ground to claims by women seeking protection in its guidance. In three directives issued in 1985, 1991, and 1993, UNHCR recommended that although gender is not one of the five Convention grounds, women facing gender-based persecution could qualify as a particular social group and come within the refugee definition. UNHCR issued comprehensive guidance in affirmance of sex or gender based social groups in its 2002 Gender Guidelines. Although UNHCR guidance is not binding, the Board and other courts interpreting U.S. refugee law often look to UNHCR as persuasive authority, given that it provides authoritative interpretation on the international Convention from which U.S. law derives.

The BIA’s first published gender decision in 1996, Matter of Kasinga, was consistent with both Acosta and UNHCR guidance. It applied its immutable/fundamental analysis to grant protection to a woman fleeing female genital cutting, finding that she was a member of a social group defined by gender combined with other characteristics, including ethnicity and uncut status.

But only three years later, in Matter of R-A-, the BIA began to backtrack. It reversed a grant of asylum to a Guatemalan woman fleeing domestic violence, ruling that Acosta’s immutable/fundamental test was only a threshold, and that applicants must also show the proposed social group “was recognized and understood to be a societal faction,” which the BIA ruled, the applicant had failed to do. Attorney General Janet Reno vacated Matter of R-A-. She directed the BIA to decide the case once proposed regulations addressing gender claims which her Department of Justice had issued, were finalized – which, unfortunately, never occurred. (Notably, a February 2021 Executive Order committing to the promulgation of regulations on social group and gender claims by the Biden administration also never came to fruition.)

Beginning in 2006, the BIA formally ruled that a PSG could no longer be defined solely by immutable/fundamental characteristics. In a series of decisions, it added two additional requirements – particularity and social distinction. Particularity requires that a group be defined in a way that provides a “benchmark” for who is in, and who is out, while social distinction, previously referred to as “social visibility,” requires proof that the group is “perceived as a group by society.” In a previous article with Stephen Legomsky, we explained why we and other scholars disagree with the Board’s imposition of these two requirements.

Requiring proof of particularity and social distinction had a draconian impact on the success of social group claims, including those based on gender. The BIA’s only positive social group decision following the adoption of these criteria was Matter of A-R-C-G- in which the government stipulated to the cognizability of the social group.

The decision in A-R-C-G– was an early casualty of the first Trump administration. It was vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who wrote that “[h]ad the Board properly analyzed the issues,” rather than accepting the government’s stipulation, “it would have been clear that the particular social group was not cognizable.” During Biden’s term, Attorney General Merrick Garland reinstated A-R-C-G- as precedent, but Bondi vacated A-R-C-G- once again, by way of Matter of S-S-F-M- mentioned above.

What’s Next in K-E-S-G-?

The K-E-S-G- case was sent back to the immigration court for consideration of another form of relief, however its flawed reasoning will be challenged on appeal as it begins to be applied in other cases. In contrast to the BIA, a number of circuit courts have repeatedly recognized social groups based on gender, including groups defined solely by gender and nationality. In a series of decisions as early as 2005 and continuing to the present, courts have accepted gender plus nationality groups across a range of claims involving domestic violence, femicide, sexual assault, ritual harm inflicted on widows, and female genital cutting.

If upheld, the decision in K-E-S-G- would seriously undermine protection for women fleeing violations of their most fundamental human rights. But the weight of authority runs counter to its holding, and the decision’s rationales are particularly unconvincing.

The BIA disregards the growing body of contrary precedent, acknowledging only two of the many circuit court decisions that have recognized social groups defined by gender and nationality. It then attempts to discount one of those two by erroneously claiming that it was decided under a “prior definition” of social group.

The BIA leans heavily on the Third Circuit’s decision in Chavez-Chilel, which rejected the proposed group of “Guatemalan women.” But Chavez-Chilel is a confused and deeply flawed opinion. It misstates the governing law by holding that, for a group to be cognizable, every member must possess a well-founded fear of persecution. That has never been the standard. This reasoning improperly collapses two distinct elements of the refugee definition: the existence of a protected ground and the well-foundedness of the applicant’s fear. Numerous decisions have affirmed that each element must be considered separately.

The Board’s application of the social group requirements to the case before it – Salvadoran women – is perhaps the least persuasive aspect of the decision. While it concedes that the group’s defining characteristics are immutable, it rejects the claim on the basis of particularity and, having done so, declines to address social distinction. In effect, the entire rejection rests on its particularity analysis. The Board concludes that the group lacks particularity because it could encompass women of “varying ages, socioeconomic statuses, marital statuses, family backgrounds, and lifestyles.” Yet particularity requires only that a group be defined with sufficient clarity to establish its boundaries, and “Salvadoran women”—despite internal diversity—constitutes a group with clear and ascertainable limits. This is consistent with other findings of PSG in similar cases, such as the 1990 decision in Toboso-Alfonso, ruling that “Cuban homosexuals” is a cognizable group, which the BIA has more recently referenced as meeting the particularity and social distinction requirements.

In concluding—and perhaps in tacit recognition of the weakness of its legal analysis—the BIA turns to a quasi-policy justification for rejecting gender and nationality groups. It asserts that recognizing sex and nationality based social groups would amount to creating “another protected ground” under the statute, and that nothing in domestic law, the Refugee Convention and Protocol, or their negotiating history supports such an intent.

Whether the BIA genuinely believes that recognizing such groups would have this effect is debatable. In any event, the argument is peculiar. Allowing the social group ground to function as intended—filling gaps in protection—is not equivalent to adding a new protected ground. If it were, the recognition of every cognizable social group would constitute the creation of a new ground, a claim that has never been made.

Equally confounding is the BIA’s invocation of the Convention, the Protocol, and their negotiating history. UNHCR has for decades urged recognition of gender-defined social groups. Moreover, numerous State parties, through both legislation and jurisprudence, expressly recognize gender alone or gender-nationality groups.

The BIA’s efforts to justify its rejection of gender nationality social groups are ultimately unpersuasive. But K-E-S-G- will not be the final word. It is now up to the federal courts to address the issue. After the Supreme Court’s decision in Loper Bright, the federal courts are no longer bound by Chevron deference to “reasonable” agency interpretations of ambiguous statutory terms. One can only hope they reach the same conclusion as the First Circuit in de Pena-Paniagua.

[I]is not clear why a . . . group defined as “women” or “women in country x” – without reference to additional limiting terms – fails either the ‘particularity’ or “social distinction” requirement. . . . [I]t is difficult to think of a country in which women are not viewed as “distinct” from other members of society. . . It is equally difficult to think of a country in which women do not form a “particular” and “well-defined” group of persons.

In the meantime, the BIA is obligated to decide each case on its own record, so attorneys should continue to argue gender/nationality groups, along with narrower groups which may be more likely to be accepted.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-11391582461.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 10:58:03.950332

They landed in Seoul on Friday afternoon local time — only after sitting in limbo for 24 hours while President Trump told his government to consider letting them stay and train American workers, South Korean officials said.
ICE planning documents suggest that agents were not necessarily targeting temporary South Korean workers last week.
“It was an accident” that ICE picked up the South Korean workers, Mr. Kuck argued.","Almost 500 people were detained during a raid of a Georgia battery plant owned by two South Korean manufacturers last week, the largest immigration enforcement operation at one location in the history of the Department of Homeland Security.

But in at least one instance, officials admitted a worker was employed legally and forced him to leave the country anyway, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times.

The Times obtained internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrest records for 11 of the detained workers. Six entered the country with B1 or B1/B2 visas, which are issued for business trips of up to six months. Four entered through the visa waiver program, which allows travel for 90 days. In one case, the worker’s status was unclear. The records stated that all but one of the 11 were working unlawfully at the time of the raid, but did not provide details about why.

In the one exception, agents said that although the worker “has not violated his visa,” the local ICE field office director “mandated” that he be considered someone who was voluntarily departing the country. The file noted that he worked for the South Korean engineering firm SFA, which did not respond to a request for comment.

Two-thirds of the people arrested on Sept. 4 were South Koreans, and nearly all of them were flown back to their home country this week. They landed in Seoul on Friday afternoon local time — only after sitting in limbo for 24 hours while President Trump told his government to consider letting them stay and train American workers, South Korean officials said.

“What ICE is doing here is illegal, and people should be held to account,” said Charles Kuck, an Atlanta immigration lawyer who is representing some of those who were detained. “If we’re turning from ‘let’s enforce the law against people who violate the law’ to ‘let’s enforce the law against everybody regardless of their legal status,’ I think we’ve changed the kind of country that we’ve become.”

The fallout from the operation at the plant was the latest example of the dragnet-like nature of Mr. Trump’s immigration policy and how it can conflict with other stated policy objectives, such as bolstering production in the United States. It also highlighted a strategy used by multinational firms to temporarily import workers into the United States to establish new operations.

The question of who will perform both the heavy manual labor and sophisticated technical jobs associated with advanced factories has taken on greater urgency in recent years as the federal government has pushed advanced manufacturing, often led by foreign companies.

The Trump administration has told its trading partners to either make their goods in America or pay steep tariffs, and leveraged hundreds of billions of dollars in investment commitments from South Korea, Japan and the European Union. The plant, which is owned by the carmaker Hyundai and the battery supplier LG Energy Solution, is weeks from completion. Contractors were installing the sophisticated equipment needed to make batteries for electric vehicles.

Representatives from the battery plant joint venture did not return requests for comment, nor did spokespeople from the White House and the Department of Homeland Security.

The B1 and combination B1/B2 visa — the kind held by several Georgia plant workers — is commonly used for business and tourism-related travel lasting less than six months, especially for consulting technical or scientific roles. A total of 4,906 B1/B2 visas were issued to South Koreans in the first five months of this year, according to government records, a small slice of the 2.86 million issued to all countries over the same period.

Robert Marton, an immigration lawyer with auto manufacturer clients other than Hyundai, said he had relied on B1 visas more in recent years as other programs for bringing in foreign workers had become more competitive.

Companies routinely bring in employees from elsewhere with H-1B visas, which allow someone to stay for several years. But those are capped in number, expensive to apply for and in high demand.

“The H-1B program has been restrictive as it’s been for years,” Mr. Marton said. “So I think lawyers like us are looking at workarounds and getting people in quickly.”

Obtaining a B1 visa requires submitting proof of the worker’s credentials, such as degree certificates, and proof of employment in someone’s home country. It is supposed to be used for consulting with business associates, negotiating contracts or attending conferences.

Jongwon Lee, a lawyer in Duluth, Ga., who has worked with South Korean companies operating in the state, said the official guidance left little clarity on how expansively the B1 visa could be interpreted.

“Installing software, giving instructions of how to set up machines, is that consulting or not?” Mr. Lee said. “Nobody knows. No update, no instruction, no case law.”

Instead, enforcement can play out in real time. ICE planning documents suggest that agents were not necessarily targeting temporary South Korean workers last week.

The original warrant for the raid listed only four Hispanic individuals. According to Mr. Kuck, agents did not have any Korean speakers on hand during the raid and had to use apps to translate.

“It was an accident” that ICE picked up the South Korean workers, Mr. Kuck argued. “They just transported everybody to the jail to sort it out later.”

The raid was part of an expansive deportation effort that the White House has choreographed throughout the United States this year, roping in several agencies that typically did not handle immigration matters as a way to meet Mr. Trump’s campaign promises. Stephen Miller, the White House’s deputy chief of staff, has targeted 3,000 arrests a day. Work site enforcement is seen as a way to put large numbers on the board.

Nearly all of the 317 ​detained South Korean workers had planned to return home to rest but may consider returning to the construction site later, officials in Seoul said this week.​ One worker chose to stay in the United States with relatives who have green cards.

Typically, when foreigners accept a “voluntary departure,” it means they have acknowledged that they violated immigration laws and will not be allowed back into the United States. In this case, removal documents did not contain an admission of wrongdoing, and South Korean officials have demanded that the workers not face adverse consequences.

Along with the South Koreans, ICE agents picked up workers from Japan, China and Indonesia at the Georgia plant. The Mexican Consulate in Atlanta said 23 of its citizens had been detained, and the Colombian Consulate said it was aware of 19 Colombians.

Some of those from Central and South America, according to lawyers and an organization called Migrant Equity SouthEast, had valid work permits and were legally present in the country with Temporary Protected Status or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Both are programs that the Trump administration has sought to dismantle.

Short-term business visa programs have been abused in the past — by employees who overstay their limits, as well as by employers. A pending class action lawsuit alleges that a contractor for a Hyundai subsidiary recruited engineers and technicians to work at a Georgia warehouse on TN visas. That visa category is intended for educated professionals from a prescribed list of occupations, but the workers say they were instead forced to do security, cleaning and packaging jobs.

It’s not clear whether anything similar was underway at the Hyundai-LG plant. Julia Solórzano, the legal and policy director of the Centro de los Derechos del Migrante, an immigrant rights group that helped bring that case, has been coordinating the response to the raid. Unlike workers in such operations in the past, she said, those who were not flown back to Seoul have not been released on bond.

“In this raid, it is notable that they seem to have taken so many of the workers into detention,” Ms. Solórzano said. “It makes it very hard to support people, and it creates conditions that make it hard for workers to fairly assess their immigration options.”

The Supreme Court did not address the lawfulness of the removals under the Alien Enemies Act.","Washington — More than 300 lawsuits challenging many of President Trump's second-term plans and his administration's actions have been winding through the federal courts over the past few months. But a handful now may be poised for review by the Supreme Court, or are getting close to it.

The cases involve major policies enacted by Mr. Trump in the months since he returned to the White House, and several of them have already been before the high court, though during earlier stages in the proceedings.

In those instances, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to grant it emergency relief, allowing it to enforce its immigration policies, in some instances, or terminate officials at independent agencies, in others.

In the wake of those interim decisions, lower courts have continued to hold proceedings and issue rulings addressing the merits of the Trump administration's actions. If the Supreme Court agrees to step into these disputes, they will present the initial opportunities for the justices to address the legality of Mr. Trump's plans.

""I'm expecting this to be the term of Trump,"" Dan Epps, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said of the new Supreme Court term set to begin Oct. 6.

The justices are already set to hear blockbuster cases on redistricting, campaign finance and state laws barring transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.

Many of the disputes involving Mr. Trump's actions test the limits of the president's power, and rulings could have massive implications for his policies on the economy and immigration, as well as his reshaping of the executive branch.

The Trump administration has sought emergency intervention from the Supreme Court roughly two dozen times so far, and it has fared well in its bids to continue enforcing its plans while legal challenges continue.

But whether the president will prevail when the Supreme Court examines the lawfulness of his actions remains to be seen. Still, in some instances — like his efforts to fire certain executive officers — the Supreme Court has signaled that Mr. Trump may have the power to terminate members of certain independent agencies.

""What's at stake is the country's commitment to the rule of law,"" Epps said. He added that the new term could also bring a ""huge sweeping victory"" for executive power, particularly if the Supreme Court finds that courts should give broad deference to the president on matters like immigration.

Tariffs

The dispute over Mr. Trump's tariffs imposed on nearly every U.S. trading partner will be the first in which the Supreme Court will decide the legality of one of Mr. Trump's key policies.

The high court said Tuesday that it is taking up two cases involving the global tariffs, which question whether Mr. Trump has the power to impose the sweeping duties under a federal emergency powers law. The justices will hear arguments in early November, a rapid timeline for the court.

The Justice Department had asked the Supreme Court to step into the legal battle after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled late last month that many of Mr. Trump's tariffs issued under the emergency powers law are illegal.

The Federal Circuit divided 7-4 in finding that the law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, did not authorize the president's global tariffs. But the duties remain in place for now, as the Federal Circuit wiped away a permanent injunction granted by a lower court that blocked the Trump administration from imposing the levies.

The dispute tests a major centerpiece of the president's economic agenda, and the Justice Department has warned that a ruling against the government would put the frameworks of trade deals negotiated with half a dozen countries at risk.

Termination of temporary legal protections for Venezuelan migrants

Soon after Mr. Trump took office, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem took steps to end legal protections that had been granted to hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants by the Biden administration through a program known as Temporary Protected Status.

In response to a lawsuit filed by the National TPS Alliance and seven individuals who were shielded from threat of deportation, a federal judge granted preliminary relief and postponed the date Noem's plan was set to take effect.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit declined to put that decision on hold while proceedings moved forward, but the Supreme Court granted the Trump administration emergency relief, allowing Noem to end the legal protections for now.

Meanwhile, the 9th Circuit heard arguments in July on the Trump administration's effort to terminate the TPS designation for Venezuela, and late last month, a three-judge panel sided with the plaintiffs.

The judges found that the TPS holders were likely to succeed in their argument that Noem lacked the authority to set aside an earlier extension of the program for Venezuelan migrants.

The impact of that decision, however, is limited because the interim relief granted by the Supreme Court at an earlier stage in the case is still in place.

Alien Enemies Act removals

Mr. Trump issued a proclamation in March that invoked the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport Venezuelan migrants who are suspected of being members of the gang Tren de Aragua. The Trump administration has deported hundreds of migrants it claims are gang members under the wartime law, which gives the president the authority to remove citizens of a ""hostile nation"" if it is engaged in an ""invasion or predatory incursion"" of the U.S.

A ""60 Minutes"" investigation found that many migrants deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act didn't have criminal records.

The proclamation immediately sparked litigation, including two court fights that have already been up to the Supreme Court on its emergency docket. In the first case, brought in federal district court in Washington, D.C., the high court said any challenges to removals under the Alien Enemies Act must be brought in the judicial district where a migrant is being held.

But the Supreme Court also said that migrants at risk of deportation under the 1798 law must receive notice that they are subject to removal and the opportunity to challenge it.

In the wake of that decision, judges in Texas, Colorado, New York and California have blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants being held in their regions.

The second case to reach the Supreme Court arose when Venezuelan migrants detained by immigration officials at a facility in the Northern District of Texas sued to challenge their removals under the Alien Enemies Act.

The high court temporarily blocked the migrants' deportations in April and later sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit for further review after finding the Trump administration had not provided the migrants with enough notice — 24 hours — of their impending deportations.

The Supreme Court did not address the lawfulness of the removals under the Alien Enemies Act.

After holding additional proceedings, a divided three-judge panel on the 5th Circuit rejected Mr. Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to remove Venezuelan migrants in the Northern District of Texas. The court said in its 2-1 decision that there was no predatory incursion or invasion by Tren de Aragua — preconditions to invoking the law.

The 5th Circuit is the first appeals court to address whether Mr. Trump properly invoked the 18th century-law.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson suggested the Trump administration will appeal, saying the 5th Circuit's decision ""will not be the final say on the matter.""

Firings of members of independent agencies

Mr. Trump has spent his months back in the White House pushing the bounds of executive power, including by firing officials at independent agencies appointed by former President Joe Biden.

Mr. Trump's attempts to remove members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board, Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Consumer Product Safety Commission and Federal Trade Commission, to name a few, have all led to legal challenges by the ousted officials.

In cases brought by Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris, members of the NLRB and MSPB, respectively, a lower court ordered them to be reinstated to their roles. Federal judges in Washington, D.C., ruled their firings violated federal laws that shielded them from being terminated without cause and cited a 1935 Supreme Court decision that said Congress could enact removal protections for members of multi-member boards that met certain criteria.

The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court for emergency relief allowing it to fire Wilcox and Harris while their cases proceed, and the court gave the president the green-light to remove the officials for now.

Meanwhile, the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., heard oral arguments on Mr. Trump's bid to fire Wilcox and Harris in May but has not yet issued a decision.

But in a different case, involving Mr. Trump's attempt to fire FTC Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, the Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to decide whether the removal protections for members of the trade commission violate the separation of powers. The administration wants the high court to take up the dispute over Slaughter's removal before the appeals court has ruled.

At least one justice, Brett Kavanaugh, believes it's time for the Supreme Court to address the legality of removal restrictions for members of independent agencies. In a concurring opinion in a case involving Mr. Trump's firing of three members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, Kavanaugh said there is a ""at least a fair prospect"" that the Supreme Court will either narrow or overrule Humphrey's Executor v. United States, that 1935 decision that upheld removal protections for certain executive officers.

""[W]hen the question is whether to narrow or overrule one of this Court's precedents rather than how to resolve an open or disputed question of federal law, further percolation in the lower courts is not particularly useful because lower courts cannot alter or overrule this Court's precedent,"" he wrote.

Birthright citizenship

The president's plan to end birthright citizenship has already been before the Supreme Court, but the justices did not address the constitutionality of his executive order. Instead, the dispute involved whether federal judges have the ability to issue nationwide injunctions, or orders that universally block enforcement of a policy beyond the plaintiffs in a case.

The high court said judges are limited in their ability to grant that sweeping relief, but left open other avenues like class-action lawsuits or challenges to an agency rule brought under the Administrative Procedure Act, a federal law governing the agency rule-making process.

Following that June decision, several groups of plaintiffs amended their initial lawsuits and asked district courts to certify as classes children covered by Mr. Trump's executive order and would be denied birthright citizenship.

In one of those cases, brought by a group of four states — Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon — a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled 2-1 in July that Mr. Trump's executive order is unconstitutional.

The White House said in response to the decision that it looks forward to ""being vindicated on appeal.""

The ruling from the 9th Circuit was the first from an appeals court to address the constitutionality of Mr. Trump's executive order.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/09/10/fd1f2e69-29e9-45d4-b0f6-1444933fab09/thumbnail/1200x630g2/ae08fc9338409810347b1e40bcf793d3/gettyimages-2222462629.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 06:57:04.981625
