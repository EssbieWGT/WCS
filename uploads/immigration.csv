,Human Rights,2025-12-21 11:15:31+00:00,Common Dreams,Immigration Detention Is Reproductive Violence - Common Dreams,"gabriellag-watson, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.commondreams.org/opinion/immigration-detention-reproductive-violence,"Reports show this has been the deadliest year in immigration detention since 2004.
For nearly a century after Ellis Island first opened, immigration detention was relatively rare.
The Reagan administration imposed the nation’s first immigration detention quota, ensuring that thousands of migrants—many fleeing violence or seeking family reunification—would be incarcerated at any given time.
Today, the US operates the largest and fastest-growing immigration detention system in the world.
In July, Congress budgeted $45 billion for ICE to build more immigration detention centers, and an additional $30 billion for arrests and deportation.","Early this month, The 19th reported that a 22-year-old mother named Nayra Guzman was kidnapped by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on her way to the neonatal intensive care unit to see her newborn daughter, just days after a long and complicated delivery. While her daughter remained hospitalized, Guzman—still recovering from a C-section and managing Type 1 diabetes—was taken to an immigration detention center and held for 34 hours without adequate medical care, food, or water, or access to a breast pump.

This is not an isolated failure. It is reproductive violence by design.

Immigration in the US has always been about control—controlling who belongs, who gets to build a family, and who is deemed worthy of safety and care. Early laws like the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act and the 1924 Immigration Act codified eugenicist ideas about which communities were deemed “desirable” and which the country sought to exclude. During World War II, Japanese Americans were subject to mass incarceration, families were separated, pregnancies endangered, and women sterilized. More recently, between 2017 and 2021, more than 4,600 children were kidnapped at the US border—1,360 of whom still remain unaccounted for.

Reports show this has been the deadliest year in immigration detention since 2004. Next year is projected to be even worse. People are dying from untreated infections, suicide, dehydration, and preventable complications. Investigations have documented hundreds of human-rights abuses—including pregnant people miscarrying, being shacked across their stomachs during transport, placed in solitary confinement, and denied translation during medical procedures.

We must dismantle the systems that cage people, separate families, and dictate who is allowed to parent safely.

Major medical, public health, and advocacy organizations have long recognized that pregnant and postpartum people should not be incarcerated. Under the Obama administration, ICE was directed to avoid the detention of pregnant people whenever possible, citing serious health risks and the agency’s inability to provide appropriate care. Under both Trump terms, those protections were rolled back. And last month, Intercept uncovered that the Trump administration has been actively concealing how many pregnant people are in ICE custody.

What we don’t know should scare us even more. Until recently, the Department of Homeland Security was required to publish semiannual reports detailing how many pregnant, postpartum, and lactating people were detained, and what care they received. Since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term, those reports have stopped, and Congress quietly dropped the reporting requirement altogether.

Without even basic reporting requirements, what happens inside detention becomes nearly impossible to track, and people vanish. They are transferred in the middle of the night, across state lines, with no transparency, and no way for their families to know where their loved ones are or if they’re safe.

What we are seeing today are the consequences of a system rooted in racialized policing and mass incarceration—one that criminalizes migration and is built to financially benefit from human suffering. Today, detention quotas and private contracts dictate immigration policy.

For nearly a century after Ellis Island first opened, immigration detention was relatively rare. But by the 1980s, as the ""War on Drugs"" expanded the criminal legal system, immigration enforcement adopted the same punitive logic. The Reagan administration imposed the nation’s first immigration detention quota, ensuring that thousands of migrants—many fleeing violence or seeking family reunification—would be incarcerated at any given time. After 9/11, detention intensified with the “War on Terror” and the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. Private prison companies secured lucrative federal contracts, new facilities opened nationwide, and immigration violations—many of them civil, not criminal—were now punished with incarceration. ICE’s own data shows roughly 72% of people in detention have no criminal record. Yet thousands are incarcerated for civil violations that carry no criminal penalty under federal law.

As prison beds became profitable, people became commodities. Today, the US operates the largest and fastest-growing immigration detention system in the world. In July, Congress budgeted $45 billion for ICE to build more immigration detention centers, and an additional $30 billion for arrests and deportation. The two biggest private prison companies, CoreCivic and GEO Group, have reported record-breaking profits and described the Trump administration as offering “unprecedented growth opportunities.”

As climate change, war, and economic and political instability drive global displacement and migration, the US has responded with cages instead of care. And apathy feels endless. Politicians who call themselves “pro-life” support policies that detain pregnant people, criminalize pregnancy, and separate families. The American people, exhausted and complacent, have learned to tune it out. Silence has become a coping mechanism.

Working in policy, I live with a constant tension: I know change is incremental, that the system moves slowly, but I am also an abolitionist. I do not believe in prisons or borders. I believe health and reproduction are human rights, and that no one should be imprisoned for migrating or for being pregnant. I think of my policy work as harm reduction—protecting people’s dignity and autonomy now, as we fight for collective liberation in the future.

Calls to release pregnant people from detention are growing. In November, the Democratic Women’s Caucus declared the treatment of pregnant, postpartum, and nursing people in ICE custody “unacceptable,” and last week, Illinois Rep. Delia Ramirez introduced a resolution urging congressional action.

But that demand cannot come from advocates and politicians alone—change depends on ordinary people determined to not look away. Our outrage is long overdue. Call your representatives and let them know that cruelty is a political choice we refuse to normalize. Join groups organizing on the ground, donate to local defense funds, and talk about this in your circles.

In the long term, we must dismantle the systems that cage people, separate families, and dictate who is allowed to parent safely. That vision is at the heart of reproductive justice—because every struggle is connected, and every win brings us closer to the world we deserve.

Senator Bernie Moreno called out this video posted earlier this week of the Columbus police chief and mayor.

“Entering the U.S. through a non-designated port of entry, without a visa, or overstaying a visa is a federal crime. The two in this video should be aware that impeding federal law enforcement efforts is also a crime,"" Moreno said.

This weekend, the Party for Socialism and Liberation in Columbus is planning a protest. It's scheduled for 3 p.m. on December 21 at 455 Park Meadow Road in Westerville.

""Our immigrant neighbors are here trying to live their lives just like everybody else,"" said Kiera Toliver, an organizer. ""They deserve to feel safe in our community, and a lot of the hateful things that are being said about them are simply not true.""

Toliver and her group hosted a planning meeting Saturday, and the line to get in wrapped around the side of the building.

""We are seeing a super high turnout today, which is amazing,"" Toliver said. ""We want everyone to know what's going on, let them know that we are here to fight back and how we're gonna do that.""

South Sudan received the designation in 2011 after it seceded from Sudan to become an independent nation.
Many South Sudanese TPS holders have settled in Maine, where officials have spent years trying to draw younger workers to its aging labor force.
For decades, numerous South Sudanese arrivals were granted refugee status before 2011, and then Temporary Protected Status.
According to a State Department travel advisory last month, South Sudan is designated as a level 4 destination, the highest ranking.","Alex Lomong is a man of many labels: He’s a Virginia resident, was a decorated Division I athlete on the Ohio State University track team, and is a middle-distance runner whose times put him in sight of qualifying for the Olympic trials.

He is also an immigrant from South Sudan who was granted Temporary Protected Status. Now, with the Trump administration’s plan to end TPS designation for South Sudanese nationals on Jan. 5, Lomong is one of many facing an uncertain future in the United States.

“Ever since I’ve been here, this is the only home I knew,” Lomong, 28, told NBC News.

Born in a small village in what is now South Sudan, Lomong fled with his mother to Kenya in 2003 as violence at home escalated. He came to the United States in 2009 at age 11 on a student visa and quickly emerged as a standout runner. The end of TPS could mean that he, as well as hundreds of others, will be forced to return to a country with widespread famine and political instability.

“Being deported there is basically like a suicide mission,” Lomong said.

TPS provides temporary legal status to people whose home countries are deemed critically unsafe. South Sudan received the designation in 2011 after it seceded from Sudan to become an independent nation. TPS for South Sudanese people has been extended multiple times over the years, and many have depended on it to remain in the United States.

“You have people who have been relying on that status for at least 14 years, who have paid their taxes, worked, built lives here, and contributed to the U.S. economy,” said Mariam Masumi, an immigration lawyer who works with TPS holders in Virginia.

South Sudan remains deeply unstable, with ongoing violence and mass displacement. The United Nations has warned of widespread hunger, saying millions face food insecurity amid conflict and economic collapse. The Trump administration announced on Tuesday that South Sudan is now among a group of five countries newly subject to full U.S. entry restrictions and travel limitations.

Many South Sudanese TPS holders have settled in Maine, where officials have spent years trying to draw younger workers to its aging labor force. For decades, numerous South Sudanese arrivals were granted refugee status before 2011, and then Temporary Protected Status. They fled violence in their home country to brave Maine’s blistering cold and rebuild their lives.

South Sudanese people have since opened grocery stores and churches, and became nonprofit leaders.

John Ochira is the previous president of the South Sudanese Community Association of Maine and founded the Community Champions League, a soccer program for low-income players in the greater Portland area. A naturalized citizen, he came to the United States in 2005 when he was 17 years old.

“I feel super lucky to have come when I came,” Ochira said. “Having come here as a refugee, I was able to naturalize, but not everybody around me has had the privilege to get naturalized.”

TPS allows people already in the U.S. to stay and work legally for a limited time while conditions in their home country are unsafe, but it does not provide a path to permanent residency, said Ruben Torres, advocacy and policy manager at the Maine Immigrants’ Rights Coalition. Refugee status is granted to people outside the U.S. who face persecution and are resettled with legal status that can lead to citizenship, he said.

Matthew Long, a reverend at Portland’s Sudanese Fellowship Presbyterian Church, said that his community of South Sudanese worshippers panicked after hearing the news of TPS ending. Some, he said, have had trouble finding affordable legal representation.

“We should all be protected by the law in this country, but this is not the case right now,” Long said.

Issac Gang, an associate professor at George Mason University and the U.S. Missions representative for the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement, said that the Sudanese community in Washington, D.C., is also preparing for the possibility of deportations in January.

“This status has been around for a while, and a good number of our people have enjoyed the status. Given what’s happening in South Sudan, we never expected it to be terminated, because you look at the war and the civil war and the problems, we didn’t expect a termination,” Gang said.

In October, the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan issued a stark warning that political corruption and crisis is leading to an increase in armed violence, deepening grim human rights conditions. According to a State Department travel advisory last month, South Sudan is designated as a level 4 destination, the highest ranking.

“Do not travel to South Sudan for any reason. U.S. citizens are at risk due to unrest, crime, health, kidnapping, and landmines,” the advisory stated.

“South Sudan still remains very much in a dire humanitarian crisis. Hundreds of thousands of people just even in the last year have left the country,” Masumi said. “It’s not even just a reintegration at this point. You’re having people return to a country where, although yes, there’s no full-scale civil war, there’s still a significant amount of problems within the country.”

Now, facing the prospect of being sent back to famine and conflict, TPS holders have few viable pathways to remain in the United States.

“There are very limited options for folks. There may be other venues or pathways for immigration that they could qualify under, but it is very difficult to access them,” Torres said.

Torres said that the asylum system is so backlogged that cases can take eight to 10 years, and the traditional refugee admissions program has been replaced by a new Trump administration system that advocates argue does not follow the requirements Congress set in 1980.

“Under normal circumstances, TPS holders who lose status might shift to another category like asylum, an H-visa, or another visa they qualify for. But those avenues are largely closed, leaving almost no alternative pathways for people to remain in the country,” Torres said.

Even with the possibility of being returned to South Sudan without any living relatives there, Lomong still holds onto his dreams of becoming a U.S. Olympian, like his brother Lopez, who was a 2008 U.S. flag bearer. He also still hopes to build a life here without the constant fear of having to leave.

“I think it’s sad that we are just all a bunch of pawns in this big chess game, and we don’t have a choice to make any moves,” he said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251210-Alex-Lomong-mn-1540-ff5822.jpg",N,,2025-12-21 06:56:43.715454

There are a lot of continuities with the past and similarities between then and now.","MILES PARKS, HOST:

Earlier on today's show, we heard about the influential force of Turning Point USA in conservative politics today. Vice President Vance actually attended one of the organization's events in October, and he made a very specific claim about immigration that pops up a lot on the political right these days.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JD VANCE: If you go back to the 1920s, the United States passed an Immigration Reform Act that effectively cut down immigration to close to zero for 40 years in this country. And what happened over those 40 years? The many, many people who had come from many different foreign countries and different foreign cultures, they assimilated into American culture.

PARKS: We wanted to dig into this idea that immigrants used to want to assimilate more than they do now and that Americans used to welcome immigrants more because of that. Is any of that true?

To learn more, we called Nancy Foner. Her new book, ""Immigration: How The Past Shapes The Present,"" is coming out next year. Professor Foner, welcome to the show.

NANCY FONER: Thank you for having me.

PARKS: So let's just start there. How did immigrants assimilate 100 years ago, and, in turn, how did Americans welcome those immigrants?

FONER: Well, initially, I should say, we're talking about the immigrants who came at the turn of the 20th century, and they were overwhelmingly from Europe and from Southern and Eastern Europe. And many of them were Jewish immigrants and Italian immigrants. And initially, they were not welcomed, and, in fact, they were viewed in very negative ways. They were seen as racially inferior whites who were never going to assimilate, that they were polluting America's racial stock.

PARKS: Well, it's so interesting. I feel like there's this other claim that I see popping up a lot, especially I - when I'm not hosting this program, I cover voting in elections, and this comes up a lot when you talk about the idea of noncitizens voting in American elections, that - basically the idea is that when immigration mostly came from European countries, that the assimilation was easier. And what are your thoughts on that idea?

FONER: Well, I mean, there's this myth about immigrants in the past, you know, learning English right away, which was not true. Today, immigrants are actually more, not less, likely to speak English. Another popular myth is this rags to riches that, you know, immigrants in the past and Ellis Island immigrants came with nothing, they quickly and vastly improved their progress. And just like today, they didn't make great leaps forward. They made, you know, incremental steps up the occupational ladder.

Like my grandfather - I always say, a good example - who came to New York. He lugged seltzer bottles up on the Lower East Side. He eventually co-owned a garage in Brooklyn. But it wasn't until the next generation, the second generation, that his four sons all went to college and moved into professional jobs, and we see the same thing today. We have, you know, something like 35% of immigrants in the U.S. today over 25 have a bachelor's degree or higher.

PARKS: So then why do these myths persist then?

FONER: Well, I think that - well, there are political reasons. You know, this nativism is appealing to - certainly, when we hear it from JD Vance, immigration has been a big part of their political outreach, so to say, to their base of non-college-educated and evangelical whites and who are very concerned about the population change in the U.S. So there's a lot of racial resentment. And also the economic changes in America, where they're not doing well. There's been, you know, a decline in manufacturing jobs, and well, in the past, in post-World-War-II period in America, America was, you know, very prosperous at that time. The people who are unhappy now were growing up and moving into the workforce in a better economic time, and they're blaming immigrants. And this has been a successful ploy of the Republican Party.

PARKS: Can I ask - big picture, I guess, as somebody who studies immigration - how much of the current moment you do just feel deja vu every time you read a headline?

FONER: Well, we do feel deja vu. There are a lot of continuities with the past and similarities between then and now. And certainly, we've had Nativist movements. There were the Know Nothings. There was the anti-Mexicans. There was the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, and Asians were excluded basically for a very long time in American society. So it is not that we have welcomed with open arms immigrants. We have had this in the past.

But I think the pressures are going to be for - in continued immigration for demographic reasons. I mean, the United States is aging, and the baby boomers, as of 2030, will all be 65 and older. And so the question is, who's going to do their jobs? We're going to need workers. Employers are going to be pushing for immigrants to come in for that reason and are likely to, I think, lead to continued levels of fairly high immigration.

PARKS: That's Professor Nancy Foner. Thank you so much for talking with us.

FONER: Oh, well, thank you for having me.

Witness testimony described an agitated Dugan, whose colleague, Judge Kristela Cervera, testified — damagingly — that she was uncomfortable with how Dugan managed the federal agents she was outraged to find hanging around outside her courtroom.
The handcuffs, the public arrest at Dugan’s workplace, the media circus — none of it was normal, or justified.
One of the most distressing aspects of the Dugan trial was the prosecution’s through-the-looking-glass invocation of the rule of law and the integrity of the courts.
Churches, day care centers and peaceful suburban neighborhoods are also “safe” environments for armed, masked federal agents.","According to the Eastern District of Wisconsin’s Interim U.S. Attorney Brad Schimel, freshly appointed to his position by President Donald Trump, the federal trial of Milwaukee Judge Hannah Dugan had nothing to do with politics. “There’s not a political aspect to it,” Schimel told reporters after Dugan’s felony conviction on charges she obstructed U.S. immigration agents as they tried to make an arrest inside the Milwaukee courthouse. “We weren’t trying to make an example out of anyone,” Schimel said. “This was necessary to hold Judge Dugan accountable because of the actions she took.”

Schimel didn’t say whether Dugan’s very public arrest and perp walk through the courthouse was also necessary, along with the social media posts by Trump’s FBI director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi, crowing about the arrest and sharing photos of Dugan in handcuffs.

There is no doubt that the Dugan case was highly political from the start.

As a coalition of democracy and civic organizations in Wisconsin declared in a statement after the verdict, Dugan’s prosecution threatens the integrity of our justice system and “sends a troubling message about the consequences faced by judges who act to protect due process in their courtrooms.”

But Schimel is right about one thing: Dugan’s trial this week was mainly about “a single day — a single bad day — in a public courthouse.”

That narrow focus helped the prosecution win a conviction in a confusing mixed verdict. The jury found Dugan not guilty of a misdemeanor offense for concealing Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, the defendant she led out a side door while immigration agents waited near the main door of her courtroom to arrest him. At the same time, the jury found Dugan guilty of the more serious charge of obstructing the agents in their effort to make the arrest. The two charges are based on some of the same elements, and Dugan’s defense attorneys are now asking that her conviction be overturned on that basis.

An observer watching the trial from afar with no inside knowledge of the defense strategy might wonder why Dugan’s defense team didn’t enter a guilty plea on the misdemeanor charge and then strongly contest the felony obstruction charge as an outrageous overreach in a heavily politicized prosecution. That might have led to a more favorable mixed verdict, in which the jury found that Dugan was probably guilty of something, but that it did not rise to the level of a felony with a potential penalty of five years in prison.

I’m no expert, but daily reports from the trial this week gave me the strong impression that things weren’t going well for Dugan as long as witnesses and lawyers focused on a blow-by-blow account of the events of April 18. Witness testimony described an agitated Dugan, whose colleague, Judge Kristela Cervera, testified — damagingly — that she was uncomfortable with how Dugan managed the federal agents she was outraged to find hanging around outside her courtroom.

It’s not surprising that the jury agreed with the prosecution that Dugan was not cooperative and that she wanted to get Flores-Ruiz out of her courtroom in a way that made an end-run around the unprecedented meddling of federal immigration enforcement inside the courthouse. Like other judges and courthouse staff, she was upset about the disruption caused by ICE agents stalking people who showed up to court.

But, as Dean Strang, a law professor at Loyola University Chicago School of Law and a long-time Wisconsin criminal defense lawyer, told me in April just before he joined the defense team and stopped talking about the case to the press, “Whatever you think of the actual conduct the complaint alleges, there is a real question about whether there’s even arguably any federal crime here.”

The government’s behavior was “extraordinarily atypical” for a nonviolent, non-drug charge involving someone who is not a flight risk, Strang added.

The handcuffs, the public arrest at Dugan’s workplace, the media circus — none of it was normal, or justified. When Bondi and Patel began posting pictures of Dugan in handcuffs on social media to brag about it, “what is it they are trying to do?” Strang asked. His conclusion: “Humiliate and terrify, not just her but every other judge in the country.”

The Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, Voces de la Frontera, and Common Cause-Wisconsin agree with that assessment, writing in their statement reacting to the conviction that Dugan’s felony conviction threatens the integrity of our justice system as a whole, and undermines the functioning of the courts by scaring away defendants, witnesses and plaintiffs who are afraid they might be arrested if they show up to participate in legal proceedings.

But that big picture perspective was not a major feature of the defense’s closing arguments, which relied heavily on raising reasonable doubt about Dugan’s intentions and her actions during a stressful and chaotic day.

That’s frustrating because, contrary to Schimel’s assertions, the big picture, not the events of “a single bad day” is what was actually at stake in this case.

One of the most distressing aspects of the Dugan trial was the prosecution’s through-the-looking-glass invocation of the rule of law and the integrity of the courts.

The federal agents called to the stand, the prosecutors in the courtroom, and Schimel, in his summary of the case, made a big point about the “safety” of law enforcement officers.

Repeatedly, we heard that immigration agents prefer to make arrests inside courthouses because they provide a “safe” environment in which to operate.

In his comments on the verdict, Schimel emphasized that Dugan jeopardized the safety of federal officers by causing them to arrest Flores-Ruiz on the street instead of inside the courthouse: “The defendant’s actions provided an opportunity for a wanted subject to flee outside of that secure courthouse environment,” Schimel said.

This upside-down view of safety has become a regular MAGA talking point, with Republicans claiming that when citizens demand that masked agents identify themselves or make videos of ICE dragging people out of their cars, they are jeopardizing the safety of law enforcement officers — as opposed to trying to protect their neighbors’ safety in the face of violent attacks by anonymous thugs.

Churches, day care centers and peaceful suburban neighborhoods are also “safe” environments for armed, masked federal agents. But their activities there are making our communities less safe.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Kelly Brown Watzka, delivering the prosecution’s closing argument, told the jury it must draw a line against judges interfering with law enforcement, or else “there is only chaos,” and that “chaos is what the rule of law is intended to prevent.”

But chaos is what we have now, with federal agents terrorizing communities, dragging people out of courthouses and private residences, deporting them without due process and punishing those who stand in their way in an attempt to defend civil society.

The real questions raised by Dugan’s case are whether we believe the “safety” of the agents making those dubious arrests matters more than the safety of our communities, and whether we want the courts to be able to regulate the conduct in their own courthouses as a check on the government’s exercise of raw power.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Dugan1.jpeg,N,,2025-12-20 23:57:11.144538

President Trump weighed in on the election earlier this year, putting his support behind Nasry “Tito” Asfura.","The State Department on Friday restricted the visas of two Honduran officials over national security concerns, claiming they tried to impede on a special vote count following the nation’s election last month.

The Trump administration revoked a visa for Mario Morazán, a magistrate of the Electoral Justice Tribunal. Marlon Ochoa, a member of the Honduras National Electoral Council, was denied a visa. Both men are a part of the country’s LIBRE party, which holds the legislative majority in the Central American nation.

In a statement, the department pointed to Section 221(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to justify its moves. The section, per officials, “generally bars entry to those whose entry or proposed activities have potentially serious adverse U.S. foreign policy consequences.”

“The United States will not tolerate actions that undermine our national security and our region’s stability,” the statement reads. “We will consider all appropriate measures to deter those impeding the vote count in Honduras.”

The ban comes nearly 20 days after the election, which remains undecided among two candidates due to inconsistencies with the vote count.

President Trump weighed in on the election earlier this year, putting his support behind Nasry “Tito” Asfura. As of Saturday, Asfura is narrowly leading LIBRE candidate Salvador Nasralla, also a conservative, by roughly 0.6 percent, according to The Associated Press.

Nasralla acknowledged in a recent Reuters interview that Trump’s endorsement of his opponent likely “hurt” his chances of winning and ripped the algorithm after a brief website malfunction. But the candidate did not accuse the U.S. leader of meddling in the election.

After a special count was called, the president said there would be “hell to pay” if Asfura did not win.

“If he doesn’t win, the United States will not be throwing good money after bad, because a wrong Leader can only bring catastrophic results to a country, no matter which country it is,” he continued at the time. “Tito will be a Great President, and the United States will work closely with him in order to ensure the success, with all of its potential, of Honduras!”

Neither candidate has declared victory in the race.

Trump also issued a pardon for former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández in December. The embattled ex-leader, who was sentenced to 45 years behind bars in July 2024 for collaborating with drug traffickers, was released from prison after clemency was granted.

Hernández thanked Trump and is maintaining his innocence.”

Nasralla pushed back on the move, saying the former president “deserves punishment in Honduras.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/AP25353688103948-e1766247354869.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-20 21:57:18.202332

This is not the justice we believe in or stand for in Massachusetts or as Americans.
Congressman Seth Moulton has filed legislation that would allow those detained by ICE agents to sue them in federal court.
The bill, the National Oversight and Enforcement of Misconduct (NOEM) Act, named after DHS Secretary Noem, would allow detainees whose constitutional rights were violated by federal immigration enforcement officers to sue those officers in federal court.
During a rally at Faneuil Hall in Boston on Friday, he said “Massachusetts won’t be complicit in ICE cruelty.” “What we are seeing is immigration enforcement masquerading as authoritarianism.","Massachusetts political leaders are ramping up messaging against federal agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as the Trump Administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration continues.

The federal agency is under attack from Bay State Democrats, including the likes of U.S. Senate candidate and Congressman Seth Moulton (MA-06), Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) and Governor Maura Healey, who all claim ICE has acted “inhumanely” towards detainees and those they seek to arrest.

This week, Gov. Healey sent a letter to ICE leadership, demanding they stop using private aircraft at Hanscom Field airport in Bedford to remove illegal immigrants they have detained.

“It has come to my attention that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as part of its disturbing and anti-American deportation tactics, is using private aircrafts at Hanscom Field airport in Massachusetts to quickly remove residents and sever them from their family, friends, and counsel without due process of law,” Healey wrote in her letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, whose department oversees ICE, and Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons.

“Flying these residents out of state and away from their support systems and legal counsel — often within hours of arrest — is intentionally cruel and purposely obstructs the due process and legal representation they are owed. This is not the justice we believe in or stand for in Massachusetts or as Americans. This practice must stop,” she said, going on to claim that “a significant majority of people detained by ICE in Massachusetts over the past year have no criminal convictions or charges.”

The Massachusetts Democratic Party is echoing Healey’s call, calling the ICE deportation flights out of Hanscom a “disregard for due process.”

“The Department of Homeland Security’s use of unmarked private planes to rapidly remove ICE detainees at Hanscom is yet another example of the Trump administration’s disregard for due process. We know that 73 percent of individuals detained by ICE have no criminal history. They are people who live and work and are part of the fabric of our communities,” said MassDems Chair Steve Kerrigan. “Through these unmarked removal flights, the Trump administration continues to circumvent the legal process, transporting individuals thousands of miles away from their families and legal counsel.”

One illegal immigrant recently detained and set to be deported by ICE sent a 63-year old woman flying nearly 80-feet and has left her intubated with a brain bleed at Massachusetts General Hospital. The horrific hit-and-run happened on December 7, when 23-year old Peruvian national Brando Diaz-Sanchez struck the victim and never stopped. He had been driving without a driver’s license and had been charged with reckless driving less than two months prior. He entered the U.S. in 2022 during the Biden Administration, whose immigration policies have been derided as “catch and release” by Republicans

The battle with ICE doesn’t stop with the governor’s office. Congressman Seth Moulton has filed legislation that would allow those detained by ICE agents to sue them in federal court.

The bill, the National Oversight and Enforcement of Misconduct (NOEM) Act, named after DHS Secretary Noem, would allow detainees whose constitutional rights were violated by federal immigration enforcement officers to sue those officers in federal court. Moulton’s office says the legislation would ensure ICE and other federal immigration officers can be held liable in the same way any state or local law enforcement officer would be when they violate the constitutional rights of detainees.

“Right now, if an ICE officer violates someone’s Fourth or Fifth Amendment rights, victims have almost no legal recourse,” Moulton said in a press release. “The NOEM Act fixes that. ICE is not above the law — and if its officers break the law, they should be held accountable in court.”

Moulton introduced the legislation just weeks after a highly-publicized feud with ICE and Acting Director Lyons after the congressman called for the agency to be prosecuted.

The Herald has reached out to ICE for comment on Moulton’s bill. The agency had some strong words about it already, posted Saturday on its official X account.

“Congressman, our ICE officers and agents enforce the laws YOU pass and we arrest the criminals who break the laws YOU pass,” the post stated. “Why are you so keen on defending criminal illegal alien murderers, rapists, drug dealers, child sex offenders — the WORST of the worst we’re taking off your streets to protect YOUR constituents?”

Moulton’s 2026 primary competitor, Senator Ed Markey, has also taken aim at the immigration agency. During a rally at Faneuil Hall in Boston on Friday, he said “Massachusetts won’t be complicit in ICE cruelty.”

“What we are seeing is immigration enforcement masquerading as authoritarianism. The Trump Administration has sought to end birthright citizenship, dehumanize immigrants with racist rhetoric and unleash masked ICE agents into our communities, violently abducting innocent people,” Markey said. “I’ve pressed the Boston field office and ICE leadership on ICE’s aggressive tactics, its brutal dragnet approach to enforcement, and the lack of transparency and accountability that we are seeing, and I am going to continue to demand answers from them that hold ICE accountable for their actions.”

Last month, the Joint Committee on Public Safety and Homeland Security heard oral arguments in support of the Safe Communities Act, which would prohibit state and local law enforcement from notifying ICE about illegal immigrants in non-criminal matters.",https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ICEBlock_App_Trump_08164.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-12-21 06:56:57.905512

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is pushing back against claims from Senate Democrats that 2025 has become the deadliest year in decades for immigrants held in federal custody.

In a post to X Saturday, DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin slammed allegations made by the Senate Judiciary Democrats’ account, claiming ""30 immigrants have died in ICE custody since Donald Trump took office, making 2025 the deadliest year in ICE detention since the early 2000s.""

McLaughlin swiftly fired back, accusing Senate Democrats of ""trying to twist data to smear ICE law enforcement.""

""There has been NO spike in deaths. Consistent with data over the past decade, death rates in custody are 0.00007%,"" she said.

McLaughlin also argued that those held in ICE custody receive appropriate medical care and a ""higher standard of care"" than most U.S. prisons.

""As bed space has rapidly expanded, we have maintained a higher standard of care than most prisons that hold U.S. citizens, including providing access to proper medical care,"" she said. ""For many illegal aliens this is the best healthcare they have received their entire lives.""

The response came just one day after DHS touted that ICE's ""Christmas gift to Americans"" came early as agents pulled more illegal immigrants with criminal records off the streets.

""This holiday season, ICE is working around the clock to ensure silent nights and safer streets,"" DHS said in its announcement.

With reports of immigrants detained and pop-up protests across the Twin Cities, some suburban police departments are taking the initiative to explain the roles they play — and do not play — in federal immigration operations.

St. Paul and Minneapolis both passed separation ordinances years ago, spelling out that local employees, including police, are not in the business of enforcing federal immigration law.

After Immigration and Customs Enforcement made the Twin Cities the focus of its Operation Metro Surge this month, several suburbs shared statements to address their own policies.

Their message: City-appointed officers will not be involved with ICE operations unless the arrest involves someone accused of crimes in their jurisdictions. They’re emphasizing that no community member, whether a citizen or not, should be afraid to call 911 or cooperate with local investigations.

Operation Metro Surge

ICE’s stepped-up enforcement operations in Minnesota began on Dec. 1, with reportedly at least 100 federal officers from out of state.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a news release last Friday that ICE agents had arrested more than 400 undocumented immigrants in Minnesota since the operation began.

According to DHS, the operation targets “criminal illegal aliens” with prior convictions for serious crimes such as sexual assault, domestic violence and gang affiliation, as well as individuals with final deportation orders.

Although DHS has not released a complete list of those arrested, the agency has said they’ve included “pedophiles, rapists and violent thugs” who were “allowed to roam Minnesota’s streets thanks to sanctuary policies.”

While initially focused on Minneapolis and St. Paul, the operation has expanded into suburbs such as Burnsville, Brooklyn Park and Chanhassen, according to media reports.

Burnsville incident

State Sen. Lindsey Port, DFL-Burnsville, said she was “horrified” by reports that masked agents have detained the parents of young children, leaving them without the care of their parents.

Port was referring to a Dec. 6 case that made the news involving the arrests of two parents at a Burnsville home. ICE agents left behind a 7-year-old to be cared for by others, KARE-TV reported.

“I am horrified at the recent actions by federal law enforcement agents in Burnsville and across Minnesota,” Port said in a statement. “The videos of masked federal agents aiming guns at crowds and forcing their way into homes are scenes from a dystopia. This is no way to make our communities safe.”

The city of Burnsville said in a statement that it is actively monitoring federal immigration activity in the city.

“Burnsville Police do not engage in federal immigration enforcement and are typically not notified of federal operations,” the statement reads. “Burnsville police officers enforce only state and local laws. Burnsville Police do not check someone’s immigration status. Our role is to keep everyone in our community safe.”

The statement continued that residents and community members should never hesitate to call 911, regardless of their immigration status. It also stated that officers may respond to gatherings or related protests that occur “to ensure safety for everyone present.”

Other cities have issued statements in response to ICE activity or citizen concerns. What follows is a sampling of east metro statements.

Woodbury statement

Woodbury community members have reported concerns about recent ICE activity in the city, according to Public Safety Director and Police Chief Jason Posel.

“Woodbury Public Safety was not aware of this activity and does not proactively work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement,” the department said in a statement. “We do not inquire about immigration status, nor do we enforce federal immigration law. Our goal is for everyone to feel safe interacting with our officers and comfortable calling 911 in an emergency.”

The statement went on to express that the city understands ICE activity can create stress among community members, especially immigrants, and that Woodbury is “committed to being a welcoming and inclusive community.”

“To our Somali residents and all members of our immigrant communities: you are valued, and your safety and well-being remain a priority,” the statement continued.

Stillwater statement

Stillwater officials issued a statement Wednesday afternoon on social media after citizens at Tuesday’s city council meeting asked them to address the potential for ICE activity in the city.

“Recent federal immigration enforcement activity in our region has understandably caused fear and uncertainty for some members of our community, particularly among our immigrant neighbors,” city officials said in the statement. “We want to share some important information and provide reassurance.”

Police officers do not enforce federal immigration law, the post states. Federal immigration enforcement decisions are made at the federal level and are outside the city’s control, according to the post.

Stillwater police officers do not ask about immigration status and do not conduct immigration enforcement, the post states. “We want everyone to feel safe calling 911, reporting a crime, or asking for help in an emergency,” according to the statement.

The Stillwater Police Department does not detain a person solely based on federal civil immigration violations, and the Stillwater City Council is not considering a cooperative agreement with ICE, according to the post.

“Should federal enforcement activity occur in Stillwater, the city’s priority would be the safety of everyone involved, maintaining calm, and reducing the risk of harm,” the post states. “Local police would be present only to support de-escalation and public safety.”

Rosemount statement

The city of Rosemount shared in a statement that it is committed to “protecting and serving all of our residents. Regardless of how long you’ve called Rosemount home.”

The Rosemount Police Department stated that they enforce state and local laws, not federal laws.

“If federal immigration enforcement were to arrive in Rosemount, our officers would not play an active role,” the city said in a statement. “However, they may respond to ensure physical safety near the scene, including the safety of neighbors or spectators.”

Rosemount officers will not ask about the immigration status of community members, or provide information “to anyone attempting to identify an immigration violation, or detain a person solely for a federal immigration violation,” the statement said.

Residents are encouraged to contact law enforcement as necessary, regardless of their immigration status.

Attorney general opinion

The Minnesota Attorney General’s Office also has weighed in with a recent opinion concerning 287(g) agreements, which are agreements that state and local governments can enter into with ICE authorizing state or local law enforcement officers to perform certain immigration duties.

According to the attorney general’s office, county sheriffs are not able to enter into 287(g) agreements themselves; the authority to enter into 287(g) agreements rests with the county board of commissioners rather than with sheriffs.

Sheriffs also may not detain immigrants “solely on the basis of a civil ICE detainer request if state law does not otherwise authorize law enforcement to detain them.”",https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ICEBlock_App_Trump_08164.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-12-20 21:57:25.525019

The letter, addressed to Interim President Robert M. Groves, cites the March detainment of Georgetown postdoctoral researcher Badar Khan Suri as part of a broader crackdown on academics engaged in pro-Palestinian advocacy and urges Georgetown to take measures protecting academic freedom and student rights. Groves, in his response to the letter, reaffirmed the university’s commitment to its freedom of expression and speech policy and its concern for the implications of Khan Suri’s arrest.

The letter from the rapporteurs asks the university to detail the measures it is taking to protect student rights and requests any additional comments on the allegations. The rapporteurs also request information on how the university plans to prevent repression of expression protected under articles 19 and 21 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), a UN treaty that commits signatory nations to respect individuals’ civil and political rights, such as freedoms of religion, speech and assembly.

“Please provide information about the measures your university intends to take to protect the rights of students and scholars, particularly Dr. Badar Khan Suri as well as other student activists and human rights defenders at Georgetown University expressing their solidarity with victims of human rights violations in Gaza and the West Bank,” the letter reads.

In an email to the rapporteurs Dec. 12, Groves responded to the letter, saying the university is committed to the freedoms of speech and expression.

“Our long-standing, university-wide Speech and Expression Policy protects our community members’ rights to free and open inquiry, deliberation and debate, even on controversial or objectionable ideas,” Groves wrote in the email. “Our policy ‘encourages and protects the free expression of ideas within the broadest possible latitude… and the untrammeled verbal and nonverbal expression of ideas.’”

The rapporteurs’ letter says there have also been cases of mistreatment and detainment among non-citizen scholars from Cornell University, Tufts University, Minnesota State University and Columbia University. These universities received similar letters addressed to their respective provosts and presidents.

“These individuals, many of whom held valid immigration status, have faced violations of their rights to liberty, due process, freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, religion and access to justice,” the letter reads. “Reports indicate a pattern of arbitrary detention, transfers to remote facilities, denial of medical care, religious discrimination and the use of unsubstantiated national security.”

In the letter, Special Rapporteurs Mary Lawlor, Farida Shaheed, Irene Khan, Gina Romero and Gehad Madi said they condemn the U.S. government’s financial pressure on universities and their research.

“We are equally concerned over the coercive measures taken by the U.S. government against universities and the consequent actions by, for instance, Columbia University,” the letter reads. “The State has a responsibility to respect and protect academic freedom, including the autonomy of academic institutions by virtue of their special role in society, which is underpinned by a range of human rights, including the rights to freedom of opinion, expression, association and peaceful assembly.”

The letter comes after changes in immigration policy and decreased research funding resulting from the downsizing of the U.S. Department of Education (DOE) under President Donald Trump. At a university town hall Dec. 12, Georgetown extended a series of budget constraints implemented last April to address the financial measures taken by the federal government.

The letter urges university officials to cease any ongoing potential violations, saying that the university must ensure a safe environment for peaceful expressions of solidarity with the Palestinian people.

“While awaiting a reply, we urge that all necessary interim measures be taken to halt the alleged violations and prevent their re-occurrence and in the event that the investigations support or suggest the allegations to be correct, to ensure the accountability of any person(s) responsible for the alleged violations,” the letter reads. “We also urge you to uphold the fundamental right to freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly in line with the international norms and standards and thus ensure a free and safe environment for all those peacefully expressing solidarity with Palestinian people, in particular regarding Dr. Badar Khan Suri.”

Groves said the university has multiple programs aimed at fostering an environment conducive to free expression among students and faculty.

“The University recognizes that we must balance our commitment to openness and international engagement with our obligations to comply with applicable laws, including those immigration laws and regulations that pertain to hosting international scholars and students,” Groves wrote. “Georgetown takes seriously its obligations to diligently serve and support the safety of all members of this community as they work toward expanding their knowledge and enhancing ours.”",https://thehoya.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/UN_Rapporteurs.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 19:57:55.174628

On Wednesday, an Arizona Daily Star reporter saw three agents wearing vests that read ""ERO,"" for ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations branch, stationed just north of the pedestrian exit at the DeConcini port.

Taxi drivers who work near the port said the agents have been there almost every day, as well as in the southbound vehicle lanes, since the week of Dec. 8. Locals also report seeing ICE agents questioning travelers before they leave the U.S. through the Morley pedestrian crossing and the Mariposa port of entry.

""They ask where you're from, where you live, how many days you were here"" in Arizona, Rosario Díaz, 68, said in Spanish, moments after entering Arizona on foot through the DeConcini port on Wednesday.

The Nogales, Sonora, resident said she regularly visits her U.S. citizen son in Arizona, and the interrogations bother her.

""This has never happened before,"" she said.

Agents aren't stopping all travelers; a white Star reporter crossed on foot without being questioned. Regular border-crossers say agents seem to be targeting people who look Hispanic.

The presence of ERO agents in Nogales appears to be related to a recent ICE memo, reported this month by HuffPost and Texas Public Radio. The memo described a Department of Homeland Security plan to deploy ICE agents to the border this month, in order to detain undocumented migrants, or people who have overstayed their U.S. visas, as they try to return home for the holidays.

Agents will target commercial buses heading to Mexico, HuffPost's story said.

Neither ICE nor DHS have responded to the Star's requests for clarification of the new operation at the southern border.

A spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection said he had no information on ICE's mission at Nogales ports of entry. CBP employees typically handle operations in the border region — CBP officers man the ports of entry, and Border Patrol agents patrol between the ports — whereas ICE usually operates in the U.S. interior.

By formally deporting violators before they can leave voluntarily, ICE can boost its deportation statistics as the Trump administration seeks to fulfill its campaign promise of ""mass deportations."" ICE can also impose penalties or prohibitions on deportees' return to the U.S.

'Ghost town'

The heightened scrutiny at the ports is unnerving for residents of Nogales, Arizona, and Nogales, Sonora, border towns commonly referred to as ""Ambos Nogales,"" especially as ICE agents' mission remains unclear, travelers and shop owners said Wednesday.

Business owners say Mexican shoppers have been staying away from Nogales, Arizona, this Christmas season, which some attributed directly to ICE agents' presence, as well as factors like inflation and heightened immigration enforcement broadly.

Nogales shopkeeper Lidia Lopez gestured around her empty dress store Wednesday morning. Normally, she said, it would be filled with families from Sonora and Sinaloa doing their Christmas shopping.

But since ICE agents started questioning travelers, ""There aren't any sales, there aren't people in the streets,"" said Lopez, an employee at Sam's Perfumes and Fashion on Grand Avenue, just north of the DeConcini port. ""The businesses here are becoming like a ghost town.""

Speaking in Spanish, she described the timing of the ICE operation during the holidays as ""cruel.""

""This is the high season,"" she said. ""People are afraid. They're afraid of not knowing how to answer (ICE's questions) and that they might use it as a pretext to take away their passports.""

La Cinderella and its sister store Kory's, both on Morley Avenue, have seen reduced foot traffic lately, employees said. Owner Sandra Kory attributes slower business not only to heightened enforcement, but also reported plans for mandatory facial scans at the southern border.

""There are so many new rules,"" she said.

In a plan that a CBP spokesman called ""completely unrelated"" to ICE agents at the ports, DHS will start doing biometric screenings for all non-U.S. citizen travelers on Dec. 26, scanning travelers' faces as they enter and exit the U.S., including at air, land and sea ports.

Even for international tourists and shoppers with their documentation in line, the surveillance is unnerving, Kory said.

""People are just so nervous to come in (to Arizona) because they’re afraid,"" she said. ""It's all over the news that people even with legal status are being taken (by ICE), and they don't know where they take you.""

Greater Nogales Port Authority board chairman Josh Rubin said this year, non-commercial border crossings — pedestrians, personal vehicles and bus passengers — at Nogales ports are on track to reach an estimated 10.5 million by the end of the year, about 300,000 fewer than in 2024, he said.

That's based on reported monthly data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, for which the most recent reliable data is for September 2025. The projection wouldn't account for any fluctuations in December.

It's not a big drop, but will likely be felt by local businesses, he said. Multiple factors are at play in that slight decline, including lingering impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, he said.

""I know it's crazy to continue talking about the pandemic five years later, but the pandemic really changed the way Mexican shoppers shop,"" he said. ""They were forced to find new ways to get what they wanted"" without coming to the U.S.

For the Port Authority board, safe and efficient operations at Nogales ports of entry are the top concern, and DHS is a partner in that goal, he said. As long as ICE's operations don't hinder cross-border flows, Rubin said he doesn't have a problem with their presence.

""At the end of the day, we live in an international border here in Nogales, and the laws are the laws,"" he said. ""From the Port Authority standpoint, our priority is to keep Nogales a reliable, efficient and welcoming port of entry for lawful travelers and trade. That consistency is what supports jobs, businesses and the regional economy on both sides of the border.""

Roberto Contreras lives in Nogales, Sonora and works just over the border, at Pinnacle Charter School on Morley Avenue. The slowdown in foot traffic there has been dramatic this month, said Contreras, who is a dual citizen and crosses the border daily.

He's noticed the ICE agents at the ports over the past two weeks, which he says contributes to the already rising hesitation among would-be border-crossers. Normally, there would be a line down the avenue of ""paisanos"" — people with Mexican roots who live in the U.S. — returning to Mexico to visit family for the holidays, but not this year, he said.

The nonprofit charter school helps students get their high school diplomas online and offers in-person English classes, mostly to U.S. citizens who live in Nogales, Sonora.

Fear is keeping many of the students away in recent months. Contreras' co-worker Jessica Leal said they're doing more outreach lately, ""to try to keep the place alive.""

Aggressive immigration enforcement 'is killing the economy,"" Contreras said.

Shop owners say they're hoping for a surge in last-minute holiday shoppers before the month is out. Kory said DHS oversight will continue to be front of mind for many local businesses.

Over the summer, La Cinderella was hit with an I-9 audit, in which DHS agents — likely from Homeland Security Investigations — asked for proof of store employees' legal status, Kory said.

Kory and her staff scrambled to gather all the documents, but didn't hear back from the agents for months, she said.

""We didn’t have anything to hide,"" she said, but the audit was especially stressful, as Kory was dealing with health issues.

""I'd just had surgery, and I had to be standing up trying to help my secretary to make all the copies they needed,"" she said. ""It was terrible.""

Officials at the detention facility made no diet accommodations for Gantchev’s type 2 diabetes, loved ones said.","A longtime Chicago resident from Bulgaria died Monday while in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement at a Michigan detention facility.

Nenko Gantchev, 56, was arrested Sept. 23 during “Operation Midway Blitz,” the Trump administration’s recent immigration enforcement campaign across the Chicago area.

Gantchev had been held at the North Lake Correctional Facility in Baldwin, Michigan, a private prison contracted by ICE to hold immigrants without legal status, when he was found unresponsive in his cell during a routine check, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

His death was “suspected to be from natural causes,” but the official cause was still under investigation, according to DHS officials who said Gantchev had a pending bond appeal.

U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Illinois, called for an “immediate, transparent investigation into the circumstances” of Gantchev’s death, including reports from other detainees that Gantchev asked for medical assistance and did not receive it in time to save his life.

“To date, we are aware of at least 30 deaths at ICE detention centers this year, making 2025 the deadliest year for immigrants in ICE custody,” Ramirez said in a statement Thursday.

DHS officials said staffers provided treatment to Gantchev and that the agency “is committed to ensuring that all those in custody reside in safe, secure and humane environments.”

Officials also claimed Gantchev had been arrested four times since 1995, with charges dropped in two cases and the outcomes unknown in the others.

According to ABC7, Gantchev was among hundreds of immigrants that a federal judge in Chicago ordered released on bond last month. But the order was later blocked by the 7th Circuit Appeals Court.

Gantchev’s wife and friends told the news station he moved to Chicago 30 years ago on a student visa, received a work permit, owned a trucking company and was in the process of applying for a green card.

Officials at the detention facility made no diet accommodations for Gantchev’s type 2 diabetes, loved ones said.

As my Cato Institute colleague David Bier explains in a thorough and insightful post, the new policy goes well beyond Trump's already expansive previous travel bans, causing great harm including separating many US citizens and permanent residents from spouses and children:

President Trump signed a new proclamation that bans nearly all legal immigration from about 40 countries, covering about one in five legal immigrants from abroad and nearly 400,000 legal immigrants over three years. Although it exempts some foreign workers and travelers from certain countries, this ban does not include any categorical exemption or waiver for spouses, minor children, or parents of US citizens or legal permanent residents, making it far harsher than his prior bans.

The ban repudiates the immigration system Congress created. The Trump administration is reimposing via executive order the national origins system that governed immigration policy from 1924 to 1965. After four decades of rigorous debate, Congress ended that system. In the Immigration Act of 1965, it allocated the caps on immigrant visas equally between countries and prohibited discriminating against immigrant visa applicants based on their race, sex, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence.

David's post effectively outlines the enormous scope of the new ban, and the extensive harm it will cause. He also shows that the supposed security rationale for the policy is utterly indefensible, as immigrants from these countries actually pose little, if any, security risk.

From a constitutional point of view, this proclamation further underscores Trump's claim to virtually unlimited executive discretion to restrict migration, in the process abrogating legal migration pathways established by Congress, including even those for spouses and children of US citizens. In an article on Trump's earlier - already extensive - second-term travel bans, I explained why this violates the nondelegation doctrine, which constrains delegation of legislative power to the executive, and addressed various objections (such as the idea that immigration restriction is actually an inherent executive power; also, I note that Trump v. Hawaii (2018) doesn't preclude nondelegation challenges to executive immigration restrictions, because it did not consider that issue, or even mention it). I think this policy also likely violates the major questions doctrine, which requires Congress to speak clearly when it delegates to the executive the power to decide major economic or political questions.

Nondelegation and major questions are central issues in ongoing challenges to Trump's attempt to impose a $100,000 tax on H-1B visas, and in at least one case challenging the the less extreme travel ban he imposed in June. I hope litigants will raise these issues, here as well.",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/02/TravelBan.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 18:57:20.060558

“Recent public reporting, including an NPR investigation, has highlighted DHS’s increasing reliance on facial recognition and third-party data systems with limited transparency or oversight.

Many Afghan migrants are also reported missing along the Iran–Afghanistan border, the sources said.

The Associated Press reported that since November 26, at least 24 Afghan migrants mostly in Northern California have been detained.","The two-day summit, held on Friday and Saturday, December 19 and 20, brought together Japan and the five Central Asian states including Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan for multilateral talks aimed at expanding cooperation and addressing shared regional challenges.

Regional security and stability, enhanced coordination, and efforts to combat terrorism and organised crime were among the main items on the agenda.

Mirziyoyev said uniting efforts to preserve peace and strengthen stability is particularly important, adding that Afghanistan remains a key area for cooperation. He said he hopes to see Afghanistan peaceful, stable and focused on constructive development.

The Uzbek president also praised Japan’s assistance to Afghanistan, saying Uzbekistan highly values Tokyo’s consistent position. He noted that for many years Japan has been among the leading donors and partners supporting the Afghan people.

Mirziyoyev said he is confident that joint actions and partnerships will help improve living conditions, promote socio-economic and infrastructure development, and support Afghanistan’s active participation in regional economic projects.

Japan’s embassy in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that Tokyo has allocated $19.5 million in humanitarian aid for people in need in the country, expressing hope that the assistance will make a tangible difference for vulnerable Afghans.

Although Uzbekistan, like most countries, has not formally recognised the Taliban administration, it maintains broad diplomatic and economic relations with it. Mirziyoyev has frequently highlighted Afghanistan in regional and international forums, describing stability in the country as being in the interest of Central Asia as a whole.

According to the report, published on Friday the attackers underwent professional training and demonstrated advanced weapons skills. The information was confirmed to TASS by a source at the Second Western District Military Court.

A person involved in the judicial proceedings said all of the defendants had received training and possessed professional-level proficiency in the use of firearms. The source said one of the accused, Shamsidin Fariduni, displayed a high level of marksmanship during questioning in court.

The source also suggested that two separate operational groups had been prepared for the attack and later merged. The defendants have denied this claim.

According to the TASS report, Fariduni had initially been expected to travel via mountainous routes from a base in Türkiye to Afghanistan to join Islamic State Khorasan Province. However, because those routes were closed during the winter, he was allegedly instructed instead to take part in the Crocus City Hall attack.

Based on court information cited in the report, Fariduni was tasked with recruiting accomplices inside Russia, conducting reconnaissance at the Crocus City Hall, purchasing a vehicle to transport the attackers and obtaining weapons. During initial interrogations, he reportedly said the group did not intend to kill children, though Russian judicial authorities said the evidence does not support that assertion.

The report added that the organisers of the attack promised the perpetrators a payment of one million roubles. After carrying out the assault, the attackers reportedly headed toward Ukraine, where the money was to be paid.

The attack took place on March 22, 2024, in the Moscow suburbs. Four armed assailants opened fire on the crowd shortly before a concert began and then set the venue on fire. At least 149 people were killed and more than 600 others wounded in what was one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Russia in recent decades.

The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack. Court proceedings against the suspects began in the summer, with the four main defendants appearing in court after being arrested shortly after the assault.

Mohammad Yousuf Saeedi, spokesperson for the Taliban governor in Herat, said three Afghan nationals died near the Kahsan border area while attempting what he described as “illegal migration to Iran.” He told the Taliban-run Bakhtar News Agency on Friday that investigations are under way and that local authorities and emergency teams have been deployed to assist those affected.

Earlier, local sources in Herat told Afghanistan International that a group of Afghan migrants had died inside Iranian territory after being exposed to severe cold while travelling toward Iran. According to those sources, the bodies of at least 15 people were transferred to Kahsan and Adraskan districts in Herat province.

However, Afghanistan International also spoke with an Afghan migrant who had visited the morgues at the Shuhada Cemetery and Taybad Hospital in Iran’s Razavi Khorasan province. That individual said the number of Afghan migrants who died could exceed 40.

Sources further reported that several Afghan migrants have gone missing along the Iran border. In recent days, hundreds of Afghans are said to have headed toward the border in an attempt to reach Iran, but encountered extreme cold weather en route.

According to these accounts, the migrants were trying to enter Iran through unofficial and smuggling routes from Islam Qala toward Taybad. Weather conditions in the border areas have been reported as snowy, rainy and extremely cold. Families of the victims are reportedly searching for the bodies of their relatives.

The exact number of casualties remains unclear.

In recent months, the Taliban have reported the arrest of hundreds of Afghans accused of attempting to migrate illegally to Iran. Following mass deportations of Afghan migrants from Iran and tighter visa restrictions, many Afghans have resorted to dangerous and irregular routes in an effort to return to Iran.

According to the sources, the bodies of at least 15 migrants have been transferred to the Kohsan and Adraskan districts of Herat. Some sources said the death toll could be in the dozens, though the figures have not been officially confirmed.

Afghanistan International spoke with an Afghan migrant who visited morgues at the Shuhada Cemetery and at Taybad Hospital in Iran’s Razavi Khorasan province. He said more than 40 Afghan migrants had died.

Many Afghan migrants are also reported missing along the Iran–Afghanistan border, the sources said.

In recent days, hundreds of migrants are believed to have set out for Iran and encountered a wave of extreme cold along the route. The severe weather is continuing.

Sources said the migrants were attempting to enter Iran via an unofficial route from Islam Qala towards Taybad. Weather conditions along the border were described as snowy, rainy and extremely cold.

Families of the migrants are reported to be searching for the bodies of their relatives.

Iranian authorities and the Taliban have so far made no public comment on the incident.

This is a developing story.

In a letter addressed to the US secretaries of state and homeland security, the lawmakers said the administration had used a shooting by a former Afghan soldier against National Guard personnel to justify sweeping measures targeting Afghan migrants and asylum-seekers.

The lawmakers said policies such as refusing entry to Afghan migrants and denying asylum to former US military partners in Afghanistan were a mistake and risked portraying the United States as an unreliable ally.

“Exploiting this tragedy to sow division and inflame fear will not make America safer,” Democratic members of Congress wrote in the letter.

They said that following the shooting involving National Guard troops in Washington, the Trump administration not only halted the processing of Afghan asylum cases but also began re-examining cases of Afghans who had already been admitted to the United States.

According to the lawmakers, the administration has also barred the entry of Afghans holding Special Immigrant Visas (SIVs) who worked with the US government and military in Afghanistan, removing them from exemptions to the president’s travel ban.

The Trump administration recently placed Afghanistan and 14 other countries on a full travel ban list, effectively preventing their citizens from travelling to the United States or applying for asylum. Under President Donald Trump’s latest order, SIV holders were no longer exempt from the ban.

Members of Congress described the policy as a form of collective punishment against Afghan migrants and citizens. They warned that the measures endanger the lives of innocent, law-abiding people, including those who assisted US forces during the war in Afghanistan.

“The horrific actions of one individual should not be used to vilify every individual from Afghanistan who legally seeks to live in the United States,” the lawmakers wrote.

The administration’s actions have heightened fear among Afghan migrants already living in the United States. Immigration lawyers and refugee advocates in the Sacramento area of California, home to the largest Afghan immigrant population, have reported an increase in detentions of Afghans by immigration authorities and the cancellation of asylum-related interviews.

The Associated Press reported that since November 26, at least 24 Afghan migrants mostly in Northern California have been detained. In the past week alone, at least nine Afghan men were taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement when they appeared for routine case status checks.","https://i.afintl.com/images/rdk9umy0/production/fa31267f487525b9063d8fa93f5b79071d17575e-1244x927.png?rect=0,138,1244,653&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=max&auto=format",N,,2025-12-21 01:56:26.039370

It was later passed unanimously by the Senate, and Trump signed the measure into law on 19 November, triggering a 30-day countdown for the documents’ release.

This week, House Democrats on the committee released another batch of photos from Epstein’s estate, as the deadline for the justice department to release its files loomed.","The Department of Justice on Friday released a long-awaited and huge tranche of documents detailing its investigations into the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a major development in the lengthy saga that turned into one of the biggest political setbacks Donald Trump has suffered since his re-election last year.

While significant portions of the files are redacted, those that were viewable included images of Epstein socializing with an array of prominent figures, including entertainers such as Michael Jackson, Chris Tucker and Diana Ross, and the entrepreneur Richard Branson. Bill Clinton appears in several photos, including one in which he is in a swimming pool along with Epstein’s convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell. The images also show the former British royal Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.

Another cache of documents showed photos of evidence gathered including drives and computers but did not reveal details as to the contents. There was also a photo of what appeared to be a dog in a garbage bag, placed inside a box.

In a letter to Congress, Todd Blanche said the documents, which date back to 2006, when Epstein was investigated on child prostitution charges, were only the first set of what is planned for release. “The volume of materials to be reviewed … means that the department must publicly produce responsive documents on a rolling basis,” the deputy attorney general wrote in the letter obtained by Fox News.

He also acknowledged an array of redactions, including the identifying details of more than 1,200 victims and their family members.

Congressional Democrats accused the Trump administration of failing to adhere to the letter of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which requires the justice department to release all “unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials” in its possession related to the financier’s cases by 19 December. Epstein died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal charges of sex-trafficking minors.

The law also requires the justice department to publish any materials from the investigations that relate to Maxwell, who was found guilty in 2021 of aiding Epstein’s sex trafficking of teen girls and sentenced to 20 years in prison.

“Technically they’re not in compliance,” said Democratic congressman Ro Khanna, a leader of the push to get the legislation passed.

“The law calls for all the documents that are unclassified to be released. They have not done that. The law also calls for them to explain redactions. I haven’t seen yet whether they’ve done that or not. My initial read is that they have a lot of redactions without explanation,” Khanna said.

Chuck Schumer, the top Senate Democrat, echoed his concerns, and said in a statement: “We will pursue every option to make sure the truth comes out.”

Thomas Massie, a Republican, also joined the chorus, writing on social media that the document release “grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law that [Donald Trump] signed just 30 days ago”.

Abigail Jackson, the White House deputy press secretary, said the documents’ release prove that “the Trump administration is the most transparent in history” and said it “has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have” by making the files public and cooperating with a separate congressional investigation.

Epstein’s case has captivated public attention for years, and been the subject of countless conspiracy theories – largely due to his connections to powerful and wealthy figures in the US and overseas, including Trump.

While he has the authority as president to make the documents public, Trump previously opposed doing so, and said the concern over his ties to Epstein was a “Democrat hoax”. As the House of Representatives neared approval of the bill in November, the president abruptly reversed his position and said Republican lawmakers should support it. It was later passed unanimously by the Senate, and Trump signed the measure into law on 19 November, triggering a 30-day countdown for the documents’ release.

Although the law mandates the release of unclassified materials, it may not provide the full transparency demanded by numerous Epstein victims, as it does include notable carve-outs, including a provision exempting materials “that would jeopardize an active federal investigation” from being released.

The legislation also states that “no later than 15 days” after the materials are made public, the justice department must provide Congress with a list of all categories of records released and withheld, a summary of any redactions made, and a list of “all government officials and politically exposed individuals named or referenced in the published materials”.

Before the release of the materials, experts also warned that the disclosure of records may not provide a full accounting of Epstein’s crimes or his network, and that it could still leave many Epstein questions unanswered.

Trump vowed to release Epstein-related files as he campaigned for president last year. This summer, his administration sparked backlash after the justice department announced it would not release any files related to the late financier, and said it had found “no incriminating client list” despite earlier claims from Pam Bondi, the attorney general, that such a document was sitting on her desk.

The announcement sparked bipartisan outrage – including from some Trump supporters – and reignited scrutiny of Epstein’s past ties to Trump, with whom he was friendly for at least 15 years before falling out in 2004. The president has consistently denied any knowledge of or involvement in Epstein’s criminal activities.

In mid-November, several days before Congress voted to release the justice department files, Democrats on the House oversight committee released three email exchanges they received from Epstein’s estate in response to a subpoena that dated from 2011, 2015 and 2019, and included one email in which Epstein claimed that Trump “knew about the girls”.

Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, dismissed the emails, and accused Democrats of “selectively” leaking them “to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump”.

Later that day, Republicans on the committee released more than 20,000 documents they received from Epstein’s estate, including emails between Epstein and prominent figures.

In early December, House Democrats on the committee released several dozen photographs from Epstein’s estate that highlight his ties to prominent figures, including Trump, Clinton and Mountbatten-Windsor.

Angel Ureña, a spokesperson for Bill Clinton, said that the Epstein investigation wasn’t about the former president.

“There are two types of people here,” he said. “The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships after that. We’re in the first. No amount of stalling by people in the second group will change that.”

The images represent a small number of the almost 100,000 images given to the House committee, and were released without context or captions.

This week, House Democrats on the committee released another batch of photos from Epstein’s estate, as the deadline for the justice department to release its files loomed.

Among the images were photographs of lines from Vladimir Nabokov’s novel Lolita – which is about a middle-aged man’s sexual obsession with and sexual abuse of a 12-year-old girl – written on different parts of a woman’s body. It was reported earlier this year that photos from inside Epstein’s Manhattan mansion revealed that he kept a first edition copy of Lolita in his office.

The same batch also included photos of travel documents, and notable people such as Bill Gates, Woody Allen, Noam Chomsky and Steve Bannon, Trump’s former adviser.

The images provided by the estate were undated, and provided without context. The appearance of these people in the photos is not evidence of any wrongdoing.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ded76e1e37e83ea78b983d7c2081f57978b05b1/281_0_3336_2669/master/3336.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f08b991abea82e33ada6b09fade37528",N,,2025-12-20 16:57:18.865838

Red flags over reported abuses There have been growing concerns over the conditions at the sprawling immigration detention center.","Immigrants held at the Camp East Montana detention center in El Paso regularly face injury, life-threatening illnesses and acute mental health crises, according to a review of 911 emergency calls placed at the nation's largest ICE immigration lockup.

The emergency call log data, in part, reads:

22-year-old male suicide attempt

89-year-old female chest pain

19-year-old male fall from bunk

32-year-old male kidney stone/pain

54-year-old female fainted

47-year-old male low blood pressure/swelling of legs (Inmate died Dec. 3, 2019)

The most common medical emergencies at Camp East Montana involved chest pain, seizures, suicidal attempts, abdominal pain, breathing problems and fainting episodes, according to 911 records obtained by the El Paso Times through a freedom of information request to the city of El Paso.

A handful of calls involve employees at the sprawling, soft-sided tent facility located on land owned by Fort Bliss.

U.S. Rep Veronica Escobar, D-El Paso, immigrant rights advocates and civil rights groups have raised red flags about the physical and emotional treatment of immigrants and inhumane conditions at the detention center.

A Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary called the claims of abuse at the detention center ""categorically false"" in a statement. The official did not comment on the death.

ICE detention centers hold immigrants during civil immigration proceedings while await deportation. Many of the immigrants are not accused or convicted of any major or violent crimes. Detainment is not intended to serve as punishment.

There have been about 90 emergency calls at the facility between Aug. 17 and Dec. 1, according to the logs. That is about five calls per week in the 15 weeks since the facility opened.

The facility officially opened on Aug. 17, but began receiving detained immigrants on Aug. 1. It housed over 3,000 detainees as of Dec. 19, Escobar said in a social media post.

The emergency calls were for detainees aged 19 to 89. About 43 of the emergency-involved immigrants are 40 or older. The ages of about 20 immigrants and Camp East Montana staff were listed as ""unknown age.""

The administration of President Donald Trump has detained over 75,000 immigrants across the U.S. The vast majority of immigrant detainees have not been convicted of criminal charges, according to data from Deportation Data Project.

Emergency medical technicians are permitted into the detention center in cases where the facility's medical staff has made the call.

""El Paso Fire Department responds to all request for emergency services at the location,"" Assistant Fire Chief Gustavo Tavarez said. ""Upon arrival at the facility perimeter, the fire department unit will make contact with gate security. The fire department unit will then be escorted to the location of the emergency. If the gate security verifies that there is no emergency, the fire department will verify the information with 911 Communications.""

Escobar: DHS withheld data on ""detainees mental health'

There were five emergency calls related to attempted suicides in the call logs provided to the El Paso Times, including one from Dec. 1, when an ambulance was called for a 22-year-old. The report was made nearly 12 hours after Escobar and her office made a congressional oversight visit to the detention center.

Escobar said that her office has not been informed of any reports of attempted suicides or medical emergencies at the facility in their communications with the DHS and ICE.

“We have asked about detainees' mental health,"" Escobar said. ""Not once have staff at Camp East Montana informed me that there have been several suicide attempts at the facility. It speaks volumes that staff at the facility have not volunteered this information during those lengthy visits and conversations.""

Escobar's concerns follow her three congressional oversight visits to the detention center, including shortly after it was opened in August. At each visit, she has raised concerns about the conditions and management of the site.

The congresswoman made an unannounced visit to the site on Friday, Dec. 19, according to a post on social media.

""Contrary to the administration’s claims, ICE is not transparent and this facility is not meeting the minimum federal standards for care of human beings in their custody,"" she added. ""If the private contractor running the facility cannot be trusted to hold people, and if ICE cannot be trusted to be transparent with information about Camp East Montana, the facility should be shut down immediately.”

This is the second time that homeland security facilities have drawn congressional and national scrutiny. During President Trump's first administration in 2019, the little-known Border Patrol facility in Clint, Texas, was criticized for its inhumane management of migrant children in federal custody.

First death at Camp East Montana

A 911 call was made on Nov. 16 for requested assistance for a ""47-year-old male, low blood pressure and swelling to legs,"" according to the logs. Francisco Gaspar Cristóbal Andrés, the patient, would be pronounced dead on Dec. 3 at the Hospitals of Providence, eight days after his birthday.

Cristóbal Andrés' widow, Lucía Pedro Juan, told the El Paso Times that her husband had told his daughter that his legs were feeling numb in the weeks leading up to the call. ICE reported that Cristóbal Andrés died from ""natural liver and kidney failure."" His widow said he was healthy when he was detained on Sept. 1.

The medical staff at Camp East Montana and the doctors at the El Paso hospital treated Cristóbal Andrés at least five times. He was in ICE custody for nearly 90 days before his death.

Red flags over reported abuses

There have been growing concerns over the conditions at the sprawling immigration detention center.

Over $1.2 billion is allocated for the construction and management of the facility. It is operated by a private contractor who holds an agreement with DHS.

The American Civil Liberties Union and Texas-based human rights groups, including El Paso's immigration advocacy group Las Americas, have raised concerns about the conditions in the detention camp. The human rights groups sent a letter to ICE officials condemning the conditions based on 45 detainee interviews, including 16 sworn declarations.

Detainees held in the facility have told lawyers about the squalid conditions and human rights violations in the camps, the ACLU reports.

The letter details the horrid conditions in the facility, including ""beatings and sexual abuse by officers against detained immigrants, beatings and coercive threats to compel deportation to third countries, medical neglect, hunger and insufficient food, and denial of meaningful access to counsel, among other rights violations.""

DHS response: 'No lawbreaker"" treated better

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin described claims of inhumane conditions and abuses as ""fear-mongering clickbait."" McLaughlin also said that immigrants are allowed to meet with lawyers and family members and are receiving dietitian-approved food.

""No lawbreakers in the history of human civilization have been treated better than illegal aliens in the United States,"" McLaughlin said. ""Get a grip.”

Detainee shares mistreatment allegations

Pedro Juan, the widow of Cristóbal Andrés, was detained at Camp East Montana for nearly three months. During that time, she said that the guards were verbally abusive to detainees.

""Shut up, you can't say anything because you're eating dog and pig food,"" she recalled the guards telling them. ""You're dumb, stupid, burros.""

She also described unsanitary conditions and receiving food that was often rotten or foul smelling, if it arrived at all.

""Sometimes we get food, and sometimes we don't,"" Pedro Juan said, ""and since there are quite a few of us — 72 people in our detention center — we can't get enough.""

Women also fainted because of hunger and a lack of water, she said.

At night, detainees would cry out, she said. It made it difficult to sleep, which added to detainee's mental health conditions.

Escobar has sent three letters to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, including one sent on Dec. 18, detailing how conditions were ""dangerous and inhumane.""","https://www.elpasotimes.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/18/PTX1/85714823007-180820256-d-8-a-6338.jpg?crop=5485,3086,x0,y285&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-20 16:57:27.271206

Among the documents made public are around 4,000 files — mostly photographs — under a subset the Justice Department described as “DOJ Disclosures.""

The Justice Department did not explain how those photos were related to the criminal investigation.
The president made no reference to the initial records release during a rally Friday night in North Carolina.","NEW YORK -- The U.S. Department of Justice on Friday published thousands of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, a release long anticipated for its potential to reveal new details about the late sex offender and his connections to powerful people.

But it was clear soon after the release that it would fall far short of those expectations. The partial release angered Democrats who accused the Trump administration of trying to hide information. The Justice Department said it would continue releasing documents in the weeks ahead.

The file dump — dominated by photographs, but also including call logs, court records and other documents, many with redactions — comes after politicians and the public waged a massive campaign for transparency about the government's investigations into the wealthy financier.

President Donald Trump, who was friends with Epstein for years before the two had a falling-out, tried for months to keep the records sealed. Though he hasn’t been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, he has argued there is nothing to see in the files and the public should focus on other issues.

On Nov. 19, relenting to political pressure from his fellow Republicans, he signed a bill mandating the release of most of the Justice Department’s files on Epstein within 30 days. The White House said Friday’s release of the files shows how the administration is the “most transparent in history.”

Here are some takeaways about the Justice Department's initial Epstein file release:

The law signed by Trump last month set Friday as the deadline for the Justice Department to release most of its files about Epstein.

Ahead of the release, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told Fox News he expected several hundred thousand files to be released Friday, along with several hundred thousand more to come later.

But the number of files that actually landed on the Justice Department's website seemed to be a thin slice of the total number expected. Blanche acknowledged in a letter to Congress that the production of files was incomplete. The department said it expected to complete its production of Epstein documents by the end of the year.

Among the documents made public are around 4,000 files — mostly photographs — under a subset the Justice Department described as “DOJ Disclosures."" The vast majority of the photographs were taken by the FBI during searches of Epstein’s homes in New York City and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Also included were images of envelopes, folders and boxes containing investigative materials from various probes related to Epstein. Many records are redacted and anything containing a victim’s personally identifiable information, including materials depicting sexual and physical abuse, isn’t authorized for release.

Various other files released by the Justice Department on Friday include court records, public records and disclosures to House committees. At least some of that material has already circulated in the public domain after years of court action and investigations.

Many of the most discussed photos from the files show the former Democratic president. Clinton has acknowledged that he traveled on Epstein's private jet but said through a spokesperson that he had no knowledge of the late financier's crimes.

Some of the photos show Clinton on a private plane, including one with a woman seated next to him with her arm around him. Her face is redacted from the photo.

Another photo shows him in a pool with British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, who has been convicted of luring young girls to Epstein so he could molest them, and with another person whose face is redacted. One shows him with the late pop star Michael Jackson, singer Diana Ross and a woman whose face is redacted.

And another shows Clinton in a hot tub with a woman whose face is redacted. The Justice Department did not explain how those photos were related to the criminal investigation.

Nevertheless, senior White House aides quickly called attention to them on X.

Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, wrote “Oh my!” and added a shocked face emoji in response to the photo of Clinton in the hot tub.

Angel Ureña, Clinton’s deputy chief of staff, said in an X post that “this isn’t about Bill Clinton” and accused the White House of trying to protect others.

“There are two types of people here,” he wrote. “The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships with him after. We’re in the first.”

Clinton has never been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and the mere inclusion of someone’s name or images in files from the investigation does not imply otherwise.

To some exploring the records released Friday, the most interesting parts were which high-profile figures appeared scarcely — or not at all.

For example, Trump is minimally referenced in the files, and the small number of photos that do show him appear to have been in the public domain for decades. The president made no reference to the initial records release during a rally Friday night in North Carolina.

The release does include at least one photo of the former Prince Andrew, who appears in a tuxedo lying on the laps of what appear to be several women who are seated, dressed in formalwear. One of Epstein’s accusers, Virginia Giuffre, accused Epstein of arranging for her to have sexual encounters with men, including the prince.

Marina Lacerda, one of the women who says she survived sexual assault by Epstein, beginning when she was 14 years old, said Friday she wanted to see greater transparency from the Justice Department and expressed frustration over redactions and the incomplete release.

“Just put out the files,” she said. “And stop redacting names that don’t need to be redacted.”

Several lawmakers blasted the Trump administration for failing to produce all the documents required under the law.

Reps. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky., had introduced what is known as a discharge petition, which eventually led to the congressional vote that forced the release of the Epstein files. On Friday, both took to social media to criticize the partial release.

Massie wrote that it “grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law.” Khanna called the release so far “disappointing.”

“We're going to push for the actual documents,” he said.

Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., said that by disregarding the deadline, the administration was denying justice to Epstein's victims. He added he was “exploring all avenues and legal tools to get justice for the victims and transparency for the American people.”

The plan, released in November, sought the most significant changes in decades to policy affecting homeless people and would have governed $3.9 billion in awards to community organizations under a program called Continuum of Care.

Groups opposed to the move said that only Congress had the authority to shift the program away from its longstanding approach, called Housing First, and that the speed of the change could send as many as 170,000 people back to the streets.

Judge Mary S. McElroy of the U.S. District Court in Rhode Island issued a preliminary injunction that prevents the sudden rule change. “Ensuring lawful agency action, continuity of housing and stability for vulnerable populations is clearly in the public interest,” she said.

Her ruling applied to two lawsuits raising similar issues, one by Democratic attorneys general and another by a mix of advocacy groups and local governments. Among those groups are the National Alliance to End Homelessness and the National Low Income Housing Coalition.

The groups said the ruling offered vulnerable people “respite from the government’s assault.”

About 90 percent of the annual spending typically goes to renew existing programs. But the administration’s efforts to end that practice and distribute the money under new rules have left most local programs uncertain if they can continue to house people next year.

The funding decisions are months behind schedule, and annual contracts start to expire as soon as next month. But Friday’s ruling may not be the last word amid some unusual legal maneuvering.

In a move that drew the judge’s complaint, the Department of Housing and Urban Development withdrew its plan last week to make “appropriate revisions,” and government lawyers then suggested Judge McElroy should not rule on the withdrawn document because it was moot. Rejecting that argument, Judge McElroy said on Friday that HUD was trying “to evade court jurisdiction.”

John Bailey, a Justice Department lawyer representing HUD, said the department planned to reissue the rules, but by Friday evening it had not done so. It was not clear if the revisions would address Judge McElroy’s concerns.

While the machinations can seem esoteric, the stakes are high. Homelessness is at a record level, and the Continuum of Care program is the federal government’s main response.

Housing First provides chronically homeless people long-term housing and offers treatment for addiction or mental illness. But it does not require them to accept that treatment.

Proponents emphasize that a large body of research shows the approach works better than treatment mandates in getting people housed and hail it as “evidence based.” But the once-bipartisan policy has come under sharp conservative attack, and the rules HUD issued in November would have cut funding for long-term housing by about two-thirds.

The Trump administration argues the prospect of free housing encourages irresponsible behavior, and grant-making rules penalize groups like rescue missions that favor sobriety mandates. In issuing the new rules, Scott Turner, the HUD secretary, said Housing First had driven homelessness higher by neglecting the “root causes of homelessness, including illicit drugs and mental illness.”

In the effort to impose new rules, HUD also sought to use homelessness money to advance unrelated priorities related to gender and race. The rules would have allowed the department to reject community groups that previously or currently embraced policies that “facilitate racial preferences” or “use a definition of sex other than as binary in humans.”

A HUD spokesman, asked about the legal developments, said the department was “committed to program reforms” and would proceed according to the law.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/21/multimedia/19-dc-homeless/19-dc-homeless-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 15:57:27.465183

That pressure helped push the Providence City Council to unanimously pass a resolution directing two city courts to accommodate remote-hearing requests.","In late September, Washington, D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) stopped Jose Bonilla Lopez, a gardener who lived in the city’s northwest. According to a police report, it was a case of mistaken identity. Instead of releasing him, they turned him over to masked federal agents from the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI, who seized him as neighbors chanted for his freedom.

The next day, MPD stopped a car missing a rear license plate and arrested the driver. Mayker Enrique Salas-Araujo was a passenger in the vehicle. Instead of releasing him, police transferred him directly to a masked Homeland Security agent, who led him in his neon yellow construction jacket to an unmarked car outside of a school. According to a bystander, the handover frightened students, who asked if they would be taken next.

More than 40 local organizations say MPD’s cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) violates D.C.’s Sanctuary Values Amendment Act, which bars police from transferring individuals to federal immigration authorities unless they are awaiting trial or sentencing for a federal criminal charge or are serving a federal criminal sentence. Even after an executive order authorizing such cooperation expired in September, MPD continued the practice. Throughout this period, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser maintained that the department was no longer involved in immigration enforcement. After The Washington Post reported at least half a dozen such cases, Bowser admitted that local officers had continued to patrol with the Department of Homeland Security.

Truthout’s review of news coverage indicates that cooperation between ICE and local police in the district is among the most entrenched in the country.

But D.C. is not an isolated case: Police across the country face serious allegations of violating laws meant to protect immigrants. Truthout’s analysis found credible allegations in many of the largest U.S. cities with ordinances and laws meant to limit cooperation between local law enforcement and ICE, as well as in smaller jurisdictions from Providence, Rhode Island, and Rochester, New York, to Springfield, Oregon, Adams County, Washington, Loveland County, Colorado, and Mesa County, Colorado. In other cities, legal loopholes allow police and federal immigration authorities to collaborate without breaking similar protective laws. Philadelphia’s ordinance, for instance, restricts police from complying with ICE detainer requests, but does not limit transfers of migrants through other channels. Philadelphia officers have twice — potentially legally — escorted men to federal immigration authorities at courthouses, drawing condemnation from local activists.

The alleged violations reviewed by Truthout generally fall into two categories: illegal data sharing and assistance with immigration-related arrests.

In California, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego law enforcement allegedly violated state law by sharing automated license plate reader data with ICE and Border Patrol. In Illinois, state police have been sharing some information from its gang database with ICE since 2008 despite a 2017 state law forbidding such data sharing. In New York City, the Department of Investigation has documented two violations of the city’s sanctuary laws. In one case, a New York City Police Department officer set up a system where he would be notified when a person of interest to federal immigration authorities interacted with the department. In another, a Department of Correction staffer who was part of a joint Homeland Security task force relayed sensitive information to ICE about two migrants in custody, unwittingly violating sanctuary laws, according to the report. In Chicago and Los Angeles, activists and some lawmakers report police assisting federal agents during immigration raids — though police claim they were only assisting with crowd control.

Truthout’s analysis of news coverage revealed that at least 18 jurisdictions allegedly unlawfully shared data and six may have illegally assisted with immigration-related arrests. None of the alleged violations were disclosed by police departments themselves. The public typically learned about them through bystander interventions or public records requests, indicating these violations may be a fraction of a widespread problem.

The pattern of collaboration reinforces a core abolitionist argument: that police departments are not neutral arbiters of the law, but political institutions with their own interests, norms, and value systems. In some cases, cooperation may stem from overlapping organizational ideologies, such as a shared commitment to enforcing social control through state-sanctioned violence. In others, loopholes persist because local ordinances fail to clearly define what constitutes “cooperation,” giving departments room to plausibly deny violations.

Individual politics also play a role. Many officers hold right-leaning political beliefs, which can increase their alignment with immigration enforcement priorities; in Adams County, Washington, for example, a sheriff who has repeated white nationalist talking points is being represented by a legal organization founded by Stephen Miller in a lawsuit alleging state sanctuary law violations brought by the Washington attorney general’s office. And in other cases, a lack of training may be to blame, as seen within the New York City Department of Correction. Together, these dynamics begin to explain why local police continue to bolster ICE operations illegally.

Even when abiding by “sanctuary” ordinances, the carceral system often acts as a “force multiplier” for ICE. Arrestees’ fingerprints are automatically sent to the FBI, which alerts ICE through federal databases. ICE may then issue detainer requests to local jails. Even if “sanctuary” cities deny these detainer requests, ICE can learn the individual’s location from information available to them in such databases. Courthouse proceedings, as matters of public record, indirectly assist ICE by allowing agents to track down and arrest people after criminal, family, immigration, or traffic court hearings.

As policing scholar Alex Vitale told Truthout, declarations of sanctuary are akin to political theatre. “They send a positive message — that local governments will not deny immigrants services,” he said. “But these pledges are a bit thin. They cannot in fact protect people from federal agents determined to pursue them, deny them services, and make them fearful.” Vitale pointed to legal indirect forms of cooperation, such as local police providing crowd control assistance during raids, and legal loopholes that allow police to turn over so-called “criminal aliens” directly to ICE, as examples of some policies’ limitations.

This close association between police and ICE is increasingly becoming a public relations problem for police departments.

“ICE is becoming a rogue police force with no accountability or transparency,” said William G. Lopez, a professor at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. “I frankly think the escalation of ICE violence has happened so fast that many police departments [that] formerly supported ICE are not going to do so forever and have not come forward to say anything yet.”

Some police departments have attempted to confront potential public relations issues head on. InSan Jose, California, Police Chief Paul Joseph has gone door to door distributing flyers assuring residents that local police are not involved with immigration enforcement. The department even released an AI-generated video of Joseph speaking Spanish to spread the message.

But Vitale said it’s misleading for police to claim that “sanctuary” laws will protect residents and their neighbors from deportation. Because ICE routinely mines FBI criminal databases, gang databases, and court records, even brief contact with the criminal legal system can put people at risk.

Slowing the Deportation Machine

Across the country, activists and some lawmakers have been pushing to slow down what some describe as the police-assisted deportation machine.

In Providence, Rhode Island, organizers successfully pushed for amendments to the Community-Police Relations Act after members of the Rhode Island Deportation Defense Network (DDN) released a video showing a Providence police officer calling for “Ivan,” a man ICE was seeking, to come downstairs. After he complied, ICE immediately arrested him.

The footage sparked rallies and drew condemnation from local organizations including ACLU Rhode Island. The Providence police chief later claimed his officers did not participate in or assist with enforcement actions, and were present only to ensure the “wellbeing” of everyone involved, an explanation organizers emphatically reject.

“The only people whose wellbeing the Providence police were looking out for was that of ICE,” said Kate Hao, an organizer with Rhode Island’s DDN and the Party for Socialism and Liberation.

A civilian oversight body later concluded that the department violated a local ordinance and its own policies during the encounter by establishing a perimeter, providing crowd control, gathering intelligence, and coordinating tactical positions for ICE.

Lawmakers in Providence hope the amendments will clarify ambiguities around cooperation by defining what constitutes assisting ICE operations and strengthening enforcement mechanisms. In particular, the amendment clarifies that the Providence Police Department may not provide non-public information to ICE; forbids them from using any city money, personnel, or resources to assist in immigration-related arrests; and prohibits them from establishing traffic perimeters or controlling public areas to assist immigration enforcement. It expands the definition of protected spaces in the city to include charter schools. It also clarifies data sharing policies, stating that police cannot collect demographic data with city-operated surveillance technologies such as the Real-Time Crime Center or Flock cameras. All partner agencies accessing city-owned data must formally agree not to share it with federal immigration enforcement. And the changes allow civil rights, human rights, and youth organizations to take civil action against the city, department, and officers for violating the Community-Police Relations Act.

The Long Beach City Council in California similarly strengthened its ordinance in August, adding measures that prohibit federal agents from access non-public city grounds, creating a certificate program for businesses offering safe spaces to undocumented residents, and establishing penalties for city workers and contractors who do not comply with its policies.

After securing strong protections, Rhode Island-based organizers are now turning their attention to cutting off indirect forms of assistance, such as courthouse arrests carried out by ICE. In July, the DDN launched a petition demanding a virtual option for hearings, trials, and conferences.

“We see ICE vehicles outside the courthouse every week,” said Hao, “literally waiting in ambush to kidnap community members as they leave the building.”

The petition quickly gained traction, drawing thousands of signatures. That pressure helped push the Providence City Council to unanimously pass a resolution directing two city courts to accommodate remote-hearing requests. “Now our petition is demanding that the rest of Rhode Island does the same,” she said, noting that the state already has the infrastructure and protocols from the COVID-19 era to make such accommodations routine.

Hao situated these policy changes as just one piece of a much larger struggle to build working-class power. “We have to fight back by building the organized power of our communities to defend our neighbors,” she said, “and make it clear that we won’t allow ICE to tear apart our families, no matter what the police and politicians decide to do.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/12/1-DSC08929-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 15:57:32.083339

See below for a full list of fiscal year 2025-2026 CBP and ICE contracts for companies based in Louisiana.","U.S. Border Patrol’s high-profile immigration crackdowns in North Carolina and Louisiana over the last two months have brought fresh scrutiny to the hundreds of billions of dollars being spent on immigration raids and arrests under the Trump administration.

The massive spending bill pushed by Trump and passed by Congress this summer increased immigration enforcement by $170 billion, part of a broader push to reach the administration’s goal of deporting 1 million immigrants each year.

The new round of immigration spending includes $75 billion over four years for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, on top of the $10 billion the agency had already been allocated for 2025. The bill also gave $65 billion more to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), which had already received $20 billion for fiscal year 2025.

While CBP and ICE, which both operate under the Department of Homeland Security, are responsible for immigration matters, Border Patrol has emerged as the leader in Trump’s anti-immigration crusade in recent months, according to immigration reporter Nick Miroff of The Atlantic. Under the bombastic leadership of Gregory Bovino, who grew up in western North Carolina, CBP has led a series of high-profile and militarized operations in Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte, and New Orleans that have sparked widespread backlash due to their heavy-handed tactics and violations of due process.

Helping carry out Border Patrol and ICE’s immigration operations are an army of private contractors who have seen their fortunes soar as federal money has flowed into enforcement activities.

In the wake of the major operations in Louisiana and North Carolina, Facing South and the Institute for Southern Studies collected and analyzed data from USASpending.gov on more than 50 businesses headquartered in those states who are receiving CBP and ICE contracts for fiscal years 2025-2026. The contracts for companies based in Louisiana and North Carolina total more than $341 million.

North Carolina

The Facing South/Institute analysis finds 38 companies based in North Carolina receiving contracts from CBP and ICE. These contracts are currently valued at $61.7 million, with a potential to grow to $77.9 million once the work is completed.

One of the most notable contractors is Quantico Tactical, founded and owned by former Marine David Hensley. Based in Aberdeen, N.C., Quantico has received more than 50 contracts valued up to $19.3 million for fiscal years 2025-2026 providing a wide range of firearms, “less than lethal” munitions, restraints, communications equipment, and other supplies to both Border Patrol and ICE.

Other top contractors include Laboratory Corporation of America (Labcorp) in Burlington, N.C., which has contracts potentially valued up to $21.4 million for laboratory services, including at ICE detention centers, and TMC-TELESOLV of Battleboro, N.C., which has a contract valued up to $14.8 million for CBP’s Trusted Traveler Program.

Duncan-Parnell, Inc., in Charlotte has a $5 million CBP contract for drones, and MacGyver Solutions, Inc. has contracts valued up to $2.2 million for Polaris and Yamaha vehicles and ATVs.

In August, Hendrick Motorsports Technical Solutions of Concord, N.C. was given a $1.5 million no-bid contract to supply 25 Chevrolet Tahoe vehicles to ICE. The company is a spinoff of Hendrick Motorsports; both are owned by Rick Hendrick, a prominent Republican donor. Media attention about the deal during the North Carolina immigration raids led to calls to boycott Hendrick’s companies, which include car dealerships in the state.

Louisiana

In Louisiana, where Border Patrol’s “Operation Catahoula Crunch” is still underway, there are fewer contractors, but the total awards to companies based in the state is much larger.

Facing South/Institute analysis of contracting data finds 16 Louisiana-based companies receiving contracts from CBP and ICE in fiscal years 2025-2026. The current value of those awards is $50.3 million, but the total potential value is listed at $263.2 million for the state.

Topping the list are two companies which stand to bring in more than $208 million making emergency detention centers for ICE. LaSalle Corrections, which manages 18 private correctional facilities in Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas, received a contract worth up to $125 million to build a new detention center. The company has a checkered history: In 2023, LaSalle agreed to a $7 million settlement over a wrongful death lawsuit, and the ACLU of Louisiana has frequently battled with the company over forced hysterectomies of ICE detainees and other alleged rights abuses.

Lemoine Disaster Recovery, LLC — a building and disaster services company headquartered in Lafayette, L.A. — was awarded a contract worth up to $83.8 million, also to build an emergency ICE detention facility.

Another major contract went to People Who Think, LLC — a marketing and political consulting firm founded by Republican political advisor Jay Connaughton. The firm’s $25 million contract is earmarked for an ICE recruitment campaign. Gulf South Research Group, based in Baton Rouge, pulled in several contracts totaling $21.6 million for environmental assessments and planning, including projects related to the border wall.

ICE agents left around that time.","Immigration enforcement activity in Eden Prairie drew renewed scrutiny last week after federal agents detained a father outside an apartment complex while his 13-year-old son looked on, according to family members.

The Dec. 11 incident, along with a separate standoff involving U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at a construction site in nearby Chanhassen on Dec. 13, prompted community members to gather at both locations to observe and document activity by ICE in the southwest metro.

Gomez and his 13-year-old son, Jose, went outside their Eden Prairie apartment building around 10:20 a.m. to move the family’s car so snow could be plowed, his wife, Karina, said. The property manager had emailed residents earlier that morning asking them to move their vehicles.

Watching from a window, Karina said she saw a group of people begin to run, then received a message that her son was being detained and placed in handcuffs.

Karina said she saw ICE officers throw her son to the ground and strike him. Gomez and Jose were then placed into a vehicle and driven away from the apartment complex.

Jose was later dropped off at his aunt’s home around the corner from the complex, Karina said, after Gomez told agents they could not take his son because he is a minor. Agents kept Gomez in custody and left with him.

Karina said she was on the phone with Gomez during the detention but has not heard from him since and does not know where he is being held.

After arriving at her sister’s home, Karina said Jose — who has a pre-existing heart condition — began feeling unwell. An ambulance and police were called. An Eden Prairie Police Department incident report states officers responded to a report of injuries following the incident.

Jose was taken to St. Francis Hospital in Shakopee, where medical staff treated his injuries and evaluated his heart after an abnormal heartbeat, Karina said. She said her husband has the same heart condition.

“I’m scared because I don’t know anything about where he is; he might get sick in jail and his heart might start racing too,” Karina said in an interview translated from Spanish.

Neither Karina nor Gomez are U.S. citizens, she said. Gomez arrived in the United States from Mexico in 2022. Karina and two of her children, including Jose, joined him late last year after seeking asylum through CBP One, a federal app used by migrants entering the country.

Gomez is the family’s sole provider, Karina said. She said she is worried about paying bills because she is afraid to leave the house and cannot work after recently giving birth to her daughter, who is 20 days old and the family’s only U.S. citizen.

Karina said the family fled Mexico after she and her children were threatened at gunpoint for money. She said she fears her husband could be seriously harmed or killed if he is sent back.

“I don’t want him to be sent back to Mexico because we came here fleeing crime,” Karina said. “The three of us came alone because they threatened my children with weapons.”

Karina said her son has been traumatized by the incident, waking at night screaming and crying, and that the stress has worsened his heart condition.

“He was there, he saw everything, he was traumatized by it. He keeps telling me, ‘Let’s go there, let’s go look for him.’ I tell him, ‘No, I can’t go out,’” Karina said. “What his father is going through is a source of distress for him.”

She said she does not think the agents’ actions were fair or right.

“They didn’t have the right to arrest my son,” Karina said. “I want justice for my son because this isn’t right.”

Karina’s sister, Yuri, said Gomez and Jose were treated like criminals even though they were not doing anything illegal when they moved their car, and that the violence they faced was unjustified.

“These aren’t criminals. They are people who work, people who support their families. What’s the justification for this?” Yuri said. “They are not criminals, they didn’t do anything wrong.”

People’s constitutional rights are being violated because of ICE’s presence in the community, Yuri said.

“Rights are not being respected, rights are being trampled upon,” Yuri said. “The Constitution is being violated, and there’s nothing we can do except for those who have documents to raise their voices for those who don’t.”

A family friend of Karina, Marion Vazquez, organized a GoFundMe to help cover the family’s living expenses, Jose’s medical bills and legal fees. As of Dec. 19, the fundraiser has raised nearly $7,800.

Eden Prairie Local News contacted ICE for comment. The agency said it needed additional identifying information to respond. That information was not available before publication.

ICE activity in Chanhassen

Immigration agents were also reported at a construction site in Chanhassen on Saturday, Dec. 13, where two men were working on the roof of a house, according to state Rep. Alex Falconer, a DFLer who represents District 49A in northern Eden Prairie and southern Minnetonka.

Falconer said he is part of a community group that monitors ICE activity and observes enforcement actions.

When he arrived around 10 a.m., Falconer said about 10 to 15 agents were positioned behind police tape around the house, with roughly 15 to 20 community members watching nearby.

“The two workers were up on the frame of the roof, we already had people reporting that they’re cold, they’re stranded,” Falconer said. “They can’t come down.”

Falconer asked several agents whether they had a judicial warrant to detain the men. He said many did not respond, but those who did told him they did not have a warrant.

He and other members of the group asked ICE agents whether they knew the men’s identities so their families could be contacted. Agents said they did not.

“They didn’t have a judicial warrant, they didn’t know who they were trying to find,” Falconer said. “They just saw two workers on a construction site and tried to detain them.”

Another woman at the scene, who requested anonymity, said an ICE agent told her the men were approached in what the agent described as a “consensual encounter” and fled when asked for their names. The agent said that gave officers probable cause to pursue them.

An ICE agent told the woman the area was being targeted because of a known criminal but said agents did not know whether either man was the person they were seeking.

Falconer said his primary concern was that no one in the crowd was injured and that no chemical agents were used.

Another attendee, who requested anonymity, said she saw an ICE agent shove a woman who was bringing blankets into a portable toilet.

Falconer said one of the men on the roof eventually succumbed to the cold and came down, and an ambulance transported him for medical attention. The other man remained on the roof until about 1:30 p.m., when ICE agents left the scene.

Onlookers asked ICE agents for permission to give the remaining man on the roof blankets, hand warmers or a warm drink to prevent hypothermia, Falconer said, but the requests were denied.

Falconer said two women later made their way to the back of the construction site and entered the building to give the man blankets and hand warmers. ICE agents left around that time.

After ICE departed, the man was able to come down from the roof, and members of the crowd helped him into a car to seek medical attention, Falconer said.

The Sahan Journal reported that the men were Edgar Chicaiza Dutan and Marco Chicaiza Dutan. Edgar Chicaiza Dutan came down from the roof first and was taken to a nearby hospital before being transported to the Freeborn County Adult Detention Center.

It was unclear whether Marco Chicaiza Dutan was detained, The Sahan Journal reported.",https://www.eplocalnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_1344-e1766085422554.jpeg,N,,2025-12-20 16:57:39.786323

At the Farmville Detention Center, as of Nov. 28, the average daily detainee population was 712 — just 20 shy of its maximum capacity of 732.

TRAC Immigration also lists detainee information for Riverside Regional Jail, a Prince George County facility that entered into an agreement with ICE to house its detainees in May.

Riverside’s detainee population has ballooned since September. At that time, it held only an average of 9 detainees on a given day. As of Nov. 28, that average was 94 detainees.

What do we know about these detainees?

ICE’s own data reveals that the majority of the detainees held at Virginia facilities are not considered criminals. A similar number of these detainees have no “ICE Threat Level,” which means they have no criminal history.

Notably, most of the detainees held at Riverside are not considered criminals and have no ICE Threat Level.

More institutions in Los Angeles and Long Beach plan to host Am I Next?","Each evening, drivers on the busy 101 freeway in downtown Los Angeles pass billboard-size portraits of Angelenos that flash across the side of a building with a simple message next to their faces: Am I Next?

Three Los Angeles institutions have teamed up to launch a response to federal immigration raids in the nation’s second-largest city, projecting illuminated images of everyday LA residents in support of the thousands of community members who have been detained this year.

Part of a protest art project entitled Am I Next?, the striking black and white images began appearing nightly on 6 November on the facades of the downtown buildings of the California Community Foundation, LA Plaza Cultura y Artes and the Japanese American National Museum in objection to the undermining of democratic norms and attacks on civil liberties.

Along with projecting portraits of Angelenos, Am I Next? highlights brief stories of people, including US citizens, accosted and snatched out of homes, cars, workplaces and the streets by federal agents, under the word “Taken”:

Mauricio, waiting for a bus.

Rosalina, at home with her children.

Juan, on lunch break from his construction job.

The campaign addresses the fear and trauma millions have experienced since Donald Trump and his administration began its violent and militarized approach to immigration enforcement in June – one that’s changed day-to-day life in a city where nearly half of its residents are Latino.

It also asks the question: if fellow residents are arrested without consideration of constitutional rights, then who is really safe?

“I carry my passport around, which I never imagined as a native Angeleno,” said Miguel Santana, president and chief executive of California Community Foundation, or CalFund. “I know people who are afraid to leave their homes, who don’t go shopping at Home Depot – because it doesn’t matter if you’re a US citizen or not. We’re putting up a mirror to what is happening.”

More than 65,000 immigrants across the US are confined in federal detention, a two-thirds increase since January, and recent data shows that 74% of those in custody have no criminal convictions.

A few of the faces in Am I Next? are familiar: the veteran actors and activists Edward James Olmos and George Takei, who was incarcerated as a five-year-old boy during the second world war, and Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass. The dozens of others are LA residents who Pulitzer-winning photographer Barbara Davidson met throughout city neighborhoods such as East LA, Venice and Echo Park.

“Some were too nervous to participate because they, or a family member, were in the process of becoming citizens and didn’t want to risk jeopardizing their application,” said Davidson. “Others were eager to take a stand against the ICE raids.”

A dedicated website allows people to submit their own photos in a show of solidarity.

“The photos draw contrast to the cowardice of the masked men who hide their faces because they know what they’re doing is wrong,” said Santana, whose own portrait appears on CalFund’s building, which is visible from City Hall and walking distance from ICE’s downtown LA detention center. “Courage is the best antidote to authoritarianism.”

For the Japanese American community, the use of force, dehumanization tactics, lack of due process and the racist targeting of immigrants feels all too familiar.

The Japanese American National Museum, or JANM, in historic Little Tokyo is not only a nightly canvas for protest art, but was where more than 37,000 Japanese Americans from Los Angeles boarded buses for American concentration camps in 1942. It’s also where about 75 armed federal agents conducted an immigration raid in August, during a news conference event with Gavin Newsom, a sight that caused widespread outrage.

“What’s at the heart of this campaign is a reminder to people that when we protect the rights of anyone in our community, we are really protecting the rights for everyone, including ourselves,” said James Herr, director of the Democracy Center at JANM. “The same kind of xenophobia, fear, prejudice and racism that Japanese Americans faced during world war two is what our current immigrant populations are facing.”

JANM’s evening projections also incorporate images of former incarcerated people with Angelenos standing against ICE raids.

At the nearby LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes, over 30 large-scale digital images and neon from 10 LA-based artists, including Brandy González, Lalo Alcaráz and Patrick Martinez are on view in addition to images from Am I Next? The bold and colorful works, entitled We Belong Here, reflect the immigrant experience and call for justice with messages such as “Invest in the oppressed“ and “It is the weak who are cruel”.

More institutions in Los Angeles and Long Beach plan to host Am I Next? on their walls, and Santana said he’s heard from colleagues in San Francisco and New York who are looking to project similar images to bring awareness.

“The violent way in which [immigration enforcement] is happening really needs to be exposed and not normalized,” said Santana, who said the project will run indefinitely. “We will keep it going until we can all sleep at night knowing that our core American constitutional rights are not going to be violated. We’re living in a moment where every American has to decide if those rights apply to all of us or some of us.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/050396c33302b183c96c76b9d3d64e36f100b37b/0_0_1000_800/master/1000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cd3b0919e20567f139395161314cb87d",N,,2025-12-20 17:57:12.955260

“The restrictions on immigration judges’ free speech rights are unconstitutional, and it’s intolerable that this prior restraint is still in place,” Krishnan said.
The court has sided with the Trump administration about two dozen times on issues ranging from immigration to federal funding.","The Supreme Court sided with immigration judges on Friday, rebuffing the Trump administration for now in a case with possible implications for federal workers as the justices weigh expanding presidential firing power.

The decision is a technical step in a long-running case, but it touches on the effects of a series of high-profile firings under President Donald Trump. The justices let stand a ruling that raised questions about the Trump administration's handling of the federal workforce, though they also signaled that lower courts should move cautiously.

Immigration judges are federal employees, and the question at the center of the appeal is about whether they can sue to challenge a policy restricting their public speeches or if they are required to use a separate complaint system for the federal workforce.

Trump's Republican administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene after an appeals court found that Trump’s firings of top complaint system officials had raised questions about whether it's still working as intended.

The Justice Department said the firings are within the president’s power and the lower court had no grounds to raise questions. The solicitor general asked the Supreme Court to quickly freeze the ruling as he pushes to have the immigration judges’ case removed from federal court.

The justices declined, though they also said the Trump administration could return if the lower courts moved too fast. There were no noted dissents. The court has allowed most of Trump’s firings for now and is weighing whether to formally expand his legal power to fire independent agency officials by overturning job protections enshrined in a 90-year-old decision.

A union formerly representing immigration judges, who work for the Justice Department, first sued in 2020 to challenge a policy restricting what the judges can speak about in public. They say the case is a free-speech issue that belongs in federal court.

Ramya Krishnan, an attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute who argued the case on the union's behalf, applauded the high court's Friday decision. “The restrictions on immigration judges’ free speech rights are unconstitutional, and it’s intolerable that this prior restraint is still in place,” Krishnan said.

In recent months, the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration has included firing dozens of immigration judges who are seen by his allies as too lenient.

The White House did not immediately respond to an email message seeking comment Friday.

While the order is not a final decision, the case could eventually have implications for other federal workers who want to challenge firings in court rather than the employee complaint system now largely overseen by Trump appointees.

A landmark 1992 lawsuit that reined in Border Patrol tactics around the campus is now colliding with a fresh policy shift in Washington and a recent Supreme Court order, and the combination has locals worrying that the protections they fought for are slipping away.

The 1992 case that shaped protections

Back in 1992, Bowie students, a coach, and school staff filed a class action against the Border Patrol after years of stops, searches, and detentions in the blocks surrounding the school. In Murillo v. Musegades, a federal judge certified the class and issued injunctive relief that told agents they needed reasonable suspicion and could not rely solely on a person’s race or appearance when deciding whom to stop. Case records show the lawsuit produced a preliminary injunction and pushed the agency to adopt training and other measures for agents. According to the Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse, the suit was filed to halt what plaintiffs described as unconstitutional stops and searches around Bowie’s campus.

In El Paso, that ruling is still remembered as a turning point that helped seed the broader practice of limiting immigration enforcement at so-called sensitive locations, including schools. Advocates say the Bowie case was not just about legal doctrine; it was about giving students enough breathing room to walk to class in a border city where daily life and federal enforcement can feel uncomfortably intertwined.

Bowie memories and local fear

Former students and staff who testified in the 1990s recounted a tense routine outside the school: Border Patrol trucks pulling up to curbs, agents rifling through backpacks and questioning employees in front of students. Those encounters and threats have stuck with them for decades. Ernesto Muñoz, one of the students involved in the original case, told reporters that he and his family now take extra precautions, including carrying passports, because they fear being profiled. His experience, along with similar accounts from other alumni, has been detailed in recent coverage of how the Bowie case still echoes today, as reported by Texas Public Radio.

Policy reversal in Washington

On January 20, 2025, the Department of Homeland Security issued a directive that revoked earlier guidance shielding so-called protected or sensitive locations, including schools, houses of worship, and hospitals. Instead, the department told agents to lean on enforcement discretion and “common sense.” In a statement that month, DHS declared, “Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America's schools and churches to avoid arrest,” language widely read as a sharp break from long-standing practice. The shift was announced by DHS and covered by national outlets, including Reuters.

Supreme Court stay and its aftermath

Over the summer and into the fall, lower federal courts in California imposed limits on certain roving immigration stops. In September, the Supreme Court stepped in and granted emergency relief, staying a district court order that had barred stops based solely on apparent race, language, occupation, or place. The unsigned stay drew a pointed dissent from Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who wrote, “We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job,” according to the Court’s published materials. The order is an interim measure while the underlying litigation continues in the lower courts, as documented by the Legal Information Institute.

Legal implications

Taken together, the DHS directive and the Supreme Court’s stay have narrowed the real-world protection that communities believed they had after the Bowie litigation, according to legal observers. The moves have also triggered a wave of new lawsuits and advocacy efforts. Several organizations and religious institutions have sued to block DHS’s rollback of protected-areas guidance, arguing that the change runs afoul of administrative law and religious-freedom guarantees. In those cases, plaintiffs have brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act and, in some complaints, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, as tracked by Bloomberg Law and Public Counsel.

What it means for El Paso

Bowie High sprawls across roughly 60 acres, less than a mile from the U.S.-Mexico border, in a city that is more than 80 percent Mexican American. For many residents, the recent legal shifts have stirred up old worries about what can happen on a simple walk down the street. Former plaintiffs and alumni say the 1992 ruling created a sense of safety around the school that now feels tenuous under the new federal posture, a concern that has surfaced repeatedly in local interviews. “Even though I am an American citizen . . .

The backstory:

It all surrounds a 212c, which deals with convictions before 1997.

Alma Garza was supposed to periodically check in with ICE. When she did just that last month, she was taken into custody.

Garza has been a legal resident of the United States since 1978. Her United States permanent resident card doesn't expire until 9/23/2035.

In 1995, Garza plead guilty to felony marijuana possession and served three years' probation.

After the 212c became an issue, her daughter, Alma Torres, says her mother did everything she was supposed to do, yet she was detained when she went to the ICE office last month for her routine check-in.

Torres says her mother hasn't had any legal trouble since the 1995 conviction, and she doesn't understand why she's being detained.

She says her mother is diabetic and the stress of being held in the detention center is taking a toll on her health.

The mother of five adults could be deported. She has a trial set for sometime in 2026.

Nowhere does the agency provide statistical proof that these trained, federally authorized drivers are less safe than anyone else.
This hostility did not emerge spontaneously; it intensified after government statements portraying immigrant drivers as threats.
Lawfully present, federally authorized immigrant drivers meet the same safety standards as every other CDL holder.
Immigration status is not — and has never been — a proxy for risk.","Federal regulators have created a trucking crisis — and they did it by ignoring their own evidence, bypassing basic safeguards and targeting a workforce that has kept America moving through every national emergency of the past decade.

In September, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) issued an interim final rule that effectively bars most lawfully present, work-authorized immigrant drivers from obtaining, renewing or maintaining non-domiciled commercial driver’s licenses.

The rule limits eligibility to just three visa categories — H-2A, H-2B and E-2 — while excluding refugees, asylees, DACA recipients and other federally authorized workers who have long been able to drive using a valid employment authorization document.

These drivers meet every federal safety requirement, pass the same tests, satisfy the same medical standards and comply with the same drug-and-alcohol protocols as every other CDL holder. Yet FMCSA is treating immigration category as a disqualifying risk.

The agency offers no practical evidence that immigration status predicts highway danger. Instead, it points to a handful of isolated crashes and speculative concerns about foreign driving records that some states may struggle to verify.

FMCSA’s own regulatory analysis acknowledges that the rule will force roughly 194,000 current non-domiciled CDL holders, about 97 percent of this workforce — to exit the freight market. Nowhere does the agency provide statistical proof that these trained, federally authorized drivers are less safe than anyone else.

The weakness of the rule becomes clearer when you examine the cases federal officials spotlighted to justify it. After August’s fatal accident involving a Sikh trucker in Florida, pundits and government voices rushed to portray the named driver as an “illegal immigrant,” using the tragedy to argue that states were recklessly licensing “dangerous foreign drivers.”

That narrative was false. He held a state-issued commercial license and a valid employment authorization document — the same credentials federal rules had long recognized as sufficient.

Those facts were in the government’s own files but were pushed aside in favor of a storyline that made immigration status — not the actual safety record — the focus of public outrage.

The pattern repeated in Ontario, California, weeks later. After a September crash involving another Sikh driver, speculation exploded across social media and cable analysis, including widely spread allegations that the named trucker had been driving under the influence.

Those claims were also false. Official toxicology results came back negative, countering sensational allegations that had already shaped public sentiment.

Rather than correct the record, critics folded the case into the same sweeping narrative, suggesting, again without evidence, that immigrant drivers posed a systemic threat despite having met every federal safety requirement.

Both tragedies were real, but Washington’s selective framing was a choice, one that turned isolated incidents into a manufactured rationale for a national crackdown on work-authorized immigrant drivers.

The result is a policy driven less by evidence than by politics. Courts have long held that agencies cannot rely on impermissible factors, such as nationality or immigration status masked as a safety metric, to justify sweeping rulemaking.

That is why on Nov. 10, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued an administrative stay, pausing FMCSA’s rule while it evaluates whether the agency exceeded its authority and failed to justify its departure from longstanding federal practice.

Meanwhile, the human and economic fallout is unfolding now. Sikh and immigrant truckers — roughly 1 in 5 long-haul drivers — are reporting harassment, profiling and bias at levels that my organization, UNITED SIKHS, has not seen in years.

Drivers describe water bottles thrown at their trucks, insults shouted from passing vehicles and increased traffic stops solely because of how they look or the turbans and unshorn beards that are sacred markers of Sikh faith. This hostility did not emerge spontaneously; it intensified after government statements portraying immigrant drivers as threats.

The policy also destabilizes an already strained supply chain. The trucking industry is projected to face a shortage of more than 160,000 drivers by 2030. Removing nearly 200,000 trained, authorized drivers — without demonstrating any safety benefit — is reckless.

When experienced drivers are sidelined, those remaining face longer hauls, tighter schedules and greater fatigue. Federal safety research makes clear what that means: more exhaustion, more risk and less stability for the freight system that keeps hospitals, grocery stores and small businesses supplied.

Across the country, 19 states and the District of Columbia allow otherwise-eligible residents to obtain standard driver’s licenses regardless of immigration status because lawmakers understand a basic truth: licensed, trained and insured drivers make roads safer. FMCSA’s rule ignores that truth entirely.

Federal leadership cannot remain silent while misinformation shapes national policy. Lawfully present, federally authorized immigrant drivers meet the same safety standards as every other CDL holder. Immigration status is not — and has never been — a proxy for risk.

America’s freight system depends on these drivers. The real danger to our roads is not immigrant truckers, it is the willingness of federal officials to substitute political narratives for evidence.

Washington, D.C. must reverse the new FMCSA rule now, before it spirals into a full-blown crisis for safety, commerce and civil rights.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/trucker_california_11152021_AP25335707952808-1.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-20 11:58:12.044656

Thomas Massie and I are exploring all options,” he also said, among them possible impeachment of justice department officials, finding them in contempt of Congress.
Trump’s justice department was required to release all investigative files involving the late financier by 19 December under the Epstein Files Transparency Act.
Todd Blanche, Trump’s former criminal defense lawyer turned deputy attorney general, said the justice department would not release all its files on Friday.
“The [justice department] is breaking the law by not releasing the full Epstein files.","Donald Trump’s justice department was hit with legal threats and scathing outrage after authorities released a limited, heavily redacted trove of Jeffrey Epstein files in an apparent violation of the law mandating the near-complete disclosure of these documents by Friday.

“The justice department’s document dump this afternoon does not comply with Thomas Massie and my Epstein Transparency Act,” Ro Khanna, the California Democratic congressman who co-authored the law requiring full disclosure of all Epstein files by 19 December, said in a video statement.

“It is an incomplete release, with too many redactions. Thomas Massie and I are exploring all options,” he also said, among them possible impeachment of justice department officials, finding them in contempt of Congress.

Khanna also floated the possibility of “referring for prosecution those who are obstructing justice”.

“Unfortunately, today’s document release by @AGPamBondi and @DAGToddBlanche grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law that @realDonaldTrump signed just 30 days ago. @RepRoKhannais correct,” Massie, a Kentucky member of Congress and co-author of this legislation, said on X.

“A future [justice department] could convict the current AG and others because the Epstein Files Transparency Act is not like a Congressional Subpoena which expires at the end of each Congress,” Massie said at another point.

Trump’s justice department was required to release all investigative files involving the late financier by 19 December under the Epstein Files Transparency Act. The legislation does allow for records to be withheld or redacted if their disclosure would imperil present criminal investigations, threaten national security or identify Epstein’s victims – but otherwise it mandates disclosure of everything else.

The department’s initial disclosure on Friday afternoon, and subsequent releases throughout the night, did not abide by this requirement. Justice officials recognized as much on Friday morning, pre-empting this apparent slow walk on television. Todd Blanche, Trump’s former criminal defense lawyer turned deputy attorney general, said the justice department would not release all its files on Friday.

“I expect we’re going to release several hundred thousand documents today, and those documents will come in all different forms, photographs and other materials associated with all of the investigations into Mr Epstein,” Blanche said during a Fox News interview.

“I expect that we’re going to release more documents over the next couple of weeks, so today several hundred thousand and then over the next couple weeks, I expect several hundred thousand more,” Blanche also said. “There’s a lot of eyes looking at these and we want to make sure that when we do produce the materials we are producing, that we are protecting every single victim.”

Some new files, including transcripts, were released on Saturday.

Late on Friday, New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was among the bipartisan chorus of lawmakers slamming Trump’s justice department, including the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, and the FBI director, Kash Patel, for the documents’ lackluster rollout.

“Now the coverup is out in the open. This is far from over. Everyone involved will have to answer for this,” Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, said on X. “Pam Bondi, Kash Patel, whole admin. Protecting a bunch of rapists and pedophiles because they have money, power, and connections. Bondi should resign tonight.”

Fellow Democratic congressman Robert Garcia voiced similar sentiments.

“The [justice department] is breaking the law by not releasing the full Epstein files. This is not transparency. This is just more coverup by Donald Trump and Pam Bondi. They need to release all the files, NOW,” the Democratic oversight committee leader said on X.

“The [justice department] has had months and hundreds of agents to put these files together, and yet entire documents are redacted – from the first word to the last. What are they hiding? The American public deserves transparency. Release all the files now!” he also commented.

In a joint statement from House oversight committee Democrats, Garcia and Jamie Raskin said: “Donald Trump and the Department of Justice are now violating federal law as they continue covering up the facts and the evidence about Jeffrey Epstein’s decades-long, billion-dollar, international sex trafficking ring …

“We are now examining all legal options in the face of this violation of federal law,” the statement added.

The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, said the release violated both “the spirit of transparency and the letter of the law”.

“Senate Democrats are working to assess the documents that have been released to determine what actions must be taken to hold the Trump administration accountable,” Schumer also said. “We will pursue every option to make sure the truth comes out.”

Trump’s justice department has gone on the defensive over this criticism, insisting on social media that authorities are complying with the law. A justice department account on X pointed to the many photos of Bill Clinton released in the tranche, claiming their disclosure bolstered claims of accountability. (Clinton has denied wrongdoing related to Epstein and expressed regret for previously associating with him.)","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61b2984b93810628bd47c0b7af1ab09000b0d249/514_429_3079_2464/master/3079.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e30128fcb72d8b2c5e1106016b02e33f",N,,2025-12-20 13:57:16.286049

When unaccompanied immigrant children first arrive in the US, they are apprehended by CBP and remain in their custody for a maximum of 72 hours.
Meanwhile, the number of unaccompanied children arriving to the US across the Mexico border has significantly decreased this year, due to the Trump administration’s border policies severely restricting asylum.
Wyden wrote in his 8 December letter that the document is not only coercive, but “it intentionally misrepresents the US Government’s obligations to unaccompanied children under law”.","Border officials are pressuring unaccompanied children who arrive in the US as undocumented immigrants to quickly agree to return to their countries of origin, even if they express fear for their safety there – or else face “prolonged” detention and other consequences, a federal government document reveals.

The document, which emerged as an attachment in a court filing made by immigration attorneys, is understood to be presented or read to children within the first few days of them entering the US while they are still in the custody of Customs and Border Protection (CBP), before they can see any relatives in the US.

The document is termed an “advisal” and was attached as exhibit A at the bottom of a court filing by advocates. It says: “If you choose to seek a hearing with an immigration judge or indicate a fear of returning to your country you can expect the following: you will be detained in the custody of the United States Government for a prolonged period of time.” It goes on to say that the child’s sponsor – usually a family member residing in the US who will care for the child – “may be arrested, prosecuted and deported” if they do not have legal status, or prosecuted “for aiding your illegal entry”, and adds that if the child turns 18 in government custody they “will be turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement [ICE] for removal (deportation) …”

A US senator is now demanding “this cruel policy” be abolished, saying it “cynically exploits” unaccompanied children’s unique vulnerabilities as a way of pushing the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda.

Senator Ron Wyden from Oregon, a Democrat and the ranking member of the Senate’s finance committee, has written to CBP accusing the agency of trying to frighten children into abandoning their rights by showing them a document with choices that he describes as “shockingly coercive”.

He added in the letter, shared exclusively with the Guardian, that the policy was “clearly intended to frighten unaccompanied children into abandoning the legal relief and protections they are seeking”.

The document, titled the UAC [Unaccompanied Alien Children] Processing Pathway Advisal, was filed in court in Washington DC as part of a longstanding lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), opposing the detention of children immediately after they turn 18, brought by the National Immigrant Justice Center (NIJC), an immigrants’ rights and legal organization based in Chicago, and other organizations. The advisal and the court filing were first reported by ProPublica last month, as part of a wider investigation by that outlet into immigrant child detention.

A CBP spokesperson sent a statement to the Guardian this week that said: “The advisal document provided to unaccompanied children explains options available under the Immigration and Nationality Act on their path forward. CBP’s duty is to follow the law and protect children. Many unaccompanied minors are brought to the border by smugglers and face real risks of exploitation, which is why providing a clear, lawful advisal is essential. It ensures they understand their rights and options – and for many who were trafficked or coerced, returning home to their family is the safest path.”

Wyden first wrote to CBP on 4 November about the policy change after reading US media reports about it, and then, after the advisal emerged, wrote to the agency again on 8 December. In the latest letter, he wrote: “Unaccompanied children are a uniquely vulnerable population, arriving in this country without guardians and often fleeing threats of violence, trafficking, abuse, and neglect. CBP’s new policy and the Advisal cynically exploit these vulnerabilities to remove unaccompanied children before they can access essential protections.”

The advisal offers an apparent incentive if children agree to return whence they came. “If you choose to voluntarily return to your country, there will be no administrative consequence, and you will still have the opportunity to apply for a visa, through legal means, in the future,” it says.

However, this is a “false carrot”, said Lisa Koop, the national director of legal services for the National Immigrant Justice Center (NIJC).

“It gives a suggestion that you can come back legally if you withdraw your request now,” Koop explained. “While there is perhaps some scenario where someone qualifies for a student visa or a family-based visa decades in the future, the suggestion that there’s going to be a legal path is a false one.”

CBP put the new policy in place earlier this year and it was previously confirmed in a 4 December letter to Wyden by the CBP commissioner, Rodney Scott, that the Guardian obtained.

Wyden’s letter comes as the Trump administration escalates its immigration enforcement operations aimed at immigrant children: this year, officials have sought out unaccompanied immigrant children to deport them or pursue criminal cases against them or their vetted sponsors; offered cash incentives for children to leave; and attempted to secretly and quickly deport dozens of Guatemalan children.

When unaccompanied immigrant children first arrive in the US, they are apprehended by CBP and remain in their custody for a maximum of 72 hours. Unaccompanied children are then transferred to the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), where they are placed in shelters or foster homes or with vetted sponsors. ORR comes under the umbrella of the federal Department of Health and Human Services and also offers some legal assistance for children, through other organizations, to navigate the complicated immigration courts and asylum processes.

The document came to NIJC’s attention when an attorney, representing an unaccompanied child in an ORR shelter, discovered it among the child’s other records. The identity or other personal details about the minor in question have not been publicly disclosed.

Some children affected, who oftentimes have a limited understanding of the English language, are seemingly provided with the potentially intimidating advisal document without access to legal help, since they are still in CBP custody, before being transferred to the control of ORR.

Koop from NIJC says she and her team had never seen the advisal before they obtained it last month, despite having worked on hundreds of cases with unaccompanied minors.

“It’s not something that we’ve seen or that we were aware of in advance,” Koop said. “The most generous reading would be that it is extremely misleading.”

It is unclear whether the advisal is a piece of paper given to children or if it is just information that CBP officials verbally convey to children, Koop said. The short document, with its bullet points marking the different warnings, is in English and Spanish.

Meanwhile, the number of unaccompanied children arriving to the US across the Mexico border has significantly decreased this year, due to the Trump administration’s border policies severely restricting asylum.

“We know this administration is laser-focused on deporting children and preventing unaccompanied minors from accessing protection in the United States,” Koop said. “Even under the first Trump administration, we didn’t see this kind of coercion and threats. This is new and different.”

In mid-November, attorneys included the advisal in a court filing, as part of a longstanding lawsuit against DHS opposing the detention of children who turn 18.

It is unclear how many children the policy has so far affected.

Wyden wrote in his 8 December letter that the document is not only coercive, but “it intentionally misrepresents the US Government’s obligations to unaccompanied children under law”.

“While I have no difficulty believing the Trump administration intends to break the law, even at the expense of this vulnerable group, the Advisal blatantly misrepresents the rights unaccompanied children are entitled to in order to coerce them into voluntarily departing,” Wyden writes. “Further, the Advisal threatens immigration enforcement against family members to discourage children from seeking to reunify.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b473664ce8a9a033c7254ff69938d8a5bd5873df/331_781_4014_3212/master/4014.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4bb76f50fa652909cd8d8b19432c3237",N,,2025-12-20 11:58:16.858874

Each person who received such a ruling has 30 days to appeal it.

The rulings, immigration attorneys said, open the door for hundreds more immigrants across the Bay Area to be sent to countries like Honduras, Ecuador and Uganda, which have agreements with the United States to take asylum-seekers. They can theoretically continue applying for asylum from there, but that would be up to the host government.

One mother, who appeared beside her husband, tearfully accepted the news that Judge Patrick O’Brien had granted the Department of Homeland Security’s motion to send her family to Honduras. Technically, this is called a pretermit.

At the hearing, she stood before O’Brien with only her husband as her two teenage sons were in school. All will be sent to Honduras if they are unable to successfully appeal the motion. Judge O’Brien also ruled in favor of the government’s motions against two other families and one man.

The rulings have broad implications. Blaine Bookey, the legal director at UC Law San Francisco, said hundreds of asylum-seekers in the region have received “pretermit motions” in recent weeks to move their cases to third countries.

All could now receive similar judgments, and be at risk for deportation.

Jorge Ramirez, an asylum-seeker from South America in court on Thursday, received a 30-day reprieve, but the possibility of being sent to Honduras lingers. “This situation has taken me by surprise,” he said in Spanish. “I came here in fear of my life, escaping my country … I came with trust in this country and understanding that it respects human rights.”

In response to a flood of cases like Ramirez’s, Bay Area attorneys have been working around the clock to help asylum-seekers respond to the new motions, using pre-written templates to help expedite the mass filings.

Filing a response is critical and preserves an asylum-seeker’s right to appeal a decision in favor of removal. If an asylum-seeker fails to file the mandatory response, judges can rule solely based on the government’s motion, said Nicole Gorney, an attorney for the nonprofit VIDAS LEGAL.

“Right now, it’s about trying to preserve any option for them, because we need time,” she said. Gorney and other attorneys are hoping for an injunction that will halt these motions altogether.

Until then, detentions are likely to spike for those without lawyers. “They’re not going to have a way to defend themselves and they’ll be detained and held in detention centers with nowhere to go,” said Milli Atkinson, head of the immigration unit at the Bar Association of San Francisco.

Another asylum-seeker on Thursday’s docket sat beside her attorney, who had filed a 134-page brief on her behalf in response to another motion to send the woman to Honduras.

The lawyer opened by reminding O’Brien that Honduras was under no obligation to allow the woman to seek asylum there. A March 2020 agreement with the United States, he argued, limits the quota of asylum-seekers to 240 over two years, or about 10 people per month.

O’Brien said his hands were tied. “The Board [of Immigration Appeals] has already told me that I can’t consider that,” he said.

Honduras is an extremely dangerous country, the lawyer continued, especially for women. “Honduras has one of the highest rates of violent deaths of women in the world,” the World Bank wrote in a 2023 report. O’Brien commended the attorney’s arguments but granted the request for her removal. “I understand that Honduras is a dangerous place for women,” he told the attorney. “But I can’t find that she is likely to be tortured there, despite the country’s conditions.”

“The law is not on your side,” he said in another asylum-seekers’ case.

Each asylum-seeker now has 30 days to submit an appeal. When Ramirez left the courtroom on Thursday, he felt hopeless.

“What will I do in Honduras?” he asked. “I feel discouraged, very sad, and very worried at this moment.”",https://newspack-missionlocal.s3.amazonaws.com/mission/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/082625_MMG_SansomePrayerVigil-03-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 10:57:35.463825

The decision represents one of the most significant judicial challenges to the administration’s use of the offshore military installation as part of its broader immigration agenda.

U.S. District Court Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan, sitting in Washington, D.C., denied the federal government’s request to dismiss a class‑action lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, allowing the case to proceed and sharply limiting the administration’s ability to rely on Guantánamo as a holding site for migrants awaiting deportation.

A legal setback for the administration

Judge Sooknanan concluded that federal immigration law does not authorize the executive branch to detain deportable migrants at overseas military bases, a finding that directly undercuts the administration’s justification for expanding operations at Guantánamo Bay.

The ruling prevents the government from shutting down the lawsuit and opens the door to further judicial scrutiny of the policy.

The ACLU indicated it will now seek a formal closure order requiring the government to halt migrant detentions at the base, a step the judge did not take in her ruling but left open for future litigation.

The decision follows Trump’s January directive instructing federal agencies to prepare the Guantánamo facility to hold up to 30,000 migrants.

Trump said, “We have 30,000 beds in Guantanamo to detain the worst criminal illegal aliens threatening the American people… we’re going to send them out to Guantanamo,” according to statements reported at the time.

How the Policy Developed

The administration began transferring migrants with final removal orders to Guantánamo in February, using the base as a staging point for deportations.

Court records cited by the judge show that between February and June, federal authorities held hundreds of migrants there as part of the expanded enforcement effort.

According to filings referenced in the ruling, immigration authorities housed approximately 710 male detainees in a tent‑based setup supported by U.S. soldiers and Marines.

The ACLU’s lawsuit centers on two individuals who were deported through the base and argues that the policy places migrants in a “legal limbo,” depriving them of access to counsel and procedural protections commonly available within the United States.

Immigrant‑rights groups and individual plaintiffs contend that the use of an overseas military installation for routine immigration detention violates statutory limits on executive power and undermines due‑process rights.

They argue that detainees transferred to Guantánamo face significant barriers to legal representation and judicial review.

Government response

The Department of Homeland Security has defended the use of Guantánamo, saying it falls within the agency’s authority to hold noncitizens with final removal orders at a U.S. military facility and arguing the policy targets severe criminal cases.

In public statements to reporters, Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the government “look forward to a higher court’s vindication of our use of this facility to keep criminals off American streets.”

The government has signaled it will press its legal arguments on appeal if necessary.

Voices from civil-rights groups

Baher Azmy, legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, said that the expansion of Guantánamo for immigration purposes resurrects the base’s “symbol of lawlessness and torture” and that courts must act to protect detainees’ rights.

Eunice Cho of the ACLU’s National Prison Project called offshore transfers “cruel, secretive and illegal,” warning that incommunicado detention violates constitutional protections.

The government has indicated that it may seek appellate relief if adverse rulings are upheld.

The plaintiffs are pressing not only to stop new transfers but to secure meaningful court oversight and, ultimately, to prevent the continued practice of warehousing immigration detainees at Guantánamo.",https://media.knewz.com/bdbyftnvpv/styles/card-social/2025/12/19/Untitled-design-85.png.webp?version=69460e2d7d9aa,N,,2025-12-20 17:57:48.682814

The United States has had such an agreement with its close ally and neighbor Canada for more than two decades.","The Trump administration is intensifying efforts to deport people to countries where they have no connections.

Last month, lawyers for the Department of Homeland Security filed almost 5,000 motions to dismiss asylum cases and force applicants to seek protection elsewhere, a staggering increase from the few hundred such motions filed each month this summer.

The surge, documented in an analysis of public immigration court data, comes as federal officials have been working out new asylum agreements with a handful of nations, including Honduras and Uganda. Under these “safe third country” accords, foreign governments are offering to take in limited numbers of asylum seekers from the United States, promising that the U.S. deportees will be able to apply for asylum in those nations instead.

In immigration courts across the country, government lawyers are now increasingly asking judges to “pretermit,” or dismiss, asylum cases without hearings, asserting that applicants can seek asylum in those “safe third countries.”

Judges appear receptive to the requests, according to the court data analysis. In November, at least 230 asylum seekers who were not citizens of Honduras were ordered expelled to Honduras, as compared with 40 such people in October and one in September.

Homeland Security officials say the process will allow people to pursue asylum claims in countries where they do not fear persecution. “D.H.S. is using every lawful tool available to address the backlog and abuse of the asylum system,” the agency said in a statement.

In some cases, an immigrant may be subject to multiple motions, and D.H.S. officials have told agency prosecutors across the country that they should list as many third-country agreements as possible for a given immigrant, according to agency guidance obtained by The New York Times.

But as this practice has been expanded, it has been coming under more scrutiny, with deportation to Uganda, more than 7,000 miles from Washington, faulted by some immigration lawyers as unduly harsh.

On Friday, D.H.S. lawyers were issued a new directive that motions seeking deportation to Uganda could be filed only for immigrants from most other African nations, according to the document obtained by The Times. For motions to Uganda that had already been filed, it instructed lawyers to “expeditiously move to withdraw” them. That included the high-profile case of Heng Guan, the Chinese national who sought asylum in the United States after recording the surveillance of Uyghurs.

Lawyers who represent immigrants and scholars who study the asylum system called the motions the latest attempt to dismantle international human rights protections that President Trump has denounced as a “scam.”

In the federal lawsuit filed during the first Trump administration and resurrected in September, several asylum seekers and immigrant rights groups contend that the third-country asylum agreements are unlawful and an attempt to shirk the United States’ international obligations.

For decades, a person who enters the United States and seeks asylum has been allowed to live and work in the country while the case moves through an overburdened and underfunded court system.

But with fewer and fewer legal pathways to enter the United States, asylum claims have proliferated in recent years. The backlog now totals almost four million cases, and wait times for hearings have tended to span about four years and in some cases longer. That in turn has made the asylum system a target for critics from across the political spectrum. They argue the broken system incentivizes migrants with claims that have little or no merit under international law to use the form of relief as the surest path to remain in the country for at least several years.

In his first term in office, Mr. Trump, a vocal skeptic of asylum seekers, began an almost methodical approach to dismantling the asylum process. In 2024, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. prevented migrants from seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border after crossings at the border reached record heights, a policy that led those numbers to later drastically drop.

Since Mr. Trump’s return to the White House, his administration has taken its most aggressive actions against the system yet. It has directed Homeland Security lawyers to request the dismissal of asylum cases en masse. It has urged immigration judges to deny relief without holding hearings. It has put all pending asylum applications on hold.

Hiroshi Motomura, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the asylum system had long been due for a reckoning because of the pressures it has been under for generations. But accelerating dismissals of asylum cases is a misguided way to address the backlog, he added. The administration has been pursuing the fast-track strategy while simultaneously underfunding the system, he said, meaning fewer resources to ensure petitioners are having their cases fairly resolved.

“Efficiency is one goal, but so is accuracy, and you can be very efficient but be very inaccurate,” he said.

The analysis that showed the surge in dismissal motions for asylum seekers was conducted by Joseph Gunther, an independent mathematician, and Brandon Marrow, a civic technologist, who teamed up to analyze immigration court data as part of an effort to make the asylum process more transparent. Their research is shared on a website that Mr. Marrow created to provide free immigration court insights for lawyers.

The analysis showed that Homeland Security lawyers began filing motions to dismiss in hundreds of cases in Omaha over the summer, shortly after the administration signed new asylum agreements with Guatemala and Uganda. The practice took off in November after the Board of Immigration Appeals — the Justice Department body that reviews rulings from immigration courts and sets their policies — overturned a judge’s ruling in one of those asylum cases and delivered a decisive victory for the Department of Homeland Security.

Under that decision, immigration judges are instructed to consider whether to dismiss asylum cases without hearings on the grounds that immigrants can instead be sent to other countries to pursue relief there. The United States has had such an agreement with its close ally and neighbor Canada for more than two decades. But the new agreements are with a host of less stable nations: Ecuador, Guatemala and Honduras, all of which have endured high levels of gang violence, and Uganda, which has a checkered human rights record and borders conflict regions in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

For months, the Trump administration has been deporting migrants to troubled nations such as South Sudan, and to the tiny African monarchy of Eswatini. But the newer “safe third country” agreements are different in that they require that deportees from the United States be afforded access to a bona fide asylum process.

It remains unclear how many people the government will ultimately be able to deport to Uganda and elsewhere. Yet in courts, asylum seekers are already seeing their cases upturned.

Immigration lawyers say they are being given little notice of the new government motions and have not received copies of the third-country agreements, making it difficult to identify potential exceptions for their clients.

The board’s decision has left some asylum seekers and their lawyers to try to assess risks for several countries at once. “People are now in a position of having to show they fear persecution in five countries at the same time,” said Keren Zwick, a lawyer with the National Immigrant Justice Center, one of the groups that filed suit against the administration over its use of third-country agreements.

In an interview, Mauro, 43, an asylum seeker in Virginia, said he fled Ecuador and applied for U.S. asylum in 2023. He said he had been tortured and threatened with death by political operatives. But a day before his final hearing this November, his lawyers were notified that the U.S. government wants to send him to Honduras instead. Now, he and his lawyer are preparing to argue that he would fear persecution there as well.

“I’ve always believed that the United States is the only country where the values of free speech and democracy prevail, the only country where asylum is truly granted,” said Mauro, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation from his persecutors.

At 26 Federal Plaza, the federal building that has become the epicenter of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in New York City, the new fast-track strategy was evident this past week in the churn of cases going before judges in immigration courts.

Excerpted From: Lindsay Nash, The Immigration Subpoena Power, 125 Columbia Law Review 1 (January, 2025) (504 Footnotes) (Full Document)

After a series of public losses in its war on “sanctuary” cities, the first Trump Administration deployed the immigration subpoena, a new and formidable weapon in this fight. It used these agency-issued subpoenas to retaliate against its political foes--cities and states that refused to participate in federal immigration enforcement--and demand they do what the federal government could not otherwise compel: provide confidential information that would allow ICE to arrest, prosecute, and deport their constituents.

Unlike President Donald Trump's prior efforts, this tactic proved effective. Of course, some cities initially resisted, but once the spotlight faded, that defiance was short-lived. Challenging these subpoenas, the cities seemed to conclude, was futile. And they stood down, quietly turning over the very information they had promised to protect.

Though brief, this battle had enormous implications. For the immigrants caught in the crossfire, it meant exposure to some of the harshest penalties in our legal system: arrest, detention, and exile from their families and homes. For cities and states, it exposed a major chink in the armor of local sovereignty, one that could undermine subfederal policy on policing, privacy, and control of local resources. And, for the effort to disentangle local government from immigration enforcement, it landed a trenchant blow. It showed how these subpoenas could jeopardize one of the most powerful immigrant-protective movements of the twenty-first century: the sanctuary policies that prevent state and local actors from providing confidential information and other resources to facilitate federal immigration enforcement. In other words, the immigration subpoena offensive worked as intended--and ICE suggested that this was only the beginning and that it might start using this tactic “much more broadly.”

But has it? And how else does ICE use these administrative subpoenas--issued without judicial sign-off, active litigation, or even probable cause--to demand that recipients provide confidential records, testify against others, or present themselves for interrogation? The problem--perhaps the biggest takeaway from this episode--is that no one knows. In short, this episode revealed major, unanswered questions about when, how, and with what constraints the massive immigration enforcement agency uses its subpoena power more broadly.

These questions are particularly pronounced because the immigration subpoena regime has long operated in darkness. Although the immigration subpoena power is over a century old, information about when and how the government uses it is virtually nonexistent in the public domain. Unlike the typical subpoena issued by a federal court, these “investigative” subpoenas issued by ICE are not part of public, ongoing legal proceedings, nor are they formally connected to any filed charge or complaint. And, since ICE may issue these subpoenas to obtain information about almost any matter related to the immigration domain without a reason to even suspect that a legal violation has occurred, these subpoenas may never make it into any public record or onto any litigant's radar.

Perhaps for these reasons, immigration subpoenas have largely escaped both the legal battles raging over other ICE tactics and the scrutiny of scholars, reporters, and courts. To be sure, scholars such as Professors Medha D. Makhlouf and Bridget Fahey have published important work identifying some of the concerns that ICE's subpoenas and other information-gathering tools could raise. But no scholar has examined the immigration subpoena regime as a whole or how the agency wields this power on the ground. Indeed, the government itself lacks the fundamental information necessary to study this regime because ICE has no functional system for even tracking--much less analyzing--subpoenas' use in the immigration realm. Thus, despite in-depth examinations of other aspects of immigration enforcement and administrative subpoenas in other contexts, the immigration subpoena regime remains unstudied, largely unchallenged, and, for many, entirely unknown.

The need to understand this regime has never been greater. While local governments have long played an important role in federal immigration enforcement in the nation's interior, the increased resistance to state and municipal collaboration has changed the enforcement landscape. Specifically, because so many local law enforcement agencies now refuse to arrest and detain for immigration purposes, ICE relies even more heavily on information gathered, generated, and retained by local governments. As the federal fury over sanctuary cities' refusal to provide this information shows, the interior immigration enforcement regime depends on this information at every stage, from identifying potential targets to executing arrests to effecting deportations.

While ICE has publicly focused on obtaining this information from police, jailors, and probation departments, its reach into local interactions does not end there. Because immigration arrests and prosecutions can implicate virtually every aspect of people's lives--including spouses' employment, children's schooling, and medical care--so too can ICE's investigative powers. In this way, these investigations can extend beyond the individuals under investigation to anyone--including U.S. citizens--with whom they associate. Thus, knowing how ICE uses its subpoena power to obtain this information is critical to understanding the extent to which local entities remain complicit in immigration enforcement, the practical and legal implications of the immigration subpoena regime, and the efficacy of constraints on this power in the civil immigration realm.

This Article begins to answer these questions, providing the first comprehensive account of the immigration subpoena power. Drawing on previously undisclosed agency records reflecting thousands of subpoenas used in investigations nationwide, it shows how the agency wields a power initially created to facilitate racial exclusion at the border to reach deep into some of the most intimate areas of people's lives, including schools, social services agencies, and other historically protected domains. Indeed, it shows that the agency has long used these subpoenas to obtain children's records from schools, compel sensitive records from local agencies, surveil people's movements, and more.

This Article also reveals the significant federalism implications of ICE's subpoena practice. It demonstrates that, contrary to the agency's own representations, ICE regularly used these subpoenas to compel state and local law enforcement to participate in federal immigration enforcement well before Trump and has continued doing so to the present day. But it also shows that ICE's practice of subpoenaing states and localities that refuse to participate in federal immigration enforcement has recently transformed and become embedded in ICE policy, creating a formal structure for waging an intersovereign subpoena battle that rages on, largely in secret, today.

This Article not only shows where the agency uses this power but also provides troubling new insight into how. It reveals that the agency has sought to broaden its subpoena power to make prospective demands for information and real-time surveillance, attempted to foist investigatory functions upon subfederal government entities, and tried to obscure its subpoena practices by imposing all-encompassing, indefinite--and unlawful--gag orders upon subpoena recipients. Ultimately, this study paints a troubling picture of how ICE uses this power to force subfederal governments and others to contribute to immigration arrests and detention.

In addition to this descriptive contribution, this Article makes two important analytical claims. First, it argues that this examination exposes patterns of unauthorized and unconstitutional conduct that permeate the immigration subpoena regime. It shows how ICE's use of immigration subpoenas implicates a host of constitutional questions--related to federalism, privacy, and free speech--that have gone unanswered and, in some respects, entirely unexplored. And it contends that this study helps raise and even resolve some of these questions by demonstrating the ways that ICE's practices impinge on core constitutional rights and constraints. These findings are important not only to identify these issues but also because they open three paths to agency restraint: They give rise to viable legal challenges in an area where judicial review is notoriously weak; raise troubling policy questions that, in other contexts, have prompted subregulatory self-constraint; and arm the public with information necessary to exert pressure through other means.

Second, this Article argues that understanding how the immigration subpoena power is implemented has doctrinal and normative implications that transcend the immigration field. As the first scholarship to date that examines a large set of primary administrative subpoena records--agency-level subpoenas and data offers new insights that apply to administrative subpoena use and investigations more broadly. Specifically, it argues that this ground-level view of agency practice suggests the need to rethink the presumption of administrative regularity and the application of internal administrative law principles in at least some similar contexts. These insights are especially important in considering enforcement regimes that, like ICE's, impose extraordinarily harsh penalties and bear most heavily on historically marginalized populations who often lack resources and political power. Ultimately, this Article makes the case for greater external constraints and more probing judicial review in the immigration subpoena regime and beyond.

The Article proceeds in four parts. Part I explores why the immigration subpoena power was created and what that power looks like today. It traces the history of the immigration subpoena from its origins as a mechanism for racial exclusion to the broad, uncanalized power of compulsory information-sharing and surveillance it has become. And it shows why, despite the general acceptance of administrative subpoenas in other regimes, the immigration subpoena power raises distinct and urgent questions--ones that demand a closer look at how it functions in practice. Part II illuminates the current immigration subpoena regime. It uses new agency data and records obtained under the Freedom of Information Act to show how ICE uses this authority in the nation's interior. Ultimately, it provides a first-of-its-kind view of how this tool is used in practice and of the unlawful conduct that permeates the immigration subpoena regime. Part III explores the constitutional and doctrinal implications. It argues that the findings in this Article raise a number of serious constitutional questions, help resolve some of those questions, and justify important doctrinal and procedural changes. Part IV argues that these findings offer valuable lessons about administrative subpoena doctrine and practice that transcend the immigration regime.

[. . .]

Pre-2019. In general, field office self-reports were consistent with the available data. As long as the data did not deviate by more than three subpoenas from the field office's self-report, I accepted (and used) the field office's self-report as a statement of its general policy and practice. In one instance, however, the data diverged by more than three subpoenas from the office's self-report; in that case, I relied on the practice reflected by the data.

The records produced did not contain a self-report from all field offices regarding the issuance of subpoenas to state and local law enforcement. When the record did not provide the field office's self-report, I concluded that a field office did “likely not” issue subpoenas pre-2019 if ICE produced records from that field office from that time period and there was no evidence that they issued subpoenas to state or local law enforcement during that time (and in consideration of ICE's statements that ICE had historically not issued subpoenas to state and local law enforcement). In some instances, the field office did not produce any data or self-reports for the pre-2019 period; in those instances, I coded the practice as “unknown.”

2019 to Present. For purposes of this table, I concluded that field offices did issue subpoenas if they issued two or more subpoenas to state or local law enforcement during this period. I concluded that field offices did “likely not” issue this type of subpoenas from 2019 on if (1) I had relatively comprehensive-appearing logs reflecting the field office's subpoena use for that period and there was no evidence that it issued such subpoenas in that period or (2) other information (such as the government's representations in litigation) indicated that the field office did not issue subpoenas in that period. In some instances, the field office did not produce any data or produced only obviously incomplete data for the post-2019 period; in those instances, I coded the practice as “unknown.”",https://racism.org/images/Portraits/lindseynash.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 10:57:39.532990

Bobby Nuñez, 33, was charged with theft of government property and faced up to ten years in prison before a jury found him not guilty on Friday.

In a statement, the U.S. Attorney's office said, ""The trial lasted four days. The jury deliberated for more than three hours. We have no further comment.""

ORIGINAL REPORT: Federal agents arrest man accused of illegally towing government vehicle during immigration raid

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) released a video in September showing a rogue tow truck driver snatching an immigration agent's government SUV in the middle of a raid in downtown L.A. in August.

The raid targeted a popular influencer, Tatiana Martinez, who was reportedly livestreaming the immigration enforcement activity to thousands on TikTok. The same video shows her being pulled from her car and arrested.

Federal immigration agents were sent scrambling when the tow truck operator took off with one of their vehicles as they were making the arrest.

Acting U.S. Attorney for Los Angeles Bilal ""Bill"" Essayli posted the video of the arrest to X, writing, ""Apparently he thought it would be funny to interfere with our immigration enforcement operations. Now he can laugh behind bars while he faces justice.""

According to a news release from Essayli's office, law enforcement officers used two vehicles to block Martinez's vehicle and prevent her from escaping. The government vehicles reportedly had their emergency lights on.

During Martinez's arrest, Nuñez reportedly pressed the passenger side door of her vehicle on an officer, who then threatened Martinez with arrest. After he was told what was happening, Essayli's office said the man told them, ""Something was going to happen.""

Among the tens of thousands arrested in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown are many convicted of violent crimes, but nearly three-quarters of those held by ICE have no criminal record. That's according to TRAC Reports, a nonpartisan data gathering platform.

Amna Nawaz spoke recently with the family of a young — one young woman who has been detained by federal immigration officers in North Carolina.

Amna Nawaz:

Last month, 23-year-old Fatima Issela Velasquez-Antonio was arrested by Border Patrol at her worksite in Raleigh, North Carolina. This is the video showing that moment shot by a family friend.

Despite having a legal work permit and no criminal record, she remains in ICE custody in Lumpkin, Georgia, today. After both of her parents died, Fatima left Honduras at the age of 14, entering the U.S. as an unaccompanied minor and seeking asylum. Her family is choosing not to do interviews due to fears over their own immigration status.

But they have asked Gene Smith, her aunt's boyfriend, to speak on their behalf. He joins us now.

Gene, welcome to the ""NewsHour."" Thanks for joining us.

Gene Smith, Family Friend of Fatima Issela Velasquez-Antonio: It's my pleasure. Thanks for having me.

Amna Nawaz:

So it's been over a month now that Fatima has been held. When is the last time you or anyone in the family was able to talk with her? And what can you tell us about how she's doing?

Gene Smith:

I was able to speak to her over the weekend. And she was in good spirits. I know she's been in contact today with her boyfriend and other family members. And she's just — she's worried. She's locked up. She's confined and she wants to come home. She doesn't really know her legal future and what's going to happen tomorrow.

So she's really concerned. And, for the most part, she's worried about her family. She wants them to be happy and to know that she's — she knows that they're on her side and they're praying for her. And she's just supporting them, which is ironic since she's the one that needs our support.

Amna Nawaz:

Let me ask you about the day that she was arrested back in November, because we have seen federal agents showing up at a number of worksites across the country in different places.

On the day that she went to work, was there any reason to think that the same thing would happen to Fatima?

Gene Smith:

No. Not on my side, no.

But, that morning, her aunt, which is my girlfriend, she owns a business. And she said, ""Gene,"" she said, ""some of my employees can't make it or can't work today.""

I said: ""Why not?""

They — she said they're — they have a fear of getting arrested by ICE. And nonchalantly just blew it off, said, if — ""You can't let anyone dictate how you run your business.""

And then, a few hours later, five, six hours, she gets a call that says Fatima's locked up. Now it just hits me broad right in the face. So I feel really, really ashamed and apologetic. And what she said to her family that day, she said, crying, she was locked up — not that day, but when they finally was able to talk to her, she told them, she said: ""I'm glad it was me, not you.""

Amna Nawaz:

Knowing her as you do, why do you think she said that?

Gene Smith:

Because she's a good kid and she loves her family. And if anyone could wear the brunt of this administration's messed-up policies, I think she would be willing to take that bullet for her family.

Amna Nawaz:

Tell us a little bit more about her, so we know who we're talking about here. As I mentioned, she came here when she was just 14. She'd lost both of her parents.

Gene Smith:

Yes.

Amna Nawaz:

Why did she come to the U.S.? And tell us about the life that she's built in the years she's been here.

Gene Smith:

Well, as you know, she lost her mom when she was around 12. I think her mom died of cancer. Her dad was murdered by gang members around the age of 14.

She sought asylum here in the United States to the only country that she felt secure in, and to her family, which resides in North Carolina. And since she's been here — she came as an unaccompanied minor, as you said. She's created a life for herself. She did exactly what the government asked her to do. She graduated from high school.

She got a valid work permit, Social Security card. She pays taxes. She had gainful employment. And she just bought a home with her boyfriend a few months ago. That is a heck of a feat at age 23. And so she's just a good kid. She loves her family, her nieces and nephews, her cousins. And she just enjoys life.

She's a blessing to be around. And I think, if anyone deserves a pass, it's this young lady.

Amna Nawaz:

And I just want to be clear on this point, Gene. Our understanding is that she doesn't have any criminal record. She does have a couple of traffic violations, which would be civil infractions, in the years. Is that correct?

And, if so, what is your understanding of why she was arrested and why she's still being held?

Gene Smith:

That is correct. She has no criminal history whatsoever, other than minor traffic violations. ICE came to North Carolina under a sweep, starting Charlotte, and the next day they were in Wake County.

She got arrested in Cary. They interviewed her that day. I think the video shows that she has a valid work permit. That day, she grabbed the wrong one, but she does have a valid one. And they ruled that, because her paperwork was not correct right then, they're going to detain her.

Since then, we have tried to get her released on bond. Unfortunately, the Trump administration has ruled that detainees can't get a bond right now.

Amna Nawaz:

Gene, I have to ask you, because I know from your previous conversations with my colleague that you have supported, and I think — I understand you still support President Donald Trump, that you did vote for him.

This is someone who campaigned on mass deportations, who said anyone who is here illegally will be removed and deported. And though she is seeking asylum, Fatima did enter the country illegally. So I guess the question is, did you not expect that someone like her would be targeted by this administration?

Gene Smith:

I can't fathom that his policies were targeted at someone such as her.

And, unfortunately for me and probably for a lot of Americans, we really don't realize the extent of what the immigration and how that system is broken. And I didn't. I certainly didn't. Now that it's hitting close to home, I see how broken that system is.

I did vote for Trump. And I still support Trump. I understand you need — we have a safe border, sure.

And I will reach out to Trump right now. President Trump, if you listen to this and then you see this, please release her. She is a good kid. I still support you. And I support your policies. I think our immigration system is flawed and it's broken. And we need to fix that, because the only one that's penalizing is young ladies such as her that deserve to be home with their family.

Amna Nawaz:

Gene, I just have to ask, in saying you support his policies, the administration will say, this is their policy. It is to arrest and deport anyone who is here without legal status.

What would you say to that?

Gene Smith:

I believe our law says that she's not to be detained while her — she is waiting adjudication of her case. She came as a minor. She hasn't committed a crime. She did everything the U.S. government asked of her.

And I don't think that Trump meant for that to take place, for her to be deported. I do support his policies. I just don't support this one.

Amna Nawaz:

Let me just put to you what the Department of Homeland Security shared with us when we asked them about her case.

They said in part that she admitted to officers that she was in the country illegally. They say: ""All of her claims will be heard by a judge. She will receive full due process."" They also blame the Biden administration for using discretion to, they say, indefinitely delay many illegal aliens,"" including her case.

They also say, Gene, that she has a choice to either leave voluntarily or be arrested and deported. Are you worried that she may end up deported back to Honduras?

Gene Smith:

I have faith in God, and I believe that God is in control. She's not a flight risk. She's not a danger to society. So I am hopeful that she will be granted her day in court and be released on bond, and so that she can remain with her family in the community during the adjudication process, so that she can become a United States citizen.

So I don't think she will be deported. I hope and pray she does not. If she did get deported, that would be a travesty, in my opinion.

Amna Nawaz:

That is Gene Smith speaking on behalf of the family of Fatima Issela Velasquez-Antonio.

Gene, thank you for your time.

Gene Smith:

Thank you for yours. I appreciate you. Thank you for having me.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/12/detained-1-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 10:57:43.291161

DOJ releases long-awaited tranche of Epstein files

And just like that, the justice department has just begun publishing the long-awaited cache of Jeffrey Epstein files. We’ve launched a dedicated blog, see you over there.

Updated at 16.05 EST

I hope that recap was useful! Back to the present day, Democratic senator Alex Padilla has said on X:

Reminder that if Trump fails to release the Epstein files today, he’d be breaking the law. Again.

Share

The week prior, on 2 September, the committee released 33,000 pages of records, a lot of which was already public, including years-old court filings related to Epstein and Maxwell, as well as what appeared to be bodycam footage from police searches and police interviews.

It also included flight logs from Customs and Border Protection showing travel to and from his private island, and a video of Epstein’s cell block from before his death that included the so-called “missing minute” from earlier videos, contradicting the assertion of attorney general Pam Bondi that it was recorded over.

Share

And on 8 September, the House oversight committee released another tranche of material from Epstein’s estate, including the now-infamous birthday book.

The 238-page scrapbook was given to Epstein as a present on his 50th birthday and featured contributions attributed to high-profile figures including Trump, Bill Clinton and the then UK ambassador to Washington, Peter Mandelson (Mandelson was sacked a few days later).

The most explosive section was an apparent birthday note from Trump, contained within a sketch of a naked woman’s torso. The drawing has “Donald” signed below its pelvis, along with an imagined conversation between Trump and Epstein.

A cryptic message quotes Trump as saying: “We have certain things in common, Jeffrey,” wishing that “every day be another wonderful secret” and adding: “Enigmas never age, have you noticed that?”

Trump has denied drawing the figure or writing the note.

Another image showed Epstein standing among palm trees and holding an oversized cheque for $22,500 with a “Trump” signature on it. Partly redacted writing below the image says Epstein showed “early talents with money + women” and had sold a “fully depreciated [redacted] to Donald Trump”.

Share

Going back further, on 12 November the committee released damning emails that suggested Donald Trump knew about Epstein’s conduct, including one in which Epstein said “of course [Trump] knew about the girls” procured for his sex-trafficking ring, and another that said Trump “spent hours” with one victim at Epstein’s house.

In one of the memos, Epstein alleged to his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell in April 2011 that Trump had had a lengthy engagement in the company of one of the disgraced financier’s sex-trafficked victims.

“I want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump.. [victim’s name redacted] spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned,” the message reads.

In her reply, Maxwell said: “I have been thinking about that.”

A second message, sent by Epstein to Trump biographer Michael Wolff in January 2019, indicates that Trump had asked him to resign from Mar-a-Lago, the president’s exclusive members-only club in Florida.

But, Epstein says, he was “never a member ever” and adds “of course he knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop”.

Later that day, the committee’s Republican majority countered by releasing its own tranche of 23,000 documents, accusing Democrats of “cherrypicking” the memos “to generate clickbait”.

Updated at 15.38 EST

On 3 December, Democrats on the committee also released 73 photos and four videos of Epstein’s private island home, where he is alleged to have trafficked young girls.

The images and videos showed Epstein’s home, including bedrooms, a telephone, what appeared to be an office or library, and a chalkboard on which the words “fin”, “intellectual”, “deception” and “power” are written. Several photos show a room with a dentist chair and masks hanging on the wall. The New York Times reported that Epstein’s last girlfriend was a dentist who shared an office with one of his shell companies. The videos appear to be a walk-through of the property.

The materials were from law enforcement authorities in the US Virgin Islands. They were taken in 2020, the year after Epstein died by suicide in jail.

Share

As well as the new batch of 68 photos released yesterday from a trove of about 95,000 the committee obtained from Epstein’s estate (see my recap here), Democrats on the House oversight committee have published tens of thousands of documents over the past year.

In a previous drop from 12 December, the committee released a tranche of what they called “disturbing” photographs – some of which had been seen before – featuring prominent figures including Donald Trump, former British prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, former president Bill Clinton, former treasury secretary Larry Summers, film director Woody Allen, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Trump’s former political adviser Steve Bannon, and Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin empire.

A reminder that there is no suggestion of wrongdoing and the photos do not implicate any of the individuals pictured in Epstein’s crimes.

Other photos showed construction work on the exterior of Epstein’s island home, and included more photographs of the yellow dentist’s office that was featured in a similar release of images and videos by the committee on 3 December, as well as a bathroom, a “Trumpkin” (a pumpkin decorated as Donald Trump), and Epstein in a bathtub.

Trump features in three of the 19 images initially released in that drop. In one, he is photographed with six women, some in Hawaii dress, and whose faces are blacked out. In the second, he is seen alongside Epstein listening to a woman with blond hair who appears to be sharing a joke. In the third, apparently taken onboard an aircraft, he is sitting alongside another woman with longer blond hair, and whose face is also blacked out.

The president’s face in cartoon form, and the words “I’m huuuuge”, appear in another image on square packets with a sign advertising a “Trump condom” for $4.50. The novelty items were on sale before Trump’s first election win in 2016, and earned a place in the Smithsonian Institution’s political satire collection.

A collection of sex toys, including restraints, a catalog and a guide to the Japanese art of shibari (a form of bondage), appear in three more images. Epstein was accused of hosting sex parties for clients at his homes in New York, Florida and at his private Caribbean island retreat, Little Saint James in the US Virgin Islands.

Marjorie Taylor Greene has joined the chorus of US legislators reminding the justice department of its legal obligations after it said this morning it won’t meet its deadline to release all the Epstein files today.

The Republican representative wrote on X:

My goodness, what is in the Epstein files? Release all the files. It’s literally the law.

As I reported earlier, her colleague Thomas Massie, who co-led the discharge petition to force a vote on releasing the files, also stressed that he wanted all the documents released today.

He shared a picture of the text of the law in a post on X this morning, highlighting the part that says “all” of the files must be released within 30 days.

Wisconsin Republicans have threatened to impeach Judge Hannah Dugan unless she resigns following her conviction on charges of obstructing federal officers who were trying to arrest an undocumented immigrant outside her courtroom

Dugan faces up to five years in prison after a jury on Thursday found her guilty of felony charges. Federal prosecutors alleged that she distracted agents trying to arrest the man and led him out through a private door.

Conviction in the high-profile case represents a boost for Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant deportation agenda.

While the Wisconsin constitution bars convicted felons of holding public office, state law also lays down that a convicted office holder’s seat does not become vacant until they have been sentenced. No sentencing date has been set for Dugan.

However, Wisconsin’s Republican state assembly speaker, Robin Vos, and majority leader, Tyler August, called on her to resign immediately or face impeachment.

“

“Wisconsinites deserve to know their judiciary is impartial and that justice is blind,” they said in a joint statement. “Judge Hannah Dugan is neither, and her privilege of serving the people of Wisconsin has come to an end.”

Trump announces deals with another nine drugmakers to lower prices

A short while ago, Donald Trump announced deals with nine major pharmaceutical companies that will lower the prices of some medicines.

It brings the total number of drugmakers the administration has reached deals with to 14, with Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol Myers Squibb, Roche’s Genentech unit, Gilead, GSK, Merck, Novartis and Sanofi all participating in today’s announcement.

“This is the biggest thing ever to happen on drug pricing and on healthcare. This will have a tremendous impact on health care itself,” Trump said in the Roosevelt Room at the White House, flanked by the pharmaceutical companies’ chief executives.

“They’re going to pay our country the lowest price paid anywhere in the world, and they will list their most popular drugs on TrumpRX.gov,” he added.

Trump previously announced agreements with Pfizer, AstraZeneca, EMD Serono, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk after he sent letters out in July to all 17 companies, urging them to offer so-called most-favored-nation prices to Medicaid and ensure new medicines launch at prices no higher than those in other wealthy countries. In return, the companies that reached deals secured three-year exemptions from any tariffs Trump might slap on imported pharmaceuticals in the future.

AbbVie, Johnson & Johnson and Regeneron are the last major drugmakers that have yet to announce deals with the administration. Trump said he would be meeting with them in the coming weeks in an effort to get them to sign on to lowering their costs.

A judge in Texas has ordered the unsealing of documents in the divorce case of the state’s attorney general, Ken Paxton, in a move with potential implications for a forthcoming Senate race.

Paxton’s wife of 38 years, is suing him for divorce on “biblical grounds” and “recent discoveries”, having previously stood by him in a 2023 impeachment trial, which exposed an extramarital affair, and a succession of other legal troubles.

The judge’s order followed an agreement between lawyers for Paxton and a coalition of news outlets to make the records public.

Their disclosure could provide fodder for opposition attacks on Paxton in the campaign leading up to the Republican primary scheduled for 3 March, in which the attorney general is seeking to unseat the sitting GOP senator, John Cornyn.

Groups supporting Cornyn, who has been criticized for a willingness to work with Democrats, have already spent $21m on television campaign adverts aimed at warding off the threat from Paxton, who is seen as a loyal acolyte of Donald Trump.

Secretary of state Marco Rubio spoke about Russia-Ukraine peace efforts and defended the Trump administration’s increasing military pressure on Venezuela during an end-of-year news conference today.

“There’s no peace deal unless Ukraine agrees to it. But there’s also no peace deal unless Russia agrees to it,” Rubio said. ″So our job is not to force anything on anyone. It is to try to figure out if we can nudge both sides to a common place.”

The US proposal has been through numerous versions with Trump going back and forth between offering support and encouragement for Ukraine and then seemingly sympathizing with Putin’s hardline stances by pushing Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to agree to territorial concessions. Kyiv has rejected that concession in return for security guarantees intended to protect Ukraine from future Russian incursions.

Rubio has also been a leading proponent of military operations against suspected drug-running vessels from Venezuela that have been targeted by the Pentagon in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean since early September.

In an interview with NBC News on Friday, Trump would not rule out a war with Venezuela. Rubio sidestepped a direct question about whether the US wants “regime change in 2026” in the South American country.

“We have a regime that’s illegitimate, that cooperates with Iran, that cooperates with Hezbollah, that cooperates with narco-trafficking and narco-terrorist organizations,” Rubio said, “including not just protecting their shipments and allowing them to operate with impunity, but also allows some of them to control territory.”

Senator Adam Schiff of California has joined a wave of lawmakers today who are demanding that the Trump administration honor the law by releasing the full Epstein files after deputy attorney general Todd Blanche said the justice department won’t meet its Friday deadline for full disclosure.

“The Epstein Files Transparency Act is clear: while protecting survivors, ALL of these records are required to be released today. Not just some,” Schiff wrote on X. “The Trump administration can’t move the goalposts. They’re cemented in law.”

Two rightwing influencers have clashed at the annual youth conference of Turning Point USA, the conservative pressure group founded by the late Charlie Kirk.

The fissures within the movement were laid bare on the stage in Phoenix when Ben Shapiro, a prominent podcaster, attacked the former Fox News host, Tucker Carlson, and other figures on the right as grifters and charlatans who mislead their followers with conspiracy theories and false narratives, AP reported.

Shapiro also accused Carlson of “an act of moral imbecility” over his recent podcast interview with the far-right provocateur Nick Fuentes, who has peddled antisemitic views and voiced admiration for Hitler.

Carlson responded with mockery less than an hour later, saying he “laughed” at what he called Shapiro’s attempt to “deplatform” him.

“To hear calls for deplatforming and denouncing people at a Charlie Kirk event, I’m like, what?” Carlson said. “This is hilarious.”

Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, only the best of the best will be allowed to serve.","WASHINGTON – Today, the United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) year-end accomplishments, celebrating one of the most consequential periods of action and reform in American history.

Under the leadership of President Donald J. Trump and Secretary Noem, DHS is restoring the rule of law, delivering the most secure border ever, removing dangerous criminal illegal aliens, creating safer communities, strengthening cyber defense, fixing disaster response, launching initiatives that are reshaping American travel and national security, and making America safe for generations to come.

“In less than a year, President Trump has delivered some of the most historic and consequential achievements in presidential history—and this Administration is just getting started,” Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement. “Under President Trump’s leadership, we are making America safe again and putting the American people first. In record-time we have secured the border, taken the fight to cartels, and arrested thousands upon thousands of criminal illegal aliens. Though 2025 was historic, we won’t rest until the job is done.”

In President Trump’s first year back in office, more than 2.5 million illegal aliens have left the U.S. because of the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration, including an estimated 1.9 million self-deportations and more than 622,000 deportations.

Since President Trump took office, fentanyl trafficking at the southern border has been cut down by half compared to the same period in 2024. The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) alone has seized enough cocaine to kill more than 177 million Americans.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has saved taxpayers more than $13.2 billion at DHS and returned key agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Cyber and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Secret Service back to their core missions.

Countless lives have been saved, communities have been strengthened, and the American people have been put first again. These are only a few examples of DHS’s accomplishments under Secretary Noem that have positioned the U.S. to enter a new era of national strength and a better future for all U.S. citizens.

Below are more examples of DHS’s accomplishments since President Trump took office on January 20th, 2025:

Most Secure Border in American History

In a matter of weeks, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) delivered the most secure border in American history. It has stayed secure ever since. Now, the wins keep piling up:

Under President Trump and Secretary Noem:

Border crossings are down 93% year-over-year.

Illegal alien apprehensions at the southwest border are down to an average of 245 per day.

From May to November, seven consecutive months, the United States Border Patrol (USBP) released ZERO illegal aliens into the country.

Under the Trump administration, there have been 73,329 total apprehensions along the southwest border, which is 53% less than the monthly average of 155,485 during the Biden administration.

USBP nationwide apprehensions have averaged under 10,000 per month since President Trump took office – a level of sustained deterrence unmatched in modern border history.

Fiscal Year 2026 has seen the lowest start to a fiscal year ever - 60,940 total encounters nationwide in October and November – lower than any prior fiscal year to date.

CBP has seized 539,984 pounds of drugs—a nearly 10% increase compared to the same time frame in 2024.

CBP awarded more than $5 billion in new border wall contracts, funded by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, in record time. It also awarded a $37 billion acquisition vehicle to support this work to seal the border wall.

CBP led the deployment of more than 130,000 feet of temporary barriers, to include concertina wire, along with the Department of War and the State of Texas, to secure critical gaps.

CBP published 24 critical waivers, allowing the agency to cut through the bureaucratic red tape to expedite border wall construction.

Since January 20, 2025, the Trump Administration has significantly increased CBP hiring, with monthly averages showing a 42.5% increase in CBP officer new hires, and an 84% increase in Border Patrol agent new hires, compared to the same time period last year.

CBP implemented 41 Presidential Actions on trade, addressing illicit drugs, public safety threats, and critical imports.

CBP assessed over $190.7 billion in tariff revenue and $266.7 billion in total customs revenue.

CBP conducted 387 audits from January 20–November 7, 2025, identifying $1.43 billion in trade revenue and collecting $225 million.

CBP ended de minimis duty-free treatment on August 29, closing loopholes exploited for narcotics and contraband.

In August 2025, CBP created the National Targeting Center’s Trade Fraud Targeting Cell to combat trade fraud schemes in support of current presidential actions.

Arresting and Removing the Worst of the Worst Criminal Illegal Aliens

Under Secretary Noem’s leadership, DHS has arrested and deported hundreds of thousands of criminal illegal aliens across the country, including gang members, rapists, kidnappers, and drug traffickers, thanks to the brave men and women of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), CBP, and other law enforcement immigration enforcement agencies. Seventy percent of those arrested by ICE are criminal illegal aliens who have been charged or convicted of a crime in the U.S.

DHS has removed more than 622,000 illegal aliens and 1.9 million illegal aliens have self-deported.

And, nationwide, ICE, CBP, and other immigration law enforcement are targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens for arrest and deportation through targeted enforcement operations in cities throughout the country:

Operation Midway Blitz was launched in Chicago and the Midwest in honor of Katie Abraham, who was killed in a drunk driving hit-and-run car wreck caused by a criminal illegal alien.

Operation Midway Blitz has resulted in the arrest of more than 4,500 illegal aliens.

In the Minneapolis area, DHS has arrested more than 670 as part of “Operation Metro Surge.”

In Florida, Operation Criminal Return, AKA “Operation Dirtbag,” has led to the arrests of more than 220 illegal aliens, including more than 150 sex offenders.

In Massachusetts, Operations Patriot 1.0 and Patriot 2.0 have resulted in over 2,860 arrests.

In New Orleans, Operation Catahoula Crunch has resulted in the arrest of approximately 370 illegal aliens since early December.

In Los Angeles, more than 10,000 illegal aliens have been arrested.

In Portland, Oregon, Operation Black Rose has resulted in the arrests of more than 1,240 illegal aliens to date.

DHS has also empowered state and local law enforcement to get criminal illegal aliens off our streets.

DHS secured more than 1,255 signed agreements with state and local partnerships under Immigration and Nationality Act Section 287(g).

Operation Tidal Wave, the first-of-its-kind 287(g) enforcement operation coordinated with state and federal law enforcement partners, resulted in 1,100 arrests in six days.

Thanks to the 287(g) program, DHS partnered with the State of Florida on Alligator Alcatraz, the State of Indiana on the Speedway Slammer, the state of Nebraska on Cornhusker Clink, and the State of Louisiana on Louisiana Lockup to expand detention space by the thousands.

DHS also launched the critically acclaimed, groundbreaking new web page, “Worst of the Worst” (wow.dhs.gov), which allows visitors to search through some of the hundreds of thousands of criminal illegal aliens arrested during enforcement operations since the start of the Trump administration.

DHS Smashes Recruitment Records

Launched Defend the Homeland; a historic nationwide campaign aimed at recruiting Americans to join ICE and help President Trump and Secretary Noem remove criminal illegal aliens.

Since the campaign took off, ICE has received more than 220,000 applications.

ICE is on target to hire 10,000 new officers by the end of 2025. Some of these new officers are already on the job.

Since January 20, 2025, the Trump Administration has significantly increased the velocity and volume of CBP hiring, with monthly averages showing a 42.5% increase in CBP officer (CBPO) new hires, and an 84% increase in Border Patrol Agent (BPA) new hires, compared to the same time period last year.

USCIS has begun recruiting new “Homeland Defenders,” who will better support the agency’s mission and bolster efforts to combat fraud and other threats.

Since launching the hiring campaign on September 30, USCIS has received more than 50,000 applications — the highest in agency history. The first Homeland Defenders began reporting for duty in early December 2025.

Since January 20, United States Secret Service received over 91,000 applications to join its ranks.

That is a 46% increase over the same period in 2024.

In Fiscal Year 2025, the Coast Guard surpassed its recruiting goals with 121% of its target for the fiscal year, totaling 5,204 new members – the highest since 1991.

DHS Locates Biden’s Missing Children

Under President Trump, DHS and Department of Health and Human Services have located more than 129,143 unaccompanied children that the Biden Administration lost.

Secretary Noem Reopens Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement Office

President Trump and Secretary Noem reopened the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE) office so that Americans harmed by illegal alien crime have a voice in the government and a place to turn to for help. Shockingly, the Biden administration closed this office.

Fixing Our Immigration System so that the American People Come First

United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is restoring integrity to our nation’s immigration policies and has instituted dynamic changes to ensure that only individuals who love America, align with our culture, and share our values, are welcomed into the country.

USCIS made history with its fraud investigation, Operation Twin Shield, the agency’s largest enforcement operation to date.

Launched in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, USCIS focused on more than 1,000 cases that had fraud or ineligibility indicators, attempted over 2,000 site visits to homes and workplaces, and completed nearly 1,500 in-person interviews with aliens during the operation.

USCIS found evidence of fraud, non-compliance with immigration law, or public safety or national security concerns in more than 500 of cases.

Operation Twin Shield has so far led to the denial of immigration benefits, the issuance of numerous Notices to Appear, and nearly a dozen arrests by ICE.

Within hours of the November 26 attack where an Afghan national murdered one National Guard member and severely wounded another, USCIS slammed the doors shut on asylum processing for aliens from every country, implemented a full-scale reexamination of every Green Card for aliens from every presidentially designated high-risk country, and placed a hold on the processing of immigration applications and petitions for all Afghan nationals and aliens from 19 high-risk countries of concern.

USCIS has also revamped U.S. immigration policy that had been weakened and lobotomized by previous administrations to realign it with American values, issuing policy guidance emphasizing that there is no room in America for aliens who espouse anti-American ideologies or support terrorist organizations.

Since January 20, USCIS has referred more than 14,400 aliens to ICE for public safety, national security, and fraud concerns, including 182 aliens who were confirmed or suspected to be national security risks.

Since January 20, the agency has been actively collaborating with other agencies on immigration enforcement and public safety efforts, resulting in more than 2,400 arrests at USCIS field offices.

Under an updated policy confirming USCIS’ role as an immigration enforcement agency, the agency’s officers are once again empowered to enforce immigration law by issuing Notices to Appear (NTAs).

Since January 20, USCIS officers have issued approximately 196,600 NTAs to place aliens in removal proceedings.

Since January 20, USCIS officers have made over 29,000 fraud referrals to the USCIS Fraud Detection and National Security (FDNS) Directorate.

FDNS has completed investigations on more than 19,300 fraud cases and identified fraud in 65% of them.

The agency has also strengthened policy guidance to ensure there is no legal defense for a false claim of U.S. citizenship.

In a pivotal move to protect American workers, USCIS changed regulation to ensure that aliens will no longer receive an automatic extension of their employment authorization when seeking renewal in certain employment authorization categories.

The agency also reduced the maximum validity period for certain employment authorization documents from 5 years to 18 months to ensure more frequent vetting and screening of aliens.

USCIS is advancing the administration’s goal of ending the abuse and exploitation in certain immigration programs.

This includes stopping broad abuse of humanitarian parole authority and terminating the family reunification and the Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan (CHNV) parole programs.

DHS is returning parole to a case-by-case basis as intended by Congress after the Biden Administration abused Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to flood our country with hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals.

Secretary Noem ended TPS for Afghanistan, Burma, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, South Sudan, Syria, and Venezuela, and issued orders for these foreign nationals to self-deport.

On September 17, USCIS announced a revised version of the citizenship test that expanded the question bank from 100 to 128 questions, increased the number of questions on each test from 10 to 20, raised the passing score from 6 to 12 correct responses, and revised the questions to ensure the test provides a more meaningful assessment of the alien’s knowledge and understanding of U.S. history and government.

USCIS launched enhancements to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) service that allow states to verify citizenship using the last four digits of Social Security numbers and run queries in bulk at no charge. This enhancement has provided federal officers and employees with a critical tool to verify legal status at a moment’s notice.

DHS proposed a rule on November 19 to rescind the 2022 Public Charge final rule and restore USCIS’ discretion when making a determination on whether an alien seeking legal status in the United States would become reliant on government assistance. Our nation will no longer import foreign nationals who will become a drain on the American taxpayer.

Ushering in the Golden Age of Travel

The Transportation Security Administration is ushering in the Golden Age of Travel.

Under President Trump and Secretary Noem:

TSA ended the Obama-era “Quiet Skies” program, which was used to spy on Americans, including Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, as well as members of Congress.

TSA launched the “Shoes On” Campaign, allowing travelers to keep their shoes on while passing through security screening at TSA checkpoints.

TSA successfully implemented REAL ID on May 7th and achieved 94% compliance, which continues to steadily increase.

TSA launched two targeted campaigns including the “Serve with Honor, Travel with Ease” campaign and the “Families on the Fly” campaign, and the first-ever TSA PreCheck Buy One, Get One Discounted offer.

TSA initiated historic hospitality training for the TSA workforce to improve customer experience.

TSA kept wait times at an average of 3 minutes for PreCheck and 5-6 minutes in standard, far below operational limits during the 43-day long shutdown.

Secretary Noem awarded $10,000 bonuses to TSA officers and personnel who displayed exemplary service, overcame hardships, and displayed the utmost patriotism during the Democrat shutdown.

Securing the High Seas, Defending Our Maritime Borders, And Saving American Lives

The U.S. Coast Guard is smashing records and being revitalized into one of the world’s most elite fighting forces that can meet the challenges of the 21st century.

Since January 2025, Coast Guard seizures of illegal narcotics are up 200%.

Since January 20th, the U.S. Coast Guard seized nearly 470,000 pounds of cocaine — enough to kill up to 177 million Americans at a 1.2g lethal dose.

Interdictions, deterrence events, and transportation of illegal aliens are up 120%.

In July, during catastrophic flooding in the Texas Hill Country, the Coast Guard’s immediate response helped save countless American lives.

Rescue Swimmer Scott Ruskan and his aircrew coordinated the rescue of 169 people.

In August, the Coast Guard launched Operation Pacific Viper, surging forces to the Eastern Pacific to stop the cartels and criminal organizations—interdicting drugs and illegal aliens before they reach American shores.

Coast Guard crews seized over 100,000 pounds of illegal narcotics, averaging approximately 1,600 pounds of cocaine interdicted daily.

Operation Pacific Viper yielded the Coast Guard’s largest-ever drug offload in its history.

The U.S. Coast Guard Cutter (USCGC) Hamilton offloaded over 76,000 pounds of illegal drugs, valued at $473 million, at Port Everglades, which included approximately 61,740 pounds of cocaine and approximately 14,400 pounds of marijuana.

During Operation Pacific Viper, USCGC Stone offloaded approximately 49,010 pounds of illicit narcotics worth more than $362 million at Port Everglades, Florida.

This offload marks the largest amount of cocaine seized by a single cutter in one patrol in Coast Guard history.

On December 2nd, USCGC Munro seized over 20,000 pounds of cocaine in a single interdiction.

This was the Coast Guard’s largest at-sea interdiction since March 2007.

During Operation Pacific Viper, the Coast Guard’s Helicopter Interdiction Tactical Squadron (HITRON) conducted its 1,000th counter-narcotics interdiction, successfully using airborne use of force to disable a narco-smuggling vessel in the Eastern Pacific Ocean.

In October, the Coast Guard launched Operation River Wall to control, secure, and defend approximately 260 miles of the Rio Grande River by deploying response boats and shallow watercraft, command and control assets, and tactical teams to the region.

In August, the Coast Guard commissioned USCGC Storis, the Coast Guard’s first polar icebreaker commissioned in over 25 years.

Restoring Excellence at Secret Service

The U.S. Secret Service (USSS) is getting back on track. Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, only the best of the best will be allowed to serve.

Since January 20th:

Secret Service has supported approximately 6,524 protective visits both domestically and overseas for 38 full-time protectees.

Secret Service successfully developed and executed the security plan for four National Special Security Events:

The 2025 Inauguration of President Trump, President Trump’s Address to a Joint Session of Congress, the 2025 UN General Assembly (UNGA, 80th Session), and the Army’s 250th Birthday Celebration.

Secret Service provided Presidential protection during multiple major events, including:

Super Bowl LIX (New Orleans, LA), Daytona 500 (Daytona Beach, FL), Charlie Kirk’s Funeral (Glendale, AZ), Ryder Cup (Farmingdale, NY), Washington Commanders Game (Salute to Service) (Landover, MD), and the 126th Army-Navy Game (Baltimore, MD).

The National Threat Assessment Center (NTAC) continues to advance their mission of violence prevention. In 2025, the NTAC delivered more than 364 trainings and briefings to more than 56,713 participants – both the highest calendar year totals in NTAC history. NTAC training recipients included law enforcement agencies, schools, mental health providers, faith-based organizations, government agencies, and private sector entities.

Secret Service completed 21 anti-card skimming and electronic benefits transfer fraud outreach operations in various locations around the United States. These outreach operations prevented an estimated $407 million in fraud loss.

Secret Service launched the agency’s new Advanced Threat Interdiction Unit (ATIU). The ATIU provided advanced threat detection and mitigation capabilities for evolving threats and the USSS protective mission nexus.

Ending the Censorship of Americans and Defending our Critical Infrastructure

Under Biden, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) was used to censor and target Americans. It was shameful, wrong, and unconstitutional. Now, thanks to President Trump and Secretary Noem:

CISA is back on-mission and focused on doing its job: Protecting critical infrastructure from cyber and physical threats.

CISA personnel are deployed across 10 regions in support of all 56 states/territories and are actively working with local, federal, and international partners to identify emerging threats and issue alerts, advisories or provide guidance to mitigate these threats.

CISA has issued three emergency directives to mitigate vulnerabilities and ensure strong cyber defenses across the federal government ecosystem.

CISA has co-sealed 37 joint cybersecurity advisories that continually demonstrate operational collaboration in action.

CISA continues to equip cyber defenders with essential tools to secure their systems including the Eviction Strategies Tool, a no-cost resource for incident response, and Thorium, an automated, scalable platform for malware and forensic analysis.

On August 1, CISA and FEMA announced the availability of over $100 million in cybersecurity grant funding to strengthen state, local, and tribal government community cybersecurity.

In September, CISA released CISA Strategic Focus: CVE Quality for a Cyber Secure Future, a roadmap outlining key priorities to enhance the CVE quality and better serve the global cybersecurity community.

CISA launched the new Industry Engagement Platform (IEP) designed to facilitate two-way communication between the agency and companies developing innovative and security technologies.

CISA has issued more than 1,000 pre-ransomware notifications and cataloged 220 known exploited vulnerabilities.

CISA added 38 Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEVs) to the national catalog, enabling faster remediation across public and private sectors.

Executed Emergency Directives to address zero-day vulnerabilities in F5 devices and Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA) which were exploited by nation-state Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). This resulted in thousands of federal devices or public-facing devices being patched and secured.

Published the Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Detection Technology Guide to support critical infrastructure operators address increasing drone threats in support of Executive Order 14305 on airspace sovereignty.

Supported 19 pre–World Cup 2026 exercises to ensure operational readiness.

Improved data ingestion tools, saving $6.5 million annually while enhancing speed and scalability.

Deployed automated communication for the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC), expanding real-time communications to more than 20,000 state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) partners.

Fixing Disaster Response to Streamline Resources to Communities in Need, Cutting Off Illegal Aliens

For decades, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was bloated by waste, fraud, and abuse. Now, under President Trump and Secretary Noem, FEMA is being transformed, empowering disaster response that is federally supported, state led, and locally executed:

At Secretary Noem’s direction, FEMA has conducted a critical evaluation of all grant programs and recipients to root out waste, fraud, and abuse and deliver accountability for the American taxpayer.

FEMA returned nearly $3.5 billion to American communities for emergency preparedness.

Under Secretary Noem’s leadership, recipients of FEMA grants are no longer permitted to use federal funds to house illegal aliens at luxury hotels, fund climate change pet projects, or empower radical organizations with unseemly ties that don’t serve the interest of the American people.

In February, Secretary Noem fired four FEMA workers who attempted to send $59 million in funding to the notorious “Roosevelt Hotel” to continue paying for housing illegal aliens.

Following President Trump’s emergency declaration for New Mexico’s June 2025 storms and flooding, FEMA rapidly deployed Urban Search and Rescue (US&R) capabilities to support state and local operations.

FEMA’s search and rescue team seamlessly integrated into state-led efforts, working to locate and assist individuals who were in danger due to flooding and landslides, helping to protect lives and stabilize affected communities.

In response to the flooding in Texas in July, DHS and FEMA delivered one of the fastest, most coordinated federal disaster responses in Texas history – approving a major disaster declaration within hours, deploying FEMA staff and incident support teams within five hours, deploying US&R within 24 hours, and surging Coast Guard water rescue assets to the impacted areas, saving hundreds of lives.

Governor Abbott called FEMA an “exceptional” partner and praised the response as the fastest and most coordinated he has seen, as FEMA rapidly fulfilled all state requests to support life-saving operations and recovery efforts.

In October, following the severe flooding in Alaska, Secretary Noem approved $1 million in expedited FEMA Public Assistance funding to Alaska, providing immediate resources to stabilize dangerous conditions and support critical storm recovery operations.

President Trump and Secretary Noem approved $59 million in expedited FEMA Public Assistance funding to support Missouri’s tornado recovery, focusing on debris removal and demolition of tornado-damaged properties in St. Louis.

This funding accelerated overall recovery efforts – enabling the state of Missouri to lead this effort with technical support from FEMA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).

FEMA implemented Rapid Assessment with Public Infrastructure Data (RAPID), an accelerated approach to Public Assistance grant formulation that helps states get the funds they need to rebuild infrastructure at historic speeds.

With RAPID, FEMA uses geospatial data and publicly available information to develop cost estimates for facilities that are damaged beyond repair instead of traditional site inspections. This significantly reduces the burden on applicants and accelerates the availability of grant assistance.

Since national implementation in July, RAPID has been used in 105 infrastructure recovery projects representing more than $374 million in recovery funding.

This streamlined approach cut program processing time from an average of 396 days to 135 days – and, in some cases, achieving unprecedented permanent work obligations in as few as 47 days.

FEMA modernized how the agency interacts with disaster survivors – with improvements to the online application on DisasterAssistance.gov, clearer letters, and short explanation videos that walk people through the process step by step. These improvements included:

A new application status tracker that visually shows and describes where survivors are in the application process. Survivors no longer need to solely rely on the FEMA Helpline to get updates on the status of their application – cutting down on calls to the Helpline.

Guided videos to help inform survivors on what to expect during and after they complete an application for disaster assistance.

In alignment with President Trump’s Executive Order to modernize federal payments, FEMA partnered with the U.S. Treasury to provide new options for survivors to receive their disaster assistance money faster and more securely.

In 2025, FEMA launched the Direct-to-Consumer Flood Insurance Quoting Tool to expand ways that people can access flood insurance quotes.

DHS is just getting started under President Donald Trump and Secretary Noem. The best is yet to come.

Immigration court hearings are open to the public, but individual judges can limit attendance or close hearings at their discretion.","Immigrant rights activist Jeanette Vizguerra went before a judge Friday for a bond hearing at the detention facility in Aurora where she has been detained for nine months.

Immigration Judge Brea Burgie, citing the complexity of the case, did not immediately make a decision and will release a written order soon.

U.S. District Judge Nina Wang ordered the bond hearing to occur earlier this week.

Vizguerra, a prominent activist originally from Mexico, has been held at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center since March. She has a pending habeas corpus petition in federal court over her arrest and detention, arguing that she was targeted for arrest because of her constitutionally protected political speech against the Trump administration.

Vizguerra rose to national attention during the first Trump administration when she took sanctuary in a Denver church to avoid deportation. She was arrested this year as the Trump administration undertook aggressive mass deportation efforts that have faced repeated rebukes by federal judges.

In September, her lawyers claimed that her prolonged detention goes against legal norms and precedent and that she should be released on bond while her case progresses.

Wang wrote in her order that the federal government must prove that Vizguerra is a flight risk or danger to the community to justify continued detention. Government lawyer Shana Martin said that Vizguerra’s past criminal conviction demonstrates Vizguerra’s “inability and unwillingness to follow the law” and “lack of respect for authority.” Vizguerra entered the country without authorization in 1997 and was convicted of having a fake Social Security card in 2009, which prompted the deportation efforts against her.

In the 16 years since then, however, Vizguerra has received bond and multiple stays of removal with that conviction, her lawyer Laura Lichter said. The conviction for a “common status-related necessity” of using a false Social Security number to work and obtain housing, Lichter said, does not indicate flight risk or danger, and the government made that same determination multiple times before.

“There is no evidence during any of that time that she was at risk of flight. Or that she was a danger,” Lichter said. “There’s no history of failures to appear, and again, going back to the burden of proof, what the government has said, is they don’t like Ms. Vizguerra. What the government has shown is they have treated her differently than almost any other noncitizen in the United States, in the way they targeted her.”

Lawyers said the government did not bring any new evidence showing why Vizguerra should not receive bond and did not meet the legal burden to keep Vizguerra at the ICE detention facility.

“At the end of the day, all the government had were just kind of playground level insults about who Jeanette was and what she stands for, none of which was actually backed up by solid evidence in the record,” Lichter said after the hearing.

The bond hearing started over two hours late. Journalists and supporters were originally blocked from entering the court by officials with GEO Group, the private company that runs the facility, who said they had a directive from ICE to close the hearing to media. A Colorado Newsline reporter was ordered to leave by a GEO official and threatened with action from the Aurora Police Department for taking a photo of courtroom access rules posted in the lobby. Eventually, press was allowed into court and onto the court livestream.

Immigration court hearings are open to the public, but individual judges can limit attendance or close hearings at their discretion. Burgie at the start of the hearing affirmed that press was welcome.

Vizguerra’s supporters gathered on the sidewalk outside the facility during the proceedings.

“Her record speaks for itself,” Lichter said. “Her support speaks for herself, and we expect to see a positive decision hopefully in the next few days.”",https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lichter-dec-19-1-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 13:57:19.892637

The attack on Dugan is part of a broader campaign by the Trump administration against democratic rights.
The Trump administration has seized upon virtually any violent incident to intensify its assault on immigrants and democratic rights.","In a split decision on Thursday, a Wisconsin jury convicted Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan of felony obstruction while acquitting her of a related misdemeanor charge. Dugan was arrested by the FBI this past April as part of the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to establish a political dictatorship and subordinate all branches of government to the White House.

Dugan is facing up to five years in prison for the crime of instructing Eduardo Flores Ruiz, a Milwaukee resident at the time, to use a side door to exit her courtroom as a gang of federal agents waited outside. After exiting the courtroom, Flores Ruiz and his attorney proceeded down a public hallway where two federal agents were waiting and arrested him. Prosecutors argued that even though Flores Ruiz did not evade arrest, Judge Dugan intended for him to avoid federal agents by using a stairwell and exit not typically accessible to the public.

Under previous administrations, courts and other so-called “sensitive areas” were generally off limits to ICE kidnapping operations in part because the government sought to ensure immigrants would appear for court hearings without fear of arrest.

The arrest and conviction of Dugan is one of the most consequential actions taken by the Trump administration in its drive to erect a presidential dictatorship. The Trump White House, which directed Dugan’s arrest, has demonstrated its willingness to imprison political opponents, including members of the judiciary, who take any action that impedes the ongoing mass deportation operation.

While Dugan was found guilty of obstructing federal agents, she has not yet been sentenced. Her attorney has already stated that the conviction will be appealed. If the verdict stands, Dugan faces up to five years in prison.

Dugan’s conviction comes nearly 11 months after Trump, in one of his first official acts after returning to office, pardoned more than 1,500 fanatical supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021 in an attempted coup. Many of those pardoned had been convicted of obstructing a federal proceeding for conspiring to block Congress from certifying the Electoral College vote.

While Trump’s fascist foot soldiers walk free, Judge Dugan now faces the prospect of imprisonment.

Underscoring the political character of the prosecution, Trump administration officials and Republican politicians responded to the verdict by gloating and issuing threats. Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on X, “NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW. No one can obstruct law enforcement as they carry out their basic duties. This Department of Justice will not waver as our agents and law enforcement partners continue to make America Safe Again.”

FBI Director Kash Patel echoed the same slogan, posting, “No one is above the law” alongside a Fox News headline about the trial.

On Friday, Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Assembly Majority Leader Tyler August released a joint statement demanding that Dugan immediately resign or face impeachment proceedings.

As Republican officials circle, no prominent Democrats have spoken out in defense of Dugan. At the time of her arrest, Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer described the prosecution as an attack “on the separation of powers” and pledged to “fight this with everything we have.” As of this writing, more than 24 hours after the conviction, Schumer has issued no further public statement. Wisconsin Democratic Governor Tony Evers, who previously denounced Dugan’s arrest and Trump’s assault on the judiciary, has also remained silent.

The attack on Dugan is part of a broader campaign by the Trump administration against democratic rights. The Guardian, citing records obtained by Property of the People, reported that the FBI has initiated domestic terrorism investigations into anti-ICE activity in 23 regions across the United States. Some of these investigations were launched under Trump’s National Security Presidential Memorandum 7, “Countering Domestic Terrorism and Organized Political Violence,” issued on September 25.

The memorandum asserts, without evidence, that “Common threads animating this violent conduct include anti Americanism, anti capitalism, and anti Christianity; support for the overthrow of the United States Government; extremism on migration, race, and gender; and hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family, religion, and morality.”

Although the FBI document provides few specifics, an accompanying chart shows that 54 percent of pending investigations related to anti-ICE activity concern “civil unrest,” meaning the FBI is investigating individuals for protesting illegal, violent and brutal immigration kidnapping operations.

Further escalating this campaign, Thursday marked the first deadline in a memo issued earlier this month by Attorney General Pam Bondi ordering all federal domestic law enforcement agencies to submit intelligence files on “Antifa” and “Antifa related” activities to the FBI. The December 4 memo outlines how federal agencies are to implement NSPM-7 against those who oppose capitalism and fascism and express support for socialism.

Defending these actions, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told the Washington Post that “Left wing organizations have fueled violent riots, organized attacks against law enforcement officers, coordinated illegal doxing campaigns, arranged drop points for weapons and riot materials, and more,” a claim made without evidence.

The Trump administration has seized upon virtually any violent incident to intensify its assault on immigrants and democratic rights. Following the shooting at Brown University and the murder of MIT Professor Nuno Loureiro at his home in Brookline, Massachusetts by Claudio Neves Valente, a former Brown grad student and Portuguese national, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced on Thursday night the suspension of the diversity visa lottery program, even though DHS does not administer the lottery.

The lottery program is run by the State Department. DHS’s role is limited to issuing green cards to individuals already granted legal permanent resident status. By halting the issuance of green cards under this program, DHS is effectively placing legal residents at risk of detention by ICE for failing to carry documentation.

Hundreds of thousands of people have entered the United States through the diversity visa lottery since Valente did in 2017. Suspending the program will do nothing to address gun violence but will instead expose hundreds of thousands of people to immigration raids and detention.

The Democratic Party, which has just voted to provide Trump with a $1 trillion war budget, has demonstrated that it is both incapable and unwilling to defend democratic rights. As Trump launches daily attacks on the Constitution, the judiciary and the working class, Democrats have supplied the votes needed to keep the government and the detention camps operating.

This is a government of the oligarchy waging war on the working class. It is dismantling vital social programs on which millions depend. This week Republicans confirmed there would be no vote to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies, ensuring that health insurance costs for millions will rise sharply in the coming year.

The decisive question is one of political leadership and organization. The Democratic Party will not oppose Trump’s drive toward dictatorship because, like him, it represents the financial aristocracy and is committed to the defense of the capitalist state and the wealth of the super-rich.",https://www.wsws.org/asset/73e2362a-89ba-4b0d-93ce-9e93aebba4d6?rendition=1600x900,N,,2025-12-20 09:56:56.898108

The jury returned the verdicts after deliberating for six hours. Dugan faces up to five years in prison when she’s sentenced, but no date had been set as of late Thursday evening.

The case inflamed tensions over Trump’s immigration crackdown, with his administration branding Dugan an activist judge and Democrats countering that the administration was trying to make an example of Dugan to blunt judicial opposition to the operation.

Dugan and her attorneys left the courtroom, ducked into a side conference room and closed the door without speaking to reporters. Steve Biskupic, her lead attorney, later told reporters that he was disappointed with the ruling and didn’t understand how the jury could have reached a split verdict since the elements of both charges were virtually the same.

U.S. Atty. Brad Schimel denied the case was political and urged people to accept the verdict peacefully. He said courthouse arrests are safer because people are screened for weapons and it isn’t unfair for law enforcement to arrest wanted people in courthouses.

“Some have sought to make this about a larger political battle,” Schimel said. “While this case is serious for all involved, it is ultimately about a single day, a single bad day, in a public courthouse. The defendant is certainly not evil. Nor is she a martyr for some greater cause.”

U.S. Deputy Atty. Gen. Todd Blanche praised the verdict on X, saying nobody is above the law, even judges.

According to court filings that include an FBI affidavit and a federal grand jury indictment, immigration authorities traveled to the Milwaukee County courthouse on April 18 after learning 31-year-old Eduardo Flores-Ruiz had reentered the country illegally and was scheduled to appear before Dugan for a hearing in a state battery case.

Dugan learned that agents were in the corridor outside her courtroom waiting for Flores-Ruiz. She left the courtroom to confront them, falsely telling them their administrative warrant for Flores-Ruiz wasn’t sufficient grounds to arrest him and directing them to go to the chief judge’s office.

While the agents were gone, she addressed Flores-Ruiz’s case off the record, told his attorney that he could attend his next hearing via Zoom and led Flores-Ruiz and the attorney out a private jury door. Agents spotted Flores-Ruiz in the corridor, followed him outside and arrested him after a foot chase. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced in November he had been deported.

Prosecutors worked during Dugan’s trial to show that she directed agents to the chief judge’s office to create an opening for Flores-Ruiz to escape.

An FBI agent who led the investigation testified that after agents left the corridor, she immediately moved Flores-Ruiz’s case to the top of her docket, told him that he could appear for his next hearing via Zoom and led him out the private door.

Prosecutors also played audio recordings from her courtroom in which she can be heard telling her court reporter that she’d take “the heat” for leading Flores-Ruiz out the back.

Her attorneys countered that she was trying to follow courthouse protocols that called for court employees to report any immigration agents to their supervisors and she didn’t intentionally try to obstruct the arrest team.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3a00a45/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4755x2496+0+535/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa4%2F16%2Fbbec46064c5cbd27266a4a23642d%2F6112550c73d54cc088b52eeb07092766.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 11:58:24.674298

The court ruled that the government’s action violated the law, restoring access to bond hearings for a class of people arrested and detained throughout New England.
Later that month, the court certified a class of individuals arrested by ICE inside the United States and held in New England detention facilities.","BOSTON – A federal court today ruled that the Trump administration is unlawfully denying bond hearings to potentially thousands of people in New England who were arrested and detained by ICE and deprived of the opportunity to challenge their ongoing detention. The court granted a motion for partial summary judgement and declared that it was unlawful for the government to deny bond hearings to class members.

The class action lawsuit was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, the ACLU of New Hampshire, the ACLU of Maine, the law firm Araujo and Fisher, the law firm Foley Hoag, and the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic.

""Everyone in the United States is entitled to due process,” said Daniel McFadden, managing attorney at the ACLU of Massachusetts. “The government cannot arrest and detain people inside the United States without providing them with strong procedural protections, including a hearing before a judge. But a few months ago, the Trump administration broke the law and reversed the government’s longstanding practice of providing bond hearings to people arrested on civil immigration charges. This reversal deprived countless people of the right to challenge their detention in immigration court. Federal courts around the country have almost universally rejected the Trump administration’s unlawful action. We are grateful that the federal court in Massachusetts has now restored due process rights to thousands of people arrested and detained throughout New England.”

As the lawsuit argued and this ruling affirms, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice abruptly began to misclassify people arrested by ICE inside the United States earlier this year. These people may generally be detained, if at all, under the statutory authority of 8 U.S.C. § 1226, which usually allows for the opportunity to request bond during removal proceedings. However, starting in July, the Trump administration began misclassifying many of these people and placing them in no-bond detention under the provisions of 8 U.S.C. § 1225. The court ruled that the government’s action violated the law, restoring access to bond hearings for a class of people arrested and detained throughout New England.

“When the administration began routinely denying bond hearing to members of our class, it upended 30 years of standard practice and signaled a dark new strategy designed to demoralize our clients and close off well-established avenues for legal relief,” said Annelise Araujo, founding principal and owner at Araujo & Fisher LLP. “We’re pleased the court recognized the essential injustice at the heart of this matter. This ruling restores hope for thousands of immigrants.

The original complaint was filed in September on behalf of named plaintiff, Jose Arnulfo Guerrero Orellana, and a class of similarly situated individuals. In October, the court granted a preliminary injunction and ordered a bond hearing for Mr. Guerrero Orellana, who was later released on bond. Later that month, the court certified a class of individuals arrested by ICE inside the United States and held in New England detention facilities. Today’s rulinggrants relief to that class and holds that the Trump administration does not have the statutory authority to detain class members without access to a bond hearing.

This ruling for the New England regional class is consistent with a ruling issued yesterday in Maldonado Bautista v. Santacruz, in which a District Court in California declared that the government's policy of subjecting a nationwide class to no-bond detention violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, and vacated that DHS policy.

The President of the United States poses with a lightsaber flanked by the American flag and eagles. Taylor Swift offers free cookware sets due to a packaging error. Ukraine’s former Foreign Minister calls a United States Senator to gather political information. While no one was fooled into believing President Trump owns a lightsaber, scammers are using AI-generated photos, videos, or voices to trick people into providing confidential or sensitive information. These schemes now target employers seeking to hire for remote jobs.

In January, the FBI warned that North Koreans were posing as candidates for remote jobs to access employers’ confidential information and systems. Nearly every major company has hired or received applications from North Koreans using AI-generated interview answers or deepfake applicants to participate in video interviews. According to the Financial Times, one quarter of all job applicants in the global market will be fake by 2028.

To avoid falling prey to these scams, hiring managers do not need a computer science degree from Stanford.

Disparate Impact: The Law of the Land?

By Peter R. Rich and Carrie H. Grundmann

Disparate impact is a long-standing theory of liability recognized under laws like Title VII, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and many state employment laws. First recognized by the United States Supreme Court in 1971 in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., the Supreme Court held that facially neutral employment practices can violate Title VII where they disproportionately exclude protected groups unless the employer can show the practices are job-related and consistent with business necessity. Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 431–36 (1971). Disparate impact claims are assessed by courts under the burden-shifting framework known as the “effects test.""

Executive Actions on Immigration Impacting Employers

By Eric E. Kinder

The last several federal administrations have gone back and forth regarding how to define a joint employer under federal law and specifically under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). For the uninitiated, a joint employer exists where two separately incorporated entities are treated as a single employer with respect to an employee or group of employees. Joint employers are jointly and severally liable for FLSA compliance, including any wages, damages and penalties owed to the employees. Importantly, this can be true even where the two entities are, by outward appearances, separate.

The federal lawsuit, filed in the Western District of Washington state, seeks a court order forcing the Department of Transportation to release the funds.","This story comes from our partners at WHYY.

New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania are suing the Trump administration over funding for electric vehicle chargers, as part of a coalition of 17 Democratic attorneys general, and Gov. Josh Shapiro. They are alleging the White House is acting unlawfully by withholding funds approved by Congress.

“Without any notice or explanation, the United States Department of Transportation just quietly refused to approve any new funding under the programs which had already been appropriated by Congress and awarded to the states,” said New Jersey Attorney General Michael Platkin.

“This is consistent with how this administration has treated congressional appropriations. They’re not optional. They’re laws,” said Platkin. And the Constitution says that only under limited circumstances can the president, after money has been appropriated by Congress and passed into law, can he restrict those funds from going to their intended recipients.”

New Jersey is waiting on $16 million from the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Program and the Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator Program. Both programs are part of the Biden-era bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which Congress passed in 2022.

Platkin said the funds would create new jobs and provide EV drivers greater access to the roads.

“At a time, again, when we’re trying to make energy costs go down,” Platkin said. “We’re trying to make people’s lives easier and more affordable. This makes no sense. It’s illegal, but it also just makes no sense.”

The lawsuit alleges the Trump administration’s actions violate the Constitutional separation of powers and the Administrative Procedure Act.

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said in a statement that the funds would support “EV construction projects in Pennsylvania and … new, good paying jobs.”

“I will not let the federal government break their word at the expense of Pennsylvanians,” Shapiro said.

Pennsylvania was awarded funds to construct three charging stations along I-78 and I-81. The joint project involving Maryland, New Jersey and West Virginia was awarded $18.6 million.

The effort was part of former President Joe Biden’s effort to tackle climate change.

This is just another reckless attempt that will stall the fight against air pollution and climate change, slow innovation, thwart green job creation, and leave communities without access to clean, affordable transportation,” said California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who led the effort. “While the Administration is busy finding ways for their Big Oil donors to profit, California will continue to fight for its people, environment, and innovation.”

The Department of Transportation did not respond to a request for comment.

But President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he’s not a fan of electric vehicles. Trump signed a law that ended EV tax credits and recently weakened fuel efficiency standards, saying that Americans prefer gas-powered vehicles.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Attorneys for President Donald Trump urged a federal judge on Friday to rule that Trump is entitled to presidential immunity from civil claims that he instigated a mob’s attack on the U.S. Capitol to stop Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 election.

U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta didn’t rule from the bench after hearing arguments from Trump attorneys and lawyers for Democratic members of Congress who sued the Republican president and allies over the Jan. 6. 2021, attack.

Trump spoke to a crowd of his supporters at the “Stop the Steal” rally near the White House before the mob’s attack disrupted the joint session of Congress for certifying Democratic President Joe Biden’s electoral victory.

Trump’s attorneys argue that his conduct leading up to Jan. 6 and on the day of the riot is protected by presidential immunity because he was acting in his official capacity.

“The entire point of immunity is to give the president clarity to speak in the moment as the commander-in-chief,” Trump attorney Joshua Halpern told the judge.

The lawmakers’ lawyers argue Trump can’t prove he was acting entirely in his official capacity rather than as an office-seeking private individual. And the U.S. Supreme Court has held that office-seeking conduct falls outside the scope of presidential immunity, they contend.

“President Trump has the burden of proof here,” said plaintiffs’ attorney Joseph Sellers. “We submit that he hasn’t come anywhere close to satisfying that burden.”

At the end of Friday’s hearing, Mehta said the arguments gave him “a lot to think about” and he would rule “as soon as we can.”

Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who chaired the House Homeland Security Committee, sued Trump, his personal attorney Rudolph Giuliani and members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers extremist groups over the Jan. 6 riot. Other Democratic members of Congress later joined the litigation.

The civil claims survived Trump’s sweeping act of clemency on the first day of his second term, when he pardoned, commuted prison sentences and ordered the dismissal of all 1,500-plus criminal cases stemming from the Capitol siege. Over 100 police officers were injured while defending the Capitol from rioters.

Halpern said immunity enables the president to act “boldly and fearlessly.”

“Immunity exists to protect the president’s prerogatives,” he said.

Plaintiffs’ lawyers argue that the context and circumstances of the president’s remarks on Jan. 6 — not just the content of his words — are key to establishing whether he is immune from liability.

“You have to look at what happened leading up to January 6th,” Sellers said.",https://www.advocate-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25353653177403.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-12-20 15:57:44.403114

A Wisconsin jury found state court Judge Hannah Dugan guilty of obstructing federal immigration enforcement on Thursday, delivering a victory to the Trump administration’s crusade against anyone—even judicial officers—who attempt to impede its mass deportation campaign. Dugan, a Milwaukee County Circuit Judge, helped a noncitizen evade ICE agents at the state courthouse by instructing him to exit the courtroom through a specific door. Agents apprehended him anyway, and prosecutors promptly charged Dugan with obstruction, a felony punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment.

On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed the jury’s verdict, and the dissonance of a legal regime in which the president can break the law with impunity while a judge faces prison for impeding an immigration arrest inside her own courtroom. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: Judge Dugan allegedly pointed an undocumented immigrant to a side door in her courtroom to evade ICE agents. And now she has been found guilty of a felony offense. This verdict is so depressing in so many ways. Can we count them?

Mark Joseph Stern: We are living in a world in which the Supreme Court has granted sweeping criminal immunity to presidents—specifically, to Donald Trump—for actions that they take that fall anywhere within the “outer perimeter” of their “official responsibilities.” SCOTUS simply made that rule up in Trump v. United States. Yet there is a real doctrine of judicial immunity that has deep roots in American law. It provides an absolute shield against prosecution of judges for all actions taken in their official capacity. That has long been understood to include how judges direct activities within their courtrooms. Now, remember what Dugan allegedly did: She directed a criminal defendant in her courtroom to leave through a certain door so ICE would not arrest him, thereby preventing her from continuing to adjudicate his case. The Trump administration argued that Dugan should not receive judicial immunity for this act. And U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman agreed, paving the way for Thursday’s guilty verdict.

The idea that a judge can’t claim judicial immunity for the act of telling someone to leave through a certain door in her courtroom strikes me as absurd. Set aside professional penalties. How in the world can a judge face criminal prosecution for this conduct after Trump v. United States? The Supreme Court has now granted the president absolute immunity for ordering a sham investigation into a free and fair election in order to nullify valid votes and overturn the results. But Dugan can be prosecuted for this? I just can’t square those things.

I’m not saying that what Dugan did was unquestionably right or good. I am saying that when a judge in her robes, in her own courtroom, tells someone who is going to appear at her hearing to leave through a particular door, she is surely acting within the outer perimeter of her official duties. Certainly much more so than Trump was acting within the outer perimeter of his official duties when he attempted to secure himself another term by overturning the results of an election.

I think you’re making a subtle argument and it’s worth landing on it really squarely. It’s one thing to confer maximalist, seemingly boundless authority on the executive branch and on the president that, by definition, circumscribes the judicial role. But to aggressively chip away, cut away, minimize, and cabin the powers of the judiciary at the same time? That’s really salt in the wound, and a threat to an independent judiciary.

Let’s be clear: This is an effort to chill the conduct of judges, especially state court judges, who believe they should decide the case before them without worrying that ICE agents are going to ambush plaintiffs or defendants or witnesses and thwart their effort to carry out justice. That is what happened here. That is what is happening in many states around the country. Some, like New York, have tried to block ICE agents from going into state courthouses. This was Judge Dugan doing much the same thing; trying to contend with the fact that ICE was about to arrest someone who was due to appear before her.

I think the verdict shows a real failure of the jury to understand how vindictive and partisan this prosecution was, and to see the deeper issues lurking here. It’s awful that the U.S. attorney brought this case in the first place. I think the prosecutors who worked on this case should be ashamed of themselves. I guess my one consolation is that Judge Adelman is known to be a very lenient sentencer. If Dugan’s conviction is upheld on appeal, I think it’s unlikely that he’ll give her any term of confinement behind bars. She has no criminal record and there are no other factors that would call for a higher sentence. Adelman might impose house arrest, but probation seems more likely.",https://compote.slate.com/images/60ffbaa5-943e-4800-9ebc-b79564ea9fd4.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560,N,,2025-12-20 01:58:02.858680

City officials told ABC6 News they were aware of what they described as an uptick in ICE presence. However, until Wednesday, federal officials had not confirmed any enforcement actions.

In a statement to ABC6 News, ICE said the arrests were part of ongoing operations.

“These enforcement actions are part of ongoing efforts to uphold public safety and enforce federal immigration laws,” the agency said.

ICE described those arrested as the “worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens,” but provided details on only two individuals taken into custody earlier this week.

ICE identified the two individuals as Wilmar Lozano-Alcantara and Abdirisaq Hassan Mohamed.

Wilmar Lozano-Alcantara

A review of local court records shows Lozano-Alcantara has multiple prior charges, including criminal trespassing and drug-related offenses, one of which involved possession of methamphetamine.

Court documents also show he was charged with aggravated robbery in a separate case. According to probable cause documents, police say Lozano-Alcantara stole two sandwiches from a business. When employees asked him to leave, investigators say he threatened them with a metal tube approximately eight inches long.

In court records, investigators noted Lozano-Alcantara admitted to the robbery, stating, “I robbed them. I was hungry.”

Abdirisaq Hassan Mohamed

For Mohamed, local court records were limited. The only documentation ABC6 News was able to locate was a traffic citation for failure to control a vehicle and not wearing a seat belt.

ICE, however, claims Mohamed was arrested for several additional offenses, including failure to disperse, refusing to submit to arrest, unlawful trafficking in scheduled drugs, terrorizing, and drinking in public.

At this time, ABC6 News has not been able to find court documentation to support those additional allegations.

Unanswered questions:

In its request to ICE, ABC6 News asked the agency several follow-up questions, including:

How many enforcement operations have been conducted in Columbus

How many people have been detained or arrested

How many ICE agents are currently operating in the city

Whether this represents an increase from earlier in 2025

ICE has not yet responded to those questions.

This is a developing story. ABC6 News will update this article as more information becomes available.",https://abc6onyourside.com/resources/media2/16x9/4199/1320/1033x1306/90/e57efcf3-6a41-45f2-8d70-23713474525e-AP25027710663013.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 01:58:07.935761

After 25 years of marriage — most of that time in the U.S. — Pedro Juan is now on her own.","SANTA EULALIA, Guatemala — Lucía Pedro Juan knew that she and her husband would not be returning to their southern Florida home.

Her husband, Francisco Gaspar Cristóbal Andrés, stood across the room in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office. ICE agents separated them as they took their fingerprints, warning them not to talk or touch each other.

But a tearful Pedro Juan ignored their orders.

""I broke away like that, but with such courage that I had the strength to go to him,"" Pedro Juan said. ""And I hugged him, I tickled him on his ribs and I gave him a kiss on his cheek.""

""Cheer up, papi,"" she told her husband.

He replied: ""It's OK, mami, you too, cheer up.""

The guard who had separated them yelled, ""I told you, you can't be together.""

That was the last day the husband and wife of 25 years were together.

“I never saw him again, I never spoke to him or heard his voice again,"" Pedro Juan said. “It's something terrible they did to us. Yes, it's something terrible they did to us.”

'A great pain for me'

Pedro Juan was awakened by guards at 1 a.m., in late November at the Montana Avenue ICE processing center. She had been transferred there from Camp East Montana — the United States' largest immigration detention center — in El Paso days prior to her immigration hearing.

She thought the guards were taking her to see her 48-year-old husband, who was in grave condition with liver and kidney complications at an El Paso hospital. She had repeatedly begged to see him after her daughter had told her he was critically ill.

Instead, she was placed on a deportation flight from El Paso to Guatemala City on Nov 28.

As she adjusted to returning to her highland Indigenous Mayan Q'anjob'al hometown, she learned her husband had died. His death on Dec. 3 has devastated Pedro Juan, their five children in the United States and her in-laws.

Cristóbal Andrés is the first immigrant to die in custody at the sprawling Camp East Montana detention center — a soft-sided facility, hastily constructed to house immigrants rounded up by federal agents in President Donald Trump's mass deportation campaign.

He died a week after his birthday from liver and kidney failure, according to an ICE news release. Cristóbal Andrés had suffered from medical issues since the week of his detention, ICE officials said.

His widow says that he was healthy when agents arrested them in Florida.

Candles sat on an altar with photos of Cristóbal Andrés in the home he had built for his parents back in Guatemala, surrounded by vases of white daisies and calla lilies. A banner depicting him with his arms stretched out and Jesus at his shoulder hung on the wall.

""That is a great pain for me,"" Pedro Juan said. ""I never imagined that was going to happen when they caught us.""

'Look, ma'am, sir, I have to take you in'

Cristóbal Andrés and Pedro Juan started their Labor Day holiday with a quick run to the grocery store. Their 15-year-old daughter had the day off from school for the holiday.

""I said, 'Let's go get groceries,' and he said, 'OK, mami,'"" Pedro Juan recalled. ""It was around 8:40 a.m., when we were on the road heading to Homestead (Florida). And an ICE agent passed by us and caught up with us.""

Public records show that it was a Florida State Highway patrol officer that first pulled them over.

He stopped them and requested both of their identification papers. Cristóbal Andrés presented his Florida driver's license and Pedro Juan told the officer she didn't have an ID, and instead presented her Guatemalan passport.

The officer went to his car, but he returned and said, ""look, ma'am, sir, I have to take you in. You're going to be detained for being undocumented.""

The officer explained he would be calling a tow truck, but she asked if it would be possible to drive the vehicle to a nearby location where a family friend could pick it up. The officer consulted an ICE agent, who granted the request with a stern warning.

""'If you try to run away, the officer behind you has the right to shoot you if you try to run away,' he told us,"" Pedro Juan said.

""I told him that we are not criminals,"" she said. ""We are very hardworking, very determined people. We're not criminals.""

They were taken to Miramar, Florida, to be processed between 9:30 a.m., and 11 a.m. Agents took all their possessions, including the over $1,100 in cash Pedro Juan had with her, which was never returned.

The couple had operated a nursery outside of Miami for the past decade.

Pedro Juan began to cry as she was separated from her husband and worried about her daughter at home. She refused to allow her daughter to be placed in Child Protective Services, choosing to ask a family friend to take care of her.

'It's there in Texas where we suffered'

Pedro Juan was initially taken to the Broward Transitional Center in Pompano Beach, Florida, where she spent five days.

""I can't say there was any mistreatment there,"" she said. ""I was there for five days, and I said, 'Only God is great, how am I going to get out of this?'""

The following Sunday, she learned that her prayer would not be answered. She was placed on an ICE-chartered GlobalX plane and moved to the Southwest.

""They sent me to Texas,"" she explained. ""It's there in Texas where we suffered.""

She was flown with around 36 other women to El Paso, all handcuffed. They were among the first women to arrive at Camp East Montana in mid-September.

Nearly 3,000 men and women were held at the detention facility by Dec. 1, according to the office of U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-El Paso. Pedro Juan learned that her husband had been transferred to the same facility.

Pedro Juan was held in the detention facility for nearly three months, despite the Trump administration's claim that the facility would hold detainees for only up to five days.

She described living in cruel, unsanitary and inhumane conditions at Camp East Montana.

The guards would mock them in English, describing them as animals.

""That's what happens when you are a donkey,"" Pedro Juan said the guards told them. ""And that's what happens when you don't understand. You're crossing the border, people are still catching you here, but you keep crossing.""

The insults came from guards whose ""parents are immigrants like us.""

""I don't know why you treat us like this,"" she asked.

She recalled a sick woman being called out by guards.

""'You're going to die here because that's what you came here to do, to find your own death, that's why you crossed over,' they told her,"" Pedro Juan recalled.

The women had to just sit there as guards berated them and sought to silence them.

""Shut up, you can't say anything because you're eating dog and pig food,"" the guards told them. ""You're dumb, stupid, burros.""

On another occasion, women in her area were fainting because of hunger and thirst. They pleaded with guards for medicine, saying, ""we are going to die, we are not going to endure it.""

She said she felt like she was going to faint too, and was given two Tylenol.

Living in a detention center was physically and emotionally challenging.

The food was inedible and was often spoiled. They would often run out of toilet paper by 8 a.m., and have to do without for the rest of the day. Pedro Juan and the other women suffered from depression.

""Our hair was falling out because of the stress,"" she explained.

Pedro Juan, under duress, ultimately requested voluntary departure. She feared that if she remained in the lockup, she would die.

Her story confirms the concerns raised by human rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the El Paso-based immigrant rights advocacy group Las Americas, and Escobar, about the conditions in the detention facility.

Cristóbal Andrés' death highlights the concerns over the conditions at the site.

""This kind of detention is only going to accelerate that harm, and it is gravely unfortunate that this man has passed,"" Marisa Limón Garza, the director of Las Americas said during a news conference on Dec. 12. ""I am confident that this will not be the last (case).""

ICE: Detainee received 'high-quality care'

ICE officials announced Cristóbal Andrés' death in their custody in a news statement on Dec 5. He had received medical attention from the moment he was detained, ICE officials said.

""From the moment they were notified of his health crisis, ICE medical staff ensured he had constant, high-quality care,"" officials said.

He was treated for alcohol withdrawal days after his detention. Ninety-three days later, he died from liver and kidney failure, the ICE report states.

He received medical attention at the El Paso facility on Sept. 27, Oct. 2, Oct. 9, Nov. 3 and Nov. 13 for a variety of ailments, including feeling lightheaded, flu-like symptoms, bleeding gums, sore throat and body aches. He was also treated for fever, productive cough with phlegm, jaundice, severe left lower extremity edema and hypertension, ICE said in the news release about his death.

He was taken to the Hospitals of Providence East Campus on Nov. 16, where medical staff diagnosed him with hyponatremia. He was placed on a liver transplant list and placed on dialysis and palliative care towards the end of November, before he was pronounced dead in December.

There was indisputable evidence that his life was in danger.

A 911 call was made from the ICE detention facility on Nov. 16 for a ""47-year-old suffering from low blood pressure and swelling to legs,"" according to call logs provided to the El Paso Times through a Freedom of Information request to the city of El Paso.

The cause of death reported by ICE came as a shock to Pedro Juan. She said that her husband did drink from time to time on the weekends with his friends, but she refuted that he had any prior health conditions, including hypertension.

""About a year ago, we took him to the doctor,"" Pedro Juan said. ""He never complained to us, even when he was sick, nothing.""

She insists that his health declined while in ICE custody, and became worse while detained at Camp East Montana.

Living the American dream

Cristóbal Andrés migrated to the United States in 2002 in search of work, like many other residents of his highland town. Pedro Juan and their four daughters joined him in 2007.

""I lived in the United States for 18 years,"" Pedro Juan said. ""My husband went to work for a company in Miami, Florida when he arrived. I went with him after many hardships in life. (Guatemala) lacks money. I worked at a nursery company cultivating plants when I got there. I worked there for eight years. Then my husband and I started our own little business.""

Santa Eulalia sits atop the Cuchumatanes mountains in the western highlands of Guatemala, 215 miles up winding, unmaintained highways that look like a lunar landscape from Guatemala City, and just 30 miles from the border with Mexico. The remote town has long been plagued by extreme poverty and a lack of attention from the Guatemalan state.

The two had built a life together in the United States and he built a home for his parents back in Guatemala. They were inseparable as they built a business and raised their family in Homestead, Florida.

Over the years, their daughters married men from El Salvador, Honduras and Mexico. Their youngest daughter was born in 2010 in Florida, making her a U.S. citizen.

Pedro Juan opened her business, Lucy Nursery, in Miami after years of working for a landowner there. The family invested in the business, buying tractors and other machinery.

They attended two churches during their time in Florida: the Sacred Heart Catholic Church and another in Kendall, Florida. Pedro Juan said that her business provided poinsettias to the churches for Christmas celebrations in their community.

Cristóbal Andrés had previously been detained by immigration officials in 2017. But the family hired a lawyer and had him released to pursue his immigration relief case, paying $15,000, Pedro Juan said.

""He was going to court, he was going to take care of everything that the requirements ask for, and then we were working, struggling with life with the family,"" Pedro Juan said. ""And we never imagined that we were going to go through this situation that we are going through now.""

A mother's plea: 'I want to see my son'

María Andrés had not seen her son, Cristóbal Andrés, in over 23 years, but she still remembers when her firstborn son left for the United States. The family had suffered from poverty, and he wanted to give them a better life.

""He said, 'I'm leaving, Mom,'"" the 68-year-old said through a translator in the Q'anjob'al language. ""'I'm going to look for opportunities and I want to help you.'""

She had 15 children, but only seven survived. Of those, she has lost three in the last 10 years, including Cristóbal Andrés.

Now all she wants is her son back.

""I want to see my son,"" Andrés said. ""I want his body to be returned.""

The family has spoken with the Guatemalan government about repatriating his body for a proper Catholic burial in his hometown. But Pedro Juan said that there was no money.

Pedro Juan said that an official from ICE said that if they didn't claim the body and pay, his body would be cremated against the wishes of the family. She said they wanted $6,000 to repatriate his body.

At least 30 immigrants have died in detention in 2025. It is unclear how many of those bodies have been returned to their home countries.

'May God give him peace'

Before Pedro Juan was taken from the detention center, she begged ICE agents one last time to see her husband, a day before she was deported. Her daughter had told her in a recent call that he was ""very sick.""

“(On Nov. 27), before he died, I begged, 'Please take me to see my husband. We haven’t seen him for two and a half months.'""

As before, her cries for help were ignored.

""I told them, crying, 'Please, I want to talk to my husband. I am heartbroken,'"" she said, breaking into tears again. ""They said nothing. Not even 'Wait' or 'Let me check.' Nothing. 'No visits allowed.'""

The widow described her husband as a man who deeply loved his family and who fought to provide for them. She explained, ""I was very close to him. We were always together.""

""May God give him peace,"" Pedro Juan said. ""He was very hardworking.""

Sadness, grief and blame

Pedro Juan still has nightmares of being detained. She said she has ""lost everything.""

""It is something horrible that they did to us,"" she said.

Her body shakes from the stress and trauma she went through, and she points to her thinning hairline as an example of the loss of hair.

She is a stranger in her hometown. So much has changed in the community in the past 20 years, but the signs of their hard work are there: a house that her husband and she built for his parents with the money they earned in Florida.

Pedro Juan is having to re-adjust to the colorful, woven clothing of Mayan communities, as she has not put on a traditional skirt in years. She still wears a silver cross she wore while being detained.

She calls her suffering and her husband’s death a U.S. tragedy. She stresses her family members didn’t come to harm America. They weren’t criminals who needed to be swept off the streets by the Trump administration.

""I hope the government, or the ICE agents, who detained us understand that we are people — we give our labor to the world,"" Pedro Juan emphasized. ""We are hardworking people — my people, my country’s people, immigrants from everywhere.

""Everyone goes to work out of necessity — to support their families. That is why we are there. We deserve justice.""

Pedro Juan spoke to her husband by telephone after she was freed, but by then he was unable to form words, she said.

After 25 years of marriage — most of that time in the U.S. — Pedro Juan is now on her own. The widow knows in her heart what caused her beloved Cristóbal Andrés' early death.

""What a coincidence that my husband was fine and it turns out that he is now dead,"" Pedro Juan said. ""I know they killed him.""","https://www.elpasotimes.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/19/PTX1/87842781007-mother-ice-death-4438.JPG?crop=3200,1800,x301,y121&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-19 22:56:58.331392

A one-paragraph order from the high court with no listed dissents denied a request to dismiss the lawsuit but still left the door open for the government to try again once the case progresses.
The restrictions violated their First Amendment rights and interfered with their ability to lecture at universities or speak with community groups, the National Association of Immigration Judges said.
It was a rare loss for the Trump administration at the Supreme Court that has regularly ruled in its favor as the administration files emergency appeals at a record pace.
So far, the administration has filed 32 emergency applications the White House blames on judges overstepping their authority to block Trump’s agenda.","The Supreme Court rejected a request from the Trump administration to immediately stop a free speech lawsuit from immigration judges over restrictions on their public speaking engagements.

A one-paragraph order from the high court with no listed dissents denied a request to dismiss the lawsuit but still left the door open for the government to try again once the case progresses.

“At this stage, the Government has not demonstrated that it will suffer irreparable harm without a stay,” the order says.

The judges sued over a policy put in place during the Biden administration banning them from making statements about immigration or the agency that employs them in a personal capacity. The restrictions violated their First Amendment rights and interfered with their ability to lecture at universities or speak with community groups, the National Association of Immigration Judges said.

While the lawsuit is centered around free speech, justices did not rule on that aspect and were instead focused on what the proper venue is for resolving complaints of government employees. The Justice Department sought to stop the lawsuit from proceeding before a federal district judge and argued it should go before the Merit Systems Protection Board, which oversees federal government employee disputes.

But Trump has long opposed the Diversity Immigrant Visa Programme, sometimes known as the DV Programme. On Friday, his secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, revealed that he had directed her to end the lottery immediately.

She also identified the suspect as Portuguese national Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, who received his green card, a certificate for permanent residency, through the lottery in 2017.

“This heinous individual should never have been allowed in our country,” Noem wrote in her social media statement.

“At President Trump’s direction, I am immediately directing USCIS [US Citizenship and Immigration Services] to pause the DV1 program to ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous program.”

Campaign to end visa lottery

Friday’s announcement is not the first time Trump has sought to wind down the diversity visa lottery.

Trump has long sought to narrow the country’s pathways to legal immigration, and he has used crime as a pretext for doing so.

Noem herself pointed out that, in 2017, Trump “fought” to shut down the diversity visa lottery in the wake of an attack in New York City in which a truck rammed into a crowd of people, killing eight.

Speaking at a graduation ceremony for the FBI in December 2017, Trump, then in his first term as president, called on Congress to “end the visa lottery system”.

“They have a lottery. You pick people. Do you think the country is giving us their best people? No,” Trump said.

“What kind of a system is that? They come in by lottery. They give us their worst people.”

The Diversity Immigrant Visa Programme was established in 1990 to ensure applicants from underrepresented countries had access to the US immigration system.

Immigration rights advocates have long argued that pathways to permanent residency are narrow for those who do not already have a spouse, relative or some other kind of sponsor in the country.

The visa lottery helps to answer that need by creating an alternative route to residency.

The lottery system selects visa recipients randomly, but critics argue it remains a long-shot avenue to gain US residency, and even successful applicants must still pass a rigorous screening process after the lottery.

While the Diversity Immigrant Visa Programme used to accept 55,000 applicants each year, in 2000, that number was lowered to its current level, according to the American Immigration Council.

Suspect identified

Friday’s decision to immediately suspend the lottery comes as new details emerge about Neves Valente, a physics scholar found dead in a storage unit in New Hampshire after a nationwide manhunt.

The search began on December 13, when gunfire erupted on the campus of Brown University, a prestigious Ivy League school in Providence, Rhode Island.

The school’s fall semester was at its conclusion, and the exam period had begun. Students in the Barus and Holley physics laboratory were taking their end-of-course exams when a suspect, clad in black, entered the building and opened fire, killing two students and injuring nine others.

The physics lab was close to the edge of campus, and the suspect was able to escape on foot undetected.

The manhunt included several false starts, as authorities said they quickly detained a person of interest, only to release the individual without charges.

Then, on November 15, law enforcement officials announced that a plasma physics scholar named Nuno Loureiro had been found dead at his home after suffering multiple gunshot wounds.

Loureiro was also a Portuguese immigrant, and he had served as a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), a highly regarded science institution.

It was not immediately clear that the two shooting incidents were related, and authorities faced pressure to bring the Brown University shooter to justice as the manhunt dragged on.

But on Thursday night, officials announced they had discovered Neves Valente dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and that they believed him to be responsible for both attacks.

Neves Valente had previously studied in a PhD programme at Brown, though he did not complete his degree, and he had been Loureiro’s classmate in Portugal.

Visa revocations

The Trump administration has a track record of revoking visas and terminating immigration programmes after high-profile attacks.

On November 26, for example, two National Guard members from West Virginia were shot while on patrol in Washington, DC, as part of Trump’s crime crackdown in the capital.

The suspect in that case was identified as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who had previously worked with allied forces during the US-led war in Afghanistan.

One of the National Guard soldiers, 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom, ultimately died from her wounds.

Trump responded to the incident by announcing that he was halting all visa applications and asylum requests from Afghan nationals, despite outcry from human rights and veterans groups.

The Republican leader also said he would pursue a “permanent pause” on entry for immigrants from “all third-world countries”.

In the aftermath of the shooting, Trump’s White House tightened entry for 19 countries it had identified in June as “high risk” and expanded the list of restrictions to include 20 more countries.

Trump has also taken targeted actions to strip individuals of their immigration status following shootings.

After the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk in September, the Trump administration announced it was yanking visas from six foreign nationals who posted disrespectful comments or memes online about the attack. They hailed from countries ranging from Argentina to Brazil, and Germany to Paraguay.

Free-speech advocates said the decision was a clear violation of the First Amendment of the US Constitution, which protects the freedom of expression.

But the Trump administration has repeatedly threatened to boot foreign nationals whose views do not align with its policy priorities.

“Aliens who take advantage of America’s hospitality while celebrating the assassination of our citizens will be removed,” the US State Department wrote in response.

The suspect in the Kirk shooting is a 22-year-old US citizen named Tyler James Robinson from Utah.

As CHIRLA’s director of workers’ rights and labor legal services, Yunuen Trujillo has observed an effect on Los Angeles restaurant workers.","It’s been more than three months since the United States Supreme Court voted 6-3 in Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo to approve an emergency request from the Trump Administration to temporarily suspend an order from two federal courts that barred the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from detaining people based on their ethnicity, speaking a language other than English, or the type of job held. In August, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, plus a Los Angeles federal court, previously ruled that ICE raids and arrests were tantamount to racial profiling.

Since June 6, 2025, ICE’s immigration sweep operations have swept through Southern California. These have focused on swap meets, taco trucks, food stands, car washes, and Home Depot parking lots; the enforcement appears to target Latino-majority communities. Though two lower courts ruled that ICE’s actions are likely illegal, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote the majority opinion, which included the following: “The Immigration and Nationality Act authorizes immigration officers to ‘interrogate any alien or person believed to be an alien as to his right to be or remain in the United States.’” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote the dissent, joined by Justice Elena Kagan and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.

ICE’s impact on Southern California restaurants and agricultural communities has been felt since the widespread raids began in late May 2025. On June 15, Tacos de Cabrito y Machito El Lagunero, a San Bernardino County street food operation serving traditional spit-roasted kid from Mexico’s Comarca Lagunera region, was forced to close despite plans to celebrate its third anniversary. On August 6, LA Cha Cha Chá co-owner Alejandro Marin confirmed he would close his prominent Arts District restaurant, blaming federal ICE raids, subsequent protests, and deployment of the National Guard and U.S. Marines. Taquería Frontera owner Juan Carlos Guerra delayed opening a second location for six months due to the rise in immigration raids across Los Angeles.

Human Rights Watch, the international nongovernmental organization that investigates and chronicles human rights abuses, reports that certain Los Angeles residents have lived in fear since the raids began, with many withdrawing from public life.

Between wildfires, a significant decrease in international tourism, and rising costs, 2025 is one of the most challenging times for Los Angeles restaurants. Several advocacy groups, including Consejo de Federaciones Mexicanas (COFEM), have taken an on-the-ground approach, in addition to carrying out social media trainings, to keep the region’s undocumented workers (and those assumed to be undocumented because of their race) safe from ICE. Eater spoke with advocates, a restaurant owner, and an undocumented individual about their efforts and how they are navigating this tenuous time.

As executive director of COFEM, Francisco J. Moreno-Castillo has one goal in 2025: to improve the educational, health, social, and political conditions for California’s Latino immigrant communities. Now that Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo is the law (at least for the time being), a decision he finds devastating, his organization has even more concerns about Angelenos being targeted simply for stepping out of their homes. COFEM has hosted free webinars to prepare Coachella Valley families to potentially encounter ICE. “Living with that constant fear of being separated from our loved ones is something no family should have to endure,” Moreno-Castillo wrote in a statement to Eater. “Our region’s restaurants, service industries, and small businesses are powered by our labor. We keep our neighborhoods running. When raids target us, it hurts entire communities and destabilizes the economy we all depend on.”

“Living with that constant fear of being separated from our loved ones is something no family should have to endure.”

— Francisco J. Moreno-Castillo

That destabilization has been felt by a popular Los Angeles restaurant owner, who requested to remain anonymous for fear that the immigration agency might target their employees. Their business is in a part of Los Angeles where weekly swap meets, locally known as outdoor weekend markets, have disappeared since the ICE raids began in June. “At the peak of the ICE raids, one of our workers was so afraid to travel home that they stayed in the restaurant. For three or four days, we made sure they had a pillow, sheets, an air mattress, clean underwear, food, all that stuff,” the owner tells Eater. “One day, he wasn’t picking up his phone, so we went out looking. We started to think the worst because people were disappearing, and you couldn’t locate people. So we feared the worst, only to find out he was in the hospital, undergoing some health issues.”

Since June, local media outlet L.A. Taco has published a daily update on ICE activity and people abducted throughout the region. A tight team, including journalist Memo Torres, developed coverage that reached national and international news outlets. On December 8, 2025, Torres reported: “Since [Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo], today we have reached 1,000 confirmed kidnappings, at least 96 confirmed ‘Kavanaugh stops,’ which include 15 U.S. citizens being detained, and at least one of them being shot.” L.A. Taco’s coverage requires relationships with community leaders who are closely connected to activist groups and residents who report ICE activity.

One of those activists is Juan C. (not his real name), who left Oaxaca and immigrated to the United States in 1995. He is one of the many undocumented workers in Southern California who are also servers, bartenders, cooks, expediters, and dishwashers in Los Angeles restaurants. He makes a good living due to his decades of experience. Juan’s experience is quite common in Los Angeles, as one of the many skilled restaurant workers who can earn enough to support his family. In 2025, he coordinates with a local immigration nonprofit to keep an eye out for ICE activity in the Southland. Juan’s life has changed drastically since the raids began: He says he doesn’t go out as much as he used to and is always cautious.

“They’re going for the most vulnerable people,” says Juan. “They’re no longer grabbing people at car washes; they’re going after street vendors. Their tactics have been changing. As an organizer, we started focusing on [protecting] street vendors, people who don’t have a car, or who take the bus.”

Juan prefers to keep the name of his organization under wraps. The coalition also provides know-your-rights training for its team of volunteers, showing them how to safeguard others in a designated community, how to spot ICE agents, and what to do if they witness someone being detained. Juan shared a video with Eater that showed a female street food vendor being taken away by four masked men wearing tactical gear. Before being placed in a vehicle, the woman was surrounded by individuals who work with Juan’s organization; they asked for her name and confronted the ICE agents, asking for identification. “Our best line of defense is community patrolling and people knowing their rights,” says Juan. Juan, his organization, and its volunteers allegedly observed ICE agents utilizing a hidden staging location, then patrolling with two cars in three groups to detail people throughout the Southland.

Since 1986, the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA) has focused its efforts on human and civil rights by protecting immigrants and refugees from exploitation. Its team operates from Westlake near MacArthur Park, and has ramped up its workshops by creating educational videos and working directly with Los Angeles businesses to educate them on protecting their employees’ rights during immigration raids.

As CHIRLA’s director of workers’ rights and labor legal services, Yunuen Trujillo has observed an effect on Los Angeles restaurant workers. “We’ve definitely seen an impact in many industries, including restaurants, since Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo,” says Trujillo.

CHIRLA’s on-the-ground approach has expanded in recent months by conducting workshops in factories, inside hallways, outside workplaces, and in classrooms so that as many workers as possible know their rights. The primary goal is to share that information with others. It had to adjust its strategy, according to CHIRLA’s director of communications, Jorge-Mario Cabrera. Since the September ruling, his organization saw an increase in specific labor violations, which include illegal wage garnishment and the nonpayment of final paychecks, particularly for workers who were detained or deported.

“The harassment of workers, the assumption or the threats of calling ICE, those are calls that we have gotten a lot more often these days, more than ever before,” says Cabrera. “Our colleagues hear that the families of those who have been arrested have to go through a number of hoops to get money that was owed to their loved ones.”

The Trump administration’s emergency request to lift the lower court’s temporary restraining order is just that: temporary. Justice Kavanaugh states at the end of his opinion that essentially pauses the stay as the case winds its way through the lower courts. Justice Kavanaugh writes, “In sum, the Government has demonstrated a fair prospect of success on the merits and has met the other factors for an interim stay pending appeal of the District Court’s injunction.”

When asked about remaining in the U.S., Juan calls California home. “My ancestors are from America. I have Indigenous blood. I speak my native language. My ancestors were born here. All of those who arrived after 1492, everyone who arrived after that, are just visitors. We were here before you. And now you want to kick us out?”

Trump has long opposed the diversity visa lottery. Noem’s announcement is the latest example of using tragedy to advance immigration policy goals.

Unlike federal judges, who have lifetime tenure, immigration judges are employees of the justice department, which runs immigration courts, and can be fired by the attorney general with fewer restraints.","A US army reserve lawyer detailed as a federal immigration judge has been fired barely a month into the job after granting asylum at a high rate out of step with the Trump administration’s mass deportation goals, the Associated Press has learned.

Christopher Day began hearing cases in late October as a temporary judge at the immigration court in Annandale, Virginia. He was fired around 2 December, the National Association of Immigration Judges confirmed.

It is unclear why Day was fired. He did not comment when contacted by the AP, and a justice department spokesperson declined to discuss personnel matters.

But federal data from November shows he ruled on asylum cases in ways at odds with the Trump administration’s stated goals.

Of the 11 cases he concluded in November, he granted asylum or some other type of relief allowing the migrant to remain in the United States a total of six times, according to federal data analyzed by Mobile Pathways, a San Francisco-based non-profit.

Such favorable outcomes for migrants have become increasingly rare as the Trump administration seeks to slash a huge backlog of 3.8m asylum cases by radically overhauling the nation’s 75 immigration courts.

As part of that drive, the Trump administration has fired almost 100 judges viewed as too liberal and over the summer eased rules allowing any attorney, regardless of their legal background, to apply to become what recent recruitment ads refer to as a “Deportation Judge”.

In response, Pete Hegseth, the US defense secretary, in September approved sending up to 600 military lawyers to hear asylum cases. The goal, migrant advocacy groups say, is to redefine a judge’s traditional duties as a fair, independent arbiter of asylum claims into something akin to a rubber stamp in a robe for the White House’s mass deportation goals.

The American Immigration Lawyers Association has decried the influx of military officers lacking expertise in immigration law, likening them to cardiologists attempting to do a hip replacement. But Pentagon and White House officials have defended the move.

So far, only 30 members of the military have been detailed to the immigration courts and for the most part appear to have lived up to the administration’s expectations. Nine out of every 10 migrants whose asylum cases were heard by such judges in November were either ordered removed from the US or requested to leave the country voluntarily, according to federal data. Overall, the military judges ordered removal 78% of the time compared with 63% for all other judges.

But those like Day, whose rulings countered that trend, are especially vulnerable if it is determined they violated their military duties, said Dana Leigh Marks, a retired immigration judge.

“It is hard to imagine someone being fired so quickly, after five weeks on the bench, unless it was for ideological reasons,” said Marks, the former head of the National Association of Immigration Judges. “It’s especially unfair to military judges because they don’t have the same civil service protections and could face severe consequences for failing in their assignment.”

The Uniform Command of Military Justice, which governs service members, forbids senior military leaders from interfering or retaliating against military attorneys for their actions in a military tribunal. Army regulations also require judge advocate general attorneys to proceed with candor and honesty much like expectations of all licensed lawyers.

But whether those standards apply to military lawyers working outside the normal confines of a military tribunal is untested.

Brenner Fissell, a Villanova University law professor, said that there were a number of personnel actions that can be taken – letters of counseling or reprimand – that, even if found to be baseless later, would affect one’s potential for promotion and affect their discharge. Appealing such decisions, he said, was a byzantine process that can take years and require hiring a costly lawyer.

A graduate of American University law school, Day has held multiple jobs in the federal government over the past two decades while simultaneously serving as a lieutenant colonel in the US army reserve’s judge advocate general’s corps.

Zheng and his six-year-old son Yuanxin were both deported to China this week, the New York Times first reported.
Since their arrest on Nov. 26, Zheng had been held at the Orange County Jail upstate, where ICE has a contract with the county to hold detained immigrants.
His son was in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which takes charge from ICE for unaccompanied children.
“And when we found out he’s been separated from his son, another word came to mind: “Wait.","A Chinese father and son who were arrested by ICE and separated inside 26 Federal Plaza in Lower Manhattan last month have been reunited — and then swiftly deported to China.

Zheng and his six-year-old son Yuanxin were both deported to China this week, the New York Times first reported. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, confirmed the deportation to the Times saying, “We are happy to report we were able to remove the family back to their home country.”

THE CITY first reported on the separation of Zheng and his six-year-old son Yuanxin earlier this month, which quickly drew nationwide attention and widespread condemnation from elected officials, including multiple members of Congress and Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.

Hundreds of parents and kids rallied last week near PS 166 in Astoria, the school where Yuanxin had been enrolled, calling for the family’s reunification and release.

Since their arrest on Nov. 26, Zheng had been held at the Orange County Jail upstate, where ICE has a contract with the county to hold detained immigrants. His son was in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which takes charge from ICE for unaccompanied children.

Jennie Spector, a volunteer who was in touch with Zheng over the phone and in person during his confinement, said Zheng was eventually able to speak with his son twice over the phone while they were separated, though he wasn’t told of his exact whereabouts.

On Wednesday, ICE’s detainee locator showed Zheng had been moved from Orange County Jail, but did not list a new location. By Thursday Zheng was no longer in ICE’s system, indicating he was no longer in their custody.

“This was a family who wanted to contribute to their community, a child who was bright and wanted to get a good education, a father who wanted the best for his child and wanted to work hard,” Spector said. “They were denied that opportunity because of our broken and punitive immigration system, a system that is now set up to cause as much harm as possible.”

The Department of Homeland Security initially explained the family’s separation saying Zheng had refused to board a plane and “was acting so disruptive and aggressive that he endangered the child’s wellbeing.”

Citing internal DHS records, the New York Times later reported Zheng hit his head against a wall and said he wanted to die during his arrest at 26 Federal Plaza.

Yuanxin is one of a growing number of children arrested and detained by ICE, according to data obtained by the Deportation Data Project through a Freedom of Information Act request. One hundred and fifty one children under the age of 18 have been arrested between January and October, with a steep increase beginning in May.

Zheng and his son first entered the United States seeking asylum this spring and had twice before spent time at a family ICE detention center in Texas before. They had only been free for about a month on parole at the time of their November arrest.

“The first time he was in detention, he still had hope,” said a friend of Zheng’s, also from China, who met him while the two lived at a shelter in Long Island City. “But the second time, much different.”

The friend, who asked not to be named fearing retaliation, has been in touch with Zheng’s wife since his first arrest in August. Over the last few months, much of their conversations have revolved around panicked questions: What to do, how to get a lawyer, how to present Zheng’s case to the court.

“Just one word came to mind when he was arrested the second time: disaster,” he told THE CITY in Cantonese. “And when we found out he’s been separated from his son, another word came to mind: “Wait. There’s nothing else we could do about it.”

Zheng’s wife had learned about her husband’s deportation from a lawyer in New York, the friend said. He recalled her reaction in a recent conversation upon hearing about his husband’s impending return.

“She sounded hopeless — unsure of what to do next,” he described. “But she also sounded very clear-eyed about this. She’s just worried about what life would look like in the future. What her husband would do, how to make a living, how to support her husband when he returns, how to deal with his despair.”",https://www.thecity.nyc/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/chinese_seperation_family-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 21:57:58.586755

On Thursday, in a newly created thread, the author of the now-deleted Reddit post shared two screenshots of Provisions’ internal employee group chat.
They capture a message sent by Blaine, the Marché CEO, to staff members on Wednesday addressing “Reddit chatter” about Provisions and ICE agents.","An anonymous user claimed in a post to Eugene’s Reddit forum on Wednesday, Dec. 17, that they saw Immigration & Customs Enforcement agents drinking coffee inside Provisions Market Hall the day before.

The post generated nearly 1,000 reactions and hundreds of comments. Dozens of users criticized the grocery store and restaurant inside Eugene’s Fifth Street Public Market for serving the alleged agents, some pledging to no longer shop and eat there. Others said the claims were inaccurate or incomplete, accusing users of rushing to cancel the business.

ICE, one of several agencies housed under the Department of Homeland Security, has an office in downtown Eugene’s federal building on Seventh Avenue, along with other federal agencies like the Internal Revenue Service and the FBI. It is a 4-minute walk from Provisions, which appears to be the closest coffee shop to the building.

But the anonymous user — who goes by username “elderberry-queen” — later told Lookout Eugene-Springfield that the agents they witnessed were affiliated with DHS, not ICE specifically.

When Lookout called Eugene’s ICE office for comment, the person who picked up the phone denied that ICE agents had been at Provisions.

“I have very few officers, and I know exactly what they were doing all week,” said the official, who declined to state their name. “Whoever it was, it wasn’t ICE.”

The ICE official pointed to other agencies housed under DHS, adding: “Believe you me, in this climate, ICE isn’t going out with anything on our shirts. It ain’t happening.”

The Federal Protective Service, federal police that protect government buildings and employees, is one of such agencies housed under DHS. FPS officers are regularly seen patrolling the Seventh Avenue federal building; they detained one anti-ICE protester outside the building in August, two in September and one, briefly, in October.

Jessica MacMurray Blaine, the CEO and creative director of the Marché Restaurant Group, which owns Provisions’ three locations, confirmed to Lookout that a group of DHS agents buy coffee at Fifth Street Market Provisions regularly.

On Tuesday, between four and seven uniformed agents grabbed coffee at the location, she said, adding that she personally wasn’t there. Their uniforms said “Homeland Security” and “law enforcement,” Blaine said. When showed a photo of FPS officer uniforms to compare to the ones she has seen before, she said the uniforms match “more or less.”

“There wasn’t anything that said anything about ICE specifically,” Blaine said.

In the original Wednesday Reddit post, the anonymous poster said that after seeing the agents inside Provisions, they called the business and spoke with an employee to see if they were “OK with hosting ICE.”

The employee allegedly responded that the agents were “not the ones taking people off the streets,” per the post.

The anonymous poster said they then asked the employee to post a sign welcoming immigrants outside Provisions. The staffer said immigrants are welcome, but refused to post a sign, the anonymous poster said, which prompted their criticism of the business on Reddit.

Blaine confirmed the conversation took place. The employee didn’t have permission to hang the poster without her approval, she said, and restaurant leadership is concerned such posters could make the business and its staff a target for law enforcement.

“We’re talking with our neighbors and our landlord and our team about what is the right message that represents where our boundaries are and how we can provide a safe space for our crew and for our guests,” Blaine said.

Provisions also responded to the situation in a statement on the restaurant’s website.

“We welcome immigrants to our businesses — as guests and as employees. Full stop,” Provisions’ statement reads. “We are committed to providing a safe space for them, and find the current wave of anti-immigrant action abhorrent.”

Reddit moderators took down the original Reddit thread sometime between Wednesday night and Thursday morning, though it has since been reposted on other social media platforms.

One moderator said they removed the post because Provisions employees reached out with complaints of death threats. Blaine declined to provide specifics to Lookout, but said the business has received “profane and abusive emails and phone calls” that have not been reported to the police.

Another moderator said they removed the post because it was “unsourced and potentially misinformation.”

“The screenshots don’t demonstrate that it’s even ICE,” one moderator wrote. “Eugene has a DHS branch here, with FEMA, TSA, and other non-ICE agents working out of it.”

Commenters responded to both explanations with frustration, some calling for the moderators’ resignation.

On Thursday, in a newly created thread, the author of the now-deleted Reddit post shared two screenshots of Provisions’ internal employee group chat. They capture a message sent by Blaine, the Marché CEO, to staff members on Wednesday addressing “Reddit chatter” about Provisions and ICE agents.

Blaine confirmed the screenshots’ authenticity.

She wrote in the message to staff that a group of DHS personnel come into Provisions for coffee, adding that they are “well-behaved guests” and their actions have never been disruptive. Provisions leadership is “reaching out to [the DHS personnel] to talk about their impact on other guests,” Blaine wrote.

Blaine told Lookout on Thursday that she didn’t have specifics to share about that communication, as the business doesn’t yet have a form of “direct contact” with the department.

Blaine also said in her message to staff that management has measures in place to protect employees from ICE action, and the business will refuse service to disruptive guests.

“We’re a woman-owned, independent small business that supports progressive causes,” Blaine told Lookout. “We’re horrified by some of the behavior of ICE in this country writ large, but it’s difficult to know how to speak to it, and how to protect your crew without creating more targeting.”",https://lookouteugene-springfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251218Lookout_ProvisionsIW_06-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 21:58:04.821837

The website also offers a ""Corporate Gold Card,"" allowing companies to pay $2 million to secure a ""Gold Card"" for an employee, and a ""Platinum Card,"" which offers special tax benefits and may eventually be offered for $5 million.
Spending by the ""Gold Card"" wealthy is also expected to help real estate, the service economy and other industries.
Using the EB-1 and EB-2 programs for the ""Gold Card"" program has created other potential hurdles.
The unanswered questions and legal risks surrounding the ""Gold Card"" have caused potential buyers to hold off on applying, attorneys say.","President Donald Trump's new ""Gold Card"" visa program uses a novel definition of wealth as a job skill to allow the overseas wealthy to bypass immigration rules and secure citizenship, according to immigration attorneys.

Trump last week announced the start of applications for the ""Trump Gold Card,"" a new investment visa for foreign nationals. In exchange for $1 million and a $15,000 processing fee, ""Gold Card"" applicants will get full-time residency in the U.S. in ""record time,"" according to the program's website. The website also offers a ""Corporate Gold Card,"" allowing companies to pay $2 million to secure a ""Gold Card"" for an employee, and a ""Platinum Card,"" which offers special tax benefits and may eventually be offered for $5 million.

Only Congress can set immigration policy, meaning the president doesn't have the power to create or destroy a visa program. So to create the ""Gold Card,"" Trump is effectively adding a new fee model to two existing programs – known as EB-1 and EB-2 – experts explained to CNBC.

White House officials say that the $1 million payment is proof that ""Gold Card"" holders are successful business people who meet the requirements for exceptional abilities. Anyone with $1 million to spend on a visa is likely to be a productive addition to the American economy and society, they say. Entrepreneurs who started companies overseas can come to the U.S. to expand or start new ventures, creating more jobs. Spending by the ""Gold Card"" wealthy is also expected to help real estate, the service economy and other industries.

""Why shouldn't we expedite the people who are willing to step up, to give the United States $1 million,"" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC last week. ""Let's bring in the top of the top, the best. Why should we take people who are below average?""

Immigration attorneys, however, say that replacing highly skilled or celebrated talents with foreign nationals whose sole qualification is writing a $1 million check distorts the intent of the EB-1 and EB-2 programs. Not everyone with $1 million payment is a high-achieving businessperson or entrepreneur, they say. Some may have borrowed the money from friends, family or a lender. Others may have inherited their fortunes but have scant job skills.

""Having $1 million has nothing to do with your value as a person of extraordinary ability,"" said Emily Neumann, an immigration attorney with Reddy Neumann Brown PC. ""It doesn't mean you are able to provide value to the United States of America. These categories were supposed to be reserved for people who can foster innovation and contribute to the economy and create jobs. There is no requirement that ""Gold Card"" holders have a track record of any of those things, just because they happen to have $1 million.""

While ""Gold Card"" applicants can't legally skip the current waiting line for EB-1 and EB-2 holders, some attorneys fear the White House will give ""Gold Card"" applicants priority. Neumann said she has an Indian client who's a leading expert in artificial intelligence and machine learning and is working on AI applications for doctors to better diagnose patients. He's approved for the EB-1 but is still waiting on a green card, which could take years.

""They're using up a limited number of green cards meant for people who have done wonderful things,"" she said. ""It's a very different standard.""

Using the EB-1 and EB-2 programs for the ""Gold Card"" program has created other potential hurdles. While Trump has said he would sell ""millions"" of ""Gold Cards,"" and Lutnick said sales could raise $1 trillion in revenue, the two programs are capped at around 28,000 a year. Individual countries are capped at 7% of the total, which is why the the waiting list for E-1 and E-2 applications from India and China already extends for several years.

Immigration attorneys say India and China would be largest sources of demand for ""Gold Cards."" Yet because of the waiting lists, few are likely to apply.

""If 'Gold Card' holders will be allowed to jump the queue, there will likely be lawsuits from those currently on the wait list,"" said Reaz Jafri, an immigration attorney with the international law firm Withers. ""And if not, who will want to pay the $1 million and then wait for three years?""

The unanswered questions and legal risks surrounding the ""Gold Card"" have caused potential buyers to hold off on applying, attorneys say. Dominic Volek, group head of private clients at Henley & Partners, said a number of his clients in Taiwan, Vietnam and Singapore are interested in the ""Gold Card"" but are waiting for proof that the program works.

Some are also worried about paying the $1 million and then having their visas overturned by a court or a future Democratic administration.

""They want to see the dust settle and see if there are any major legal challenges,"" Volek said.

Another concern is the structure of the fee. While some national investment visas are more expensive – such as Singapore's at nearly $8 million or New Zealand's at nearly $3 million – they're structured as investments rather than non-refundable payments. Without an explicit guarantee of a green card, the overseas wealthy are reluctant to pay the $1 million.

""It's not clear if you make the payment once it's approved or you provide the payment as evidence, or if it's kept in escrow during the process,"" Jafri said. ""They haven't addressed so many basic questions.""

Proof of funds is proving to be another hurdle for the overseas wealthy. In order to screen for money laundering or criminal activity, the U.S. government typically requires proof that the $1 million fee didn't come from illegal or illicit sources. Many potential applicants from Asia, Africa and the Middle East are already balking at the demands, since financial documentation is not as thorough.

""The biggest sticking point for a lot of clients is being able to document the source of money,"" Jafri said. ""In certain parts of the world it's not so easy to document.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108207911-1759674894924-gettyimages-2238856414-zawrzel-donaldtr251004_nptzU.jpeg?v=1759674915&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-12-19 21:58:19.769447

WASHINGTON –– The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) vehemently condemns Fairfax County’s sanctuary policies after Marvin Fernando Morales-Ortez, a criminal illegal alien from El Salvador, brutally murdered a resident inside his home in Reston, Virginia, just ONE DAY after sanctuary politicians REFUSED to honor the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrest detainer and RELEASED him from jail.

Following his arrest for assault and brandishing a firearm, ICE immediately lodged an arrest detainer on September 14, 2025. Fairfax sanctuary politicians REFUSED to honor it and instead RELEASED this criminal illegal alien back into Virginia neighborhoods.

This serial criminal has prior arrests for aggravated assault of a police officer, larceny, and disorderly conduct.

He illegally entered the United States September 18, 2016, with his mother near Hidalgo, Texas. Morales-Ortez was released into the country by the Obama administration. In 2022, the Biden administration dismissed his immigration proceedings and marked him as a non-enforcement priority.

On December 17, 2025, police responded to a residence in Reston, Virginia after Morales-Ortez allegedly shot and killed a man inside. According to local reports, he fled the scene and caused a several hours-long manhunt placing nearby schools into lockdown. Morales-Ortez was eventually apprehended and charged with second-degree murder and firearms charges.

“There is blood on the hands of Fairfax County politicians for pushing policies that released this illegal alien from jail and onto the streets of Virginia. Fairfax County refused to honor ICE’s detainer and release him into their custody. Just hours after being released from jail, he committed murder in cold blood. Sanctuary policies have deadly consequences. We pray for the victim and his family,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.

Dugan then returned to her courtroom and told Flores-Ruiz's lawyer she would find a new date for his hearing.
Flores-Ruiz and his lawyer went through the door and an agent followed and then chased the defendant, arresting him outside the courthouse.
Prosecutors said during the case that Dugan had intended for Flores-Ruiz to escape the agents by going down the stairwell—even though he did the opposite.
Norm Eisen, executive chair of Democracy Defenders Fund, also emphasized that the case is ""far from over.""","The case of Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan ""is a long way from over"" said a lawyer for the judge after a jury found her guilty late Thursday of the felony charge of obstructing immigration agents who showed up at her courtroom in April with the aim of arresting an immigrant who was appearing before Dugan.

The jury deliberated for six hours before finding Dugan, a Milwaukee County circuit court judge, guilty of obstructing an official proceeding. The jurors acquitted her of a misdemeanor charge of concealing a person from arrest—a result her lawyer, Steve Biskupic, said he would question when he seeks to have the conviction thrown out by a court.

""While we are disappointed in today's outcome, the failure of the prosecution to secure convictions on both counts demonstrates the opportunity we have to clear Judge Dugan's name and show she did nothing wrong in this matter,"" said Dugan's legal team.

The Trump administration seized on the case in April after Dugan responded to FBI and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents' presence in the courthouse by telling the defendant, Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, to go out a back door of her courtroom after she had sent the agents to another part of the building.

FBI Director Kash Patel posted a photo of Dugan in handcuffs on social media in April, and Attorney General Pam Bondi attacked the judge in television appearances, accusing her of “protecting a criminal defendant over victims of crime.”

The case began at Milwaukee County Courthouse in April, when Dugan was hearing a number of misdemeanor cases in one day. Flores-Ruiz, who had been deported in 2013 and had reentered the US without authorization, was facing battery charges.

Emails presented in Dugan's case this week showed she had tried to push Milwaukee County Chief Judge Carl Ashley to make an official policy regarding how judges should handle the arrival of federal agents at a time when President Donald Trump's rapid escalation of his mass deportation campaign was sending ICE officers to courthouses across the country. Courts had previously been treated as protected areas where immigration enforcement could not take place.

""We reject a system that uses prosecution and brute force to advance a far-right, anti-immigrant agenda and criminalizes those who stand up against this assault on our human and constitutional rights.""

Without official guidelines in place, the court clerk who notified Dugan of the ICE agents' presence, Alan Freed, testified that he had been ""upset and a little bit outraged"" that the officers were there.

Dugan confronted the agents, who were sitting in the hallway and waiting to arrest Flores-Ruiz, and told them to go down the hall to Ashley's office.

An FBI special agent testified that Dugan ""seemed to be angry"" when she confronted the officers.

Dugan then returned to her courtroom and told Flores-Ruiz's lawyer she would find a new date for his hearing. She spoke privately to a court reporter saying Flores-Ruiz could leave the room through a side door that was not open to the public.

“I’ll get the heat,"" Dugan said.

The side door led to a stairwell and also to another door that opened into a public hallway where the federal agents were. Flores-Ruiz and his lawyer went through the door and an agent followed and then chased the defendant, arresting him outside the courthouse. Flores-Ruiz was deported last month.

Prosecutors said during the case that Dugan had intended for Flores-Ruiz to escape the agents by going down the stairwell—even though he did the opposite.

An attorney on Dugan's legal team said during closing arguments that she ""never acted corruptly in doing her job as a judge in the middle of a stressful, new, and confusing situation.""

Dugan could serve up to five years in prison and will likely be barred from serving as a judge, as the Wisconsin Constitution prohibits people convicted of felonies from holding public office.

Norm Eisen, executive chair of Democracy Defenders Fund, also emphasized that the case is ""far from over.""

""Substantial legal and constitutional issues remain unresolved, and they are exactly the kinds of questions appellate courts are meant to address. Higher courts will have the opportunity to determine whether this prosecution crossed the lines that protect the judiciary from executive overreach,"" said Eisen.

Milwaukee-based advocacy group Voces de la Frontera emphasized that Dugan's case ""is not about one judge,"" but rather ""the normalization of ICE operating in courthouses and the expansion of immigration enforcement into spaces meant to guarantee fairness, safety, and access to justice.""

""By validating this prosecution, the verdict blurs the line between the courts and executive enforcement power, signaling that the law will be enforced aggressively against immigrants and those who dare to defend their rights, while the privileged and powerful continue to evade accountability,"" said the group, calling Dugan's case ""a political prosecution that criminalized the exercise of judicial independence and the defense of due process.""

Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Vocesde la Frontera, said the verdict ""tells judges, court staff, and our communities that defending due process comes with consequences.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=62609675&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C413%2C0%2C413,N,,2025-12-19 21:57:44.314127

The eviction was carried out at the request of the Barcelona City Council, and the Administrative-Contentious Court No.
A total of 15 people were arrested under the Immigration Law during the operation carried out to evict the migrants at B9.
At its peak, B9 was host to between 400 and 500 migrants.
“Human rights law is clear: Evicting a person in the middle of the winter into homelessness is a serious violation of the right to adequate housing and other human rights.","UN HUMAN RIGHTS experts have publicly condemned a series of evictions of more than 400 migrants from an informal settlement in Badalona, Catalonia, which took place on Wednesday, December 17. The settlement, a building known as Badalona 9, or B9, was the largest informal migrant settlement in the community of Catalonia and its migrants were evicted by the Mossos d’Esquadra, or Catalan police. The building, a former secondary school, will be demolished, as it is considered a source of “conflict and crime.”

Forced daylight eviction of more than 400 migrants

Shortly before 7:00am on the morning of December 17, a large number of police vans arrived at B9 and its surroundings, though they waited until daylight to begin the eviction, as the court order specified to wait until daylight hours. The eviction was carried out at the request of the Barcelona City Council, and the Administrative-Contentious Court No. 11 of Barcelona had ruled in favour of it on December 4. A total of 15 people were arrested under the Immigration Law during the operation carried out to evict the migrants at B9.

At its peak, B9 was host to between 400 and 500 migrants. Of these, only around 30 were considered very vulnerable and allowed to receive short-term emergency housing. Among the evictees, of whom the majority were from West and sub-Sahara African countries, were women, elderly people, and people with medical needs.

Eviction during the middle of winter ‘a violation,’ ‘cruel,’ and ‘inhuman’

“The eviction is pushing hundreds of vulnerable individuals into homelessness in the middle of winter, without any adequate alternative housing offered by municipal authorities,” the experts said of the move. They stated that they regretted that Spain had proceeded with the large-scale eviction, despite appeals to postpone the move until the affected residents could be re-housed.

“With no alternative housing provided, the vast majority of those evicted has no choice but to seek again refuge in other informal settlements or to camp in the open,” the experts continued. “Human rights law is clear: Evicting a person in the middle of the winter into homelessness is a serious violation of the right to adequate housing and other human rights. Repeatedly evicting persons without providing any housing alternatives may amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, strictly prohibited by international human rights law.”

Human rights experts lash out at choice to evict, citing ‘structural failure’

The experts called the cycle of eviction and homelessness in Spain a “structural failure” and claimed that it needed an “urgent, rights-based response, certainly not more evictions.” They also stressed that the rhetoric surrounding the B9 migrants calling the criminals or a threat to Barcelona security was “unacceptable, discriminatory, and deeply harmful.”

“Migrants face compounded challenges when trying to access adequate housing,” said the experts at the UN. “Public authorities must strive to counter discrimination, not fuel it.”

Spain’s delicate migrant crisis, a topic of fierce debate

Spain’s migrant crisis has long been a point of contention and a sensitive topic of debate. In November, the European Commission designated several countries as being “under migratory pressure,” one of which being Spain. It, along with Italy, Greece, and Cyprus, faced a “disproportionate level” of migrants in 2024. Additionally, Eurostat and Bank of Spain figures showed that Spain welcomed around 24 immigrants per 1,000 residents in 2023, well above fellow migrant hotspot European countries France or Italy.

Weeks later, four detainees escaped from the facility as concerns emerged about improper conditions.

New Jersey Democrats have long been opposed to the facility, and are ramping up their criticism in light of Brutus’ death.

“This tragedy is not an isolated incident, and we have seen neglect, abuse, and cruelty from this administration as they strip people of the rights this country affords everyone, including those in detention,” McIver said in a statement. “Delaney Hall must be closed immediately and a full, independent, investigation needs to take place.”

Sen. Cory Booker echoed McIver’s sentiment to close Delaney Hall “so that this stain can be removed from our community of Newark.”

When reached for comment on New Jersey Democrats’ calls to shut the facility, GEO Group referred POLITICO to ICE’s previous statement on Brutus’ death. The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

ICE said that Brutus entered the country in 2023. He was arrested three times for criminal trespassing by the Elizabeth Police Department between July and October 2024 and twice this past November, once for criminal trespassing and the other for criminal mischief, according to the agency.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F90%2Fd6%2Fd2b2ae824a269cbe3efb05a76f49%2Fmigrant-detention-center-protest-62399.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 19:57:03.492129

Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan’s conviction marks a high-profile victory for the Department of Justice (DOJ) and President Donald Trump’s aggressive immigration crackdown.

The judge’s arrest in April drew protests in Milwaukee and sharp criticism of the Trump administration’s ongoing tactic of arresting people in courthouses while they are appearing for immigration hearings.

Dugan, a judge for nine years, was accused of intentionally misdirecting federal agents away from a Mexican immigrant who was appearing in state court at the time. The agents were seeking to arrest the man outside her courtroom.

Alongside the felony obstruction charge, Dugan was charged with a misdemeanor count of concealing an individual to prevent his arrest or discovery.

The jury acquitted her of the misdemeanor but found her guilty of the felony. She now faces up to five years in prison. However, given the circumstances and her lack of a criminal record, it’s unlikely she will receive a maximum penalty if she’s sentenced.

A sentencing hearing has yet to be scheduled.

Dugan’s case sets a precedent: It marks the first time a state judge has gone to trial and been convicted on charges of obstructing immigration agents.

Dugan’s lawyer, former U.S. Attorney Steve Biskupic, said the conviction was disappointing but the case was “a long way from over.”

Biskupic said that the jury’s split verdict was puzzling since Dugan’s mental state, actions and other circumstances were virtually the same for both counts. He added that he would ask the presiding judge to set aside the felony conviction based on the split.

Interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin Brad Schimel, the state’s former attorney general who led an unsuccessful bid for Wisconsin Supreme Court earlier this year, headed the DOJ’s case against Dugan.

“We weren’t trying to make an example out of anyone,” Schimel said after the jury issued its verdict. “This was necessary to hold Judge Dugan accountable because of the actions she took.”

Despite Schimel’s comments, Trump’s political appointees hailed Dugan’s conviction as an example.

“NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW,” Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on social media Friday. “No one can obstruct law enforcement as they carry out their basic duties. This Department of Justice will not waver as our agents and law enforcement partners continue to make America Safe Again.”

Reacting to her conviction, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche claimed on social media that Dugan “betrayed her oath and the people she served.”

“Today, a federal jury of her peers found her guilty and sent a clear message: the American people respect law and order. Nobody is above the law. This Department will not tolerate obstruction, will enforce federal immigration law, and will hold criminals to account – even those who wear robes,” Blanche wrote.

Before trial, Dugan’s team unsuccessfully argued that, as a judge, she was immune from prosecution. They also asserted that the Trump administration was trying to make an example out of Dugan as part of its unrelenting attack on federal and state courts.

DOJ officials have not shied away from publicly weighing in on Dugan’s case — even before it had begun.

The day of Dugan’s arrest, Bondi called some judges “deranged” and promised to arrest those who help people who are in the country illegally.

“You cannot obstruct a criminal case. And really, shame on her,” Bondi said of Dugan’s actions.

What did the June travel ban do?
What changes have been made in the expanded travel ban?
The biggest change in the travel ban is an expansion of which countries are subject to restrictions.
Because the travel ban restricts entry, there are no immediate impacts on people who are currently present in the United States.","In June, President Trump built on the legacy of his first term by implementing a new travel ban under Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to “suspend the entry” of nationals from 19 countries. The initial action in June called for federal officials to suggest additional countries to ban.

That expansion has now come. On December 16, President Trump issued a newly enlarged travel ban, restricting the entry of nationals of 20 new countries (as well as the Palestinian Authority) and cutting back on exceptions included in the prior ban.

With this new ban in place, roughly 1 in 5 people seeking to immigrate to the United States legally are now barred from doing so, and hundreds of thousands more seeking nonimmigrant visas to visit or reside temporarily will now be unable to do so.

What did the June travel ban do?

The June travel ban imposed two categories of visa restrictions on 19 countries in total. 12 countries (Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen) were subjected to a ban on all non-immigrant and immigrant visas. 7 countries (Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela) were subject to a ban on all immigrant visas and a slightly more limited ban on tourist, student, and exchange visitor visas.

Like the travel bans in Trump’s first term, there were exceptions. The June ban did not apply to, among others, anyone with a current green card or a current valid visa; athletes, coaches, and their families attending the World Cup, Olympics, or other sporting events, people who are immediate relatives of a U.S. citizen (spouses, children under the age of 21, and parents); children adopted abroad; and Afghans seeking Special Immigrant Visas for their work helping U.S. armed forces

Although the Trump administration stopped publishing monthly data on visa issuance before the June travel ban went into effect, data from 2024 showed that 25,086 immigrant visas and 136,901 nonimmigrant visas were issued to nationals of the 19 banned countries, with the highest numbers going to Venezuelans, Iranians, and Cubans. However, because many immigrant visas go to immediate relatives of U.S. citizens, the impact was likely limited by the exception.

What changes have been made in the expanded travel ban?

The biggest change in the travel ban is an expansion of which countries are subject to restrictions. Under the new ban, the following seven countries are now subject to a total ban on immigrant and non-immigrant visas:

Burkina Faso

Laos

Mali

Niger

Sierra Leone

South Sudan

Syria

Additionally, a total of 19 countries are now banned from all immigrant visas and all tourist, student, and exchange visitor visas (B-1, B-2, B-1/B-2, F, M, and J visas):

Angola

Antigua and Barbuda

Benin

Burundi

Cote d’Ivoire

Cuba

Dominica

Gabon

The Gambia

Malawi

Mauritania

Nigeria

Senegal

Tanzania

Togo

Tonga

Venezuela

Zambia

Zimbabwe.

Only one country, Turkmenistan, saw a positive change; it will now be subject only to a ban on immigrant visas, but will not be banned from nonimmigrant visas.

In addition, the Trump administration moved to eliminate multiple exceptions included in the June ban. Specifically, the following three categories of people are no longer eligible for visas if they come from one of the 39 countries that are now subject to bans:

Immediate relatives of U.S citizens.

Children adopted abroad.

Afghans seeking Special Immigrant Visas for their work assisting U.S. armed forces.

The Trump administration gave no explanation at all for its decision to bar international adoptions for nationals of these 29 countries. In support of banning U.S. citizens from obtaining visas for their children, spouses, and parents, President Trump declared that, “Familial ties can serve … as unique vectors for fraudulent, criminal, or even terrorist activity through means such as the domestic or international financing of such activity,” and therefore family of U.S. citizens should not be exempted from broad visa bans. As a result, under the new ban, U.S. citizens seeking to bring over their spouses and children from travel banned countries will be unable to do so, unless they manage to obtain an individual national interest waiver.

The country most heavily impacted by the new restrictions is Nigeria. Over the last decade (excluding the COVID years of 2020 and 2021), Nigerians received an average of 128,000 immigrant and nonimmigrant visas on an annual basis. Nearly all of these visas will now be restricted, blocking legal immigration from the most populous country in Africa.

In addition, two of the newly banned countries, Senegal and Cote d’Ivoire, qualified for the World Cup in 2026, which will mostly be held in the United States. Under the new travel ban, any fans of those countries who don’t have valid visas as of January 1, 2026 will be barred from getting them and unable to attend the games in person.

What is the reasoning behind the ban?

As with the June travel bans, Trump claims that the bans are justified by national security concerns about vetting, as well as the argument that many of these countries have high visa overstay rates. Yet as before, the Trump administration has never made a clear connection between a total ban on visas, even for small children, and national security. And as with the June travel ban, no explanation is provided as to why high nonimmigrant visa overstay rates justify barring immigrant visas, nor why other countries with similarly high nonimmigrant visa overstay rates were not banned.

For example, the new ban says that nationals of the small Pacific island nation of Tonga should be banned from immigrating to the United States because 6.5% of its nationals overstayed tourist visas (152 suspected overstays out of 2,358 expected departures) and 14.4% of its nationals overstayed student or exchange visitor visas (13 suspected overstays out of 90 expected departures). Yet those rates are broadly comparable to multiple other countries which were not subject to restrictions, including Armenia, which has a 6.3% tourist visa overstay rate, or Ethiopia, which has an 8.1 tourist visa overstay rate and a 14.0% student and exchange visitor visa overstay rate.

Allegations of racism against African and Muslim immigrants continue to linger over the rationales offered in the latest ban, which came just days after President Trump declared that Somalians were “garbage” and that he wanted to ban all immigration from “third world countries.” Following the ban being issued, the Department of Homeland Security even described its restrictions on legal immigration as “slamming the door shut on the foreign invaders who have undermined our national security.” This rhetoric may provide opportunities for challengers seeking to block the bans in court.

Will the ban impact people who are already inside the United States?

Because the travel ban restricts entry, there are no immediate impacts on people who are currently present in the United States. However, in late November, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services put in place a blanket pause on the adjudication of all immigration benefits for nationals subject to the June travel ban. This suspension applies to all benefits, including visa petitions, green card applications, and even citizenship oath ceremonies.

This suspension has now been extended to nationals of the 20 newly-banned countries. As a result, this means that there are now 39 countries whose nationals are currently unable to obtain immigration status and come here from abroad, or obtain or change their immigration status from within the U.S.

Hundreds of thousands of people who would otherwise qualify to obtain, maintain, or change their immigration status under current immigration law are now in limbo — as are their U.S. citizen family members or employers who may seek to sponsor them.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/immigration-impact-trump-expands-travel-ban.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 19:57:11.788303

This was not a neutral enforcement of the law. It was a political prosecution that criminalized the exercise of judicial independence and the defense of due process. The verdict signals that judges and court officials can be punished for questioning or limiting immigration enforcement, even when acting to preserve the integrity of the court and the rights of people before it.

This case is not about one judge. It is about the normalization of ICE operating in courthouses and the expansion of immigration enforcement into spaces meant to guarantee fairness, safety, and access to justice. By validating this prosecution, the verdict blurs the line between the courts and executive enforcement power, signaling that the law will be enforced aggressively against immigrants and those who dare to defend their rights, while the privileged and powerful continue to evade accountability.

Across the country, ICE has carried out warrantless arrests, forcibly separated families, racially profiled, and detained and deported people who are actively pursuing asylum or lawful status. This verdict risks further legitimizing those practices within our legal system.

When people fear arrest for showing up to court, the justice system fails. Families are driven into the shadows, trust collapses, and entire communities suffer.

In 2023, 82.5% of immigrants admitted in 2018 were residing in their intended province or territories, while 17.5% had changed jurisdiction.","Immigrant settlement patterns in Canada are dynamic, often involving residential changes within the country, especially during the first few years after admission.

According to the 2021 Census, recent immigrants admitted since 2016 were about four times more likely to have moved to another province or territory in the previous year than established immigrants (before 2016) and about three times more likely than the Canadian-born population.

The retention rate, which is the share of immigrants who reside in their intended destination one or five years after their admission in Canada, provides a picture of their residential choices. Net internal migration of immigrants is the difference between the number of in-migrants and out-migrants for a given geographical area. These measures can help in planning infrastructures and services for a geographical area in various fields such as housing, labour market, education and access to social and public services.

Using data from the Longitudinal Immigration Database, this release presents the most recent insights in the retention rates and net internal migration of immigrants.

Increasing proportion of immigrants change province or territory during their first year in Canada, reflecting higher interprovincial migration in 2023, after the COVID-19 pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted daily life, in many ways, including interprovincial migration. The numbers of Canadians who moved to another province or territory significantly increased in the years following the start of the pandemic in 2020, then began to decline once again in 2023, while remaining higher than the levels observed before the pandemic. The likelihood of immigrants residing in their intended province or territory one year after admission also fluctuated during this period. In 2023, 86.5% of immigrants admitted in 2022 were still living in their province or territory of admission, down from 89.9% among immigrants admitted in 2021 and lower than those admitted in 2020 (88.4%) and 2019 (88.1%).

Among immigrants admitted in 2022, those who planned to settle in Quebec (91.5%), Ontario (91.3%), British Columbia (88.5%) and Alberta (87.3%) were the most likely to live in the same province one year later. The one-year retention rates in these provinces were lower among immigrants admitted in 2022 than among those admitted in 2021, reversing the previous increase for immigrants admitted in 2021 compared with those admitted in 2020.

The one-year retention rates of immigrants admitted in 2022 were the lowest in the Atlantic provinces, ranging from 46.7% to 64.3%. However, these rates increased compared to those of immigrants admitted in the Atlantic provinces in 2021. The growth was most pronounced in Newfoundland and Labrador (+7.0 percentage points to 59.7%) and Prince Edward Island (+4.9 percentage points to 46.7%). Despite this rise, the share of immigrants admitted in 2022 who stayed in each of the four Atlantic provinces was lower compared to those admitted in 2020 and 2019.

A similar pattern was also observed in Manitoba, where 71.5% of immigrants admitted in 2022 stayed in the intended province one year later, a higher proportion than those admitted in 2021 (69.4%), but lower than those admitted in 2020 (75.0%) and 2019 (77.5%).

In the territories, the one-year retention rate among immigrants admitted in 2022 was 66.7%, higher than those admitted in 2021 (61.6%) but lower than those admitted in 2020 (75.5%).

Ontario is the most common destination for immigrants who are not residing in their intended province one year after their admission

Among immigrants admitted in 2022 who intended to reside in Ontario, 36.8% had settled in Quebec, 34.4% in Alberta, 20.3% in British Columbia and 8.4% in another province or the territories one year after their admission. In addition, Ontario was the province that received the largest share (38.4%) of immigrants admitted in 2022 who did not settle in their intended province or territories in the year following their admission. Ontario was the place of residence for more than half of the immigrants admitted in 2022 who initially intended to settle in the Atlantic provinces, Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia but who were not living there a year after admission.

As a result, Ontario (+4,470 immigrants), Quebec (+2,095), Alberta (+5,530) and British Columbia (+1,730) had a positive one-year net internal migration of immigrants admitted in 2022, as was previously the case for immigrants admitted in 2021, 2020 and 2019 (except Quebec, which had negative net internal migration for those admitted in 2019).

The one-year net internal migration of immigrants admitted in 2022 was negative in Saskatchewan (-3,760), Manitoba (-3,460), Nova Scotia (-2,715), New Brunswick (-1,975), Prince Edward Island (-995), Newfoundland and Labrador (-860) and the territories (-50). Over a year, each of these regions lost more immigrants admitted in 2022 than they received from other parts of the country. There was also a net loss in these areas for immigrants admitted in 2021, 2020 and 2019 (except the territories, which had positive net internal migration for those admitted in 2020).

The share of immigrants living in Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick five years after their admission is increasing

While some relocations occur in the first year, a longer period of five years following an immigrant's admission corresponds to a pivotal period during which various aspects of life—such as work, education, family structure, personal networks and preferences for a place to live—evolve, potentially influencing residential settlement and migration decisions. In 2023, 82.5% of immigrants admitted in 2018 were residing in their intended province or territories, while 17.5% had changed jurisdiction.

Ontario (90.8%), Alberta (86.0%), British Columbia (84.9%) and Quebec (79.6%) had the largest shares of immigrants residing there five years after their admission. In these provinces, the five-year retention rates among immigrants admitted in 2018 were lower than those admitted in 2013, with decreases ranging from -5.3 percentage points in British Columbia to -2.4 percentage points in Ontario.

New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island stand out from other provinces regarding the five-year retention rate. There was an upward trend in the five-year retention rate in New Brunswick between the immigrants admitted in 2013 (47.8%) and those admitted in 2018 (57.6%). Meanwhile, Prince Edward Island experienced a recent increase in the five-year retention rate, reaching 34.1% for immigrants admitted in 2018, the highest rate since those admitted in 2014 (28.1%) and approaching the rate for those admitted in 2013 (39.9%).

Saskatchewan and Manitoba experienced the largest declines in five-year retention rates between immigrants admitted in 2013 and 2018 (down from 66.5% to 47.5% in Saskatchewan, and from 75.1% to 60.9% in Manitoba).

Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia continue to have positive five-year net internal migrations

In Ontario (+8,080), Alberta (+5,500) and British Columbia (+3,030), there were more immigrants admitted in 2018 who moved in from another province or territory than immigrants who moved out within a period of five years after admission. A positive five-year net internal migration was also observed in these provinces for each group of immigrants admitted from 2013 to 2017.

Conversely, the five-year net internal migration of immigrants was negative among those admitted in 2018 in Saskatchewan (-5,215), Quebec (-4,290), Manitoba (-3,715), New Brunswick (-950), Prince Edward Island (-945), Nova Scotia (-930), Newfoundland and Labrador (-525) and the territories (-35). This was also true for immigrants admitted from 2013 to 2017 in these regions.

The five-year retention rate remains high and stable for family-sponsored immigrants and refugees, whereas it continues to decline for economic immigrants

Different contexts of immigration can correspond to different needs and can affect the decision to reside in the intended province or territory of destination.

Immigrants admitted in 2018 under family-sponsored programs—which aim to reunite families—were the most likely to reside in their intended province or territory five years later. Among the immigrants admitted in 2018 under this category, 91.4% resided in the province or the territory five years after admission. In comparison, this proportion was 93.6% for those admitted in 2013. The share of refugees who were residing in their intended province or territory five years after their admission in 2018 (86.7%) has remained stable since those admitted in 2013 (87.1%).

Economic immigrants admitted in 2018 had a five-year retention rate of 76.8%, down 5.9 percentage points from the five-year retention rate for those admitted in 2013. This decline was more pronounced among immigrants admitted under business programs (-31.0 percentage points to 28.5%), skilled worker and skilled trades (-8.9 percentage points to 76.0%), provincial/territorial nominees (-8.0 percentage points to 70.7%) and the Canadian experience class (-5.0 percentage points to 86.5%).

Five-year retention rates continue to decline in the major census metropolitan areas

Urban centres are home to most immigrants. From 2013 to 2023, around 90% of immigrants intended to settle in census metropolitan areas (CMAs), with nearly 75% choosing the largest CMAs of Toronto, Montréal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg or the Ontario part of Ottawa–Gatineau as their intended destination.

Immigrants who initially intend to settle in the largest CMAs s are increasingly likely to reside in other regions a few years later. The five-year retention rates for immigrants admitted in 2018 decreased in the larger CMAs s in comparison to those admitted earlier, in 2013, led by Winnipeg (-16.0 percentage points) and Toronto (-13.5 percentage points). For other major CMAs, the decreases ranged from -5.2 percentage points to -7.8 percentage points.

Among immigrants admitted in 2018, those who settled in the three largest western CMAs of Vancouver (79.8%), Calgary (79.4%), and Edmonton (78.1%) were more likely to reside in the same CMA five years later compared to those who initially chose the major eastern CMAs of Toronto (72.8%), Montréal (71.3%), and the Ontario part of Ottawa–Gatineau (69.9%) as intended destination.

For immigrants who intended to settle in Toronto in 2018, most of those who were not there five years later resided in nearby urban centres such as Oshawa, Hamilton, and Kitchener–Cambridge–Waterloo. Meanwhile, those who initially intended to reside in another major CMA were more likely to be established in Toronto. After Toronto, Vancouver was the most popular CMA for those who intended to settle in Montréal and Calgary. Meanwhile, Calgary was the top destination among the immigrants admitted in 2018 who initially chose Edmonton and the second most popular CMA for those who had Vancouver and Winnipeg as intended destination.

Immigrants admitted in 2018 who planned to settle in non-CMA areas were less likely to reside in the same intended area five years later than those who initially chose to settle in CMAs. In most cases, their most popular place of residence was CMAs within the same province.

Vancouver, Calgary and Edmonton have more immigrants moving in than moving out five years after admission to Canada

These residential mobility patterns regarding the retention rate in the largest CMAs contributed to the five-year net internal migration of immigrants. Among immigrants admitted in 2018, Vancouver (+2,030), Calgary (+3,860) and Edmonton (+1,655) had more immigrants moving in than moving out over five years. A positive net balance was also observed for groups of immigrants admitted from 2013 to 2017. In contrast, Montréal (-5,725 for immigrants admitted in 2018) and Winnipeg (-3,035) saw more immigrants moving out than moving in over this period. Toronto had positive five-year net internal migration for those admitted in 2013 (+810) and 2016 (+510) but started seeing negative five-year net internal migration for those admitted in 2017 (-2,590) and 2018 (-8,350).

In a statement, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin blamed President Biden for restarting the diversity visa lottery after Trump's first term.","President Trump's overnight crackdown on diversity visas is the latest use of his 2025 strategy to scale down legal immigration.

Why it matters: The Trump administration is leveraging collective punishment by halting or trying to scuttle entire legal immigration programs after high-profile incidents.

""[T]hey are using them fully as a pretext for ... undoing so many aspects of the immigration system,"" said Doris Meissner, who formerly led the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and is now at the non-partisan Migration Policy Institute.

Driving the news: The alleged shooter at Brown University and MIT entered the U.S. from Portugal through the diversity lottery immigrant visa program, which allows roughly 50,000 people entry a year.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem announced that program is now paused. Trump had called to end this visa program several times in his first term.

The big picture: Through its travel ban, the Trump administration has halted the legal immigration process for roughly 20% of people in the system, according to a review from the CATO Institute.

In November, DHS paused all asylum decisions after an Afghan national, who entered the U.S. legally and was granted asylum, attacked members of the National Guard in D.C.,

The agency also suspended all immigration decisions for Afghan passport holders and nationals on the travel ban list, which has grown to 39 countries.

The pause has stopped citizenship ceremonies, green card interviews and will prevent people from renewing their work or student visas.

Zoom in: Trump also ordered the termination in November of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Somalis over reports of widespread fraud in Minnesota.

The Somali decision will impact less than 1,000 people, according to data shared with Congress earlier this year. But it's created justification to surge immigration enforcement in the state, particularly in Minneapolis.

The other side: DHS did not respond to questions about its broad crackdown on legal immigration program in reaction to acts of violence or alleged fraud.

Columbus police have confirmed an increase in federal officers operating throughout the city. Business owners in Northgate, including one who witnessed her employees being detained by ICE at a gas station on Cleveland Avenue, are expressing shock and fear.

These people are good, innocent people. The only crime they committed in this country is come to this country to work.

""We come to this country wanting to work, wanting to learn English, wanting the best for ourselves and our children, this just does not align with who we are as a country,"" Immigration attorney Inna Simakovsky said.

Simakovsky is left in shock seeing this content online and in her community.

""If you are just in the wrong place at the wrong time and you are pumping gas and you are not a white man, you could be targeted,"" she said, referring to the two men in the video the Northgate business owner shared. ""It's very unruly. It feels like the due process is completely gone.""

ABC 6 is on your side asking the Department of Homeland Security and ICE how many agents are in Columbus, and how many people have been detained or arrested. A spokesperson with ICE confirmed the arrests of Abdirisaq Hassan Mohamed from Somalia and Wilmar Lozano-Alcantara from El Salvador.

But the only official response we've been given is this statement:

ICE officers continue to arrest criminal illegal aliens and immigration violators in the city of Columbus, across Ohio, and throughout the United States. These enforcement actions are part of ongoing efforts to uphold public safety and enforce federal immigration laws.

Earlier this week, ICE officers in Columbus arrested these worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens: Abdirisaq Hassan Mohamed is a criminal illegal alien from Somalia with a final order of removal and two convictions for felony unlawful possession of scheduled drug and convictions for criminal trespass, theft of services, and disorderly conduct. Mohamed has additional arrests or charges for failure to disperse, refusing to submit to arrest, unlawful trafficking in scheduled drugs, terrorizing, and drinking in public.

Wilmar Lozano-Alcantara is a criminal illegal alien from El Salvador with a final order of removal and convictions for felony possession of a controlled substance, misdemeanor criminal trespass, felony robbery and felony probation violation. Lozano has additional arrests or charges for criminal trespass on two occasions, possession of drugs, obstruct business, illegal use of marijuana, and petty theft.

However, many of the reported ICE raids remain unconfirmed, leaving families in chaos and uncertainty. With limited details about ICE operations in Columbus, Simakovsky advises families to have a plan and keep important documents like case numbers and birth certificates readily available.

Fairfax County Commonwealth’s Attorney Steve Descano’s office has repeatedly dropped charges against the man in a number of unrelated cases in recent years. And Fairfax County Sheriff Stacey Kincaid did not alert ICE that Ortez was leaving her jail, allowing him to walk free and allegedly murder someone in Reston this week.

In an X post sharing 7News’s story on Ortez, DHS said “sanctuary politicians of Fairfax County, VA have blood on their hands.”

“The day after Fairfax County REFUSED to hand over Marvin Fernando Morales-Ortez, a criminal illegal alien from El Salvador, to ICE he allegedly MURDERED an American citizen. He has a prior history of aggravated assault, larceny, assault on a law enforcement officer, weapons charges and other misdemeanor offenses,” DHS added.

ICE posted about the deadly shooting as well.

“If Fairfax County would have simply worked to uphold our nation’s laws, and honored our detainer, then this tragedy may have never happened,” the post read.

“This tragic case is a prime example of what happens when Democrats choose to side with criminal illegal aliens over American citizens. This monster should’ve never been allowed to roam free in American communities. The Trump Administration will continue our efforts to deport all criminal illegal aliens and Make America Safe Again, despite unrelenting Democrat opposition,” The White House told 7News Reporter Nick Minock.

7News has extensively reported on how Fairfax County Sheriff Stacey Kincaid does not honor ICE detainers, how Fairfax County Commonwealth’s Attorney Steve Descano considers immigration consequences in felony cases and has a long, documented history of dropping serious charges, and how the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors does not allow the Fairfax County Police Department to work with ICE.

7News reached out to Kincaid for comment. You can see the sheriff's statement below:

“I am deeply saddened by the tragic violence that occurred in Reston earlier this week. My thoughts are with everyone who has been affected by the fatal shooting.

The suspected shooter, Marvin Morales Ortez, was arrested and booked into the Fairfax County Adult Detention Center (ADC) on September 14, on charges of aggravated malicious wounding and brandishing a firearm. On December 16, these charges were dropped. The release of Morales Ortez was the result of a prosecutorial decision that there was not sufficient probable cause to proceed. The court order dismissing the case required the immediate release of the inmate.

The Fairfax County Sheriff’s Office follows all local, state, and federal laws when determining whether a person is subject to release from the ADC. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is automatically notified any time a person is booked into the ADC. To ensure an undocumented person continues to be held, a judicial warrant is required. In this instance, ICE was aware of Morales Ortez’s incarceration and elected not to seek a judicial warrant to ensure he remained in custody. Accordingly, and consistent with our policies and the law, once the court issued an order dismissing his cases, Morales Ortez was released.

At the end of the day, there is only one person responsible for this terrible crime. It is our sincere hope that person is brought to justice.

Violence in any form has no place in our community. The Fairfax County Sheriff’s Office remains unwavering in its commitment to protect the safety and security of all who live, work, and visit Fairfax County.”

In August, Minock spoke to the ICE Director about these so-called sanctuary county policies.

“What's your message to cities that still aren't working with ICE?” Minock asked Director Todd Lyons.

“My message is, I would really look at what the ICE mission is and not listen to the rhetoric,” answered Lyons. “ICE, for so long, has been used as a political football, but we're a viable law enforcement agency that does a significant public safety mission here in the community. Really look at our social media sites, look at the worst of the worst that we're arresting, and see that we can make your community safer by partnering with us.”

According to court documents, Descano dropped a 2019 murder charge against Ortez even though his own prosecutor argued Ortez was an MS-13 gang member and he confessed to striking the victim three times with a machete.

7News Reporter Nick Minock obtained a 140-page transcript of the 2021 preliminary hearing. It shows Descano’s office argued in court in 2021 that Ortez confessed that he was present during the murder, that he was with a few other people, that he ambushed the victim on a path, and that he struck the victim three times with a machete.

The detective said the autopsy showed three strikes in the victim’s body consistent with the manner Ortez demonstrated. Detectives said the machete wounds cut deep into the victim’s body.

Descano’s prosecutor at the time said there were a number of facts listed by Ortez in an interview with detectives that only someone who was there would know, like the types and calibers of weapons used, the number of cut wounds, the victim’s clothes, and where it happened.

The judge agreed with detectives and the prosecutor at the time that there was probable cause in the 2019 murder, but Descano’s office dropped the charge anyway.

On Thursday, Descano’s office told 7News they dropped the 2019 murder charge because it became “clear that he was ultimately not the perpetrator who had killed Mr. Guillen Mejia,” adding that a federal court convicted someone else for the crime.

But that doesn’t mean Ortez wasn’t involved.",https://wjla.com/resources/media2/16x9/1920/1320/center/90/f0f3d09d-3adb-45ff-8107-830f704ab9ca-Untitled16_9Landscape8.png,N,,2025-12-19 17:58:47.953269

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the decision in a post on X, saying she was acting “at President Trump’s direction.” “This heinous individual should never have been allowed in our country,” Noem wrote, referring to Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, a 48-year-old Portuguese man identified by authorities as the perpetrator of the attacks. She added that she had ordered U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to immediately pause the visa program “to ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous program.”

The announcement came hours after authorities confirmed that Neves Valente had been found dead in a storage unit in New Hampshire, with a gunshot wound that law enforcement officials described as self-inflicted.

According to court documents and official statements, Neves Valente first entered the United States in 2000 on a student visa to pursue graduate studies at Brown University, where he later carried out the December 13 shooting that left two students dead. Brown University President Christina H. Paxson said the man enrolled in a Ph.D. program in physics but took a leave of absence in the spring of 2001 and formally withdrew two years later. It remains unclear where he lived or what he did in the years that followed, until he was selected for the Diversity Visa Program in 2017 and obtained lawful permanent resident status months later.

What is the diversity visa lottery, and how many people receive visas?

The Diversity Immigrant Visa Program was created by Congress in the 1990s with the goal of diversifying immigration flows to the United States. Each year, it makes up to 50,000 visas available — in some official counts, up to 55,000 — for individuals from countries with historically low levels of immigration to the U.S. Recipients are chosen at random through a lottery system, but must later meet minimum education or work requirements, complete consular interviews, and undergo security vetting similar to that required of other green card applicants.

For the 2025 lottery, nearly 20 million people submitted applications, and more than 131,000 individuals were selected, including spouses and family members. In the case of Portugal, Neves Valente’s country of origin, only 38 slots were awarded that year.

The decision to suspend the program has raised legal questions. While Noem directed USCIS — an agency within her department — to halt the program’s implementation, most diversity visas are administered by the State Department, and the program itself is established by an act of Congress. As a result, immigration experts and advocacy organizations say the move is likely to face legal challenges in court.

This is not the first time Donald Trump has sought to dismantle the diversity visa program. The president has long criticized the lottery, arguing that it is not merit-based and could pose security risks. In 2017, he urged Congress to eliminate the program following a deadly attack in New York carried out by a man who had entered the United States through the same visa system. During the Covid pandemic, Trump temporarily suspended the issuance of diversity visas as part of broader restrictions on legal immigration — a policy that was reversed in 2021 by Democratic President Joe Biden.",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/3HPLWCDCUJMPLDZODQZBR5MMDI.jpg?auth=af2b52a6dd758c22a512ab9210b268df0753012d3ae7ffbfd30071f3f8f1f846&width=1200,N,,2025-12-19 19:56:53.227935

Today, Lee is no longer a congresswoman, but the mayor of Oakland is still trying to hold President Donald Trump accountable for his alleged role in encouraging the attempted insurrection.

On Friday, Lee appeared in federal court in Washington D.C. for an important hearing in a lawsuit she’s involved in against the president. The suit, which was filed nearly five years ago by the NAACP and several members of Congress, accuses Trump of conspiring to stop certification of the election results that removed him from office.

Trump held a rally for thousands of his supporters at the Ellipse, a park near the White House, on Jan. 6, 2021. After his speech, many attendees marched to the Capitol, where they scaled walls, broke windows, and fought with police officers while lawmakers hid or scrambled to safety. During the ensuing mayhem, one rioter was shot dead by Capitol Police, and scores of people were injured, including police officers.

Many participants in the riot were subsequently charged, sentenced, and imprisoned. A grand jury also indicted Trump in 2023 for allegedly conspiring to obstruct the election. The charges were dismissed shortly after Trump was reelected in November 2024. And as president, he pardoned over 1,200 people who had been convicted for crimes committed during the attack on the Capitol.

According to the attorneys behind the lawsuit, this is one of the last civil actions challenging Trump’s role in the attack on the Capitol. If the court dismisses the case, it will mean there are “no legal means to try to hold President Trump accountable for his role on January 6, 2021,” said Joseph Sellers, a partner at Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll who is representing Lee and other plaintiffs.

Speaking outside the courthouse, Lee told reporters that no one is above the law, but “I believe that the discussion today in court revealed the fact that there are some in this country that do believe a president could be above the law.”

Trump’s legal team has argued that the case shouldn’t move forward because he has presidential immunity against civil lawsuits. His attorneys also asked Judge Amit Mehta to reconsider a previous ruling in which he declined to dismiss the case on the basis that Trump was exercising his First Amendment right to free speech on Jan. 6.

Mehta has received the arguments from both parties and is expected to make a ruling in the future.

Lee was an outspoken critic of Trump while she was a member of Congress. As mayor of Oakland, Lee has continued to criticize the president for pushing federal legislation that cut funding for healthcare and food assistance, and for making misleading statements about Oakland’s crime rate.

Tensions spiked in Oakland in October after federal immigration agents were deployed to a Coast Guard base near the city for possible operations in San Francisco and the rest of the Bay Area. Lee and other city leaders responded by reassuring residents that they were prepared to deal with any enforcement actions.

The NAACP first filed suit against Trump on behalf of Rep. Bennie G. Thompson on Feb. 16, 2021. Ten other members of Congress, including Lee, joined the lawsuit two months later. The lawsuit also named as defendants the Proud Boys, a neofascist group, and the Oath Keepers, a right-wing militia, because their members participated in the riot. The lawsuit relies on an 1871 law that was originally drafted to protect people from Ku Klux Klan violence.

“January 6 was not only an attack on Congress, it was also an attack on the voting rights of millions of Americans,” NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson said in a statement. “The court remains the only independent venue capable of establishing a factual, apolitical record of what occurred. We believe in this process, and we believe accountability will prevail.”

In March 2023, when Joe Biden was president, the Department of Justice issued a recommendation to the court hearing the lawmaker’s lawsuit that a president’s speech “on a matter of public concern is not protected by absolute immunity if it constitutes incitement to imminent private violence.” The following year, a federal court in D.C. denied Trump’s request to stay the litigation pending the resolution of the criminal case against him for his alleged role in the attempted insurrection. That case was dismissed shortly after Trump won the presidential election in November 2024.

Lee, who became the lead plaintiff in the civil suit in 2023, thanked the Capitol police officers who defended lawmakers from rioters on January 6. She said several reported being called racial slurs during the riot. Lee also thanked the NAACP and shared that her mother was one of the plaintiffs in a legal case the organization filed in Texas to integrate Texas Western College.

“The NAACP has a tradition of fighting for equal justice under the law,” Lee said. “This is another one of those cases, we’re moving forward.”",https://oaklandside.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP21189685737616-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 18:58:49.417146

Morning Reads

Trump Administration Aims to Strip More Foreign-Born Americans of Citizenship (Hamed Aleaziz, The New York Times)(Paywall) — Internal guidance documents issued to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services field offices and obtained by The New York Times show that the “Trump administration plans to ramp up efforts to strip some naturalized Americans of their citizenship” by asking the field offices to “supply … 100-200 denaturalization cases per month” in the year ahead as part of the administration’s broader “immigration crackdown.” Denaturalization proceedings previously have been rare, in part because past Supreme Court rulings on the issue make it difficult to strip someone of their citizenship. “In 2017, the Supreme Court ruled that the government must prove not only that someone had lied during the citizenship application process but that the lie had an impact on the underlying citizenship claim.”

Florida execution of Frank Walls won’t be halted by U.S. Supreme Court (Tom McLaughlin, Pensacola News Journal)(Paywall) — The Supreme Court on Thursday “denied a stay of execution for convicted murderer Frank Walls,” clearing the way for Walls to become the 19th person executed in Florida this year, according to the Pensacola News Journal. “Walls was originally sent to Florida’s death row on Aug. 24, 1988. He had been sentenced to death for the murder of Ann Peterson and also received a life sentence for the murder on the same day of her boyfriend, Edward Alger. Walls was ultimately tied to a total of five murders.”

Court blocks Michigan ban on conversion therapy on free speech grounds (Ed White, Associated Press) — A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit on Wednesday “blocked Michigan’s ban on conversion therapy for minors who are LGBTQ+, declaring it violates the First Amendment rights of therapists and counselors,” according to the Associated Press. “The Michigan law discriminates based on viewpoint — meaning the law permits speech on a particular topic only if the speech expresses a viewpoint that the government itself approves,” Judge Raymond Kethledge wrote, joined by Judge Joan Larsen. Wednesday’s “decision comes more than two months after the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in a Colorado case that could resolve the issue nationwide.” In a dissenting opinion, Judge Rachel Bloomekatz wrote that the 6th Circuit “should have waited for the Supreme Court to act.”

Supreme Court rulings, shifting federal policy create uncertainty for Colorado River basin (Alan Riquelmy, Courthouse News Service) — A deadline is looming for the Colorado River basin. “A 2007 agreement detail[ing] how Lake Powell and Lake Mead, reservoirs in the river basin, are operated,” such as how full they are kept, “expires at the end of next year,” according to Courthouse News Service. Before then, leaders in the seven states with a direct stake in the river basin’s future need to agree on new operational guidelines, but they’re struggling to navigate “recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions and policy changes by the Trump administration” affecting relevant federal agencies and environmental reviews.

A look back at the Supreme Court in 2025 (Scott Bomboy, National Constitution Center) — As 2026 rapidly approaches, the National Constitution Center is looking back at notable Supreme Court decisions from 2025. It highlighted Trump v. CASA, in which the court limited the use of universal injunctions, and United States v. Skrmetti, in which the court upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting certain medical treatments for transgender minors, among other cases.

A Closer Look: Locations of the Court

While the court’s current home at One First Street may seem like a timeless landmark, it’s actually less than a century old. In 1935, the Supreme Court settled in permanently to the large marble building that we know and love, after more than 140 years of bouncing around between taverns, basements, and various rooms within the Capitol.

Section 1 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 established that the Supreme Court “shall consist of a chief justice and five associate justices” and also provided that the court shall meet for two sessions annually “at the seat of government.” When the justices met for the first time during the 1790 term, they did so in New York (then the nation’s capital) at the Merchants Exchange. The court held two sessions that first year, although there were no cases to hear (rather the six justices focused on organizational matters).

When Congress moved the nation’s capital to Philadelphia in 1791, the court moved with it and held its February 1791 session in Independence Hall – host of the debates over the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. Shortly after, the court moved into the new City Hall and met on the ground floor of the building for most of the next nine years.

Once the seat of the federal government moved to its new, permanent home of Washington, D.C., in 1800, the justices packed up once more – and again without any provision for a place of their own. In fact, for the next 134 years, the court would bounce around locations in the U.S. Capitol. Initially, the justices were allowed to use a conference room on a lower floor but had to move to the former library of the House of Representatives due to renovations. (One problem: the library was not heated, so the court temporarily met in Long’s Tavern in Carroll Row.)

Once work on the new capital was complete, the court was given a new space below the Senate chamber, although the justices soon had to evacuate temporarily when the British set fire to the Capitol during the War of 1812. The court again found a home in a tavern, this time Bell’s Tavern. In 1817, the court returned to a room in the north wing of the Capitol until the prior chamber was once again fit for use. The court’s last move before heading to its permanent home was in 1860 when it moved up to the first floor of the Capitol Building and into the Old Senate Chamber.

As the work of the justices and their clerks picked up in the late 19th century, efforts began to persuade Congress that they needed a place of their own. With then-President and soon-to-be Chief Justice William Taft leading the charge, Congress finally agreed, appropriating $9.7 million in 1928 for the building. The architect Cass Gilbert drew up the plans for today’s structure, complete with large marble steps and a grand portico supported by Corinthian columns. The building was completed in 1935 (actually coming in under its initial budget), although neither Taft nor Gilbert lived to see it finished.

SCOTUS Quote

“It was said by Chief Justice Marshall, many years ago, that Congress could do many things, but that it could not alter a fact.”

— Justice John McLean in Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co.

How the Tariffs Could Be Refunded if the Court Sides Against Trump

It has been slightly over six weeks since the Supreme Court heard oral argument in the challenge to President Donald Trump’s power to impose sweeping tariffs in a series of executive orders earlier this year, and in addition to wondering when the court will release its decision, many court watchers are asking whether a ruling against the Trump administration would lead to refunds for importers that have already paid the tariffs. Read Amy’s analysis to understand the tariffs rebate debate.

The ruling sullies the Trump administration’s near-perfect record at the Supreme Court this year on emergency appeals filed on the so-called shadow docket.

Two weeks ago, Solicitor General D. John Sauer urged the high court to take immediate action to head off “disruptive” and “destabilizing uncertainty” caused by an appeals court ruling in June that suggested federal government employees might be able to press lawsuits in federal court because of turmoil at a federal agency that oversees employment-related disputes.

The justices said the Trump administration is free to come back to the Supreme Court for emergency relief if federal officials were ordered to testify or turn over records to the National Association of Immigration Judges.

The judges’ union filed suit in 2020 over a policy enacted during the first Trump administration that prohibited immigration judges from public comments about their work. Previously, judges were free to discuss those issues, if they made clear they were not speaking on behalf of the Justice Department, which runs the immigration courts.

An attorney for the union, Ramya Krishnan, lauded the high court’s decision.

“The Supreme Court was right to reject the government’s request for a stay of proceedings,” said Krishnan, a lawyer with the Knight First Amendment Institute. “The restrictions on immigration judges’ free speech rights are unconstitutional and it’s intolerable that this prior restraint is still in place.”

ICE has long had a presence in central Ohio, but actions this week in Columbus prompted responses from city officials, community leaders and national politicians.

Here's what we know:

How many people is ICE arresting in Columbus?

It is unclear exactly how many operations ICE has conducted in recent days and how many people have been detained.

Records from the Butler County jail, one of a handful of Ohio jails housing ICE detainees, show there were 26 people booked into the facility on Dec. 18 with no other charge listed other than ""Hold for ICE."" Another 35 people were booked in on Dec. 17. The detainees range in age from 20 to 51 and include four women and 57 men.

The jail's publicly visible information does not identify where the detainees are from, either in Ohio or their country of origin, or where they were arrested. Of the six ICE detention facilities in Ohio, the Butler County jail is closest geographically to Columbus.

Quiet protest at ICE office in freezing snow

About two dozen people gathered in freezing temperatures next to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Westerville for a regularly scheduled protest Dec. 19.

ICE arrests in the Columbus area have already been trending upward this year compared to 2024 under the second Trump administration. The gathering came a few days after local officials described increased ICE activity in the Columbus area.

At the protest, people mostly stood in a single-file line facing the street, holding signs that said “stop the cruelty.” People occasionally cheered as cars passing by honked in support, but there was no speaker or music.

“I’m worried about our country — the law is just not being followed,” said Sue Leatherman, who was coming to the protest for the second time. “I’m frightened for people I know.”

Mixed reaction from Congressional officials

U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty, a Democrat representing part of Columbus, told The Dispatch that city leaders are addressing the increased ICE activity and that she wants constituents to know “we are supporting them.”

""We would like them to leave immediately,"" Beatty said.

She added that ""Columbus has not had a problem that ICE can solve.""

A Dec. 18 video featuring Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther and Police Chief Elaine Bryant, emphasizing the city's longstanding policy that it would not cooperate with ICE on immigration offenses, was shared by the right-wing account “Libs of TikTok.”

U.S. Senator Bernie Moreno responded to the video Libs of TikTok reposted on X, saying that entering the U.S. unlawfully or overstaying a visa is a “federal crime.” He added that Ginther and Bryant “should be aware that impeding federal law enforcement efforts is also a crime.”

Overstaying a visa is not a federal crime, but a civil offense, according to the American Immigration Council. But entering the U.S. “without proper inspection at a port of entry” is a federal misdemeanor.

‘Call a kidnapping a kidnapping’: Many bystanders filming, posting

Many bystanders around Columbus have filmed ICE arrests and posted the videos to social media to warn others. One woman, Alison Claybon, sent the videos to the Dispatch and to her state representative.

Claybon has lived in the Columbus area since 2013. She said she got a call from a friend at about 3 p.m. Dec. 18 that ICE was arresting two men outside the furniture stores on Britton Parkway near the Mall at Tuttle Crossing, just south of Dublin.

“I immediately jumped in the truck and went over there because I'm not going to stand by while people are being kidnapped in broad daylight,” Claybon said.

In footage provided to the Dispatch, several men in plain clothes with ski masks and tactical vests surrounded a man, searching him. One wore a black vest that read “ICE police.”

Claybon asked the masked men who they were and where they were taking the man. They did not answer most of her questions, but one of them pointed to the man being searched and said, “he’s here illegally,” the footage shows.

Claybon yelled to the man in Spanish, asking for his name and if he had any numbers she should call.

She stayed at the scene for several minutes, filming and heckling the apparent ICE agents, who loaded the man Claybon spoke to and a second man into vehicles. She swore at the officials, calling them fascists and saying they were kidnapping people.

Claybon said she did not regret swearing at them, and she said what she saw could only be described as kidnapping, even though it was likely carried out by officials.

She said anyone could order similar police vests or even red and blue vehicle lights on Amazon, and the officials did not seem professional and did not show any identification.

“I don't have any shame for my behavior. I think they should be ashamed of themselves,” Claybon said. “Somebody has to stand up to this and call a kidnapping a kidnapping.”

FOP president says officers have duty to assist ICE in certain situations

Brian Steel, president of the Fraternal Order of Police Capital City Lodge #9, emphasized that Columbus police do not assist in federal immigration enforcement. But he did say that if ICE agents need assistance with someone who is potentially violent, sworn officers have a duty to assist the agents.

Some examples Steel included are if the suspect is armed, or they try fleeing from agents either on foot or in a vehicle.

""This is nothing new,"" said Steel.

In an email sent to Columbus police leadership minutes before a Dec. 18 press conference that Steel shared with The Dispatch, Chief Elaine Bryant said that the police division ""does not assist in detaining individuals based solely on immigration status.""

""Our responsibility in these situations is to maintain public order and keep the peace, while ensuring the safety of all involved — including the public and our officers,"" Bryant wrote. ""If you encounter federal agents conducting operations, you are expected to remain professional, focused, and aware of your surroundings. Officer safety must remain your top priority.""

Bryant also wrote that officers have a ""duty to intervene"" if they witness any conduct or actions from agents that places anyone at risk. If any sworn or civilian employee gets a request to assist in any federal operations, they are required to notify either the Deputy Chief or an Assistant Chief, according to the email.

""I expect all of you will continue to conduct yourself in a manner that aligns with our values, training, and policies. You have consistently demonstrated professionalism in challenging and sensitive situations, and I am confident you will continue to do so,"" said Bryant.","https://www.dispatch.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/19/NCOD/87846712007-ice-protest-12192025-skm-7.JPG?crop=5615,3159,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-19 16:57:14.209933

In the letter, Attorney General Nessel stressed that the fair administration of justice depends on public participation, which requires unfettered access to courthouses. Creating an environment where people fear civil arrests – whether they are victims, parties, witnesses, or simply courtroom observers or those doing business in the courthouse – discourages participation, undermines accountability, and erodes trust in the justice system.

“When people are afraid to report crimes or come to court because they fear a civil arrest, it puts victims at risk and makes our communities less safe,” Nessel said. “It’s my sincere hope that the Michigan Supreme Court adopts this amendment to protect access to justice for everyone.”

The Attorney General noted that several states already provide similar protections, including New York, Connecticut, and Illinois. Attorney General Nessel also addressed the amendment’s implications on civil immigration enforcement. The broad language of the proposed rule would limit certain civil arrests by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in administrative and non-criminal matters within courthouses. She cited recent federal litigation upholding New York’s courthouse protections, where the Court recognized that ICE’s own prior policies acknowledged that courthouse arrests can deter individuals from reporting crimes or pursuing civil rights claims.

These prior federal policies, Attorney General Nessel noted, restricted civil immigration enforcement actions in or near courthouses to limit circumstances in order to preserve access to justice. The Attorney General stressed that ICE’s historical compliance with such policies shows that civil enforcement operations can continue effectively without courthouse arrests.

Attorney General Nessel also noted that the proposed amendment would not invalidate ICE warrants, interfere with judicial warrants, or prevent civil arrests outside courthouses. Any impact on ICE operations, she concluded, would be minimal and far outweighed by the need to protect the public’s fundamental right to participate in the justice system.

Christopher Day began hearing cases in late October as a temporary judge at the immigration court in Annandale, Virginia. He was fired around Dec. 2, the National Association of Immigration Judges confirmed.

It’s unclear why Day was fired. Day and the Pentagon did not comment when contacted by the AP, and a Justice Department spokeswoman declined to discuss personnel matters.

But federal data from November shows he ruled on asylum cases in ways at odds with the Trump administration’s stated goals.

Of the 11 cases he concluded in November, he granted asylum or some other type of relief allowing the migrant to remain in the United States a total of six times, according to federal data analyzed by Mobile Pathways, a San Francisco-based non profit.

Such favorable outcomes for migrants have become increasingly rare as the Trump administration seeks to slash a massive backlog of 3.8 million asylum cases by radically overhauling the nation’s 75 immigration courts.

As part of that drive, the Trump administration has fired almost 100 judges viewed as too liberal and over the summer eased rules allowing any attorney, regardless of their legal background, to apply to become what recent recruitment ads refer to as a “Deportation Judge.”

In response, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in September approved sending up to 600 military lawyers to hear asylum cases. The goal, migrant advocacy groups say, is to redefine a judge’s traditional duties as a fair, independent arbiter of asylum claims into something akin to a rubber stamp in a robe for the White House’s mass deportation goals.

The American Immigration Lawyers Association has decried the influx of military officers lacking expertise in immigration law, likening them to cardiologists attempting to do a hip replacement. But Pentagon and White House officials have defended the move, saying that a campaign to rule on pending asylum claims was something that all federal workers — as well as migrants sometimes in limbo for years — should rally behind.

So far, only 30 members of the military have been detailed to the immigration courts and for the most part appear to have lived up to the administration’s expectations. Nine out of every 10 migrants whose asylum cases were heard by such judges in November were either ordered removed or requested to self-deport, according to federal data. Overall, the military judges ordered removal 78% of the time compared to 63% for all other judges.

But those like Day, whose rulings countered that trend, are especially vulnerable if it is determined they violated their military duties, said Dana Leigh Marks, a retired immigration judge.

“It is hard to imagine someone being fired so quickly, after five weeks on the bench, unless it was for ideological reasons,” said Marks, the former head of the National Association of Immigration Judges. “It’s especially unfair to military judges because they don’t have the same civil service protections and could face severe consequences for failing in their assignment.”

The Uniform Code of Military Justice, which governs service members, forbids senior military leaders from interfering or retaliating against military attorneys for their actions in a military tribunal. Army regulations also require JAG attorneys to proceed with candor and honesty much like all licensed lawyers are expected to do in civil courts.

But whether those standards apply to military lawyers working outside of the normal confines of a military tribunal is untested.

Brenner Fissell, a Villanova University law professor, said that there are a number of personnel actions that can be taken — letters of counseling or reprimand — that, even if found to be baseless later, would affect one’s potential for promotion and impact their discharge. Appealing such decisions, he said, is a byzantine process that can take years and require hiring a costly lawyer.

“The process can be the punishment,” said Fissell, who helps run the Orders Project, which helps provide counsel to military personnel who believe they are being asked to carry out illegal orders.

A graduate of American University law school, Day has held multiple jobs in the federal government over the past two decades while simultaneously serving as a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Reserve’s Judge Advocate General’s Corps. His last job was as an attorney for the Federal Communications Commission during the Biden administration.

Unlike federal judges, who have lifetime tenure, immigration judges are employees of the Justice Department, which runs immigration courts, and can be fired by the attorney general with fewer restraints.

That message was driven home during a two-week training course in October held for new judges, including those assigned by the Pentagon, according to someone who attended the training on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private sessions.

The Pentagon has offered extra incentives to military officers signing up for temporary detail on immigration courts. Those volunteering were promised their choice of assignments, according to an email sent by the JAG Corps leadership in the fall, a copy of which was shared with the AP. But if enough officers didn’t come forward, officers might be required to relocate up to six months away from home to fulfill the mandate, according to the email.

It marks the first time since the spring that the court has rejected one of the administration’s emergency appeals. No justice publicly dissented, but the order left the door open for the government to try again once the case progresses further.

“At this stage, the Government has not demonstrated that it will suffer irreparable harm without a stay,” the one-paragraph order reads.

The case stems from restrictions on what immigration judges can say publicly. The restrictions require the judges, who are part of the executive branch, to obtain prior approval for speeches when the subject directly relates to their official duties.

The National Association of Immigration Judges (NAIJ) claims the policy violates the First Amendment.

Those free speech issues weren’t yet before the justices, however.

The Trump administration went to the Supreme Court to try to halt an order allowing the lawsuit to proceed before a federal district judge. The administration argues it must go before the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), a specialty body that oversees certain federal employee disputes.

That question poses wider implications for other federal workers’ cases, too. Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the justices the lower ruling would “indefinitely thwart the MSPB.”

“The answer to such prolific contravention of the Court’s precedents should not be to wait and see just how much instability will ensue,” Sauer wrote in court filings.

The lower court had acknowledged the MSPB’s purview. But in allowing the lawsuit to proceed, it pointed to President Trump’s firing at the board that left it for some time without a quorum, saying it raises “serious questions” about whether the MSPB “continues to function as intended.”

The NAIJ told the Supreme Court to deny the administration’s request.

“The Supreme Court was right to reject the government’s request for a stay of proceedings,” Ramya Krishnan, senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute, which represents NAIJ, said in a statement.

“It should also quickly reject the government’s soon-to-be filed cert petition,” Krishnan said, referring to the administration’s expected ask that the justices take up the case on their normal docket. “The restrictions on immigration judges’ free speech rights are unconstitutional and it’s intolerable that this prior restraint is still in place.”

Friday’s order marks a rare loss for the Trump administration on the Supreme Court’s emergency docket.

The administration has filed 32 emergency applications with the justices since Trump retook the White House. It’s a staggering number the administration says is a result of federal district judges overstepping their authority to block Trump’s agenda, while the president’s critics say it reflects him acting lawlessly.

Several of the applications remain pending or were withdrawn, but the Supreme Court has almost always sided with the Trump administration in those decided so far.

That changed on Friday, when the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency allowed two Democratic congressmen from New York to get a firsthand look at the cells on the 10th floor at 26 Federal Plaza, in Lower Manhattan.

Representative Daniel Goldman arrived at the building, trailed inside by a throng of reporters and armed with a court ruling that ordered ICE this week to allow federal lawmakers to visit detention centers without notice.

After knocking on the 10th-floor doors for a few minutes, Mr. Goldman was escorted inside by the leaders of the ICE field office in New York, while journalists waited outside. Another Democratic congressman, Adriano Espaillat, showed up shortly after and was also let in.

Emerging from their visit, the lawmakers said that the four cells, which have held thousands of migrants this year, were holding just nine detainees on Friday. They said that federal workers, probably because of the congressional visit, were mopping the floors: “It was spick and span,” Mr. Goldman said.

The conditions, they said, appeared to have improved since a federal judge ordered ICE in August to limit the number of migrants being held to 22, following reports that hundreds of migrants had spent days at a time there earlier this year.

But Mr. Goldman criticized the lack of showers or beds in the cells for detainees. “You’re essentially sleeping on the hard floor with blankets, thin blankets,” he said.

He said that Kenneth Genalo, the ICE field office director in New York, told the lawmakers that about 60 percent of the people ICE detains in New York have no criminal histories. Many were arrested by the agency at immigration courthouses or after being summoned to check in at the ICE offices.

“ These are not violent criminals, and what ICE is very clearly doing is targeting the easiest people to arrest, detain and deport, which are not the criminals,” Mr. Goldman said at a news conference after the visit.

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shut out of power in Washington, Democrats in Congress have sought to use their oversight powers to scrutinize immigration detention facilities, hoping to exert political pressure on President Trump and his growing mass deportation campaign.

Detention centers across the United States have reached record levels of capacity, holding more than 65,000 migrants as of late November. From California to New York, the centers have emerged as political flash points amid reports of overcrowding, poor conditions and inadequate access to health care.

Mr. Goldman, and other Democratic members of Congress, had been demanding access to inspect the cells at 26 Federal Plaza since June, showing up several times, only to be denied access by ICE. The lawmakers accused the agency of violating federal laws that allow members of Congress to tour facilities where migrants are being held.

ICE repeatedly argued that the lawmakers did not have a right to visit the cells because they were not technically in a detention facility, but rather inside the agency’s New York field office, where migrants are processed and held temporarily.

On Wednesday, a federal judge in Washington ruled that ICE must allow members of Congress — whose access to detention compounds has been restricted across the country — to make unannounced visits to immigration detention facilities.

In her 73-page ruling, the judge, Jia M. Cobb, an appointee of President Joseph R. Biden Jr., wrote that the agency’s attempt to block lawmakers from ICE field offices where migrants are being detained, even if temporarily, was “contrary to statute.”

The New York holding cells began drawing scrutiny during the summer, as ICE launched a sprawling effort to detain migrants who were showing up for routine court hearings at immigration courts that are just a few floors above the holding cells at 26 Federal Plaza.

The pace of arrests overwhelmed the limited capacity of the holding cells, which are cramped and bare spaces traditionally used by ICE to hold detainees for just a few hours before transferring them to detention centers outside the city.

But the cells became packed with hundreds of migrants. They were held for days, sometimes for longer than a week, in violation of the agency’s own guidelines, which limit stays at such facilities to 72 hours. Many were forced to sleep on the concrete floor or sitting upright, according to migrants, lawyers and video footage that emerged in July.

A lawsuit filed on Aug. 8 accused ICE of holding migrants in squalid conditions, without access to lawyers, proper meals, bedding or showers, and subjected to a “horrific stench” from the metal toilets inside the cells.

The lawsuit led a federal judge to order ICE to swiftly remedy the conditions inside the cells at 26 Federal Plaza on Aug. 12. The judge, Lewis A. Kaplan, appointed by President Bill Clinton, ordered the agency to limit the number of migrants it holds there to 22, and to ensure that they have access to proper medical and hygienic care.

During Mr. Goldman’s visit on Friday, he said that he spoke to a Pakistani man who had been detained during his annual ICE check-in. The man, Mr. Goldman said, had been in the United States since 1995 and had been ordered removed from the country by a judge in 2007, but never left.

The man claimed he did not have a criminal record, and was worried for his wife and four U.S.-born children.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/19/multimedia/19met-congress-ice-01-lvzg/19met-congress-ice-01-lvzg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 14:57:43.463179

2025 unfolded as a year when record global displacement collided with the most sweeping rollback of U.S. humanitarian policies in recent history. On January 20, the new Trump administration took office and swiftly issued hundreds of executive orders reshaping immigration and humanitarian assistance, and slashing billions in approved humanitarian aid. At the same time, more than 122 million people around the world were forcibly displaced — one in every 67 individuals.

The effect was seismic. The U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) was suspended, Humanitarian Parole programs were stripped away, and USAID was shut down. These moves weren’t just bureaucratic: they cut off vital lifelines for the most vulnerable. Removals surged, often without sufficient due process, and the U.S./Mexico border was closed to people seeking asylum. The consequences of the aid cuts have been felt globally — and they will compound for years to come. One recent study estimates that 14 million lives are at risk if these cuts continue through 2030.

Within the first week, HIAS’ clients and programs had been dramatically affected, and many of our government contracts suspended. However, HIAS remained unwavering, strategically pivoting our resources and programs to continue providing protection, mental health support, and economic empowerment initiatives for displaced people seeking to rebuild their lives.

Your support matters

Your donation will empower HIAS to provide life-saving humanitarian assistance to refugees and displaced people where and when it’s needed most.

How Did Policy Changes Affect People Seeking Safety?

The U.S. government’s policy shifts weren’t hypothetical — they had real, immediate costs for people across the globe. Asylum seekers saw pathways to safety shut down. Families approved for resettlement suddenly found themselves stranded. Individuals on TPS felt exposed to swift removals. Border restrictions at the U.S.–Mexico border fueled not just fear, but reverse migration: people who could no longer seek protection in the U.S. opted instead to move south, risking dangerous routes along the way.

For decades, the United States has been the world’s largest provider of foreign assistance. This humanitarian aid is what keeps people alive when everything else has been stripped away. It’s clean water when wells run dry. Medical care when illness strikes. Safe shelter when violence forces families to flee. It’s food for hungry children, trauma counseling for survivors, and a lifeline for people who’ve lost everything.

HIAS teams throughout our country offices reported increasing vulnerability along migration paths: loss of shelter, dwindling food access, and rising exposures to violence and exploitation. These risks were not isolated; they reflected a broader contraction of safety mechanisms at the very moment people needed them most.

Meanwhile, in regions already reeling from crisis, the impact of shrinking aid was devastating. In Africa and Eurasia, where conflicts in Sudan and Ukraine displaced millions, HIAS’ protection work became more urgent even as funding declined.

How Did HIAS’ Global Footprint Change in 2025?

Faced with deep funding cuts and policy headwinds, HIAS had to make hard decisions. Several country offices were closed, staff were laid off, and longstanding partnerships were disrupted. These losses were painful, but they came with a clear guiding priority: preserving core services for displaced people.

Even as our footprint contracted, HIAS remained deeply embedded in client communities. Our teams restructured programs, leaned on trusted local partners, and sustained essential services. Legal protection continued. Mental health and psychosocial support remained central. Economic empowerment programs pressed on in the places where they could make the most difference.

How Did HIAS Fight Back?

In 2025, we filed two major lawsuits. Pacito v. Trump which was the leading legal challenge to the suspension of refugee resettlement, and Global Health Council v. Trump, which challenged the freeze on foreign assistance, even reaching the Supreme Court. Through these legal actions, HIAS reaffirmed its deep commitment to justice, fighting not only for policy change but also for the rights and dignity of forcibly displaced people everywhere.

But our response didn’t stay in the courtroom. HIAS mobilized Jewish communities nationwide, engaging more than 600 congregations in advocacy, training, and direct welcome efforts. We partnered with broad coalitions, advocated to Congress, and provided expert analysis to spotlight how asylum bans, immigration court erosion, and funding cuts harmed real people.

Our fight reflected a core principle: seeking safety is a fundamental human right.

Where Did Hope and Impact Emerge in a Year of Crisis?

2025 was a challenging and devastating time when we saw the safety and dignity of the people we serve come under attack. Throughout the year, our values guided HIAS’ response and in partnership with our supporters, we saw lives transformed.

Welcome: Across the U.S., Welcome Circles stepped up. Volunteers helped Afghans with Special Immigrant Visas (SIVs) with housing, school enrollment, medical care, and social integration. Through our Welcome Campaign, Jewish congregations stepped up to educate, advocate, and provide direct support — ensuring that welcome did not disappear when resettlement paused.

Justice: Our legal actions weren’t just about policy; they were about people. HIAS’ lawsuits protected rights and dignity, defending displaced individuals from removal and fighting to restore critical humanitarian assistance.

Empathy: We didn’t just provide services — we offered care. In Israel, displaced families received cash assistance and trauma-informed mental health support. In Ukraine, our group counseling helped parents and caregivers process ongoing war trauma. In Panama, Colombia, and Ecuador survivors of violence accessed culturally sensitive case management and psychological support.

Partnership: Strategic alliances helped us do more where it mattered. In Colombia, we worked with NGOs and municipalities to support growing numbers of Venezuelan migrants. In Chad, our collaboration with UN agencies expanded psychosocial care and protection for Sudanese refugees.

Courage: Refugees themselves became leaders. Our refugee clients in Kenya participated in advocacy and leadership initiatives. In Ecuador, refugee women shared their stories, pushed for change, and built safer, more inclusive communities.

Resilience: Stories of rebuilding emerged everywhere. In the U.S., one refugee entrepreneur launched her company — then, after her home and vehicle were destroyed by a hurricane, rebuilt with support from HIAS’ Economic Advancement Fund. She not only restarted her business but grew it, creating jobs and contributing to her community.

Real lives — like those of a family beginning a new life in the U.S. because of HIAS’ lawsuit, or Sudanese refugees in Chad finding healing and recovery — show what steadfast support can achieve even in the darkest moments.

What Comes Next for HIAS?

HIAS enters 2026 with new leadership, clear resolve, and renewed purpose. In a moment when refugees and displaced people are experiencing great challenge, our work has never been more critical. As we have for over 120 years, HIAS will spend every day of 2026 advocating for the rights and safety of refugees and working within communities to offer programs that provide protection, healing, and opportunity.

The last few weeks of 2025 brought renewed attacks on refugees and immigrants. But even though the policy landscape has become more hostile, we take heart in the knowledge that public support for refugees and immigrants has grown, and that together with our supporters we can make a profound impact. HIAS will carry on standing with refugees — offering welcome, demanding justice, and nurturing resilience. Because seeking safety is not a privilege. It is a fundamental human right.

ICE was at or near Horizon Primary School, Dublin City Schools, and Scioto High School, as well as several other locations such as the immigrant neighborhoods and grocery stores across the city.
Shannon Harding, president of Columbus City Council, wrote on Facebook that the city is not participating in, or helping with, ICE’s enforcement activity—but also said they can’t stop them, either.
Even as I write this, friends are sending me new photographs every few minutes of law enforcement activity, including some photos of officers wearing green vests emblazoned with HSI in yellow block letters.
What is happening in Columbus this week is not law enforcement as most people understand it.","I received a disturbing text message from my sister yesterday afternoon: “ICE has been at the girls’ old school today.”

The girls, my nieces, used to attend World Language Immersion School in Columbus, Ohio, where they both studied French and developed rich relationships with the teachers and students. The school is situated in a quiet, residential neighborhood where kids often walk after school to the nearby shops in Clintonville to get ice cream or play board games.

ICE broke the peace yesterday. Local parents and community members say that ICE showed up at the school’s release time, likely targeting the large Latino/Hispanic population the school attracts. Neighbors and concerned parents—including my sister—showed up to make sure that students, most of whom are 11 to 14 years old, were able to get picked up and board their buses without being harassed.

ICE’s arrival in my hometown of Columbus follows a geographic pattern of concentrated enforcement in cities for a few days or weeks, and then moving on to the next town like roving bandits, more intent on instilling fear and sowing confusion rather than establishing law and order. Los Angeles. Chicago. Charlotte. Columbus. Your city could be next.

I spent most of 2013 to 2019 learning about the grassroots immigrant rights movement in the state and eventually playing a small role in creating the infrastructure and local policies that were intended to support the often ignored new American population in the city. ICE raids took place then, but they were rarer and more focused on organized crime, not nabbing people off the street outside middle schools and Home Depots.

My nieces’ former middle school wasn’t the only school ICE reportedly targeted. ICE was at or near Horizon Primary School, Dublin City Schools, and Scioto High School, as well as several other locations such as the immigrant neighborhoods and grocery stores across the city. As I wrote last week, Columbus is also home to a large Somali-American community that Trump cruelly disparaged.

These sightings all need to be verified through ground-truthing, but the precise locations are of secondary importance to the primary issue: the disruption caused for people living in the city who are legitimately worried about what ICE is doing, whether they are following the law, and who is being affected.

A loud, online, and radicalized minority of the country is undoubtedly gleeful over ICE’s arrest-bombing of various cities. But a growing number of Americans are having a hard time squaring the Trump administration’s claims online that they are going after the “worst of the worst” with the reality that ICE is circling schools and shopping centers to look for people who’s only observable immigration infraction is that they aren’t white.

City officials spoke out about immigration enforcement. Shannon Harding, president of Columbus City Council, wrote on Facebook that the city is not participating in, or helping with, ICE’s enforcement activity—but also said they can’t stop them, either. Harding said: “Feds are conducting operations in Columbus. I know our community is scared right now, but knowledge is power. Second Timothy tells us: ‘God did not give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and a sound mind.’” The city maintains a list of resources on its website.

City attorney Zach Klein said on Reddit that he was aware of ICE activity, warned residents to be safe, and added: “We know many of our immigrant families, friends, and neighbors are feeling anxious and afraid. You are all valued members of our city, and we’re fully committed to your safety.”

Community members have gone further by documenting ICE activity as it unfolds through photographs and videos, creating a list of vehicle descriptions and license plates associated with ICE, and coordinating across the city with social service organizations to provide responsive support to affected communities. Immigration attorneys are checking on their clients.

Even as I write this, friends are sending me new photographs every few minutes of law enforcement activity, including some photos of officers wearing green vests emblazoned with HSI in yellow block letters.

What is happening in Columbus this week is not law enforcement as most people understand it. It is a spectacle, meant to intimidate rather than protect. There is something especially corrosive about this kind of enforcement in a city like Columbus, which has spent decades welcoming newcomers and building a sense of shared community.

When federal agents descend on these spaces without transparency or accountability, they rupture trust not only among immigrant families, but among teachers, neighbors, and parents who suddenly find themselves forced into the role of first responders.

What unsettles me most is not only the fear this creates, but the recognition that this is now being normalized in a place I know well and for people close to me that I love. Columbus is not an abstraction to me; it is layered with relationships of the amazing people who have done so much to make the city a home for all of its residents. Watching the city become a site of heavy enforcement truly breaks my heart for all of the people who have to live through it.

Those groups respond to reports of ICE raids and often film them and blow whistles to deter agents.
“Minnesotans feel very targeted, because we love our Somali community.” Since Trump’s remarks about Somalis, more than 500 people signed up for training — up from 115.
Monday’s confrontation between responders and ICE agents happened i n State Representative Aisha Gomez’s district.
ICE alleges increased attacks on agents The immigration crackdown does have its supporters in Minnesota.","Long before you could see the crowd, you could hear them. The whistles and shouting carried blocks from the residential street in Minneapolis, where more than 70 people lined the sidewalk recording on their phones and hurling insults — and the occasional snowball — at a handful of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and their vehicles.

An ICE agent then forced a protester to the ground. Then, a woman lunged at him and the agent raised a baton, the crowd then erupting in anger at the escalation. At some point during the confrontation, an ICE supervisor called the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office for assistance.

“I got officers getting attacked,” said the supervisor, whose name was beeped out in a recording around 1:13 p.m. that was posted to X by the sheriff’s office. “We have 60 to 70 agitators that are fighting us.”

The deputies arrived, lining the sidewalk and watched as the crowd and the ICE officers moved from one end of the block to the other, past a car stopped on the street with its window broken. Deputies looked on as an ICE agent fired a few rounds of pepper balls into the street, sending some protesters and observers back in search of water to rinse their eyes.

The Department of Homeland Security’s latest immigration push into Minnesota, Operation Metro Surge, began Dec. 1. It’s been met with significant pushback in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, with citizens saying they are standing in solidarity with the Somali and wider immigrant community that they say have been targeted by the raids — and by derogatory comments from the U.S. president.

In a public post, the Hennepin County sheriff’s office stated its deputies didn’t witness any attacks or age nts needing medical attention and noted it doesn’t take part in civil immigration enforcement.

Gov. Tim Walz, the mayors of Minneapolis and Saint Paul and the Minneapolis police chief voiced their concerns about the new crackdown, which began after U.S. President Donald Trump called the Somali community in the city “garbage” and said ”we don’t want them in the country.

Minnesota has the largest Somali population in the U.S., at roughly 80,000 people, and most are American citizens.

In its first two weeks, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reported it had arrested more than 400 people from different backgrounds including some Somalis. DHS said those arrested included “pedophiles, rapists and violent thugs.""

Among those taken into custody was a 20-year-old American-born Somali man named Mubashir who was arrested on a lunch break. Though Mubashir was later released, the mayor condemned the arrest, and the head of the Minneapolis Police, which is not assisting, apologized to the man and called it embarrassing.

The American Civil Liberties Union is now representing Mubashir. In a statement to CBC News he said he “repeatedly told the agents that I was a U.S. citizen.” He said he attempted to show them his identification, but they “refused to even look at it.” Mubashir said he was brought to a detention facility because he is Somali-American.

“Their treatment of me was cruel, unnecessary and wrong.”

Too scared to leave the house

The crackdown has had a chilling effect; Somali businesses and cafes that are normally bustling are quiet.

“There’s people that aren’t leaving their house, because they’re scared of being mistaken for someone else and being captured,” said Farah, a member of the Somali community who is an American citizen. CBC News is only using his first name because he fears repercussions for himself and his family.

“There are people that have not gone out for groceries for days and weeks — and they’re citizens.”

Farah knows Mubashir and feels the weight of the last few weeks, saying he’s had trouble sleeping.

“It’s not normal for a president and a leader of an entire country — what considers itself the most well-developed country in the world — to be singling out a group of people and calling them garbage.”

Trump has repeatedly accused Somalis of stealing billions of dollars from Minnesota. It is true that dozens of Somali Americans — of the 80,000 living in the state — have been charged in a sprawling multi-million dollar fraud case involving a COVID-era funding program called Feed our Future. Since 2022, investigators have charged nearly 80 people, and the amount of funds believed to be stolen continues to balloon.

Farah said those crimes are real and those who committed them should be held accountable.

“But it uses that to draw a false conclusion. And that false conclusion is incredibly dangerous and incredibly insidious,” he said.

“People commit crimes, people do bad things,” he said. “But there's no way, there's no actual justification to ascribe that behaviour to a large group of people.”

Organizing a response

Dieu Do is part of the group that trains local Minnesotans who want to be a part of rapid response groups. Those groups respond to reports of ICE raids and often film them and blow whistles to deter agents.

“Folks are really scared,” said Do. “Minnesotans feel very targeted, because we love our Somali community.”

Since Trump’s remarks about Somalis, more than 500 people signed up for training — up from 115. The training session teaches would-be responders what their rights are and how to safely document raids.

“They’re everyday people … they’re restaurant owners, business owners, neighbours, teachers, nurses, health-care workers,” she said.

Do believes the rapid response teams who have been showing up to ICE operations are having an effect.

“They know they have to be really quick about their pickups, because if they take longer and folks are noticing and the community starts showing up, they will back down,” she said.

Monday’s confrontation between responders and ICE agents happened i n State Representative Aisha Gomez’s district. She stood in the crowd recording with her phone and ended up getting hit by a wave of wafting pepper pellet gas.

“I've been pepper-sprayed twice today. I'm not deterred. We're standing up for our community,” Gomez said.

“We basically have secret police on our streets. They don't identify themselves. They don't observe the basic kind of protocols that law enforcement are supposed to,” she said.

“I don't know how it ends, but I know that this community is saying no. They're saying that our neighbours are important to us, and we're not going to stand for their rights to be violated.

ICE alleges increased attacks on agents

The immigration crackdown does have its supporters in Minnesota. A number of Republicans have spoken in favour of it and eight county sheriff departments did sign agreements to work with ICE, although a recent decision from the state’s attorney general may change that.

In a statement to CBC News about Monday's confrontation, ICE St-Paul said its officers were in the area conducting “a targeted vehicle stop.” They said they were attacked by a crowd of rioters “who threw rocks, chunks of ice, assaulted officers and used pepper spray against law enforcement officers” and that some of their agents sustained injuries.

ICE said it arrested two U.S. citizens for “assaulting federal officers.” It said they also apprehended “two illegal aliens.”

ICE said its officers are facing about 11 times more assaults against them — without citing a timeframe for the comparison — and called on “sanctuary politicians, agitators and the media to turn the temperature down and stop calling for violence and resistance.”","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/15b8001f-66ad-4c65-b1cb-64ed314a733e,1766113093160/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%28147%2C0%2C1306%2C734%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-12-19 15:58:41.849353

The four were among a group of about 20 who had gathered at the ICE facility, near the Burlington Mall.
“The irony of the disturbing the peace charge is lurid,” Rosen told YourArlington.
Most immigrants detained in the state go through the facility.
Representatives from ICE and the Department of Homeland Security has not responded to requests for comment about this case and what the policy for such packages is a Burlington ICE.","Two Arlington residents were among four people charged Tuesday after they tried unsuccessfully to deliver care packages to detainees held at the Burlington ICE facility.

Roger Rosen and Eric Segal, both town residents, joined Sabine von Mering and the Rev. Fred Small, who were arrested by Burlington police officers.

“We want those who are detained to know that they are not forgotten, not now and not in any season,” the Rev. Sarah Lusche told GBH News. She is the senior minister at Old Cambridge Baptist Church and a licensed clinical social worker who was present when the four were arrested. “That’s what today was about — attempting to care for these members of our community who are being detained without due process by this administration’s regime of immigration terror.”

Lusche said the packages contained food, juice, hats, bedrolls and menstrual products. The latter two items, she said, were in response to media reports of detainees sleeping on concrete floors, and in the case of menstruation, “being made to sit in their own blood.”

“They were then told that they needed to leave the property and the group, very calmly and peacefully, said they were going to stay and wait there until they were able to deliver the packages,” she said.

The Burlington Police Department confirmed to various media outlets that the four were arrested for trespassing and disturbing the peace on Tuesday at 11:15 a.m.

The four were among a group of about 20 who had gathered at the ICE facility, near the Burlington Mall. “All four were told repeatedly to disburse from the front entrance and refused to do so after multiple attempts,” Police Chief Thomas Browne told GBH. “They knew they would be arrested and ultimately were, and then booked at our facility.”

According to The Boston Globe, https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/12/17/metro/burlington-ice-facility-arrests/ an officer wrote in the police report: “All four were directly in front of the main doors reading from a piece of paper. I repeated my advisement to move and Segal, Small, Von Mering and Rosen refused to do so.”

Segal and Rosen said the four did not block the entrance, citing photos they provided.

According to a police, The Globe reported: “DHS ICE would not take any property or supplies due to not being able to properly vet everything.”

Rosen has worked with families from Haiti and El Salvador in the United States and is a climate organizer. Segal is a retired tech executive who is known for helping immigrants. Von Mering is a climate activist, mother and naturalized citizen. Small left parish ministry in 2015 and is active in human rights advocacy.

“The irony of the disturbing the peace charge is lurid,” Rosen told YourArlington. “ICE, which violently disturbs the peace of every community it targets, is not held accountable for the violent cruelty of its unconstitutional abductions, while those who peacefully bring baskets of food and necessities to our immigrant sisters and brothers in need in the holiday season are swiftly arrested and handcuffed.

In a statement reported by GBH, Small wrote: “Masked ICE agents abducted Tufts graduate student Rümeysa Öztürk less than a mile from my home. Jesus told us to welcome the stranger. Instead, ICE is brutalizing our neighbors with wanton cruelty. In this Christmas season, I want to light a candle of kindness and compassion.”

“The blatant physical and emotional cruelty of ICE operations demands that we step outside our comfort zone to object,” Rosen wrote. “Our attempt to deliver these necessities to our immigrant brothers and sisters is a recognition of their humanity and their right to be treated with kindness and respect.”

Immigrants that have been detained and released from the Burlington processing center have shared reports of crowded cells, as well as lack of access to on-site medical attention and medication.

Most immigrants detained in the state go through the facility. Some high-profile stays included Marcelo Gomes Da Silva, an 18-year-old Milford high school student detained for six days and many of the immigrant employees of Allston Car Wash. One man, Dairo Preciado, said he slept on an air mattress that felt half-inflated so he could feel “metal bars under his back” and cried as he spoke of his experience there.

The building opened in 2007 and was approved under the town’s zoning code to temporarily hold immigrants for only a few hours. But the increase of immigrant detentions across Massachusetts has yielded greater numbers of people being brought to the center to be processed, and many of them have remained there for days, or even weeks.

U.S. Rep. Seth Moulton and Sen. Ed Markey have visited the facility, calling on the agency to improve conditions there and allow immigrants to meet their attorneys, family and clergy in-person.

A group of protesters, including some from Arlington, has been showing up Wednesdays since last spring.

In California, North Carolina, New Jersey, Minnesota, Colorado, West Virginia, and other states, community members and AFSC staff organized vigils, protests, and other events.

“We need immigration policies that are welcoming, and that give people an opportunity to adjust their status,” says U.S. Migration Director Amy Gottlieb. “Border walls and cages do not deter migration; they only harm our families and communities. With our actions, we resist this cruelty because we know our communities are stronger with immigrants.”

On Dec. 6, Friends in five cities across the country also joined together for the first “Love as Action” Quaker witness events. Events took place in Atlanta, Chicago, Des Moines, New York, and Philadelphia.

“At AFSC, we have been deeply disturbed by the authoritarian actions taking place in our country,” says U.S. South Region Director Jacob Flowers. “Like so many others, we feel compelled, with love leading us, to take public action. And as we often feel called, we wanted to do it as a public witness, to show that even a simple action of public witness can make a difference. To take one step of the many that we are all taking to build beloved community.”

Thank you to everyone who has joined us this month! We are grateful to all who are taking action—in many ways—to show that our communities are stronger with immigrants.",https://afsc.org/core/misc/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-19 13:57:40.827020

A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a lawsuit filed by a pro-Trump legal group seeking access to a trove of federal judiciary documents, including from a body overseen by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts – putting an end to a protracted legal fight brought by Trump allies seeking to access key judicial documents.

U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee assigned to the case earlier this year, dismissed the long-shot lawsuit brought by the America First Legal Foundation, the pro-Trump group founded by White House policy adviser Stephen Miller after Trump’s first term; Miller, now back in the White House, is no longer affiliated with AFL.

McFadden ultimately dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, saying Thursday that two groups responsible for certain regulatory and administrative functions for the federal judiciary are an extension of the judicial branch, and therefore protected by the same exemptions to federal laws granted to the judiciary.

""Nothing about either entity’s structure suggests the president must supervise their employees or otherwise keep them ‘accountable,’ as is the case for executive officers,"" McFadden said.

TRUMP'S EXECUTIVE ORDER ON VOTING BLOCKED BY FEDERAL JUDGES AMID FLURRY OF LEGAL SETBACKS

The lawsuit by AFL was first reported by Fox News Digital earlier this year. It named both Chief Justice Roberts in his capacity as the official head of the U.S. Judicial Conference, and Robert J. Conrad, the director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, and sought access to a trove of judicial documents from both bodies under the Freedom of Information Act.

AFL accused both groups of performing regulatory actions that the lawsuit argued exceeded the scope of the ""core functions"" of the judiciary, and which it argued should subject the groups to the FOIA requests as a result.

AFL cited recent actions the Judicial Conference and Administrative Office had taken in 2023 to ""accommodate"" requests from Congress to investigate allegations of ethical improprieties by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, and subsequently to create or adopt an ""ethics code"" for justices on the high court.

""Under our constitutional tradition, accommodations with Congress are the province of the executive branch,"" AFL argued.

""The Judicial Conference and the Administrative Office are therefore executive agencies,"" and must therefore be overseen by the president, not the courts, they said.

GORSUCH, ROBERTS SIDE WITH LEFT-LEANING SUPREME COURT JUSTICES IN IMMIGRATION RULING

McFadden disagreed, rejecting the group’s argument that ""courts"" under FOIA refers only to judges. He concluded that both the Judicial Conference and the Administrative Office are components of the judicial branch and therefore exempt from FOIA.

""Indeed, if America First were right that only judges and ‘law clerks,’ who ‘directly report to the judge,’ count as part of ‘the courts,’ numerous questions arise, and senseless line drawing ensues,"" he said in a memo opinion accompanying his order. ""Rather, FOIA’s exclusion reflects that courts include a full range of ‘judicial adjuncts,’ from ‘clerks’ to ‘court reporters,’ who perform ‘tasks that are an integral part of the judicial process.’""

Plaintiffs for AFL, led by attorney Will Scolinos, had argued in their lawsuit earlier this year that the Judicial Conference’s duties are ""executive functions"" and functions they allege must be supervised by executive officers ""who are appointed and accountable to other executive officers.""

Courts ""definitively do not create agencies to exercise functions beyond resolving cases or controversies or administratively supporting those functions,"" the group had argued.

The U.S. Judicial Conference is the national policymaking body for the courts. Overseen by the chief justice, it issues policy recommendations and reports to Congress as needed.

TRUMP IS THREATENING TO 'FEDERALIZE' DC WITH NATIONAL GUARD AND MORE. HERE'S HOW THAT COULD PLAY OUT

The Administrative Office for the U.S. Courts, meanwhile, operates under the guidance and supervision of the Judicial Conference. Its role is to provide administrative support to the federal courts on certain administrative issues and for day-to-day logistics, including setting budgets and organizing data, among other things.

The news comes as President Donald Trump, in his first year back in the White House, has relied heavily on executive orders to advance his agenda — a strategy that has accelerated implementation of campaign promises but also prompted a surge of legal challenges.

If there was no deal, the U.S. would tie its drug prices to the costs set by other countries.","The political party that has historically pitched itself as a proponent of “states’ rights” is now advocating for a mass federal seizure of state land.

Speaking with Newsmax on Friday, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum suggested that the next course of action to curb immigration across the southern U.S. border should involve transferring “strips” of California to the federal government.

“We have an opportunity to take a strip of land right along the border, transfer it to the military for a three-year period. Which then, if someone crosses into our country and steps on that, they’re stepping on a military installation,” Burgum said. “That gives our troops that are down there working to secure that border more authorities about detaining people. If they step on that land, it helps to improve the security.”

It’s an escalation of a plan that the White House enacted earlier this year, when it took a 60-foot-wide strip of federal land across three states and turned the entire region into a “military installation.” Doing so effectively allowed Donald Trump to sidestep the Posse Comitatus Act, circumventing Congress to wield the military for border control.

The military base designation was supposed to expand the troops’ authority, granting them the ability to “temporarily detain trespassers” and to “conduct cursory searches of trespassers … to ensure the safety of U.S. service members and Department of Defense (DoD) property.”

But even that effort was unsuccessful. In May, a federal judge dismissed charges against nearly 100 immigrants that the administration claimed had entered the “national defense” zone, determining that the government had failed to prove the immigrants were aware they were entering a restricted military area.

Seizing land in California could prove to be an even bigger catastrophe. In the same interview, Burgum—the former governor of North Dakota—suggested that the best location to usurp state land would be “near the Pacific,” on the basis that the region is “an area of high traffic.”

Not even Fox Business can pretend like President Donald Trump isn’t wrecking the economy.

Fox Business anchors Lauren Simonetti and Stuart Varney reported Friday that a University of Michigan survey found that an index of consumer sentiment had sunk even further since mid-December.

There had been a “surprise drop” in consumer sentiment to 52.9 percent confidence in the economy, Simonetti said. That’s down from 53.3 percent just slightly earlier this month, CNBC reported separately.

“Consumers are just worried about the price of things and long-run inflation expectations as well,” Simonetti added.

“But with rather these dull numbers, the market seems to like it. Perhaps implying that we’ll get more Fed rate cuts,” Varney noted.

“The weakness, I think, is attractive. Bad news is actually good news for the market, maybe.”

While it may be good for the market in the short term, consumer confidence is an accurate means of understanding the current economic situation and consumers’ willingness to spend, borrow, or invest. It can take several months before low consumer confidence is fully realized.

In December 2024, before Trump ever imposed his slate of disastrous economic policies, such as tariff wars and mass deportations, Michigan’s consumer sentiment index had been 74 percent, indicating a nearly 30 percent plummet year over year.

And it gets worse.

The survey’s rating of the “current economic conditions” was only 50.4 percent, down from 51.1 in November. CNBC reported that this was “a new all-time low” for the study going all the way back to the 1970s. In December, the rating had been 75.1, showing a nearly 33 percent drop year over year.

More on what’s happening in the White House:

The more details that emerge about Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump, the clearer it is that the two shared a wildly unconventional—and creepy—relationship.

Hours after The New York Times reported Thursday that Epstein and Trump bonded over “trophy hunting,” investigative reporter Nicholas Confessore told MS NOW that Epstein frequently allowed his friends and associates to listen in on private phone calls where he and Trump shared details of their “sexual conquests.”

“So we spoke to several former assistants and employees of Jeffrey Epstein’s,” Confessore said. “And he had a habit of putting Donald Trump and other famous friends on the phone. It was partly a power play and partly a way that he groomed people. ‘See how powerful I am. I can put this person on the phone. I can get them on the phone, I can put them on speaker. We’re friends. That’s how powerful I am.’

“It was a way that he groomed people and he would put Donald Trump on the phone. They would talk about sex,” he added.

Trump has vehemently denied this year that he had any sort of meaningful connection to the deceased child sex trafficker, but that wasn’t always the case. Over the last couple of decades, Trump has switched his tune on Epstein several times. In 2002, Trump told New York magazine that Epstein was a “terrific guy.” He wrote a repugnant and allusory letter to Epstein for the sex trafficker’s 50th birthday. They were spotted socializing together, with young women many times, and even ended up living in the same Florida neighborhood.

But since ascending to the forefront of American power, Trump has claimed that he had “no relationship” with Epstein, pitching—despite troves of evidence to the contrary—that he was “not a fan of his.”

People around the pair of socialites, however, were under the impression that Epstein and Trump were each other’s closest friends, and Epstein reportedly believed it too.

“I think that Jeffrey Epstein thought he was Donald Trump’s closest friend for a period,” Confessore said. “They spent a lot of time talking on the phone about women and sexual conquests. They spent time at Trump Tower or over at Jeffrey Epstein’s offices nearby on Madison Avenue. They flew on each other’s planes, and they partied together a lot. And a lot of parties with women, people who are younger than they are.”

The phone calls were an instance of Epstein using Trump, wielding the real estate magnate’s name to advance his own social standing and access, according to Confessore.

Trump has not been charged with any crimes related to Epstein or his longtime associate and sex-trafficking partner, Ghislaine Maxwell.

But the country is on the precipice of knowing just about everything there is to know about the pair’s scandalous relationship. The administration is preparing to release the totality of the Epstein files Friday, as required by a law passed by Congress last month.

So far, the administration has already attempted to waylay public expectations that the files will be exposed to the full breadth of the document load, with FBI Director Kash Patel claiming that his agency is doing everything it can to release the portions of the files that are “lawful,” despite the fact that Congress mandated their entire release.

A Wisconsin judge has been convicted of obstructing federal government proceedings by allowing an immigrant man to exit her courtroom through a side door.

Judge Hannah Dugan was acquitted Thursday night of a lesser charge of obstructing an arrest, but she still faces up to five years in prison. Having now been convicted of a felony, she is likely ineligible to continue serving from the bench. The judge’s lawyers have vowed to appeal the ruling.

Witnesses testified that Dugan sent away several plainclothes Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who came to the Milwaukee County Courthouse to detain Eduardo Flores-Ruiz. She then told Flores-Ruiz’s lawyer that she would reschedule his hearing and directed them to exit her courtroom through a door typically used by the jury.

In an audio recording played in court, Dugan could be heard conferring with the court reporter. “I’ll do it,” she said. “I’ll get the heat.”

Flores-Ruiz then used a public courthouse hallway, walked past a couple of DEA agents, got into an elevator, and exited the building before ICE officers could stop him.

Dugan’s lawyers had cited Trump v. United States in arguing that their client had judicial immunity for official acts and broad authority over her own courtroom.

The ruling is a victory for President Donald Trump’s Justice Department, which seeks to paint judges who don’t greenlight his immigration crackdown as “deranged” rogue actors.

Protests and event messages about ICE could now be grounds for domestic terrorism investigations by the FBI.

The Guardian reports that the bureau has launched cases in 23 regions across the U.S. related to “threats against immigration enforcement activity.” The investigations fit into the new NSPM-7 national security strategy targeting supposed anti-American activity on the left. That document referred to protests against ICE in Los Angeles and Portland as examples of “political violence.”

The investigations were laid out in an internal report drafted by the FBI in November and shared with other law enforcement agencies. The report mentions that using encrypted messaging apps to discuss ICE was considered an indicator of whether a person would engage in terrorism, as well as “stockpiling or distributing firearms” but also “conducting online research” about agents.

The document has alarmed privacy advocates and civil rights groups, who said that it confirmed their fears that the NSPM-7 document would be used to crack down on dissent. In over 30 states, the FBI has opened cases related to anti-ICE activity or NSPM-7, a map in the document shows.

“[The FBI document] is infused with vague and overbroad language, which was exactly our concern about NSPM-7 in the first place. It invites law enforcement suspicion and investigation based on purely first amendment-protected beliefs and activities,” Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU National Security Project, told The Guardian. “People who are entirely innocent of any wrongdoing can be subjected to surveillance or investigation. That imposes stigma. It can wrongly [enmesh] people in the criminal legal system.”

Coupled with its declaration that antifa, or anti-fascism, is a terrorist organization, these actions by the Trump administration seek to clamp down on any protests or dissent against its policies. It’s not far-fetched to imagine federal law enforcement cracking down on President Trump’s political opposition, using these documents to justify its actions, all in the name of fighting terrorism.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem thinks that the diversity immigrant visa program, commonly known as the green card lottery, was responsible for the Brown University shooting and is pausing the program.

Noem announced on X Thursday night, “At President Trump’s direction, I am immediately directing USCIS to pause the DV1 program to ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous program.”

The suspect of the Brown University and MIT shootings was identified Thursday as Claudio Manuel Neves Valente. According to Noem, Valente, 48, was a Portuguese national and former Brown University student who entered the country through the program in 2017. He was found dead Thursday at a storage facility in New Hampshire, apparently having committed suicide.

Targeting the entire visa program because of one crime is excessive, but fits into a Trump administration pattern of finding pretexts for drastic immigration restrictions. Much of it is based on racism, and comes from executive actions seeking to circumvent laws passed by Congress. Afghan immigrants, for example, are facing increased difficulty because of the shooting of two National Guard members last month.

It seems the Trump administration is going to make the Brown University shooting all about immigration instead of focusing on the crime itself, showing that xenophobia is paramount in its concerns.

The White House has finally been called out for fabricating its pharmaceutical savings—and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick did not handle it well.

For months, Donald Trump has seemingly grabbed numbers out of thin air to impress an ignorant public—or his sycophantic followers—on his allegedly great pharmaceutical deals, boasting that he has “cut drug prices by 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500 percent.”

The lie continued on Wednesday night, when Trump said during his national address he had negotiated to cut drug prices by “400, 500, and even 600 percent.”

But Fox News host John Roberts saw through the numerical gibberish, excoriating Lutnick during an interview Thursday and stressing that the math was simply “not possible.”

“Well, if you cut something by 100 percent the cost goes down to zero,” Roberts said. “If you cut it by 4-, 5-, 600 percent, the drug companies are actually paying you to take their product.

“So tell me, how much of last night’s speech was hyperbole and how much was fact?” the host asked.

But Lutnick’s reply didn’t make much sense, either.

“No, what he’s saying is—bringing—if a drug was $100 and you bring the drug down to $13, right? If you’re looking at it from $13, it’s down seven times,” Lutnick said.

“No, it’s not—” Roberts interjected.

“Well, but it’s 700 percent higher price before. It’s down 700 percent now. So, $13 would have to go up 700 percent to get back to the old one. You could say, it’s down 87 percent, or you could say it would have to go up 700 percent to be the same one. So it just depends on the way you look at it,” Lutnick said, before insisting that the American public “all know what he’s saying.”

“We are hammering the price of drugs down,” Lutnick emphasized.

But the president has not tangibly lowered drug costs. In May, Trump penned an executive order that set a 30-day deadline for drugmakers to negotiate lower prices. If there was no deal, the U.S. would tie its drug prices to the costs set by other countries. But despite that threat, there hasn’t been any noticeable movement in either direction.

In November, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services announced that it had negotiated new prices for 15 expensive drugs covered by Medicare’s prescription drug program, Part D. The negotiations were conducted in the second round of Medicare’s Drug Price Negotiation Program, which was enacted by the previous administration under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Still, the cost of those drugs—which include Ozempic and Wegovy—isn’t expected to decrease until 2027.

Instead, evidence exists that drug prices have actually gone up for some 700 medications during Trump’s second term, according to a September report by the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.

Trump has previously posited that the affordable price tags on pharmaceuticals in other countries was due to American federal subsidies, which he claimed were financially offsetting their prices. But that’s not reality: The U.S. pays more for drugs because it’s an outlier among high-income, first-world countries, which predominantly support universal public health coverage.

Potential solutions that researchers argue could meaningfully address high drug prices in the U.S. include restricting pharmaceutical monopolies within the country, reworking insurance benefits to hamper out-of-pocket expenses, and recentralizing price negotiations through the leverage of a single-payer system (such as Australia, Germany, the U.K., or any number of other wealthy nations), according to a report by the Commonwealth Fund, a private American foundation focused on health care reform.",https://images.newrepublic.com/eca16c86edd1df48772d8f1456438b63013f622a.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg,N,,2025-12-19 15:58:04.175006

Two students were killed and nine others injured at Brown University on Dec. 13 when a man opened fire inside an engineering building. Two days later, Nuno Loureiro, 47, a professor of nuclear science and engineering, and of physics, was found shot dead at his home in Brookline, Massachusetts, about 40 miles from Brown. The same gunman was responsible for the two incidents, authorities said.

The Diversity Immigrant Visa program, known as DV1, allows up to 50,000 people a year from countries with a low immigration rate to the U.S. to apply to come to the United States. The shooter, 48-year-old Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, entered the U.S. in 2017 through that program, according to law enforcement authorities.

“This heinous individual should never have been allowed in our country,” Noem said in a social media post that announced the decision.

At Trump’s direction, Noem said she ordered U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to immediately “pause” the program.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to questions about why Noem believed Valente should not have been admitted. His entry to the U.S. under that program occurred during Trump’s first term.

Trump unsuccessfully urged Congress to terminate the visa lottery in 2017 after another recipient, Sayfullo Saipov of Uzbekistan, carried out an Islamic State-inspired attack in Lower Manhattan that killed eight people and injured 18 others. Saipov was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.

Authorities said they did not know what had motivated the gunman in the recent shootings at Brown University and Brookline. But Valente and Loureiro had attended the same academic program in Portugal, Leah Foley, the U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts told reporters.

Valente was living in Miami before he came to Boston last month, authorities said.

The Trump administration has also sought to crack down on immigration following an attack in Washington, D.C., last month, in which an Afghan immigrant opened fire on two National Guard members, killing one and wounding the other. The administration paused immigration applications from 19 countries it deemed high risk, halted asylum cases processed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and suspended all immigration-related requests from Afghan nationals, before further expanding its travel ban this week.

The suspect, Claudio Neves Valente, a Portuguese national, entered the country in 2017 through the diversity visa (DV) program, which makes up to 55,000 immigrant visas available worldwide through random selection, according to the State Department.

The program prioritizes those from countries with low immigration rates to the U.S. Applicants can then apply for a green card and are subject to the same standards as others seeking permanent residency.

“In 2017, President Trump fought to end this program, following the devastating NYC truck ramming by an ISIS terrorist, who entered under the DV1 program, and murdered eight people,” Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem wrote Thursday on the social platform X.

“At President Trump’s direction, I am immediately directing USCIS to pause the DV1 program to ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous program,” she added.

It’s unclear whether Trump has the power to suspend the visa lottery, which was established by Congress.

Immigration advocates blasted the move as unfairly punishing many based on the actions of one.

“It’s unjust to block the legal immigration processes of tens of thousands of people who have absolutely nothing to do with this offense, except that they happened to have applied for the same type of visa,” Myal Greene, president of World Relief, said in a statement.

“This is the latest instance of the administration leveraging an isolated evil action to advance its goal of dramatically reducing legal immigration. In doing so, it is circumventing Congress, harming our national economy and penalizing law-abiding individuals who have waited patiently abroad in one of the limited lines available to immigrate lawfully under the law.”

Valente was found dead inside a New Hampshire storage closet on Thursday, after authorities learned of his whereabouts through a person who came forward with information about the suspect.

The Saturday shooting at Brown University resulted in two deaths, just days before MIT professor Nuno F.G. Loureiro was shot and killed. The FBI previously said there was no link between the two cases.

Targeting the immigration pathway used by the shooter is the second such example in recent weeks of the Trump administration broadly restricting immigration in response to an incident.

An Afghan national was arrested in connection with the fatal shooting of a National Guard member last month in Washington, D.C. The Trump administration then placed a hold on all pending asylum applications and paused all pending immigration cases by foreign nationals from the 19 countries deemed “high risk” under Trump’s travel ban.

The president also took actions to limit immigration for Afghanistan specifically, halting the processing of any visas for the country, effectively ending the pathway for those who aided American war efforts there to the U.S.

In August, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said it would evaluate whether an applicant has “good moral character” and take a more “holistic” approach to asylum and citizenship applications.

USCIS said officers must now weigh not just any disqualifying behavior but whether those seeking a pathway to citizenship are in good standing in their community.

USCIS’ National Records Center maintains more than 55.6 million immigration records and has the largest federal FOIA program.
To compare, between Sept. 15 and Dec. 15, 2024, USCIS closed 5,427 FOIA requests due to individuals submitting inaccurate or incorrect information, according to the document.
While immigration policy has been a priority of the Trump administration due to mass deportations, the whistleblower disclosure shows that the FOIA issues at USCIS predate the current president.
“The imbalance caused by FOIA compliance failures creates a substantial and specific threat to public safety as processing delays result in unjust deportations, prolonged detention and family separation.”","U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said in a Dec. 15 compliance report that it reduced its Freedom of Information Act request backlog for certain immigration records by 99.96% over the course of three months, an impressive feat given recent workforce cuts to agency FOIA teams and a 43-day government shutdown occurred during the period.

But a whistleblower disclosure sent to the Senate Homeland Security and Judiciary committees on Friday argues that the agency has adopted unnecessarily strict criteria to summarily reject FOIA requests from migrants seeking documents for their immigration proceedings.

“The circumstances alongside the whistleblower’s disclosures suggest the reported reduction does not reflect timely, good-faith FOIA processing but rather mass closures of requests and other procedural mechanisms that remove requests from the pending inventory without reasonable searches or release of responsive records,” according to the document.

In 2020, a federal judge in Nightingale v. USCIS ordered the agency to meet statutory FOIA deadlines (generally 20-30 business days) for A-File immigration record requests, eliminate existing backlogs for such requests within 60 days and submit quarterly compliance reports.

USCIS’ National Records Center maintains more than 55.6 million immigration records and has the largest federal FOIA program.

In the disclosure submitted to Congress, which was handled by the Government Accountability Project nonprofit, an unnamed disabled Marine veteran who has worked in the agency’s FOIA office for more than a decade alleged that policies enacted over the past two years are intended to manufacture compliance with the Nightingale order.

Due to changes made in May, for example, the whistleblower said that migrants are receiving documents that are entirely redacted due to privacy and law enforcement reasons, even when it is information that the individual themselves provided to the government.

And in September, according to the disclosure, FOIA staff were ordered not to act on requests if the individual lists their attorney’s address instead of their own, which has been a common practice, or the requestor’s last name isn’t exactly the one USCIS has on file.

As a result, an individual who submitted a FOIA request about a month before their immigration court hearing on Nov. 24 did not receive their records because they provided non-requisite additional information that listed their parents’ maternal surnames, which USCIS did not have listed (e.g. Adam Lane Owen versus Adam Lane). This rejection occurred despite the A-File record numbers matching.

The whistleblower did say that the agency has begun informing individuals if their FOIA request is denied due to mismatched parents’ names, but they also pointed out that such notice is not helpful unless the requestor can successfully guess how their parents are listed in the agency’s records.

To compare, between Sept. 15 and Dec. 15, 2024, USCIS closed 5,427 FOIA requests due to individuals submitting inaccurate or incorrect information, according to the document. During the same period in 2025, there were 41,918 such rejections.

While immigration policy has been a priority of the Trump administration due to mass deportations, the whistleblower disclosure shows that the FOIA issues at USCIS predate the current president.

In fact, the first policy change mentioned in the disclosure occurred in March 2024 when FOIA officials apparently instructed employees to tell Cuban nationals who request certain documents that confirm their entry or admission to the U.S. that there’s no record, even though USCIS could possess that information.

“Without timely access to their records, individuals face a severe information imbalance. Government attorneys and immigration prosecutors have full access to the A-File while the noncitizen and their counsel remain in the dark,” according to the disclosure. “The imbalance caused by FOIA compliance failures creates a substantial and specific threat to public safety as processing delays result in unjust deportations, prolonged detention and family separation.”",https://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/cd/2025/12/19/121925_Getty_GovExec_USCIS/open-graph.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 12:57:36.506241

DoJ racing to redact documents ahead of deadline to release Epstein files - report

Congress has mandated that the Trump administration release a trove of Epstein-related files by tomorrow – and the Justice Department is racing to process thousands of pages of documents and images.

In an exclusive, CNN reports that the Justice Department is racing to redact thousands of pages in oder to protect victims, and address executive and legal privacy concerns. Per CNN, counterintelligence specialists “ were asked to drop nearly all of their other work”.

Today, House Democrats released several dozen more photos from Epstein’s estate, which show his associations with the rich and famous, including images of Epstein cooking with Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, an Emirati businessman, an image of billionaire Bill Gates posing with a woman whose face has been redacted. Another photo shows prominent linguist and philosopher Noam Chomsky sitting on a plane with Epstein.

Today's recap

House oversight Democrats released a new batch of photos from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, in a last-ditch effort to pressure the DOJ to abide by tomorrow’s deadline to release its files related to the convicted sex offender. The images are undated and lack captions or context, and the appearance of people in the photos is not evidence of wrongdoing. Among them are photographs of what appear to be lines from the novel Lolita written on different parts of a woman’s body. There are also photographs of Bill Gates posing with a woman whose face has been redacted, and of the prominent linguist and philosopher Noam Chomsky sitting on a plane with Epstein. Other images show Woody Allen, the director; Steve Bannon, Trump’s former adviser; and David Brooks, the author and New York Times opinion columnist, among others. The batch also includes photos of a number of foreign passports, with the information redacted, as well as Epstein’s US passport. There is also a screenshot of a text message conversation from a unknown sender referring to an 18-year-old from Russia. The sender says “I have a friend scout she sent me some girls today” then sends “But she asks 1000$ per girl”. Following messages read “I will send u girls now”, and “Maybe someone will be good for J?”.

Congressional Democrats expect that Trump’s Justice Department will comply with the deadline to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein, House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries said Thursday.“Based on my conversations with some of the top Democrats who’ve been working on this matter related to the full and complete disclosure of the Epstein files, we do expect compliance,” Jeffries said, according to The Hill. “But if the Department of Justice does not comply with what is federal law at this point, there will be strong bipartisan pushback.”

In a statement after the release, Robert Garcia, a US representative and ranking member of the committee on oversight and government reform, said: “Oversight Democrats will continue to release photographs and documents from the Epstein estate to provide transparency for the American people.” “As we approach the deadline for the Epstein Files Transparency Act, these new images raise more questions about what exactly the Department of Justice has in its possession. We must end this White House cover-up, and the DoJ must release the Epstein files now.”

Elsewhere, Robert F Kennedy Jr unveiled new actions aimed at eliminating transition-related medical care for minors across the US, referring to such treatments as “sex-rejecting procedures”. As part of the effort, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will initiate a rule-making process that would prevent hospitals from offering puberty blockers, hormone treatments, or surgical procedures to minors if they wish to participate in Medicare or Medicaid. The proposal would also prohibit Medicaid funds from being used to cover this type of care. Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (Chip) together cover nearly half of all American children. More here.

New York Attorney General, Letitia James responded to the Trump administration’s new actions eliminating gender-affirming care for minors, addressing families in the state: “I know this latest proposal from this administration to cut access to gender affirming care for many youth is frightening,” she said in a video, posted to social media. “Whether you live in Brooklyn, Binghamton, Buffalo, or anywhere else in New York, and even if you don’t live in New York, I will not let this administration come for you, your doctors, or your lifesaving healthcare. As of now, nothing has changed.”

Trump also signed an executive order to move marijuana out of the most restrictive drug category, a change that would loosen limits on research and certain regulations but stop short of making marijuana legal nationwide. “I’m pleased to announce that I will be signing an Executive Order to reschedule marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III controlled substance with legitimate medical uses,” the president said from the Oval Office. “This reclassification order will make it far easier to conduct marijuana-related medical research, allowing us to study benefits, potential dangers and future treatments,” Trump added. “It’s going to have a tremendously positive impact.” The action allows for a pilot program that reimburses Medicare patients for products containing CBD, a widely used cannabis-derived compound that does not produce a high. Under the order, marijuana would be shifted from Schedule I, a category that includes heroin, to Schedule III, which also includes ketamine. The move, however, would not legalize marijuana as some states have done, and would not change how law enforcement agencies handle marijuana-related arrests, according to senior administration officials who spoke to the New York Times.

The Senate has confirmed 97 of Donald Trump’s executive and judicial nominations en bloc.

This comes after Senate Republicans changed chamber rules to allow for the bundled consideration executive nominees with a simple majority vote. Those confirmed today include state department spokesperson Tammy Bruce to be deputy US representative to the United Nation, and NY Republican congressman Anthony D’Esposito as Labor inspector general.

Brent Bozell III, who was US ambassador to South Africa, is the father of Brent Bozell IV, who was convicted of storming the Capitol on Jan. 6.

Lawyers for Mark Kelly, the democratic senator of Arizona, have issued a letter asking defense secretary Pete Hegseth to clarify the nature of his investigation of Kelly.

On Monday, the Defense Department said it was elevating a “review” of Kelly’s involvement in a video he and other Democratic lawmakers made reminding service members it was their duty to disobey illegal orders. Kelly, a former naval officer, would be under an “official Command Investigation”, the department said.

Kelly’s lawyers issued a letter today, asking the secretary to clarify whther a command investigation had in fact commenced, who ordered the investigation, and under what authority, what allegations were under investigation, and on what basis the department of defense was claiming to assert jurisdiction over Kelly.

“The investigation appears to be premised entirely on accurate statements of law that the Senator made in his capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The First Amendment plainly protects those statements, just as it would protect similar statements by other retired servicemembers. In addition, a command investigation of a sitting Member of Congress who is not subject to military command authority would breach numerous constitutional and statutory safeguards,” the lawyers write.

Military law experts have said that although retired military officers can be recalled to active duty, Hegseth’s investigation into Kelly is an irregular use of of the military justice system. Democrats and some Republicans have also questioned the merits of the investigation.

In a joint statement, Democratic lawmakers and all ex-officio members of the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees condemned Trump’s efforts to rename the Kennedy Center.

Beyond using the Kennedy Center to reward his friends and political allies, President Trump is now attempting to affix his name to yet another public institution without legal authority. Federal law established the Center as a memorial to President Kennedy and prohibits changing its name without Congressional action. At today’s meeting, a sitting Member of Congress was muted, and participants were prevented from speaking—actions that reflect a troubling lack of transparency and respect for the rule of law. This whole process displays the corruption that permeates the entire Trump Administration, and as ex-officio members of the Kennedy Center Board, we will be unwavering in our commitment to holding this Administration accountable.”

The statement was signed by Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island senator Mark Warner of Virginia, representative Rick Larsen of Washgington and representative Joyce Beatty of Ohio.

And most importantly, I want you to know that you’re not alone.”

While Donald Trump claimed during an address Wednesday that “inflation has stopped,” a rosy consumer price report released earlier today has prompted skepticism among economists.

Trump’s Bureau of Labor Statistics said the consumer price index (CPI) saw an annual inflation rate of 2.7% last month--lower than the 3.1 percent economists had predicted, CNBC reported.

But the Bureau of Labor statistics did not collect data in October because of the government shutdown, leaving analysts wondering about how this affected interpretation of November’s data.

Michael Gapen, chief US economist at Morgan Stanley, reportedly said “the downside surprise reflects weakness in both goods and services, but may be partly due to methodological issues.”

“If these technical factors are the main source of weakness, we could see reacceleration in December,” CNBC quoted Gapen as saying.

Democrats expect DoJ to comply with Epstein files deadline, Jeffries says

Congressional Democrats expect that Trump’s Justice Department will comply with the deadline to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein, House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries said Thursday.

“Based on my conversations with some of the top Democrats who’ve been working on this matter related to the full and complete disclosure of the Epstein files, we do expect compliance,” Jeffries said, according to The Hill. “But if the Department of Justice does not comply with what is federal law at this point, there will be strong bipartisan pushback.”

Congress passed a bill in November mandating that Trump’s Justice Department release investigative files within 30 days without redactions, with few exceptions such as victims’ names. Despite wavering on releasing the files, Trump signed the legislation into law on November 19--meaning the documents must be disclosed by Friday.

Victoria Bekiempis

In less than 48 hours, Donald Trump’s justice department must release most of the files related to Jeffrey Epstein in its possession.

Last month, Congress passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which required the release of those materials by 19 December, except in narrow cases where they would jeopardize current investigations, harm national security or foreign policy goals, or reveal information about Epstein’s victims.

Since Trump signed the legislation, his administration has been silent on its progress. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group of lawmakers asked Pam Bondi, the attorney general, for a briefing on the department of justice’s progress, but she did not provide one. Two Democratic senators among that group subsequently pledged to block some civilian nominees, because they were concerned the administration “is gearing up to disregard the law we led the fight in the Senate to pass, which overwhelmingly passed both chambers of Congress”.

It’s not clear what remedy could follow if the justice department does not heed the law mandating disclosure, though such a move would surely provoke a political firestorm. If the files are released, they could contain hundreds of thousands of pages related to investigations into the late sex trafficker, including additional victims’ claims and the names of his high-profile associates. The documents might also lift the veil on how Epstein – who counted Trump and the former prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor among his powerful friends – evaded justice for decades.

Trump says he was 'surprised' by vote to add his name to Kennedy Center, move he previewed in August

Robert Mackey

When Donald Trump was asked today for his reaction to the news that the board of the Kennedy Center, whose members he appointed, had voted to add his name to the building, the president said “I was surprised by it”. But four months ago, at an 22 August Oval Office event, Trump announced that the World Cup draw would be taking place “at the Kennedy Center, some people refer to it as the Trump-Kennedy Center, but we’re not prepared to do that quite yet, maybe in a week or so”.

Among the Democrats pointing out on Thursday that the board does not, in fact, have the power to change the name of the performing arts center, was Joe Kennedy III, a former congressman and a grandnephew of the man it is named for, John F. Kennedy.

“The Kennedy Center is a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law. It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says,” Joe Kennedy wrote on social media.

Republican representative Thomas Massie has posted this video on X this afternoon outlining what he says people can “expect in advance of tomorrow’s statutory disclosure deadline” for the attorney general to release the Epstein files.

The FBI 302 forms in the files will contain the names of “at least 20 men” implicated in sex crimes, sourced to victim lawyers, Massie says in the video. He goes on:

If we get a large production on December 19th and it does not contain a single name of any male who is accused of a sex crime or sex trafficking or rape or any of these things, then we know they haven’t produced all the documents, it’s that simple.

In 2023, the U.S. granted asylum to 54,350 people.
In response, immigrant justice lawyers representing 13 plaintiffs sued to overturn the asylum ban in Noem vs. Al Otro Lado in 2017.
“The ability for people to seek asylum at the border is really a life-or-death issue,” Fischer said.
She also said that she has seen a decrease in the amount of people seeking asylum at the southern border since the start of the second Trump administration.","Immigrant justice advocates are worried that the Trump administration’s attempt to reinstate an asylum ban at the U.S.-Mexico border through an appeal at the Supreme Court will put asylum seekers in harm’s way.

Asylum is a way for people to escape dangerous conditions such as violence, war, consequences from climate change, or persecution for their sexual orientation or gender identity. Each year, tens of thousands of people present themselves at the border to seek asylum. In 2023, the U.S. granted asylum to 54,350 people.

“People have sought safety at the border from all over the world fleeing violence, persecution, and discrimination, and that is really why asylum is so critically important,” said Amy Fischer, director of refugee and migrant rights at Amnesty International USA. “People are fleeing real life-threatening harms, and this is really the mechanism for them to find a way for safety.”

Under the first Trump administration, people seeking asylum at the United States-Mexico border would typically be met by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents who would turn them away. While some cases of asylum seekers being turned away at the San Ysidro border crossing occurred in 2016, the turn-back policies, called “metering” by the government, weren’t written and widely instituted until the first Trump administration. This turn-back policy created a humanitarian crisis at the border that impacted thousands of people seeking refuge from danger.

In response, immigrant justice lawyers representing 13 plaintiffs sued to overturn the asylum ban in Noem vs. Al Otro Lado in 2017. The lawsuit was filed in July 2017 by Al Otro Lado, along with the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies, the American Immigration Council, and other organizations located near the border.

“Customs and Border Protection officers would confront people literally standing at the line and obstruct them from coming in,” said Melissa Crow, the director of litigation for the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies, who has been involved with the case since 2017. “They thought that would somehow make their blocking of access to the asylum process legal.”

Under the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees and U.S. immigration law, the U.S. has a legal obligation to provide asylum and pathways to citizenship to people who meet the qualifications for a refugee.

Crow said that when asylum seekers would try to cross the border at the time this ban was in place, they would be told that there was no capacity. She said that during the discovery phase of the trial, however, it was uncovered that the “excuses were pretextual.”

The case was originally heard in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California in San Diego before the federal government attempted to appeal the case to the Ninth Circuit Court, but the judge affirmed that the turn-back policy is unlawful.

Last month, the Supreme Court agreed to consider the case and expects to hear arguments in the spring, with a decision anticipated for the summer.

One of the plaintiffs in Noem vs. Al Otro Lado, an asylum seeker the legal team refers to as “Bianca Doe,” is a transgender woman who sought asylum at the U.S. border in early 2017 after suffering extreme physical and sexual violence in both Honduras, her home country, and Mexico. When she presented herself at an official port of entry, border officials turned her back. Fearing for her life in Tijuana and desperate to reach safety in the United States, she attempted to climb a fence on a beach to come into the United States, but a border officer threatened to call the Mexican police.

She wasn’t allowed into the U.S. until Noem v. Al Otro Lado challenged the policy keeping her from entering the country. Now, advocates like Fischer worry that reimplementing the asylum ban would bring back that desperation and fear facing many asylum seekers, including unaccompanied children, she said, which allows bad actors to profit and take advantage of those vulnerabilities at the border.

“The ability for people to seek asylum at the border is really a life-or-death issue,” Fischer said. “People must have the ability to present themselves and be able to seek this critical protection. Policies that are intended to block access to asylum or deter people from seeking asylum really only add to the violence and chaos and the real struggles that people have at the border.”

While the government wants to turn back people seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border, not all asylum seekers are subject to the same crackdown. Marisa Limón Garza, executive director of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, said the targeting of the southern border specifically — while European or white South African immigrants are allowed to continue seeking asylum — is due to U.S. racism. To her, the attack on asylum did not come as a surprise.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration accepted 59 white South African refugees, affirming their assertion of being victims of “racial discrimination,” while Black and Afghan refugees have been denied refuge in the U.S.

“We’ve already seen in our detention centers people with protected status be detained and attempted to be deported, so why would they not go after the big fish, asylum at large, and just cut off that mechanism unless it’s for white folks of a certain class bracket that they would like to populate the United States,” Limón Garza said.

She also said that she has seen a decrease in the amount of people seeking asylum at the southern border since the start of the second Trump administration. She believes it’s due to the increased kidnappings and raids in the U.S. “People are really second guessing, like, ‘Do I want to go to the United States?,’ because if you’re leaving danger, would you go to a place that’s just as dangerous, if not more? Why would you want to go to a place where you would just end up in a detention center in horrible conditions?”

Limón Garza is also concerned that the attack on asylum at the southern border will open the door for broader attacks on asylum recipients in the U.S.: “It’s all interconnected.”

“We have to look around, look at our resources, and make a plan so it doesn’t go unchecked,” she said. “I don’t know what we’ll do yet, but we will respond.”

Fischer said that ending asylum would mean thrusting people back into the same danger they fled. Rather than trying to ban asylum, she said, the federal government should instead be building reception systems so that people who are arriving to seek safety have access to lawyers, social workers, and the resources they need to start putting down roots in their new communities, as well as more legal pathways to citizenship.

“I think as much as communities are really stepping up and stepping out to protect their immigrant friends and neighbors, it is really, really critical for the Trump administration to stop their mass deportation and mass detention machine and really turn a new lease on their treatment of people seeking safety in immigrant communities,” Fischer said.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2193676306-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 15:58:26.598168

“The Trump administration has been destroying America's lifesaving refugee program,” said Rep. Lofgren, a former immigration lawyer and senior member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration.
Refugee Admissions Program, we must remember that the Trump administration’s restrictive policies—though agonizing and dehumanizing—do not represent who we are as a people.","WASHINGTON, DC - Representative Zoe Lofgren (CA-18) and Senator Edward J. Markey (D-MA) today, on International Migrants Day, reintroduced the Guaranteed Refugee Admission Ceiling Enhancement (GRACE) Act, legislation that would ensure a U.S. President cannot set a Presidential Determination on Refugee Admissions—the annual refugee admissions goal—below 125,000 refugees. As the Trump administration’s ramps up its racist and xenophobic attacks on refugees, this legislation would seek to reestablish the United States’ commitment to welcoming refugees. Protecting those fleeing persecution is a fundamental American value. The GRACE Act takes a necessary step toward upholding this value.

Upon taking office earlier this year, President Trump signed an Executive Order suspending the entry of refugees under the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP), stranding thousands of highly vetted refugees abroad. In October, the Trump administration announced that it would set the Fiscal Year 2026 refugee admissions cap at 7,500 refugees—the lowest ceiling in the history of the refugee program since Congress established the program in 1980. President Trump has destroyed the USRAP’s historic mission and eroded the United States’ moral standing in the world.

“The Trump administration has been destroying America's lifesaving refugee program,” said Rep. Lofgren, a former immigration lawyer and senior member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration. “Slamming the door on those fleeing persecution is a betrayal of American values, and it comes at a time when refugee numbers are increasing significantly due to instability around the globe. The GRACE Act upholds our country's commitments and grants safety and opportunity to those whose lives have been uprooted, many of whom are children.”

“The Trump administration’s racist and xenophobic attacks on refugees have made it more critical to recommit our country to its promises of safety for those seeking refuge. The GRACE Actreaffirms a simple truth: the United States is strongest when we lead with our values,” said Senator Markey. “As a country founded by immigrants fleeing religious persecution, the United States has always been a guiding light for those walking in the darkest tunnels. We must recommit to this fundamental American principle and embrace those who fear persecution abroad.”

The GRACE Act is cosponsored by Representatives Yassamin Ansari (AZ-03), Nanette Barragán (CA-44), Yvette D. Clarke (NY-09), Danny Davis (IL-07), Diana DeGette (CO-01), Henry C. (“Hank”) Johnson, Jr. (GA-04), Ro Khanna (CA-17), Ted Lieu (CA-36), Seth Moulton (MA-06), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), and Rashida Tlaib (MI-12), and Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Andy Kim (D-N.J.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).

The GRACE Act would prevent U.S. Presidents from gutting the USRAP. Specifically, the GRACE Act would:

Automatically set the annual level of refugee admissions at 125,000 if the President fails to issue a determination before the beginning of each fiscal year;

Ensure that each officer responsible for refugee admissions or resettlement treats the presidential determination as a goal;

Encourage the President to consider the report of the United Nations High Commission on Refugees (UNHCR) on global resettlement needs when setting the presidential determination and determining regional allocations; and

Mandate quarterly reports to Congress with specific oversight requirements.

Several refugee advocates and stakeholder organizations expressed their support for the GRACE Act.

“The reintroduction of the GRACE Act is a necessary step toward restoring accountability, humanity, and the rule of law to the U.S. refugee resettlement program,” said John Slocum, Executive Director of Refugee Council USA. “At every turn, the Trump administration has betrayed our nation’s promise as a beacon of refuge for the persecuted, dismantling America’s ability to respond to global humanitarian crises, and discriminating against refugees who are most at risk and left stranded abroad. The GRACE Act would set a minimum refugee admissions goal that no administration could go below – and strengthen Congress’s oversight role to hold this administration - and future administrations - accountable to operate the refugee program in good faith. This legislation reaffirms a simple but essential truth: welcoming refugees is not optional; it is a legal and humanitarian obligation as much as it is a reflection of who we are as a nation.”

“In a tumultuous year for the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, we must remember that the Trump administration’s restrictive policies—though agonizing and dehumanizing—do not represent who we are as a people. Today’s reintroduction of the GRACE Act is a vital step towards accountability, the restoration of a compassionate resettlement program that responds to global needs, and stronger protections against future attacks,” said Erol Kekic, Chief Strategy Officer at Church World Service. “The GRACE Act would establish essential safeguards, including a minimum annual refugee admissions target, to ensure presidents cannot undermine the refugee program and abandon our commitment to welcome. Its passage would help return the U.S. role on the international stage to one of leadership, not xenophobia. We thank Senator Markey and Representative Lofgren for their leadership in reintroducing the GRACE Act and urge their colleagues in Congress to support its passage.”

“The International Rescue Committee is grateful to Sen. Markey and Rep. Lofgren for their continued leadership to ensure that America’s resettlement goals reflect global humanitarian needs generated by historic levels of displacement,” said Hans Van de Weerd, Senior Vice President of Resettlement, Asylum and Integration, International Rescue Committee. “The re-introduction of the GRACE Act comes at a pivotal moment with over 117 million forcibly displaced people and 36 million refugees worldwide. It is more important than ever to re-affirm America’s longstanding bipartisan commitment to a resettlement program that protects the world’s most vulnerable refugees regardless of their country of origin.”

“At this time of global displacement and unprecedented resettlement needs, we are deeply grateful for Senator Markey and Congresswoman Lofgren and all cosponsors’ leadership in reintroducing the GRACE Act. This legislation is more needed than ever to ensure that the United States lives up to its promise of being a safe haven to those in dire need of protection. We know that as a country we can, and more importantly, we must, meet the essential standards set in this legislation to once again lead on the world stage in providing safety to refugees in need of resettlement,” said Robyn Barnard, Senior Director of Refugee and Immigrant Rights at Human Rights First.

“Refugees aren’t just fleeing persecution, torture and inhumane treatment, they are a lifeblood of the United States economy and help make America a more free, safe and secure nation. Senator Markey’s GRACE Act will ensure no President can put partisan politics over human rights and our national interests by recommitting America to its tradition of welcoming refugees through a rational, predictable and democratic process. We commend the Senator and his co-sponsors for authoring this important legislation and hope Congress acts on it swiftly,” said Elizabeth Sweet, Executive Director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy (MIRA) Coalition.

The GRACE Act is endorsed by Refugee Council USA, Church World Service, Human Rights First, National Partnership for New Americans, Advocates for Human Rights, Haitian Bridge Alliance, Refugee Congress, Center for Gender & Refugee Studies, African Human Rights Coalition, Witness at the Border, Sojourners, Immigrant Defenders Law Center, MIRA Coalition, Climate Refugees, Refugees International, AfghanEvac, HIAS, the Workers Circle, Refugee Advocacy Lab, Friends Committee on National Legislation, International Refugee Assistance Project, International Institute of New England, Lutheran Social Services of the National Capital Area, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, National Immigration Law Center, U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, American Humanist Association, International Rescue Committee, Coalition on Human Needs, Catholic Charities of Boston, Jewish Family Services of Western Massachusetts, Ascentria Care Alliance, Amnesty International USA, American Civil Liberties Union, SIREN, and United Stateless.

The two-page FBI document, dated 14 November, says some of the investigations are related to the “countering domestic terrorism” memo issued by Donald Trump in September.
The FBI document, disseminated to other law enforcement agencies, warns of increased “threat activity targeting government personnel or facilities related to immigration enforcement efforts”.
The other cases involve domestic terrorism, conspiracy to impede or injure officers, civil unrest, anti-riot laws, destruction of vehicles, and “bombing matters”.
He also noted that since 9/11, the FBI has had wide latitude to launch terrorism investigations based on minimal evidence and with little oversight.","The FBI has launched “criminal and domestic terrorism investigations” into “threats against immigration enforcement activity” in at least 23 regions across the US, according to an internal report shared with the Guardian.

The two-page FBI document, dated 14 November, says some of the investigations are related to the “countering domestic terrorism” memo issued by Donald Trump in September.

Released after the killing of Charlie Kirk, Trump’s memo, known as NSPM-7, called for a “national strategy” to thwart “violent and terroristic activities” associated with “anti-fascism”. It described “anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism and anti-Christianity” as threats and cited “riots” in Los Angeles and Portland, referring to protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), as examples of “political violence”.

The FBI document, disseminated to other law enforcement agencies, warns of increased “threat activity targeting government personnel or facilities related to immigration enforcement efforts”. It points to two violent attacks against ICE facilities in Texas, but says “domestic terrorist subjects”, who fall under NSPM-7, have also engaged in “reactive violent attacks which took advantage of First Amendment-protected activities nationwide”.

“[Domestic terrorist] attacks against ICE continue to be perpetrated primarily by individuals or small groups of actors,” the report continued, asserting that recent incidents marked “an escalation in violence compared to past attacks, which primarily resulted in property damage”.

The document says “indicators” that an individual may be planning to attack ICE include “stockpiling or distributing firearms”, but also “conducting online research” about agents’ movements and using encrypted messaging apps.

The FBI report was republished by another law enforcement entity and disclosed in documents obtained through public records requests by Property of the People, a government transparency non-profit.

Civil rights groups have raised concerns that NSPM-7 would be used to crack down on leftist organizing, ICE protesters and Trump critics, and advocates who reviewed the FBI’s November report for the Guardian said it renewed their fears.

“[The FBI document] is infused with vague and overbroad language, which was exactly our concern about NSPM-7 in the first place. It invites law enforcement suspicion and investigation based on purely first amendment-protected beliefs and activities,” said Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU National Security Project. “People who are entirely innocent of any wrongdoing can be subjected to surveillance or investigation. That imposes stigma. It can wrongly immesh people in the criminal legal system.”

The FBI declined to comment.

The FBI “public safety awareness” report warned that “criminal actors with varying social and political goals” were increasingly threatening ICE, but it did not detail specific investigations or threats.

The report said cases involving “assault on a federal officer” are the most common in the FBI’s investigations into anti-ICE activity. The other cases involve domestic terrorism, conspiracy to impede or injure officers, civil unrest, anti-riot laws, destruction of vehicles, and “bombing matters”.

The FBI document referenced two concrete incidents of past violence. In July, a group of people allegedly threw fireworks and vandalized vehicles at an ICE detention center in Alvarado, Texas, before one of them allegedly shot a local police officer. Some defendants in the case have since pleaded guilty to terrorism-related charges while others’ cases are ongoing, and a Guardian investigation has raised questions about the government’s larger narratives about the events.

In September, a gunman fired at an ICE field office in Dallas, killing two ICE detainees before fatally shooting himself. No ICE staff were injured. Some prominent Republicans blamed that shooting on “the left”, but the shooter’s motives and politics were not clear, and there was no evidence the suspect was tied to any political organizing or activist groups.

The FBI’s report included a map spotlighting FBI offices across the country with ongoing investigations. As of 31 October, the FBI said it had opened criminal and domestic terrorism investigations into “observed threats” against ICE activity across 23 of its field offices, spanning most regions of the country, including Washington state, Oregon, California, New Mexico, Kansas, Georgia, Illinois, Florida, New York and Maine. It’s unclear how many total investigations the bureau has launched, with the report noting that in the regions of Chicago, Dallas and Portland, Oregon, there have been more than 10 “incidents” each.

Separately, the FBI’s map also listed 27 locations where there are ongoing domestic terrorism investigations that fall under NSPM-7, though the report does not specify if all of those cases are related to anti-ICE threats. The FBI did not respond to inquiries seeking clarification. The report also noted some NSPM-7 cases pre-dated the president’s memo, but were aligned with its goals.

There are more than 30 states total where the FBI has opened cases tied to anti-ICE activity or NSPM-7, the map shows.

“These areas could see increased threat activity in the near term,” the FBI warned, without providing evidence or specifics.

The report continued: “Indicators that individuals may be planning an attack against ICE … may include conducting surveillance; conducting online research regarding when ICE personnel may be arriving at or departing from a facility or operation; stockpiling or distributing firearms with an intent to conduct an attack or discussing operational plans with other like-minded individuals via encrypted communication applications.”

Civil liberties advocates said the “indicators” language was troubling.

“It is not illegal to do online research about the publicly available movements of government officers or to communicate through encrypted apps like Signal or WhatsApp,” said Rachel Levinson-Waldman, director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonprofit, in an email. “While the document refers to using encrypted communications to ‘discuss operational planning’, that term is undefined and ambiguous, leaving it open what kinds of conversations might draw FBI scrutiny.”

The FBI has recently faced criticisms over its surveillance of activists opposing ICE activities. Records obtained by Property of the People and shared with the Guardian last month revealed that the FBI spied on a private Signal group chat of volunteers organizing “courtwatch” efforts, characterizing the activists who monitor public proceedings in immigration courtrooms as “anarchist violent extremists”.

The FBI’s November report builds on assertions by the Trump administration of a dramatic rise in attacks on immigration enforcement agents. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has repeatedly asserted that there has been a “1,000% increase” in assaults on ICE officers, a claim written into NSPM-7. But the DHS has not provided evidence to support the claim.

A recent Los Angeles Times investigation, based on thousands of pages of court records involving assault cases prosecuted in southern California, Portland, Chicago and Washington DC, found the majority of alleged attacks resulted in no injury to an agent. Law enforcement files reviewed by the Guardian in July revealed that US immigration officers had made false and misleading statements about several Los Angeles protesters they arrested during mass demonstrations and had accused of violence. Several high-profile federal prosecutions for alleged assaults against immigration officers have ended in dismissals or not guilty verdicts.

The FBI report further noted that NSPM-7 called for the investigation of “institutional and individual funders, and officers and employees of organizations, that are responsible for, sponsor, or otherwise aid and abet” criminal conduct, part of the memo that has raised strong concerns about the federal government targeting civil society and nonprofit groups.

The FBI’s report said it was building on an intelligence bulletin it issued in October, also obtained by Property of the People, about “domestic violent extremists” threatening ICE. That bulletin included a footnote stating, “The mere advocacy of political or social positions, political activism, use of strong rhetoric, or generalized philosophic embrace of violent tactics does not constitute extremism and may be constitutionally protected.”

Ryan Shapiro, executive director of Property of the People, said the FBI’s November report was particularly alarming when considered alongside a US attorney general’s office 4 December memo on NSPM-7 implementation.

The memo to federal prosecutors said “criminal conduct rising to the level of domestic terrorism” includes “doxing of law enforcement, mass rioting and destruction … violent efforts to shut down immigration enforcement [and] targeting of public officials”. It cited “opposition to … immigration enforcement” … and “extreme views in favor of mass migration and open borders” as potential terrorist ideologies.

The attorney general called for a wide range of prosecutions, including “picketing or parading with intent to obstruct the administration of justice” and “obstruction or disruption in or on federal property”. It also directed federal law enforcement agencies to share “Antifa” files with the FBI.

Trump has branded “antifa” a terrorist organization, despite the fact that there is no formal “antifa” entity, with the term frequently used by conservatives to describe a wide range of anti-fascist, leftist and liberal activism.

“At its core, the war on antifa is a war on dissent, a war on free speech,” Shapiro said in a statement. He argued the FBI and attorney general memos, along with Trump’s repeated disparaging of protesters and opponents, “strongly suggest that one of the primary functions of NSPM-7 is to serve as a vehicle for targeting anti-ICE organizing broadly as an anarchist violent extremist threat”.

The records, Shapiro added, suggest “the ultimate intended use of NSPM-7 is as an instrument for classifying criticism of the Trump regime as extremism and terrorism”.

Spokespeople for ICE and DHS did not respond to inquiries.

Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, said in an email that NSPM-7 is “focused on investigating, disrupting, dismantling, and prosecuting individuals and entities engaged in organized political violence and domestic terrorism – specifically the sophisticated and organized campaigns that necessitate a new law enforcement strategy”.

Jackson accused “leftwing organizations” of fueling “violent riots”, organizing “attacks against law enforcement officers” and carrying out other crimes. “The Trump administration will get to the bottom of this vast network inciting violence in American communities, and the president’s executive actions to address leftwing violence will put an end to any illegal activities.”

A DoJ spokesperson declined to comment on the specifics of the attorney general’s memo, saying in a statement: “Political violence has no place in this country, and this Department of Justice will investigate, identify, and root out any individual or violent extremist group attempting to commit or promote this heinous activity.”

In response to questions about federal assault prosecutions ending in acquittals and dismissals, the spokesperson said: “The Department of Justice will continue to seek the most serious available charges against any individual who puts federal agents in harm’s way … We will never make charging decisions based on the opinions of self-proclaimed ‘experts’.”

Mike German, a former FBI agent, who is now a civil liberties advocate, said NSPM-7 was a “chilling document that likens political opposition to government policy to terrorism”. He also noted that since 9/11, the FBI has had wide latitude to launch terrorism investigations based on minimal evidence and with little oversight.

“All it takes is an allegation to justify opening a preliminary investigation, and agents can make their own allegations, so the number of investigations doesn’t really tell you very much other than the FBI is taking this mandate from NSPM-7 to open a wide range of cases,” he said.

These kinds of FBI alerts with broad and vague language are unhelpful to other law enforcement officials, German added: “It doesn’t give a lot of specific information about what law enforcement should be looking for or how to differentiate between a protester and somebody who might be presenting some kind of violent threat. It just tends to raise the fear level in law enforcement.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18a013038f680b595c81fd11efca424a31e7f711/479_0_6139_4912/master/6139.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f258b88291f435cdc574f16bac92d0e6",N,,2025-12-19 10:57:41.786103

These grant programs have been authorized by Congress without any DEI provisions. They are critical to states, counties, and local agencies, including funding for fire departments, emergency management agencies, law enforcement, and critical infrastructure protection. For example, the National Association of Counties advised its members on June 20, 2024:

“On June 18 [2024] Congress took a significant step in supporting local fire departments across the nation by passing the Fire Grants and Safety Act (S. 870). Pending President Biden’s signature, final passage ensures the continuation and enhancement of the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) and Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) grant programs. These crucial programs, facing a statutory termination date of September 30, 2024, have now been extended to September 30, 2030…. For counties, the reauthorization of these grants is crucial. Without AFG and SAFER, local fire departments would lose approximately $700 million annually in federal assistance, which is indispensable for maintaining the safety and readiness of local fire services and the protection and well-being of county residents.” https://www.naco.org/news/congress-reauthorizes-critical-safer-and-afg-grants-until-2030

Chicago Injunction: U.S. District Court for Northern District of Illinois

Legal Background

On November 21, 2025, U.S. District Court Judge Manish S. Shah granted a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit brought by the cities of Chicago, Boston, New York, Baltimore, Minneapolis, New Haven, Connecticut, and Ramsey County, Minnesota.

Court’s Key Findings

Judge Shah acknowledged plaintiffs’ substantial concerns about the government’s unilateral interpretation of “illegal DEI.” The court wrote: “Plaintiffs make much of their fear that the government will unilaterally use its understanding of ‘illegal DEI’ to withhold money, or worse, penalize plaintiffs with False Claims Act lawsuits threatening treble damages…. The preliminary injunction does not order the payment of money that the government might not be able to recoup; it only limits the conditions DHS can impose on a grant.”

This reasoning highlights a critical concern: the risk of retroactive enforcement actions based on the government’s evolving interpretation of prohibited “DEI” activities, potentially exposing agencies to triple damages under the False Claims Act.

California Injunction: U.S. District Court for Northern District of California

Legal Background

Also on November 21, 2025, U.S. District Court Judge William H. Orrick issued a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit brought by San Francisco, numerous other California municipalities, and the City of Tucson, Arizona.

Court’s Rationale

Judge Orrick’s decision emphasized that the contested provisions fundamentally redefine long-established federal anti-discrimination standards. The court noted: “Plaintiffs have agreed to comply with federal antidiscrimination laws as a condition to their funding in the past. But they assert that ‘the federal government has now called the meaning of those laws in question by purporting to interpret them far differently than previously understood by Congress, the executive, or the courts – leaving it unclear what is expected under the terms.'”

The court found this ambiguity unacceptable and that “the balance of the equities and public interest favor granting plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief.”

Scope of Relief Granted

Judge Orrick’s order specifically enjoins defendants and their agents from “directly or indirectly taking any action to withhold, freeze, or condition funds from the plaintiffs based on (1) Section C.XVII of the Standard DHS Terms (the ‘Discrimination Condition’); and (2) Section C.XXXI of the Standard DHS Terms (the ‘EO Condition’).”

Legal Support and Advocacy

According to court filings, the Public Rights Project, an Oakland, California-based organization, provided litigation support in both successful cases. The organization helps local government officials work with communities to protect and expand civil rights through litigation support, legal representation, and training.

Related Litigation

BRIC Program Protection (August 2025; December 2025)

On August 5, 2025, U.S. District Court Judge Richard G. Stearns of the District of Massachusetts issued an injunction prohibiting FEMA from terminating the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) pre-disaster mitigation program. The lawsuit was brought by 18 states and the order prevents FEMA “from spending the funds allocated to BRIC for non-BRIC purposes until the court is able to render a final judgment on the merits.”

Over the past four years, FEMA has selected nearly 2,000 BRIC projects to receive roughly $4.5 billion in funding nationwide. The program funds critical projects like constructing levees and floodwalls and generating backup electricity for hospitals and school districts during emergencies.

On December 11, 2025, Judge Stearns granted summary judgment to the states, holding: “In sum, this is not a case about judicial encroachment on the discretionary authority of the Executive Branch. This is a case about unlawful Executive encroachment on the prerogative of Congress to appropriate funds for a specific and compelling purpose, and no more than that.” The Court in its Order wrote: “The court vacates and sets aside the termination of the BRIC program pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).”

Fourth Circuit Stays Nationwide DEI Injunction (March 2025)

On March 14, 2025, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit granted the government’s request to stay a nationwide preliminary injunction that had been issued by a Maryland district court. This means the broad nationwide protections from that case are currently not in effect, though the Chicago and California injunctions remain active in their respective jurisdictions.

The Maryland case was brought by the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education, the American Association of University Professors, Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, and the City of Baltimore. U.S. District Court Judge Adam B. Abelson had issued a preliminary injunction on February 21, 2025, prohibiting federal agencies from pausing, freezing, or terminating awards based on the DEI Executive Orders.

Practical Implications for Grant Recipients

Immediate Actions for State and Local Agencies

Consult Legal Counsel: Before accepting any FEMA or DHS grants containing DEI certification requirements, agencies should consult with their legal counsel to understand jurisdiction-specific protections and potential risks.

Understand Geographic Scope: The Chicago and California injunctions provide clear protection to plaintiffs in those cases. Agencies in other jurisdictions should determine whether similar protections apply to them.

False Claims Act Risk: The preliminary injunctions do not prevent the U.S. Department of Justice from launching investigations for false certifications under the False Claims Act or other statutes. Agencies must carefully consider certification requirements in light of this continuing risk.

Document Internal Policies: Agencies should maintain clear documentation of their programs and policies to demonstrate compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws as traditionally understood.

Current Legal Status

It is critical to understand that preliminary injunctions represent temporary relief pending full resolution of the underlying cases. These orders can be stayed or overturned on appeal (as occurred with the Maryland nationwide injunction), modified as litigation proceeds, or dissolved if circumstances change.

The Public Rights Project has confirmed that the U.S. Government has not filed appeals in either case as of December 10, 2025.

Grant recipients should not assume these protections are permanent and should continue monitoring legal developments closely.

Congressional Intent for Fire Service Grants

The contested DEI provisions particularly affect firefighter assistance programs, which have strong bipartisan congressional support. When Congress reauthorized the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) and SAFER grant programs through fiscal year 2028 on July 9, 2024, the Congressional Fire Services Institute reflected on the program’s origins 25 years ago.

The Congressional Fire Services Caucus fought for two years to establish federal support for local fire departments, “affirming that the nation’s safety demands federal investment in the fire service.” President Bill Clinton signed the FIRE Act into law on October 30, 2000. This history underscores that fire service grants were created to support local fire departments in their life-saving mission, not to serve as vehicles for implementing executive branch policy initiatives unrelated to fire safety and emergency response.

Connection to Immigration-Related Grant Litigation

In September 2025, federal courts blocked similar attempts to condition the same homeland security grants on immigration enforcement cooperation. The legal principles established in those cases – requirements for clear standards, avoidance of unconstitutional coercion, and consistent agency action – appear to be influencing courts’ approach to DEI-related conditions.

Both sets of cases reflect a consistent judicial concern: emergency preparedness funding authorized by Congress for specific public safety purposes should not be converted into a mechanism for implementing unrelated executive branch policy initiatives without clear congressional authorization.

Broader Context: Grant Administration and Separation of Powers

These DEI-related cases raise important questions about the extent of executive branch authority to impose policy conditions on congressionally authorized grant programs:

Can the executive branch unilaterally reinterpret federal anti-discrimination statutes in ways that substantially depart from decades of precedent?

May the executive impose certification requirements so vague that grant recipients cannot determine compliance?

Should emergency preparedness funding be conditioned on compliance with Executive Orders addressing domestic policy matters beyond the scope of the authorizing legislation?

When funding conditions are unclear enough that recipients face potential False Claims Act liability for good-faith mistakes, do such conditions violate due process?

Federal courts are now weighing these questions, with outcomes that will shape grant administration across the federal government for years to come.

Conclusion

State and local communities should be able to access congressionally authorized FEMA and DHS grants without fear of retroactive enforcement actions based on ambiguous certification requirements. Congress created these grant programs – from firefighter assistance to emergency management performance grants to pre-disaster mitigation – for the benefit of all communities.

The preliminary injunctions issued in Chicago and California provide important immediate protections, but the ultimate resolution of these disputes remains uncertain. As litigation continues, emergency management professionals, fire departments, and other grant recipients must carefully navigate an uncertain legal landscape while continuing their essential missions of protecting communities and saving lives.

Regardless of one’s views on DEI policies, there is broad consensus that emergency preparedness funding should flow based on demonstrated need, capability gaps, and statutory criteria, not as leverage for implementing policy objectives unrelated to the core mission of protecting Americans from disasters and emergencies.

Investigations by Afghanistan International show that over the past four years the Taliban have been involved in more than 150 clashes with Pakistani border forces.
Data compiled by Afghanistan International show that over the past 10 days, the Taliban have flogged at least 70 people nationwide, including nine women.","Hashemi’s family reported in June that she had gone missing. Her husband, Sayed Mohsen Hashemi, told Afghanistan International at the time that she had left home to visit friends and had not returned, adding that her phones were switched off. He later stopped commenting publicly on her situation.

On Wednesday, Hashemi contacted singer and women’s rights activist Ariana Saeed and informed her that she had left the country. According to Hashemi, the decision to leave Afghanistan was personal and was not facilitated by any specific individual or institution.

She did not refer to her reported disappearance and declined to provide details about her circumstances while in Afghanistan.

In an interview with the BBC, Hashemi said she had faced many difficulties over the past six years and had been waiting for an opportunity to leave the country so she could “raise her voice.” She did not elaborate further.

Previously, Ariana Saeed said in a video message that Hashemi had fled her home because of domestic violence and said her husband had spread false information to the media by claiming she had been abducted. Saeed alleged that Hashemi’s husband was attempting to trace her whereabouts through media reports and social media.

Following reports of Hashemi’s disappearance, Taliban officials said they had detained several of her relatives.

Hashemi rose to prominence after reaching the final round of the Afghan Star singing competition, broadcast by the private Tolo TV, where she competed against dozens of male singers.

Dobrindt said the transfer process has been accelerated amid the risk that the refugees could be deported from Pakistan. He told German media that many Afghans with German admission pledges are living in uncertainty and that the government is seeking to complete case reviews and relocate as many as possible before the end of the month.

He added that a small number would likely remain, and their cases would be reviewed next year.

Some of the refugees previously worked with the German government or German organisations in Afghanistan, while others are considered at risk, including journalists and human rights activists.

Pakistan, which has deported millions of Afghans over the past year, has urged Western countries, including Germany, to relocate refugees who have already received admission pledges. Dobrindt said Berlin is in talks with Pakistani authorities regarding deadlines for deportations.

Germany’s new government has not accepted all Afghans awaiting relocation in Pakistan. German media reported last week that the conservative government led by Friedrich Merz rejected 650 Afghans who had previously received admission pledges.

The Merz government had earlier sought to discourage dozens of Afghans with admission pledges in Pakistan from travelling to Germany by offering financial incentives, but only about 60 people reportedly accepted the offer.

Najibullah Shaheen, the acting head of the Taliban embassy in Norway, said the first batch of newly issued passports has already been distributed to applicants.

Norway’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed on March 21 that it had accepted Shaheen, a Taliban diplomat, as first secretary at the Afghan embassy in Oslo. The ministry said it issued him a one-year diplomatic residence card.

Shortly after assuming his post, Shaheen changed the embassy’s signage from “Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan” to “Embassy of Afghanistan.”

After the collapse of Afghanistan’s previous government and the Taliban’s return to power in August 2021, passport issuance was suspended at most Afghan diplomatic and consular missions abroad.

In recent months, several Afghan missions under Taliban control have resumed issuing passports, including embassies in Islamabad, Tehran and New Delhi, as well as a number of consulates in Germany and other countries.

In a statement issued on Thursday, the Taliban Ministry of Defence said Fitrat met with media representatives, political analysts and a number of Taliban officials to discuss coordination and strengthen cooperation.

At the meeting, Fitrat said Taliban forces had shown “no hesitation whatsoever” over the past four years in defending and protecting Afghanistan. He said the Taliban army is standing on its own feet and working to modernise its capabilities.

“We are striving to build an army equipped with modern weapons to defend the country’s territory under any circumstances,” Fitrat said. “Our army has proven to the people that anyone who looks at this land with ill intent will face a firm and courageous response, and it has also been proven to neighbouring countries that any aggression against Afghanistan will be met with a several-fold response.”

Fitrat did not name any specific country.

After the withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan, large quantities of advanced US military equipment were left behind and later taken over by the Taliban. The US Department of Defense has estimated the value of this equipment at more than $7 billion, including military vehicles, advanced weapons, biometric devices and other matériel.

Investigations by Afghanistan International show that over the past four years the Taliban have been involved in more than 150 clashes with Pakistani border forces. The Taliban have also clashed on several occasions with Iranian border guards.

In a statement issued on Thursday, the court said the Kabul primary counter-narcotics court sentenced the individuals to between 10 and 39 lashes and prison terms ranging from seven months to three years. The charges included selling and trafficking tablet K, methamphetamine, hashish and alcoholic beverages.

Data compiled by Afghanistan International show that over the past 10 days, the Taliban have flogged at least 70 people nationwide, including nine women.

According to a United Nations report presented to the Security Council last week, the Taliban flogged at least 215 people, 44 women and 171 men, across various provinces during the three-month period from August 1 to October 31.

Despite repeated criticism from international organisations over the use of corporal punishment and the treatment of detainees, the Taliban have continued to carry out public floggings across Afghanistan.","https://i.afintl.com/images/rdk9umy0/production/3a994afe4280bb70d062ebd80c491ac930a32ce1-1600x1069.jpg?rect=51,282,1499,787&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=max&auto=format",N,,2025-12-19 11:58:34.816372

See below for a full list of fiscal year 2025-2026 CBP and ICE contracts for companies based in Louisiana.","U.S. Border Patrol's high-profile immigration crackdowns in North Carolina and Louisiana over the last two months have brought fresh scrutiny to the hundreds of billions of dollars being spent on immigration raids and arrests under the Trump administration.

The massive spending bill pushed by Trump and passed by Congress this summer increased immigration enforcement by $170 billion, part of a broader push to reach the administration's goal of deporting 1 million immigrants each year.

The new round of immigration spending includes $75 billion over four years for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, on top of the $10 billion the agency had already been allocated for 2025. The bill also gave $65 billion more to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), which had already received $20 billion for fiscal year 2025.

While CBP and ICE, which both operate under the Department of Homeland Security, are responsible for immigration matters, Border Patrol has emerged as the leader in Trump's anti-immigration crusade in recent months, according to immigration reporter Nick Miroff of The Atlantic. Under the bombastic leadership of Gregory Bovino, who grew up in western North Carolina, CBP has led a series of high-profile and militarized operations in Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte, and New Orleans that have sparked widespread backlash due to their heavy-handed tactics and violations of due process.

Helping carry out Border Patrol and ICE's immigration operations are an army of private contractors who have seen their fortunes soar as federal money has flowed into enforcement activities.

In the wake of the major operations in Louisiana and North Carolina, Facing South and the Institute for Southern Studies collected and analyzed data from USASpending.gov on more than 50 businesses headquartered in those states who are receiving CBP and ICE contracts for fiscal years 2025-2026. The contracts for companies based in Louisiana and North Carolina total more than $341 million.

NORTH CAROLINA

The Facing South/Institute analysis finds 38 companies based in North Carolina receiving contracts from CBP and ICE. These contracts are currently valued at $61.7 million, with a potential to grow to $77.9 million once the work is completed.

One of the most notable contractors is Quantico Tactical, founded and owned by former Marine David Hensley. Based in Aberdeen, N.C., Quantico has received more than 50 contracts valued up to $19.3 million for fiscal years 2025-2026 providing a wide range of firearms, ""less than lethal"" munitions, restraints, communications equipment, and other supplies to both Border Patrol and ICE.

Other top contractors include Laboratory Corporation of America (Labcorp) in Burlington, N.C., which has contracts potentially valued up to $21.4 million for laboratory services, including at ICE detention centers, and TMC-TELESOLV of Battleboro, N.C., which has a contract valued up to $14.8 million for CBP's Trusted Traveler Program.

Duncan-Parnell, Inc., in Charlotte has a $5 million CBP contract for drones, and MacGyver Solutions, Inc. has contracts valued up to $2.2 million for Polaris and Yamaha vehicles and ATVs.

In August, Hendrick Motorsports Technical Solutions of Concord, N.C. was given a $1.5 million no-bid contract to supply 25 Chevrolet Tahoe vehicles to ICE. The company is a spinoff of Hendrick Motorsports; both are owned by Rick Hendrick, a prominent Republican donor. Media attention about the deal during the North Carolina immigration raids led to calls to boycott Hendrick's companies, which include car dealerships in the state.

LOUISIANA

In Louisiana, where Border Patrol's ""Operation Catahoula Crunch"" is still underway, there are fewer contractors, but the total awards to companies based in the state is much larger.

Facing South/Institute analysis of contracting data finds 16 Louisiana-based companies receiving contracts from CBP and ICE in fiscal years 2025-2026. The current value of those awards is $50.3 million, but the total potential value is listed at $263.2 million for the state.

Topping the list are two companies which stand to bring in more than $208 million making emergency detention centers for ICE. LaSalle Corrections, which manages 18 private correctional facilities in Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas, received a contract worth up to $125 million to build a new detention center. The company has a checkered history: In 2023, LaSalle agreed to a $7 million settlement over a wrongful death lawsuit, and the ACLU of Louisiana has frequently battled with the company over forced hysterectomies of ICE detainees and other alleged rights abuses.

Lemoine Disaster Recovery, LLC — a building and disaster services company headquartered in Lafayette, L.A. — was awarded a contract worth up to $83.8 million, also to build an emergency ICE detention facility.

Another major contract went to People Who Think, LLC — a marketing and political consulting firm founded by Republican political advisor Jay Connaughton. The firm's $25 million contract is earmarked for an ICE recruitment campaign. Gulf South Research Group, based in Baton Rouge, pulled in several contracts totaling $21.6 million for environmental assessments and planning, including projects related to the border wall.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a post on the social platform X that, at Trump's direction, she is ordering the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services to pause the program.

""This heinous individual should never have been allowed in our country,"" she said of the suspect, Portuguese national Claudio Neves Valente.

Neves Valente, 48, is suspected in the shootings at Brown University that killed two students and wounded nine others, and the killing of an MIT professor. He was found dead Thursday evening from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, officials said.

Neves Valente had studied at Brown on a student visa beginning in 2000, according to an affidavit from a Providence police detective. In 2017, he was issued a diversity immigrant visa and months later obtained legal permanent residence status, according to the affidavit. It was not immediately clear where he was between taking a leave of absence from the school in 2001 and getting the visa in 2017.

The diversity visa program makes up to 50,000 green cards available each year by lottery to people from countries that are little represented in the U.S., many of them in Africa. The lottery was created by Congress, and the move is almost certain to invite legal challenges.

Nearly 20 million people applied for the 2025 visa lottery, with more than 131,000 selected when including spouses with the winners. After winning, they must undergo vetting to win admission to the United States. Portuguese citizens won only 38 slots.

Lottery winners are invited to apply for a green card. They are interviewed at consulates and subject to the same requirements and vetting as other green-card applicants.

Trump has long opposed the diversity visa lottery. Noem's announcement is the latest example of using tragedy to advance immigration policy goals. After an Afghan man was identified as the gunman in a fatal attack on National Guard members in November, Trump's administration imposed sweeping rules against immigration from Afghanistan and other counties.

While pursuing mass deportation, Trump has sought to limit or eliminate avenues to legal immigration. He has not been deterred if they are enshrined in law, like the diversity visa lottery, or the Constitution, as with a right to citizenship for anyone born on U.S. soil.

But Trump exaggerated the average price now.
In a May press conference on drug prices, Trump made comparisons similar to his 400% to 600% price-drop claims.","President Donald Trump blitzed through a prime-time address to the nation on Dec. 17, but while short, Trump’s speech contained a number of inaccurate or misleading claims, many of which he has repeated in public speeches for months.

Trump mentioned several items, such as cars and plane tickets, that he said experienced price increases under former President Joe Biden and price decreases during Trump’s own presidency. We found support for some of Trump’s statistics but not others, such as the price of Thanksgiving turkeys.

The president made the misleading claim that “for the first time in years, wages are rising much faster than inflation.” Year-over-year wages have been rising faster than inflation since June 2023, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics figures.

Trump falsely claimed that inflation when he took office was the “worst … in the history of our country” and that inflation had now “stopped.” Inflation was never the “worst” under Biden, and it was 3% for the 12 months ending in January. It rose 2.7% in the 12-month period ending in November.

He said, “Gasoline is now under $2.50 a gallon, and in much of the country, in some states, it by the way just hit $1.99 a gallon.” The national average price was $2.90 a gallon the week of Dec. 15, and the lowest statewide average was $2.34 in Oklahoma.

Trump claimed that due to the tax cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, “many families will be saving between $11,000 and $20,000 a year.” The Tax Policy Center estimated the average tax cut would be $800. Only those in the top 1% of households would see an average tax decrease of the amount Trump claimed.

Speaking about immigrants, Trump’s estimate that the U.S. was “invaded by an army of 25 million people” is vastly inflated; his claim that many of them came from “prisons and jails and mental institutions and insane asylums” is unsupported, and his claim that the Biden administration allowed in “11,888 murderers” is wrong.

The president made the mathematically impossible claim that he was able “to slash prices on drugs and pharmaceuticals by as much as 400, 500 and even 600%.”

In his prime-time address, Trump spoke quickly, at twice the rate of his State of the Union address pace, according to a PBS News correspondent. The focus was mainly on the economy and “affordability.”

Prices

The president blamed his predecessor for “driving up prices and everything at levels never seen before,” but Trump said he is “bringing those high prices down and bringing them down very fast.”

“Under the Biden administration,” he said, “car prices rose 22%,” “gasoline rose 30 to 50%,” “hotel rates rose 37%,” and “airfares rose 31%.” He continued, “Now under our leadership, they’re all coming down and coming down fast.” He went on to say that “Democrat politicians also sent the cost of groceries soaring, but we are solving that too.” He added that “the price of a Thanksgiving turkey was down 33% compared to the Biden last year,” and claimed that “the price of eggs is down 82% since March.”

We found support for some of his figures, but none for others.

The White House told us that the price data for cars, hotels, airfares and gasoline came from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but was not more specific. We checked the bureau’s Consumer Price Index data, the seasonally adjusted numbers, which did show price increases under Biden and mostly price decreases so far under Trump.

The CPI for new vehicles increased about 19% during Biden’s four-year term but has increased only slightly, by 0.2%, under Trump from January to November, according to the most recent BLS figures. Meanwhile, the CPI for airline fares went up almost 32% under Biden and has declined more than 9% under Trump. Also, the CPI for lodging away from home, including hotels and motels, rose over 33% under Biden and has dropped roughly 5% under Trump. Lastly, the CPI for gasoline, including all types, grew by 34.5% under Biden and has decreased about 4.6% under Trump.

The BLS also publishes average monthly price data for unleaded, regular gas and the most recent numbers, which are not seasonally adjusted, show an increase of 38% under Biden (from about $2.33 to $3.21) and a much smaller increase, about 0.6%, under Trump (from $3.21 to nearly $3.23). But those figures are different from the most recent weekly data published by the Energy Information Administration that show the average price of regular grade gas rising almost 31% under Biden (from $2.38 to $3.11 per gallon) and declining almost 7% under Trump (from $3.11 to $2.90, as of Dec. 15).

The source of Trump’s claim that turkey prices were down 33% for Thanksgiving is even less clear, as the White House provided no indication where the president got his figure. In a Nov. 19 news release, the American Farm Bureau Federation said that the average price of a 16-pound frozen turkey was down from the previous year, but only by 16%. The nonprofit advocacy group attributed the price decline to grocery stores offering special Thanksgiving deals, “attempting to draw consumer demand back to turkey, leading to lower retail prices for a holiday bird.” The wholesale prices that retailers paid for fresh turkeys were up from the year prior, the American Farm Bureau Federation said.

As for eggs, as of November, the average retail price for a dozen grade A white eggs was $2.86, down about 42% from $4.95 in January, according to the latest BLS data. Trump was likely referring to wholesale egg prices as of Dec. 12 being down 82% from the high of $8.17 in March, but wholesale prices are not what consumers pay at grocery stores. Egg prices spiked in 2024 after an avian influenza outbreak led to an egg shortage. When bird flu cases began to decline, so did wholesale egg prices, which eventually led to lower retail prices.

Overall, grocery prices, according to the CPI for “food-at-home items,” were up about 1.17% from January to November, and up about 1.9% since November 2024.

Wages

“Real,” meaning inflation-adjusted, wages have gone up since Trump took office in January, and they went down over the entirety of Biden’s tenure. But Trump made the misleading claim that “for the first time in years, wages are rising much faster than inflation.”

Year-over-year wages have been rising faster than inflation since June 2023, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics figures.

As we’ve written before, the average weekly earnings of all private-sector workers rose 16.7% over Biden’s four years, but inflation increased by more. “Real” weekly earnings fell 4%; for rank-and-file production and nonsupervisory workers, the decline was 2%. Inflation hit wage gains the hardest in the first half of Biden’s presidency, particularly in calendar year 2022. For the 12 months ending January 2025, Biden’s last year in office, real average weekly earnings went up 0.6%.

Under Trump, since January, those real average earnings have risen faster; they’re up 1.6%.

“It remains the case that both at the tail end of the Biden administration and the beginning of this Trump administration, real wages have been rising. That is to say, inflation has been rising more slowly than wages have been,” Gary Burtless, a senior fellow emeritus in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, told us in a phone interview. Burtless said that his reading of various wage measures is that “the changes have not been terribly abrupt from the turnover of the Biden administration to the Trump administration.”

Trump referred to a real wage loss under Biden and wage gains in certain industries since January. A White House spokesperson told us that such figures refer to “annualized growth” using BLS real wage data, but we were unable to replicate the figures. For the industries Trump mentioned, since January, real average weekly earnings for the manufacturing and construction industries have both gone up 1.7%; mining and logging saw a 1% increase.

Inflation

At the top of his remarks, Trump said, “11 months ago, I inherited a mess and I’m fixing it. When I took office, inflation was the worst in 48 years and some would say in the history of our country.” He later said, “inflation is stopped.”

Inflation wasn’t “the worst … in the history of our country” when Trump returned to the White House in January. As we previously wrote, during Biden’s term there was a 9.1% increase in the Consumer Price Index in the 12 months ending in June 2022, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics said was the biggest increase in over 40 years. But annual inflation growth moderated to just below 3% in the last six months of 2024. The U.S. suffered its worst inflation increase year-to-year following World War I, when there was a 23.7% rise from June 1919 to June 1920, and it was higher than the peak of Biden’s term during other periods of U.S. history.

Inflation hasn’t “stopped,” as Trump also claimed. The BLS reported on Dec. 18, the morning after Trump’s speech, that the CPI rose 2.7% over the 12-month period ending in November. (BLS didn’t collect data for October during the government shutdown, and didn’t start collecting November’s data until the 14th of that month.)

Gasoline

Returning to one of his favorite measures of economic success, Trump claimed, “Gasoline is now under $2.50 a gallon, and in much of the country, in some states, it by the way just hit $1.99 a gallon.” Retail gasoline prices are lower than the national average of $3.11 for a gallon of regular gasoline when Trump took office, as we’ve written. But Trump exaggerated the average price now. It was $2.90 a gallon the week of Dec. 15, according to the Energy Information Administration.

He also exaggerated when he said “in some states” the price “just hit $1.99 a gallon.” According to data published by AAA, there were no states where the average price was $1.99 a gallon as of Dec. 18. The lowest statewide average was $2.34 in Oklahoma. (We found some individual stations in some states selling gasoline for $1.99 or less using GasBuddy, a site that provides information about prices at more than 150,000 stations.)

OBBBA Tax Cuts

Trump called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act he signed in July “perhaps the most sweeping legislation ever passed in Congress” and touted provisions that include “no tax on tips, no tax on overtime and no tax on Social Security for our great seniors.” (As we have said, fewer seniors would pay taxes on Social Security benefits, but millions of Americans would still have to pay.)

Trump claimed that because of the tax cuts in the law, “many families will be saving between $11,000 and $20,000 a year, and next spring is projected to be the largest tax refund season of all time.” An analysis by the Tax Policy Center found that the average 2025 tax cut from the legislation is $800.

“I don’t know what Trump means by ‘many’ but the only income group that gets an average tax cut that exceeds even $9k are those in the top 1 percent, who make $1.1 million a year or more,” Howard Gleckman, a nonresident fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told us via email.

When the White House’s own Council of Economic Advisers analyzed a Senate-proposed version of the bill in June, it estimated that within four years, the potential increase in take-home pay for a typical family with two children would be between $7,600 and $10,900. But as we wrote then, the CEA estimate was based on an assumption that real, or inflation-adjusted, gross domestic product would increase by more than 4% each year, at least for the first four years under the bill. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget labeled those “fantasy growth assumptions” that “are many times higher” than the estimates of other independent analysts that have modeled versions of the bill.

Immigrants

Trump repeated several inflated, unsupported or misleading claims about immigrants who came to the U.S. during Biden’s presidency.

“Our border was open and because of this, our country was being invaded by an army of 25 million people, many who came from prisons and jails and mental institutions and insane asylums,” Trump said. “They were drug dealers, gang members, and even 11,888 murderers, more than 50% of whom killed more than one person. This is what the Biden administration allowed to happen to our country and it can never be allowed to happen again.”

Trump’s estimate of 25 million unauthorized immigrants coming into the U.S. during Biden’s presidency is far too high. We calculated in June 2024 that the figure would be about a third of that, including an estimated 2 million “gotaways” who evaded capture by Border Patrol and about 3 million people released with notices to appear in immigration court or report to Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the future, or other classifications, such as parole.

The Pew Research Center estimates that as of 2023 there were 14 million “unauthorized immigrants” residing in the U.S. in total, which includes those with some protection from deportation, such as parole or having applied for asylum. That’s nearly 4 million more than the 10.2 million estimate from the Pew Research Center for 2019.

Trump also repeated — as he does in virtually every speech — his unsupported claim that many of the immigrants who came to the U.S. during the Biden administration were released from “prisons and jails and mental institutions and insane asylums.” Trump has never provided any credible evidence of that.

Finally, Trump’s claim that “11,888 murderers” were “allowed” into the country during the Biden administration is misleading. As we have written, there were about that many noncitizens who had been convicted of murder but were not in ICE custody as of September 2024 — a list known as the agency’s non-detained docket.

But the “vast majority” of them entered the country prior to the Biden administration and had their custody status determined “long before this Administration,” the Department of Homeland Security told us in September 2024, noting that many were in prison. Also, the noncitizens include those who entered the country legally, such as green-card holders. Some of them may also have been deported. We don’t know the source of Trump’s claim that “more than 50%” or those on the list “killed more than one person.”

Drug Prices

Trump made the mathematically impossible claim that he was able “to slash prices on drugs and pharmaceuticals by as much as 400, 500 and even 600%,” by negotiating “with the drug companies and foreign nations, which were taking advantage of our country for many decades.” Of course, such reductions would suggest that drug companies were paying consumers to take their products, instead of the other way around.

In a May press conference on drug prices, Trump made comparisons similar to his 400% to 600% price-drop claims. Then, Trump cherry-picked in saying that drug prices were higher in the U.S. than in other countries sometimes by “a factor of five, six, seven, eight times. … There are even cases of 10 times higher.”

Andrew W. Mulcahy, a senior health economist at RAND, a global policy research organization based in California, told us at the time that it was “broadly correct” to say the U.S. has higher drug prices than other countries, and “you can find examples of 5, 6, 7 or 8 times, or more, higher” for individual drugs. But on average, prices in the U.S. were 2.78 times higher compared with 33 other Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, according to a RAND report based on 2022 data. The average price was 4.22 times higher for brand-name drugs, which account for 10% of the prescriptions filled in the U.S.

Other Repeats

Eight ‘settled’ wars. As he often does, Trump claimed to have “settled eight wars in 10 months.” As we have written, international relations experts said the president has had a significant role in ending fighting in five conflicts, though officials in one country (India) refute Trump’s claim. But some of the international disagreements Trump cites have not been wars, and some clashes have not ended.

Housing. Touting his housing reform plans and criticizing Biden’s immigration policies, Trump also said, “A major factor in driving up housing costs was the colossal border invasion.” Vice President JD Vance made a similar misleading claim about the cause of housing prices rising during Biden’s term, as we’ve written. Immigration does affect housing prices by increasing demand, but economists told us the main causes of higher prices in recent years were low mortgage interest rates that fueled demand, a subsequent rise in interest rates, and a low housing supply dating to the Great Recession in 2007 to 2009. Immigrants in the country illegally are more likely to rent than buy, experts also said.

Electricity. The president said, “Electricity costs surged 30 to 100% under Biden. … On Day One, I declared a national energy emergency.” The cost of electricity did increase by 30% — not 100% — during Biden’s presidency, according to the CPI for electricity. But the cost of electricity continued to tick up under Trump from January to November, rising 6.8%, the BLS data show.

Jobs. Trump again made the claim that “there are more people working today than at any time in American history.” It’s correct, but it doesn’t mean much, as we’ve written. The BLS reported there were nearly 160 million total nonfarm employees as of November, the highest number of workers in history. But the U.S. also has its largest population in history.

“In November, both the labor force participation rate (62.5 percent) and the employment-population ratio (59.6 percent) were little changed from September. These measures showed little or no change over the year,” the BLS reported on Dec. 16. (The labor force participation rate is the percentage of the total population over age 16 that is either employed or actively seeking work.)

Investments. In his prime-time address, Trump said, “Already, I’ve secured a record breaking $18 trillion of investment into the United States” through his tariffs policy. But a White House webpage that purportedly tabulates “Total U.S. and Foreign Investments” made since Trump returned to office reports about half that, $9.6 trillion, taken in so far.

Experts say that even that number is questionable because it includes pledges and planned investments that may not come to fruition.“[T]hey’re just promises — and often vague ones at that,” Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the libertarian Cato Institute, said in an April analysis of Trump’s investment claims.",https://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/Trump-Address-720-x-307.png,N,,2025-12-19 11:59:14.453044

On December 13th, several migrant organizations came together with engaged social movements to exchange experiences and strategies – and here we share some highlight reflections.

Migrants in a global and regional context

This year, the International Migrants Day comes on December 18th amid an unprecedented forced displacement of people globally and escalating attacks on migrants including refugees, and their rights. This is taking place against the backdrop of the intensifying crisis of capitalism and imperialism in the world, the escalation of wars, genocide and settler colonial occupation, and illegal o in Palestine ; the destruction of nature and humanity, impoverishment, and widespread starvation. This comes together with the violation of fundamental human rights and collective and individual freedoms throughout the world, amid the global rise of the fascist right forces, its accession to power and place in governments, and its domination of the international political arena.

In the United States, the re-elected President, began his second term by immediately continuing the building of the racist wall separating Mexico and the United States on the one hand, and imposing the most repressive anti-migrant and anti-immigrant policies and measures in the history of the United States. In this country, built by immigrants and a country of immigration, the streets of the largest American cities are turned into real war zones and hunting grounds for immigrants, who are arrested, brutally assaulted, imprisoned, and illegally deported in a terrifying fascist spectacle.

As for Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and the rest of the Caribbean, the region is witnessing the forced dislocation and movement of people due to the fact that more than two million displaced persons and refugees from Haiti are forced to cross one of the most dangerous migration routes to America, where migrants are subjected to the worst forms of exploitation, slavery, human trafficking, and other crimes.

In Europe, as in the US, the fundamental rights of migrant and refugee people, have also been systematically dismantled. In all countries in Europe, including in the member states of the European Union, the questions of migration and asylum have been turned into racist and fascist political rhetoric as the rightist political parties continue to gain power. The Mediterranean Sea has been made into a mega graveyard of migrant and refugee people – not only because of over crowded fragile boats, but also with the deliberate government policy of prohibition and refusal to rescue at sea by European coast guards, but also the policy of blockade undertaken by Frontex, and other forces such as the “Libyan coastguard” – all financed by the EU budget/European taxpayers money – which results in fatal confrontations at sea. Citizen-led humanitarian search and rescue ships (such as SOS Mediterranee) are frequently blocked in their mission, subjected to armed attack and arrest of ships, which also leads to criminalization and court processes. Another trend is the normalization of hate speech, and system crimes against migrant and refugee people, summary detention and deportation and the externalization and securitization of Europe’s border regime to countries in Africa. At the same time, there is ‘policy standardization’ with the preparation for the full obligatory implementation of the EU Pact on Migration and Asylum across the EU member states – which has essentially dismantled fundamental human rights and replaced this by repressive ‘management’ policies and mechanisms.

In Africa, wars, poverty, and famine force hundreds of thousands of impoverished and marginalized people to migrate. These are our brothers and sisters in sub-Saharan Africa and the African Sahel, who are forced to cross the immense Sahara and sail the Mediterranean Sea in death boats in an attempt to reach Europe, fleeing their painful and terrifying reality and seeking livelihood and a better life.

In Asia, we also see more than a million forcibly displaced Rohingya

people fleeing persecution and military repression in Myanmar, who have crossed the border to Bangladesh and other neighbouring countries as Thailand. Most recently, the military confrontations on the Thai-Cambodia border is leading to further forced displacements. At the same time migrant workers women and men, especially from Philippines and Indonesia, are providing a vital labor force in other South East and East Asian economies – frequently in conditions of precarity of contracts and violation of labor and fundamental human rights. Similarly, many thousands of women and men workers from South Asia – India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Nepal are particularly concentrated in the Gulf States.

In the Arabian Gulf, similar conditions of exploitation prevail, and in addition migrants remain subject to the slave-like sponsorship (Kafala ) system and all forms of slavery and mistreatment against domestic workers and laborers.

Global Restructuring of Labor

Under the conditions of neoliberal globalization, huge sectors of manufacturing and production were moved from the Global North to establish supply chains that took advantage of cheaper labor in the countries of the Global South. At the same time very essential sectors of the economy could not be “outsourced “ to the global south – agriculture, domestic, health and care work, tourism services, oil- rig work and construction work. Therefore these sectors relied heavily on migrant labour from the global south.

Many peasants and rural workers were forced to leave their villages due to land grabbing by mega Agribusiness companies and pesticide driven model of agriculture that destroys the livelihoods of farmers and serves only the profits of the large corporations. Many are also forced to work in agriculture, either in transit countries or in destination countries, in precarious conditions and without social protection. They are exposed to labor accidents and to the use of chemicals and pesticides, without any protection.

While remittances have long helped prop up the economies of labor-sending countries like the Philippines, this reality comes at a steep and often ignored social cost. Large-scale labor migration has meant brain drain, the weakening of essential public services, and deep social wounds borne by workers’ families and communities. Migrant labor should never be treated as an economic crutch or a development strategy. Decent jobs at home—not forced migration—must remain the goal.

Likewise, during the past decades, the economies of the global north, have also relied on migrant workers for domestic, care and health services and for work in the tourist economy. However the living and working conditions are extremely exploitative and workplaces are frequently “sites without rights “ – including deliberative policies where many thousands of migrants are forced to become “undocumented”.

Migrant movements organize and build resistance

Migrant workers historically and currently are playing a major role in the economies of the global north, while at the same time contributing substantially through their remittances to the economies of their home countries in the global south – a source of foreign currency often earmarked to pay the foreign debt.

In the face of all the challenges they encounter globally as outlined above, migrant and refugee people continue to organize, protest, and resist this oppression.

Migrant and immigrant organizations and those movements and organizations in engaged solidarity – continue to raise the banner of struggle and resistance and system change and concluded the December 13th exchange resolved to:

pursue the campaign for regularization for all !

generate a new narrative – shifting the discourse while building on the achievements and contributions of migrant and refugee people – politically, economically and culturally

recall and affirm that the history of humanity is a history of migration par excellence, that the most powerful and advanced countries in the world were built by migrants, that migration is a fundamental human right, and that it is a movement of resistance against injustice, exploitation, colonialism, capitalism, and imperialism

continue to build the Pact of Solidarity as our collective response and commitment to system change for a world of justice and peace for all!

To Migrate is a fundamental human right and a movement of resistance and should not be criminalized.

Borders should not be death zones

Dignity should not be negotiable

Down with all borders!

Long live the International Migrants Day !

The December 15 order directs the defense secretary and attorney general to “determine whether the threats posed by fentanyl and its impact on the United States” justifies the Defense Department aiding the Justice Department in law enforcement.

The order states that fentanyl has the potential “to be weaponized for concentrated, large-scale terror attacks by organized adversaries.” But domestic and international law already authorize responsive action if fentanyl were employed as a chemical weapon.

This order is particularly worrying amid the Trump administration’s use of drug trafficking as a pretext to justify unlawful military strikes. Since September, the administration has carried out more than two dozen strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, resulting in at least 99 extrajudicial killings. This context raises the concern that the order aims to facilitate an expansion of such unlawful actions.

The executive order is also dangerous in the current domestic context, following months of National Guard deployments to multiple US cities. While US law enforcement agencies commit many human rights abuses, the involvement of the military in law enforcement would pose additional risks. Military forces bring fundamentally different training and experience to bear, focused less on rights-respecting law enforcement and more on the effective use of lethal force.

While governments have a legitimate interest in working to stop drug trafficking, addressing the harm of unregulated fentanyl requires an emphasis on evidence-based public health interventions. Militarized policing in US communities could unleash serious abuses, especially against Black and other overpoliced communities. US drug policy has historically fueled racially discriminatory policing, arrests, and incarceration.

WASHINGTON–Today, the American Civil Liberties Union condemned the Trump administration’s latest proposals to implement two nationwide rules that would significantly shut down access in hospitals to gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth. The proposed measures follow the recent House passage of legislation aimed at criminalizing such care and represent an unprecedented federal intrusion into the private medical decisions of families and their doctors.

The administration’s proposal seeks to block the provision of evidence-based, medically necessary care for transgender people under 18—care that is supported by every major medical association in the United States, including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics.

“These gratuitous proposals are cruel and unconstitutional attacks on the rights of transgender youth and their families,” said Chase Strangio, Co-Director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Rights Project. “By attempting to strip away essential healthcare, the administration is not 'protecting' anyone; it is weaponizing the federal government to target a vulnerable population for political gain. Healthcare decisions belong to families and their doctors, not politicians. The latest proposals from the administration would force doctors to choose between their ethical obligations to their patients and the threat of losing federal funding. It would uproot families who have already fled state-level bans, leaving them with nowhere to turn for the care they need to survive and thrive.

“We have seen the devastating consequences of similar policies at the state level, and we have fought them every step of the way. Let us be clear: If this administration moves forward with this attempt to enact a national ban on our medical care through coercion, the ACLU will see them in court. We will not rest until the rights of transgender youth to live authentically and access the care they need are fully protected.”

Why we mobilised

We mobilised to demand dignity, safety and justice for all migrant workers, and to stand against the government’s escalating attacks on migrant workers’ rights: changes to workers’ visas and proposed changes to settlement and citizenship.

This is not an abstract policy shift. These changes exclude and exploit workers, via even more insecure visas, increased salary thresholds, families being kept apart, even more lengthy routes for people to settle here, and more immigration raids – policies that treat migrant workers as disposable while extracting their labour. They come at a time of increasing anti-migrant government rhetoric and persistent mis-/disinformation from politicians and sections of the media.

This threatens the lives of our friends, loved ones, neighbours and colleagues. Many of us at JCWI are directly affected. The proposals push more families into poverty, insecurity, and create further barriers for people who have already contributed so much to the UK.

These injustices are entirely deliberate, the direct result of government policy. They are enforced through the hostile environment and normalised across UK society — from employers and landlords to consumers and institutions — while governments and private companies profit from the border regime.

Migrants have the right to decent working conditions, family life, secure settlement and access to support. Instead of fixing underfunded public services, migrants are being scapegoated and blamed for government failures.

Led by migrant justice groups including Regularise, JCWI, Migrants’ Rights Network, Tulia and India Labour Solidarity, the mobilisation was a strong show of collective resistance to these harmful new policies. We marched through Birmingham with the support of unions including RMT, IWGB, UVW, UCU, ITF and SWU, and other community organisations, including the Existing Skilled Migrants Forum.

What happened on Saturday

Saturday’s march was led by migrants directly affected by these changes. People who have already lived through uncertainty and paid huge fees. Trade union members who see the impact in their workplaces. People stood together to say that migrants belong in every community and workplace, and to demand an end to the Hostile Environment. We also stood in solidarity with refugees and people seeking asylum who are denied the right to work, and already face unacceptable delays to their applications. It is a system that oppresses us all, documented or undocumented.

The energy in Birmingham was powerful. People who are often silenced or sidelined stood at the centre, speaking clearly about their right to belong and to build stable lives.

The demonstration received coverage on Sky News and Q News Bengali, ensuring that the voices of affected communities reached far beyond the march itself.

Under President Donald Trump, federal immigration officials have dramatically expanded their efforts to identify, detain and deport immigrants they say are in the U.S. illegally.

Since the start of 2025, New England has seen a tenfold increase in the number of immigrants who were deported, compared to last year.

This big push requires the participation of federal, regional and local institutions — something that’s been happening across New England over the past year.

In Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts, county jails are holding ICE detainees. Regional airports handle ICE flights to prisons in other states.

Federal prisons, immigration courts and ICE administration offices in New England have taken on extra cases or new work.

Here’s a map illustrating the growing immigration infrastructure in New England.

The arrests

Last year, between Jan. 20 and Dec. 2, 2024, ICE made 2,044 arrests in the Boston “area of responsibility,” a region that consists of Vermont, Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire, according to an ICE spokesperson.

During that same time period in 2025, the spokesperson said ICE made four times as many arrests — 8,848.

ICE officials have targeted people at their workplaces, including design companies, construction sites, restaurants, dairy farms and car washes. They’ve arrested people off the streets, at the airport, en route to the dentist, and outside their homes. They’ve also arrested people during scheduled check-in appointments with ICE and inside court houses. Minor infractions like a DUI can tip off ICE to make arrests.

The region has also seen organized ICE raids, like a four-day operation in Connecticut in August, during which 65 people were apprehended. In September, ICE’s “Operation Patriot 2.0” netted 1,400 arrests in Massachusetts.

U.S. Border Patrol also plays a big role in immigration arrests in New England, particularly in Maine. Agents from the Houlton Sector, which covers all of Maine, arrested 725 people during the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30, 2025, a new record.

Some of the arrests in Maine have come through informal cooperation with state and local law enforcement. That was the case for a Maine carpenter from Brazil who was pulled over in May 2025 by a state trooper for an improperly-placed license plate and a missing plate light. The state trooper called Border Patrol to help verify the man’s documents, and he was taken into custody and later sent to an ICE detention facility in Texas. He was eventually released and is now back in Maine.

Some New England law enforcement agencies have officially partnered with ICE through a federal program that deputizes local officers to carry out federal immigration enforcement.

State police, county sheriffs and local police in New Hampshire began signing these 287(g) agreements in late February 2025 and were approved by ICE rapidly. That’s despite a statewide “fair and impartial” policing policy that prevents state police from stopping people only on the suspicion of their immigration status.

Of the 13 signed 287(g) agreements in New England, 12 are in New Hampshire and one is with the Massachusetts Department of Correction, according to ICE.

In Massachusetts, ICE arrests in local courthouses ballooned in 2025. In May, the Massachusetts Trial Court issued a new policy detailing how court staff should interact with ICE, though it hasn’t always been followed.

ICE is also developing new ways of identifying people to arrest. In several unassuming buildings outside Burlington, Vermont, a specialized intelligence hub for ICE known as the Law Enforcement Support Center is gathering information about immigration status and identity that is being used to make arrests around the country. It also processes tips.

The facility has been in Vermont since former Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy secured funding for it in 1994, and its work is expected to expand. ICE is looking to hire 100 more people to staff the tip line housed at the Williston, Vermont facility, the weekly newspaper Seven Days reported.

Williston is also home to a second ICE facility, the National Criminal Analysis and Targeting Center. In October, Wired reported that the agency was seeking to hire analysts to expand surveillance of social media to identify ICE targets.

Detention

Every state in New England except Connecticut has at least one facility that’s holding immigration detainees. These prisons and jails are owned and run through various entities, like county sheriffs, state and quasi public-owned companies, and the federal government.

Once arrested, it’s common for people to be taken to a detention facility in another part of New England, or outside the region.

For instance, Rosanne Ferreira-De Oliveira, a housekeeper and mother of four, was detained by ICE in Worcester, Massachusetts, but was sent to the Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, Rhode Island, where she was held for five months.

Tufts University graduate student Rümeysa Öztürk was arrested by ICE on the streetin Somerville, Massachusetts, and taken by van to Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in Vermont, then flown to Louisiana via the Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport, all within a 24-hour period, without having access to an attorney. She has since been released and has pending immigration and habeas cases.

ICE also has held people at a local processing center in an office building in Burlington, Massachusetts.

ICE also has held people at a local processing center in an office building in Burlington, Massachusetts.

Typically, people are transferred from there to a longer-term detention facility in a matter of hours. But beginning in May 2025, as the Trump administration ramped up arrests in Massachusetts and beds in regional detention centers filled up, the stays in Burlington got longer — more than a week in some cases.

Former detainees and immigration lawyers described conditions in the overcrowded holding rooms as “abysmal” and “inhumane.” They say there are no beds, so people sleep on concrete floors or benches. Each holding room has one toilet that offers little privacy. Many said they weren’t fed enough food, and women reported a shortage of menstrual products.

The conditions inside Burlington have sparked an outcry from the public, and people protest outside of the building several days a week. Elected officials have also been involved, pushing ICE for information about the number of people being detained and the conditions of their detention. In December, U.S. Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass. toured the building. He reported that conditions inside haven’t changed much since his visit in June, though he said ICE seemed to be moving people through Burlington more quickly. In mid-December, activists were arrested on the property while delivering care packages to detainees there.

People in other parts of New England have been protesting ICE detention contracts as well.

In Maine, activists have been pushing commissioners to stop letting ICE detain people at the Cumberland County Jail in Portland.

In Vermont, the high-profile arrest in April 2025 of Moshen Mahdawi, a local resident and pro-Palestinian activist, led lawmakers and activists to question an agreement between the state’s Department of Corrections and federal immigration authorities. Gov. Phil Scott said the arrangement is preferable to sending people elsewhere, and the state renewed its contract with ICE in September.

Advocates in Massachusetts are working to prevent more agreements from being forged there. In November GBH News surveyed all counties in Massachusetts and the Department of Corrections. It found those with existing contracts - Plymouth County and the Department of Correction - plan to continue them, but other counties that replied to the survey said they have no interest.

In contrast, county officials in New Hampshire’s Rockingham County are considering a new detention contract there.

New England airports

New Englanders also have been debating the use of the region’s airports for transporting immigrants. Activists have held several protests and called for a boycott against budget airline Avelo in Connecticut and New Hampshire, after the airline agreed to charter deportation flights out of other states.

Activists have also scrutinized flights from Hanscom Field in Massachusetts and Portsmouth International Airport in New Hampshire.

On Dec. 15, Gov. Maura Healey demanded ICE stop using the Hanscom Field airport to transfer and deport individuals. In 2025, through November, 114 ICE flights departed from the airfield in Bedford, according to the ICE Flight Monitor from Human Rights First. In the first half of the year, the Plymouth County Sheriff’s Office transported hundreds of detainees to Hanscom, to be flown to other ICE locations.

ICE has used the Portsmouth, New Hampshire airport, also known as Pease, off and on since July. The agency hasn’t said why or how many people are on these flights. But a handful of activists are counting the number of detainees boarding these flights, part of a wider effort to pressure local officials to stop the use of Pease as a deportation hub. Airport leadership says their hands are tied.

In Vermont, ICE has used commercial flights out of the Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport to move detainees out of the state. Activists called on airport officials to block that activity, but officials determined ICE was entitled to use public areas of the airport, according to a legal memo. In October, activists told the news outlet VTDigger that ICE officials appeared to no longer be using the airport.

Immigration Courts

Immigration legal cases are heard in three courthouses in New England – in Boston and Chelmsford, Massachusetts, and in Hartford, Connecticut. The Chelmsford court has seen a host of firings of immigration judges, as the Trump administration has terminated many appointed under President Joe Biden.

With limited detention capacity in New England and a massive ramp-up in enforcement, ICE has transferred many detainees to other parts of the country. That has brought civil immigration cases into federal court, as lawyers have scrambled to file habeas corpus complaints to stop ICE from removing detainees from the state.

For instance, Tufts University graduate student Rumeysa Öztürk, who was arrested in Massachusetts and transferred to Louisiana via Vermont, had her case heard by a U.S. district court judge in Vermont, where she had been briefly in custody when the habeas was filed.

Deportation

Mass deportation is the end goal of the Trump administration, and in the last year, the number of deportations in New England increased tenfold.

Between Jan. 20 and Dec. 2, 2024, ICE made 933 removals in New England. During that same period in 2025, the agency conducted 9,987 removals in New England, according to an ICE spokesman.

Some of the people deported include dairy farm workers in Vermont, a father of three in Chelsea, Massachusetts and a freshman at Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, who was on her way home to visit family in Texas for Thanksgiving.

Others are choosing self-deportation. The family of a 13-year-old boy from Everett, Massachusetts, who was arrested in October 2025 and detained in Virginia, asked a judge if he could voluntarily return to Brazil. A family in Springfield, Massachusetts, was preparing to self-deport after receiving instructions to do so on sticky notes from ICE, before a judge issued a temporary emergency order that allowed them to stay. The father was eventually detained at an ICE check-in.

A Revere woman with family ties to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was arrested by ICE in November. Bruna Ferreira shares a son with Leavitt’s brother, Michael Leavitt. While Ferreira, a Brazilian national, is fighting deportation, her ex urged her to self-deport.

Some families have been making arrangements for guardianship in case parents are detained or deported.

Others who have been arrested by ICE have later been released.

New Hampshire resident Fabian Schmidt was arrested at Logan Airport in Boston and held at the Wyatt Detention Facility in Rhode Island for 2 months before he was released and returned home. Lucas Segobia, a carpenter, is back home in Searsport, Maine after being arrested by Border Patrol and held in Texas. Paul Dama, the manager of Suya Joint, an award-winning West African restaurant in Boston, was released after nearly 100 days in ICE custody in New Hampshire.

In July, ICE agents detained a high school student in New Haven, CT, drawing condemnation and pushback from his fellow students, local officials and community advocates. The student was detained in Louisiana, but was eventually able to fight his slated deportation to Guatemala.

He returned home to a celebratory rally from his community.

How does systemic racism influence migration policies, asylum systems and border enforcement?

Borders are not simply lines on a map or physical barriers separating one place from another. They are a complex infrastructure of control, social ordering and exclusion shaped by racial hierarchies rooted in histories of colonialism, slavery and other forms of oppression such as patriarchy. Experts talk about “racial borders”, referring to the ways migration policies, asylum systems, and border enforcement reproduce systemic racism and racial discrimination.

These systems are used to create and enforce illegality and vulnerability. This includes who is ‘in’ or ‘out’, who should be treated with suspicion, who should be scapegoated during a crisis, who should be denied movement and who is disposable.

In modern border regimes, white people are privileged over racialized people who are excluded, often violently.

How are borders shaped or influenced by colonialism?

During colonial times, borders were shaped, imposed or influenced in ways that reflected and reinforced colonial power dynamics and ideologies, establishing and globalizing white supremacy and constructing racial hierarchies.

The Berlin Conference of 1884-1885, for example, established rules for the colonization of Africa and divided up vast territory between European powers with complete disregard of the continent’s indigenous populations. During the same period, passports and visa systems were created as basic systems of mobility control, to identify foreigners, limit their ability to travel and manage the use of migrant labour.

How is that reflected in migration systems today?

Today’s migration policies and practices reproduce biases developed during colonial times, for example the idea that colonists can travel freely between their country of origin and its colonies, while colonised people can’t. Colonised people can only travel to the colonial country to provide it with cheap labour.

These biases are reproduced in contemporary migration policies, as nationals of Global North countries can travel more easily and widely than nationals of Global South countries – and with more favourable visa conditions.

Amnesty International has exposed visa policies in several countries that intend to allow cheap labour from Global South countries but in fact expose racialised migrant workers to labour exploitation and other human rights violations.

What does the term “digital racial borders” refer to?

According to E. Tendayi Achiume, former United Nations Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, the term “digital racial borders” refers to the ways digital technologies deployed in asylum and migration contexts help entrench racial inequalities and racial harm.

Digital technology is increasingly shaping and delivering migration and asylum policies, from electronic monitoring, satellites, and drones to facial recognition, algorithmic decision-making in visa processes, “lie detectors” and iris scanning. The growth of digital technologies and so-called “smart border” technology have created new partnerships between governments and companies, and with them a range of threats to human rights. Racism is deeply ingrained within migration and asylum systems, so these technologies risk exacerbating racial biases and discrimination.

How are racial borders affecting people?

Racial borders create an underclass of exploited racialized migrant workers. For example, states employ exploitative visa policies designed to facilitate the employment of cheap migrant labour. These policies place migrants in very vulnerable positions.

We have documented how migration policies create or contribute to labour exploitation of racialized migrant workers in a number of countries across the world including Canada, France, Hong Kong/China, Italy, Lebanon, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and South Korea.

Also, migration policies, asylum systems and border enforcement often expose racialized people to discrimination and life-threatening risks, treating their lives as disposable and less worthy of protection. Amnesty International has documented this in the Dominican Republic, where migration policies have led to mass expulsions that disproportionately affect Haitians and Dominicans of Haitian descent, often implemented through racial profiling and other human rights violations.

Are there limits to states’ discretion in deciding who can visit and live in their countries?

Yes. Like any other state power, the power of states to decide who can visit and live on their territory is limited by their human rights obligations.

Under international human rights law, the prohibition of racial discrimination protects migrants and refugees from discriminatory treatment based on race, skin colour, descent, national or ethnic origin. International human rights law also includes separate protections against discrimination on other grounds such as religion, gender, disability, among others, which can often be racialized.

One of the ways in which States try to justify harmful policies and practices is to maintain a false narrative that borders are designed to protect, when in fact they are designed to control, extract and exclude.

This approach allows states to focus public attention on so-called border “crises” rather than looking into the root causes of displacement, mobility and immobility. In fact, states determine who can move and who can’t with their migration policies – and they often have a structural role in contributing to the root causes of displacement. It also shapes how support for refugees and migrants is imagined. Rather than a matter of justice and rights, it becomes a question of charity.

What should be done?

There’s much that can, and must, be done. In the short term, states must abandon discriminatory and exploitative migration policies, like visas that tie workers to one employer or discriminate against elderly and disabled people.

States must also stop surveillance and violence as means of border control and management. Migration policies must ensure that the rights of those who move or would like to move are protected and be guided by values of justice, dignity, and solidarity, centring those who have been historically marginalized at the heart of policy making.

In the long term, we must work towards a world where colonial ways of thinking, racial capitalism, and other violent mindsets do not shape policies, our experiences or our relationships with one another. It’s possible to imagine a better way of living together, where mobility and community life aren’t shaped by racial hierarchies but strengthened through mutual care and respect.

The effort to protect immigrant gathering places, ban masked agents and combat other federal law enforcement tactics comes as state Democrats, emboldened by successes in the courts and at the ballot box, aim to attack the Trump administration politically on rule-of-law issues, such as violations of constitutional protections. They are also tapping into anxiety in immigrant communities, which has fueled concern among immigrant and nonimmigrant voters alike.

“It’s never been more important in our lifetimes that like-minded state legislators, like those here, work together to share ideas and strategies,” said State Senator Mike Weissman of Colorado, who represents Aurora, which Mr. Trump has targeted as a hotbed of Venezuelan gang activity. “States are not just laboratories of democracy, as Justice Louis Brandeis famously said. They are also laboratories where remedies are being developed to protect our country from the disease of authoritarianism that is spreading out from Washington, D.C.”

The legislative push augments what a bloc of up to 20 attorneys general have done over the last year through lawsuits on challenging administration policies such as stratospheric H1B visa fees, the withholding of antiterrorism funds and the firing of federal workers.

The coordinated effort is reminiscent of what conservative groups such as the American Legislative Exchange Council and the State Policy Network have long done on issues such as promoting Christian values in schools, restricting abortion and limiting diversity initiatives, according to Gaby Goldstein, who founded State Futures, which organizes Democratic lawmakers, and who facilitated Thursday’s event.

She wrote in a recent essay that when it comes to drafting model bills that legislatures can use, along with assembling officials and disseminating ideas across the country, “the right has long done it better.”

Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, was unimpressed.

“Instead of useless P.R. stunts that cater to Resistance Liberals, these Democrat lawmakers should spend their time supporting policies that will actually benefit their American constituents,” she said.

A dozen legislators from seven states joined Thursday’s event: California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia.

Individual Democratic states have already moved forward. A smattering of legislatures, for instance, passed legislation this year that banned agreements that delegate some federal immigration powers to state and municipal law enforcement agencies. Several states have proposed banning masked or unidentified law enforcement officers.

Now they believe they have more momentum.

Irene Shin, a member of the Virginia House of Delegates who represents Fairfax County outside of Washington, D.C., said that the Democrats’ robust performance in November’s elections would make it easier to pass “a comprehensive legislative agenda to protect our communities and push back against the federal overreach.” Virginia Democrats won all three statewide races in November and secured a near two-thirds majority in the Statehouse.

Ms. Shin mentioned banning cooperation agreements on immigration enforcement and shielding private data from federal agencies.

State Assemblyman Micah Lasher of New York, who represents Manhattan’s Upper West Side, said he had cosponsored legislation to declare certain places such as schools, houses of worship and nonprofit offices as off-limits to federal agents trying to make administrative arrests or arrests without a judicial warrant. That way, he said, “our neighbors can function freely in our communities and deal with the basic needs of life, and do so not in the shadows.”

Similar legislation was enacted this month in Illinois.

State Senator Amanda Cappelletti of Pennsylvania, who represents a slice of suburban Philadelphia, said she would redouble her efforts on legislation that would require mandatory identification for law enforcement officers, including their name, their badge number and an agency or department-issued uniform. Another bill would prohibit officers and agents from wearing facial coverings or garments to obscure their identity, punishable by civil or criminal penalties.

Her constituents, she said, have been watching their neighbors get picked up and detained without due process. “It is absolutely unacceptable,” she said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/18/multimedia/18nat-states-pushback-1-kjlb/18nat-states-pushback-1-kjlb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 01:57:38.341552

Vendor platforms and the new surveillance pipeline Following a wave of vendor-built AI programs, ICE’s next moves show expansion.","The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released an updated version of its Artificial Intelligence (AI) Use Case Inventory this summer. At first glance, the changes seemed routine—some AI software programs were marked “inactive,” and a new one was added. But upon closer examination, the removal of the AI use cases does not appear to indicate a retreat from—but an expansion of—those AI capabilities.

Taken alongside reporting from The Guardian and Wired, the update points to broader trends in immigration enforcement: deploying similar AI functions within larger vendor-run platforms and expanding into continuous surveillance systems that pull in and analyze far more information than before.

Two months earlier, in May, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reported using 23 active AI software programs for immigration enforcement. By July, four of those had become “inactive,” and one—Email Analytics for Investigative Data—was moved back to “implementation and assessment” phase for reconfiguration under a new system. At face value, this looks like a pullback in AI programs. However, recent reports show there is more going on. Many similar features are part of larger AI software platforms that generate automated decisions that are harder to oversee.

Program changes made to the DHS AI inventory include:

Email Analytics for Investigative Data: Active (returned to reassessment). Automates sorting, translation, and entity extraction from seized emails.

Mobile Device Analytics for Investigative Data: Inactive. Parsed data from seized phones and devices.

Identification Card & Travel Doc Code Detection: Inactive. Used computer vision to scan IDs.

Voice Analytics for Investigative Data: Inactive. Transcribed and translated audio.

Video Analysis Tool (VAT): Inactive. Flagged faces and video snippets.

DHS also discontinued its use of three commercial generative AI services (for code, images, and chatbots) and added one new pilot program: the LIGER GenAI Toolkit, designed to support federal workers with tasks like drafting contracts and summarizing documents.

From specialized programs to big data platforms

The DHS AI Use Case inventory lists programs as separate entries, but in practice, these programs rarely operate in isolation. Investigations by The Guardian, Wired, and NPR reveal that ICE increasingly relies on large vendor-built platforms—such as Palantir’s comprehensive immigration systems, Clearview AI’s facial-recognition tools, BI2’s iris-scanning devices, and Paragon’s phone-hacking software—that pull together many different forms of data and analysis in one place.

Palantir’s platforms, for example, have been used by ICE to analyze driver’s license scans, extract information from seized phones, cross-search location data, and link records from federal, state, and commercial databases. Wired reported that these tools combine social media posts, travel records, tax data, and phone extractions into unified investigative files. NPR also documented the use of mobile facial-recognition apps and iris scanners in field operations.

Considering these new ICE contracts, the underlying functions of DHS’s “inactive” AI programs—ID scanning, mobile device analytics, video analysis, audio transcription—clearly persist across newer contracts and technologies. ID scanning now appears in field apps like Mobile Fortify; mobile device analytics continue through tools from Cellebrite and Paragon; voice, video, and text analysis feed into social-media and communication-monitoring platforms from Zignal Labs and PenLink.

Such integration carries troubling risks. When dozens of discrete tools are fused into a single “black box,” oversight becomes harder. As functions consolidate in one large system, it becomes increasingly unclear how someone was identified and harder for any watchdog to trace the steps behind a decision. What data is used? How is it weighted? What errors or biases carry forward? Without transparency, accountability diffuses.

Ultimately, AI-driven outputs begin to shape enforcement decisions in ways that are difficult to challenge. As the system grows more opaque, enforcement decisions end up driven by the final output rather than any understandable process.

Vendor platforms and the new surveillance pipeline

Following a wave of vendor-built AI programs, ICE’s next moves show expansion. Procurement documents uncovered by Wired reveal that ICE plans to hire nearly 30 contractors to monitor social media platforms—Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube—around the clock. Analysts would turn posts, photos, and profiles into enforcement “leads” for ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations Division. ICE asked the contractors to indicate how they would integrate AI into their work, and the analysts would be equipped with the latest surveillance tools.

This marks a shift from static software programs designed to log data to continuous, real-time surveillance of everyday online life. As noted in a previous Council blog on Palantir’s ImmigrationOS, ICE is increasingly relying on vendor-built systems that combine case management, biometrics, link analysis, and surveillance tools into a single environment.

When viewed alongside this trend, the July AI inventory update looks less like a reduction in DHS’s use of AI and more like a reorganization. Programs marked “inactive” on paper are not disappearing; similar functions continue in larger, always-on systems. This update enables continuous, AI-assisted surveillance pipelines—systems that automate monitoring, sift through social and digital data, and surface “high-priority” individuals for enforcement.

Together, these developments reveal the same concern: so-called neutral or “technical” systems are, in fact, the products of policy choices. Algorithm design decisions—what data to ingest, how to categorize risk, when to flag someone—shape who gets targeted, detained, or deported. Treating these platforms as neutral obscures the fact that they are political technologies, crafted by people and influenced by institutional priorities.

The July DHS AI Use Case Inventory may look like a shuffle of line items, but it signals deeper shifts in immigration enforcement. Individual programs might have been deactivated on paper, but their capabilities live on inside the platforms of vendors like Palantir. At the same time, ICE is expanding its reach into continuous, real-time surveillance of individuals’ online lives. Addressing these risks requires strong safeguards: independent audits, clear public reporting on vendor systems, and robust Congressional oversight to ensure accountability.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/immigration-impact-ice-ai-platforms.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 01:00:53.248664

Learn What It Means for the Community.

A Harris County judge this week rejected a lawsuit filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton that sought to shut down a local program allocating public funds to help undocumented immigrants access legal services. The ruling represents a key endorsement of a Houston-initiated initiative that has undergone intense political scrutiny at the state level.

The program in question, known as the Immigrant Legal Services Fund, was created in 2020 and recently received an additional $1.3 million to continue operating. The resources are distributed among nonprofit organizations that provide legal representation to people facing deportation proceedings, especially in a context of increasing federal enforcement of immigration laws.

The Harris County judge approves the continuity of the program

The court decision came after the attorney general argued that the program lacks a public purpose and violates the Texas Constitution by channeling funds to private entities. The Harris County judge did not share that view and declined to block the initiative, allowing the funds to continue being distributed as approved by the local government.

For Harris County authorities, the ruling confirms that the program serves a legitimate public function by ensuring access to due process for residents who live and work in the Houston metropolitan area.

A program that emerged in response to a local need

When the Immigrant Legal Services Fund was first approved, Harris County became the last of Texas’s large urban counties to implement such an initiative. Cities like Austin, Dallas, and San Antonio already had similar programs focused on facilitating legal counsel in immigration proceedings.

The proposal was introduced during the tenure of Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo and received support from the Commissioners Court in a party-line vote. The main objective was to reduce disparities in deportation case outcomes, especially for people without legal representation.

Houston, the epicenter of immigration enforcement in Texas

The local context is key to understanding the program’s relevance. Harris County, where Houston is located, leads nationally in the number of immigration detentions requested by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) through local jails.

The rise in immigration operations and detentions has increased the demand for legal services, particularly for families with work and community ties in Houston. Local authorities have noted that ensuring access to legal representation not only impacts individual cases but also contributes to the region’s social and economic stability.

More: 200 laptops distributed to the community

Organizations Receiving the Funds

The program’s resources are channeled to five organizations operating in the Houston metropolitan area and surrounding regions, all with experience in immigration legal advocacy. These entities work directly with people who are detained or subpoenaed to immigration hearings, helping them understand their rights and legal options.

From the local government’s perspective, the investment aims to ensure that immigration processes are carried out with greater equity and transparency, regardless of the individual’s migration status.

Arguments by the attorney general and the political backdrop

The lawsuit is part of a series of legal actions spearheaded by the attorney general against local governments that allocate funds to controversial social programs. In this case, Paxton argued that the program does not benefit the general public but rather specific individuals, and therefore should not be funded with county money.

However, Harris County leaders have responded that the lawsuit ignores the program’s collective impact, especially in a region as diverse as Houston, where a significant portion of the workforce consists of immigrants.

Additionally, local officials have noted that the litigation comes at a time of high political tension, in which immigration policies have become a central axis of state and federal campaigns.

The role of the Harris County judge in local politics

Although the Harris County judge is not directly part of the judicial process, her administration has been pivotal in creating and defending the program. Lina Hidalgo previously announced she would not seek re-election, adding a political transition element to the debate about the future of these local policies.

Nevertheless, the court decision strengthens the county’s position against potential future attempts to curb similar programs, establishing an important precedent for Houston and other local governments in Texas.

What’s next for the immigration program?

With the lawsuit rejected, the Immigrant Legal Services Fund will continue operating under the current framework. Harris County authorities have reiterated that they will continue defending initiatives that, in their view, strengthen community cohesion and access to justice.

Meanwhile, the case highlights the contrast between the priorities of state government and the decisions made at the local level in Houston, where the focus has been on meeting the immediate needs of a diverse and growing population.

For many residents of the metropolitan area, the Harris County judge’s ruling represents relief and a signal that local programs can be sustained even amid external political pressures.",https://www.iowaparkleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Judge-Rejects-Texas-Attorney-Generals-Lawsuit-Against-Harris-County-Immigration.jpeg,N,,2025-12-19 01:01:01.532951

Video on Monday in a Minneapolis neighborhood showed people yelling at ICE agents to release the woman, saying she was pregnant and could not breathe.

An agent was captured on video kneeling on the woman's back before later dragging her through the snow by one arm on her back toward a vehicle.

""Let her go! Let her go!"" witnesses yelled as the agent dragged the woman at an intersection.

The woman was eventually released from the agent's grasp.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said at a news conference on Tuesday that local police were called to the scene by a federal agent who claimed officers needed help.

But when police arrived, there was no violence against federal officers, O’Hara said, adding that other law enforcement agencies may have been using ""questionable methods.""

""Once it was determined that the scene was safe and there was no violence occurring, our officers disengaged from the scene,"" O’Hara said.

""We have been training our officers for the last five years very, very intensely on de-escalation,"" he continued. ""But unfortunately, that is not, that is often not what we are seeing from other agencies in the city.""

O’Hara also said in a statement to Reuters that the footage of the woman dragged through the street is ""profoundly disturbing.""

""This egregious disregard for human dignity is appalling,"" he said. ""It is deeply concerning that there appears to be a lack of accountability from our federal partners.""

The woman who filmed the incident, Lauryn Spencer, was driving on her lunch break when she heard whistles and honking, which have been used to warn of ICE agents in the area.

Spencer said she approached the scene and began recording immediately, but was shoved back by an agent when she attempted to ask the woman being dragged what her name was. Spencer said she and other onlookers were also sprayed with chemical irritants.

""They were being very aggressive from the beginning, like there was never a time where they attempted to use diplomacy,"" she told The Associated Press. ""I didn’t see anybody throw any hard items. The snowballs were definitely being thrown, but we didn’t start throwing snowballs until they started dragging her around by her wrist.""

Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin purported that federal agents were targeting a vehicle when protesters ""threw rocks, chunks of ice, assaulted officers and used pepper spray."" She said two people were charged with assaulting federal officers and remain in custody and that the agents sustained injuries, including cuts.

McLaughlin further alleged that agents attempted to arrest the woman in the video because she ""rushed an ICE vehicle and attempted to vandalize it"" but that they abandoned the arrest after being swarmed by protesters.

Footage showed ICE agents shattering a window before detaining a male driver, according to CBS News Minnesota. A short time later, the agents detained the woman who was seen being dragged in the video.

Agents were also seen fending off protesters who threw snowballs at them. The agents used chemical irritants, and one used a taser before yelling at the crowd: ""Who wants more?""

Tensions have been escalating in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area as federal authorities continue an immigration crackdown as part of President Donald Trump's mass deportation agenda.

Former Minnesota state legislator Hodan Hassan said she believes ICE tactics are becoming more harsh as the immigration enforcement operation in the region continues.

CHEYENNE, Wyo. — Carlos Montes was driving with his family on South Greeley Highway on Nov. 26 when a Laramie County Sheriff’s deputy pulled him over for what first appeared like a routine traffic stop.

Instead, the deputy took Montes into custody as his pregnant partner and 5-year-old son watched helplessly, his friends say.

For three weeks, his family and friends were desperate to find answers, including where the expectant father was being held. They say they were met with silence, conflicting reports and overall confusion when dealing with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Montes is a barber at Drew’s Barbershop in Cheyenne, according to husband-and-wife shop owners Drew Weston and Andrea Shipley. The couple is leading the effort to help his family navigate an increasingly difficult situation. They maintain he was wrongly detained by immigration officials despite trying to methodically follow the process to work legally in the U.S. Once he was taken by ICE, his friends and family describe how a distressing process left them in the dark about his whereabouts and well-being while putting up barriers to even simple steps like sending money to him to pay for phone calls.

Originally from Nicaragua, Montes and his partner had been living in Cheyenne since 2023, Shipley said. (His partner did not want to comment for this story.) As a licensed barber, he started working at Drew’s Barbershop in April of this year and had already gone through the proper immigration and licensing process, she said.

“Carlos has a naturalization number, and all of those things were approved through the state of Wyoming with the Attorney General’s office,” she said. “He’s worked at four different shops in town; he’s well known.”

After Montes disappeared into ICE custody last month, the couple encountered an immigration process that has been confusing and hard to navigate, Shipley said, adding, “Communication can be really difficult.”

That’s left the couple trying to piece together what happened to the barber. Weston theorized that some piece of paperwork might have been lost or missed in the long process. There’s also a chance that Montes entered the United States when migrants from Nicaragua were offered temporary protected status. The Trump administration terminated that status for Nicaraguans in September.

“I know that he has done so much paperwork to even be here and get his license, that he’s a guy who will do what he needs to do the legal way,” Weston said, “so for this to pop up and then to be treated like this, oh my God.”

After numerous requests for comment, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement responded to Oil City News on Dec. 9 with an email stating: “Carlos Fausto Montes Calderon is an illegal alien from Nicaragua. He was ordered removed by an immigration judge June 6, 2024. He was arrested by ICE Denver Nov. 26, 2025 and removed to Nicaragua on Dec. 4.”

That was information Montes’s distraught family and friends said they were unable to get from ICE. Then on Monday, after weeks of silence, the family finally heard from Montes. He had been deported back to Nicaragua and was able to connect with family there.

“If you are not an attorney, it can be really difficult for families to talk to ICE,” said Jackson-based immigration attorney Elisabeth Trefonas.

Although Trefonas isn’t representing Montes, she told Oil City News that his circumstances are familiar. It’s also not uncommon for people to have removal orders filed even though they believe their immigration papers are in order, she said.

The arrest

Montes was with his partner and child in the car when a sheriff’s deputy stopped the family, according to Shipley.

“She is going to have a baby any day,” Shipley said. “It’s heartbreaking what is happening.”

At first, the barbershop owners believed Montes had been sent to the ICE holding facility in Aurora, Colorado. But dozens of attempts to reach him were futile, they said.

Oil City News attempted multiple times to reach the privately-run Aurora Detention Center through its published number, which rang but was not answered.

Weston said a family member got through to the facility, but was unable to talk to Montes, even after putting money on his account for phone calls. Families of detainees have described the need to pay for phone calls and FaceTime to communicate with detainees.

In an attempt to see Montes, a family member traveled to the Colorado facility on Dec. 2 for a visitation, but was told that he may have already been deported. Two days later, a family member was able to reach Montes and confirm that he was still in the United States but had been sent to an ICE facility in a different state. On Dec. 5, the family used an online ICE locator tool that showed he was being held in CoreCivic’s Adams County Correctional Center in Natchez, Mississippi. Montes’s information was later missing from the locator tool when the family and Oil City News tried again. Four days after the locator tool indicated he was in Mississippi, ICE responded to Oil City News with the email saying Montes had already been deported on Dec. 4.

According to Shipley, Montes had told a family member that he had “signed some paperwork,” but wasn’t sure about the document’s meaning.

A spokesperson for Gov. Mark Gordon’s office said a representative had been in contact with the family, but was not directly involved and could only offer advice.

The Laramie County Sheriff’s Office confirmed that their deputies made the initial traffic stop that night for an inoperable headlight. “ICE authorized deputies to take Montes into custody,” a spokesperson said.

Montes has been stopped by law enforcement before. Last fall, he was pulled over three times and issued citations for traffic violations, court documents show. Most of the citations were for improper registration, not having a valid driver’s license and not possessing insurance. Otherwise, Oil City News did not locate a criminal history for Montes.

Trefonas, the Jackson-based attorney, cautioned that it’s risky for people to be driving if they have uncertainty about their immigration status, “but I’ve also had U.S. citizens wrongfully detained as well with mistaken identities, particularly with common last names.”

After being swiftly transported to a facility, she described, it’s possible the detainee either didn’t have a phone number memorized or didn’t have an opportunity to call anyone. “And then they’re moved or removed from the country before there was any time to talk with them about it,” she said.

Montes does not have an immigration attorney, according to Shipley. Immigration attorneys interviewed by WyoFile recently said the confusing process of detaining, moving and eventually possibly deporting migrants to different countries has become typical as the Trump administration increases its deportation efforts.

“We’re seeing people moved around so much they lose track of what day it is … they don’t know time and place,” Laura Lunn, of the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, told WyoFile. “People [end up] detained in Aurora, Colorado, and don’t know there’s a giant mountain range outside their front door.”

Shipley and Weston have been posting updates on the Drew’s Barbershop Facebook page, trying to rally community support for Montes, and established a GoFundMe fundraiser to offer financial help for his family and to possibly hire an attorney. Shipley said they are determined to help bring him back to Cheyenne to be with his family.

Aside from the personal cost, the couple said the aggressive crackdowns have taken a toll on small businesses, including theirs.

“It’s not about the money, it’s about the humanity,” Shipley added. “We’re taking a big hit and other small businesses affected by this are taking huge hits, too, but the fact is the people in the barbershop are losing a colleague, they’re losing a trusted friend and part of the culture of the barbershop, a community watering hole where people are supposed to be safe.”

The man’s name was Nenko Gantchev, a Bulgarian citizen arrested in Chicago, according to the information provided to the committee by ICE.

Sen. Gary Peters, the top Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security panel, said in a statement he was ""disturbed"" by the reported death at ICE facility near Baldwin in rural Lake County.

""People in the custody of the U.S. government must be treated humanely and have access to lifesaving medical care. While the cause of this death in Michigan is still under investigation, I have requested a formal briefing from ICE officials,"" Peters said.

Through the end of September, there had been 16 deaths this year in adult immigration detention in the U.S., according to tracking by the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

The North Lake Processing Center, a former privately-run prison, reopened in mid-June to house ICE detainees with a capacity of about 1,800. It’s owned and operated by GEO Group, a private company.

The Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation 's announcement Wednesday night came just over a week after the economic development leaders who brokered the deal with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement were fired.

With some Native Americans swept up and detained in recent ICE raids, the deal was derided online as “disgusting” and “cruel."" Many in Indian Country also questioned how a tribe whose own ancestors were uprooted two centuries ago from the Great Lakes region and corralled on a reservation south of Topeka could participate in the Trump administration's mass deportation efforts.

Tribal Chairman Joseph “Zeke” Rupnick nodded to the historic issues last week in a video address that called reservations ""the government’s first attempts at detention centers.” In an update Wednesday, he announced that he was “happy to share that our Nation has successfully exited all third-party related interests affiliated with ICE.”

The Prairie Band Potawatomi has a range of businesses that provide health care management staffing, general contracting and even interior design. And Rupnick said in his latest address that tribal officials plan to meet in January about how to ensure “economic interests do not come into conflict with our values in the future.”

A tribal offshoot hired by ICE — KPB Services LLC — was established in April in Holton, Kansas, by Ernest C. Woodward Jr., a former naval officer who markets himself as a “go-to” adviser for tribes and affiliated companies seeking to land federal contracts.

The Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation said in 2017 that Woodward’s firm advised it on its acquisition of another government contractor, Mill Creek LLC, which specializes in outfitting federal buildings and the military with office furniture and medical equipment.

Woodward also is listed as the chief operating officer of the Florida branch of Prairie Band Construction Inc., which was registered in September.

Attempts to locate Woodward were unsuccessful. A spokesperson for KPB said Woodward is no longer with the LLC but she declined to say whether he was terminated. Woodward did not respond to an email sent to another consulting firm he’s affiliated with, Virginia-based Chinkapin Partners LLC.

A spokesperson for the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation said the tribe divested from KPB. While that company still has the contract, “Prairie Band no longer has a stake,” the spokesperson said.

The spokesperson said Woodward is no longer with the tribe's limited liability corporation, but she declined to say whether he was terminated.

The ICE contract initially was awarded in October for $19 million for unspecified “due diligence and concept designs” for processing centers and detention centers throughout the U.S., according to a one-sentence description of the work on the federal government’s real-time contracting database. It was modified a month later to increase the payout ceiling to $29.9 million.

Sole-source contracts above $30 million require additional justification under federal contracting rules.

Tribal leaders and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security haven’t responded to detailed questions about why the firm was selected for such a big contract without having to compete for the work as federal contracting normally requires. It’s also unclear what the Tribal Council knew about the contract.

“That process of internal auditing is really just beginning,” the tribal spokesperson said.

Sharon Keegan

I. Introduction

In United States v. Sharon Elizabeth Keegan, No. 22‑13019 (11th Cir. Dec. 17, 2025), the Eleventh Circuit confronted a recurring but under‑theorized evidentiary problem: when can a party use an examining psychologist or physician as a conduit to introduce that party’s own out‑of‑court narrative under the hearsay exception for statements made for medical diagnosis or treatment, Federal Rule of Evidence 803(4)?

Keegan was charged with producing child pornography involving her fourteen‑year‑old sister, among other offenses. Her defense centered on duress: she claimed that her husband, the co‑defendant, had severely abused her and that this abuse vitiated her mens rea. Rather than testify and face cross‑examination, Keegan attempted to tell her story through an expert psychologist, Dr. Victoria Reynolds, to whom she related detailed allegations of spousal abuse. She sought to admit those statements through Rule 803(4) on the theory that they were “made for . . . medical diagnosis or treatment.”

The district court allowed Dr. Reynolds to testify as an expert about Keegan’s psychological condition, but excluded Keegan’s detailed abuse allegations as hearsay not covered by Rule 803(4), and alternatively under Rule 403. Keegan entered a conditional guilty plea, preserving her right to appeal the exclusion of the statements. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, holding that statements made to a physician retained principally for litigation, and not for the patient’s own medical care, are not “for” medical diagnosis or treatment within the meaning of Rule 803(4).

In doing so, the court:

Gave a purpose‑based, intent‑focused reading to the word “for” in Rule 803(4);

Re‑anchored the medical‑treatment exception in its traditional “selfish treatment motivation” rationale and in reliability concerns common to the hearsay exceptions;

Explicitly declined to follow the expansive reading of the 1972 Advisory Committee Note to Rule 803(4), relying instead on the rule’s text and the later amendment to Rule 703; and

Created a clear split with earlier decisions from the Second, Fourth, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits that had broadly admitted statements to litigation‑only experts under Rule 803(4).

This commentary analyzes the opinion’s reasoning, its treatment of precedents and Advisory Committee Notes, and its likely impact on the law of hearsay, expert testimony, and criminal defense strategy in the Eleventh Circuit and beyond.

II. Summary of the Opinion

A. Factual Background and Trial Posture

In 2019, Keegan took nude photographs and videos of her fourteen‑year‑old sister and uploaded them to a shared Dropbox account so that her husband could view them—sometimes at his request, sometimes as a “surprise.” An undercover U.K. agent discovered some of these images online, which led to a U.S. investigation, search warrants, and charges against Keegan’s husband. Initially, law enforcement did not suspect Keegan, but her own statements to investigators (admitting she had “accidentally sent maybe four or five photos” of her sister in pink panties) and forensic analysis of her phone uncovered substantial incriminating material.

Both Keegan and her husband were charged with child pornography offenses. The husband pleaded guilty. Keegan pursued a duress‑type theory: she contended she lacked the requisite mens rea because she was acting under the coercive control and abuse of her husband.

Years earlier, in 2018, a hospital physician had diagnosed Keegan with a dissociative disorder. After indictment, Keegan’s counsel retained Dr. Victoria Reynolds, a psychologist who had spent the last decade exclusively as a full‑time expert witness, with no clinical practice. Counsel asked Reynolds to “evaluate the impacts” of Keegan’s alleged abuse “as they relate to her current legal charges.” After two days of interviews, Reynolds arrived at the same dissociative diagnosis and prepared to testify that Keegan’s conduct was the product of “complex and recognizable trauma‑driven adaptations and survival strategies.” Central to that narrative were Keegan’s own detailed descriptions of spousal abuse, which Reynolds intended to recount to the jury.

The government initially moved to exclude Reynolds’s testimony as irrelevant. The district court denied that broad motion, finding the proposed expert opinion probative of the defense. The government then renewed its challenge, this time focusing narrowly on Keegan’s statements to Reynolds describing her husband’s abuse. The government argued that these statements were hearsay not within Rule 803(4), though they could be referenced as the basis of the expert’s opinion under Rule 703. The district court agreed:

Factually, it found that Keegan’s purpose in speaking with Reynolds was to prepare the psychologist to testify—“to feed [Reynolds] her story in hopes that [the] witness would then be able to tell the same story to the jury”—rather than to obtain diagnosis or treatment.

Legally, it held that Rule 803(4) did not apply, and in the alternative, that Rule 403 barred the statements because their slight probative value was substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice to the government.

Keegan then entered a conditional guilty plea to one count of child pornography production, reserving the right to withdraw the plea if she prevailed on appeal of the evidentiary ruling. On appeal, she argued that:

The district court misinterpreted Rule 803(4) by imposing an unduly narrow, purpose‑based limitation; and

Even if 803(4) was correctly construed, the court erred in excluding the statements under Rule 403.

B. Holding

The Eleventh Circuit (Judge Grant, joined by Judges Newsom and Abudu; Newsom wrote a concurrence) affirmed. The court held:

Rule 803(4) covers only statements that are actually made “for” medical diagnosis or treatment, i.e., where the patient’s purpose is to obtain medical care or evaluation for her own health, not to create evidence for litigation;

Reliability and “selfish treatment motivation” are inherent in Rule 803(4)’s design and must inform its application, even though the rule does not explicitly mention “trustworthiness” as some other Rule 803 exceptions do;

The district court did not clearly err in finding that Keegan’s statements to Reynolds about spousal abuse were not made for diagnosis or treatment but for use in litigation, and therefore did not abuse its discretion in excluding them as hearsay; and

Given that conclusion, the court found it unnecessary to reach the alternative Rule 403 ruling.

In a concurrence, Judge Newsom agreed with the result and reasoning but emphasized an interpretive nuance: even if Keegan’s reading of “for” as permitting dual motives is linguistically plausible, proper textual interpretation must be informed by the broader context and structure of the hearsay rules. In that context, the phrase “made for . . . medical diagnosis” cannot reasonably be read to include statements made for diagnosis that was itself sought as a tool for litigation strategy.

III. Detailed Analysis

A. Precedents and Authorities Cited

1. Historical Background on Hearsay

The majority opinion begins with a historical survey of hearsay doctrine, drawing on classic sources:

Wigmore on Evidence (5th & 6th volumes): The court cites Wigmore’s account of the gradual emergence of a general rule against hearsay from the 1500s through the 1700s, and his discussions of the rationale for exceptions when statements are “practically sufficient” in reliability.

Queen v. Hepburn, 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 290 (1813) (Marshall, C.J.): Cited for the “intrinsic weakness” of hearsay and its “incompetency to satisfy the mind” of factfinders about facts.

Ellicott v. Pearl, 35 U.S. (10 Pet.) 412 (1836) (Story, J.): Quoted for describing hearsay as “exceedingly infirm, unsatisfactory and intrinsically weak.”

Coleman v. Southwick, 9 Johns. 45 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1812): Emphasizes that hearsay deprives the opposing party of the opportunity for cross‑examination, and that a hearsay declarant can hide behind “I was told so” without answering particulars or resolving contradictions.

State v. Medlicott, 9 Kan. 257 (1872): Invoked to emphasize that rules excluding hearsay are designed to guard against the dangers of unsworn, untested declarations.

These authorities serve several purposes:

They re‑center the analysis on the fundamental concern with cross‑examination and reliability;

They link modern Rule 803(4) to a long tradition of cabining exceptions strictly to situations with strong guarantees of trustworthiness; and

They ground the court’s skepticism toward litigation‑oriented medical statements in a historical distrust of hearsay designed to evade cross‑examination.

2. Modern Hearsay Doctrine and Exceptions

The court references several modern authorities to situate Rule 803(4) within the broader scheme of hearsay exceptions:

Fed. R. Evid. 801(c), 802, 803, 807: The court restates the basic definition of hearsay as an out‑of‑court statement offered for its truth and notes the general rule of inadmissibility in Rule 802, followed by enumerated exceptions (Rule 803) and the residual exception (Rule 807), which explicitly requires “sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness.”

Mattox v. United States, 156 U.S. 237 (1895): Quoted regarding the rationale for dying declarations—impending death is presumed to induce truthfulness.

White v. Illinois, 502 U.S. 346 (1992): Cited to classify statements made for medical treatment as among the nation’s “firmly rooted” hearsay exceptions and to emphasize that some exceptions, such as medical statements and excited utterances, are inherently reliable even without explicit trustworthiness language.

Idaho v. Wright, 497 U.S. 805 (1990): Cited for the proposition that patients are “highly unlikely to lie” to their doctors because treatment effectiveness depends on accurate information.

Palmer v. Hoffman, 318 U.S. 109 (1943): Used to contrast inherently trustworthy business records with those created primarily for litigation, and to show that explicit trustworthiness language was necessary in Rule 803(6) because not all business records are inherently reliable.

United States v. Williams, 865 F.3d 1328 (11th Cir. 2017): Provides the abuse‑of‑discretion standard for evidentiary rulings and the rule that legal errors in such rulings are per se abuses of discretion.

City of Tuscaloosa v. Harcros Chems., 158 F.3d 548 (11th Cir. 1998); United States v. Byrom, 910 F.2d 725 (11th Cir. 1990): Establish clear‑error review for factual findings underlying evidentiary rulings.

3. Treatise Authorities on Rule 803(4)

The court relies heavily on leading evidence treatises:

McCormick on Evidence § 277: Provides the key phrase “selfish treatment motivation,” which the court adopts. The idea is that patients are motivated to be truthful when speaking to medical providers because their own health is at stake.

Weinstein’s Federal Evidence § 803.06[1]: Describes the “guarantee of credibility” that arises when a patient’s desire to heal encourages accurate statements to a physician.

Wigmore on Evidence § 1720: Warns against admitting patient statements whose “real use and predominating effect would be that of hearsay testimony of the patient,” a warning the court uses to justify limiting Rule 803(4) to genuine medical‑care statements.

4. Rule 703 and Basis‑of‑Opinion Evidence

Crucially, the court invokes the 2000 amendment to Rule 703 and the scholarship surrounding it:

Fed. R. Evid. 703: Post‑2000, it clarifies that inadmissible facts or data reasonably relied upon by an expert may be disclosed to the jury only “to help the jury evaluate the opinion” and, if they would otherwise be inadmissible, only if their probative value in evaluating the opinion substantially outweighs their prejudicial effect.

Henderson v. Ford Motor Co., 72 F.4th 1237 (11th Cir. 2023): Cited for the proposition that hearsay relied on by an expert under Rule 703 is admissible only as the basis of the expert’s opinion, not as substantive evidence.

United States v. Kent, 93 F.4th 1213 (11th Cir. 2024): Referenced for distinguishing between using a statement as substantive evidence versus as the basis of an expert’s opinion.

Paul W. Kaufman & Christopher J. Merken, “Toward a Presumptive Admission of Medical Records Under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(4),” 64 B.C. L. Rev. 567 (2023): The court quotes this article for the insight that Rule 703 now demands the very jury distinction (between basis and substantive use) that the 1972 Advisory Committee Note to Rule 803(4) disparaged as unrealistic.

Ronald L. Carlson & Paul R. Rice articles on expert testimony: Cited in the Rule 703 advisory history to highlight the debate over whether juries can meaningfully distinguish an expert’s opinion from its factual bases.

5. Circuit Precedents on Rule 803(4) from Other Circuits

The court explicitly declines to follow older cases from other circuits that broadly applied Rule 803(4) to litigation‑only examinations:

O’Gee v. Dobbs Houses, Inc., 570 F.2d 1084 (2d Cir. 1978);

United States v. Iron Shell, 633 F.2d 77 (8th Cir. 1980);

Morgan v. Foretich, 846 F.2d 941 (4th Cir. 1988);

United States v. Farley, 992 F.2d 1122 (10th Cir. 1993).

These decisions, relying heavily on the 1972 Advisory Committee Note, treated Rule 803(4) as having abolished “the common‑law distinction between the doctor who is consulted for the purpose of treatment and an examination for the purpose of diagnosis only,” and allowed statements to litigation‑oriented experts to come in as substantive evidence.

The Eleventh Circuit respectfully parts ways with these decisions, emphasizing that:

They predate the 2000 amendment to Rule 703;

They do not seriously engage the text and purpose of Rule 803(4); and

They give too much weight to the 1972 Note, which the Eleventh Circuit views as both atextual and undermined by subsequent rule amendments.

6. Deference to District Courts

The opinion stresses the role of trial judges in evaluating purpose and context:

United States v. Shamsid‑Deen, 61 F.4th 935 (11th Cir. 2023): Cited for the proposition that district courts, “immersed in the case as it unfolds,” are well positioned to resolve evidentiary questions based on procedural and factual detail.

B. The Court’s Legal Reasoning

1. Textual Focus on “for” in Rule 803(4)

Rule 803(4) provides, in relevant part, that the following is not excluded by the rule against hearsay:

“A statement that: (A) is made for—and is reasonably pertinent to—medical diagnosis or treatment; and (B) describes medical history; past or present symptoms or sensations; their inception; or their general cause.”

The core interpretive question is the meaning of “made for . . . medical diagnosis or treatment.” Starting with ordinary dictionary definitions, the court finds that “for” denotes “the object, aim, or purpose of an action or activity,” and “connotes intent.” Thus, for a statement to be within Rule 803(4), obtaining a medical diagnosis or treatment must be the declarant’s purpose or aim in making the statement.

Importantly:

This focus is on the declarant’s purpose, not merely the fact that a medical professional was involved or that a diagnosis resulted.

The court emphasizes the link between purpose (“for”) and the functional justification of the exception—reliability founded on a “selfish treatment motivation.”

2. Reliability and the “Selfish Treatment Motivation”

The opinion re‑situates Rule 803(4) within the broader logic of the hearsay exceptions. The key steps in the court’s reasoning are:

Hearsay exceptions are justified by reliability. The court draws on Wigmore and Supreme Court cases like White and Wright to assert that hearsay exceptions admit statements made in contexts that provide “substantial guarantees of . . . trustworthiness.”

Rule 803(4) is premised on a patient’s incentive to tell the truth when seeking care. The patient’s desire to obtain effective medical diagnosis or treatment—what McCormick calls “selfish treatment motivation”—is what ensures reliability.

Statements to litigation‑only experts may lack that reliability. When a party consults a doctor or psychologist solely (or essentially) to prepare for litigation, the natural incentive is not necessarily to be candid for health reasons, but to craft a narrative advantageous in court.

Although Rule 803(4) lacks an explicit “trustworthiness” clause (unlike Rules 803(6) and 803(8)), the court reasons that reliability is no less central:

In contexts such as excited utterances (Rule 803(2)), reliability is inherent in the circumstances of the statement, and thus need not be expressly referenced.

For medical diagnosis/treatment statements, the guarantee of credibility is likewise built in when the statement is truly made to seek care, but not when the doctor is effectively a litigation consultant.

3. Limiting the Advisory Committee’s 1972 Note

A key doctrinal move is the court’s treatment of the 1972 Advisory Committee Note to Rule 803(4). The Note had asserted that:

Statements to a doctor “consulted only for the purpose of enabling him to testify” are admissible under Rule 803(4);

This breaks from “conventional doctrine,” under which such statements were not admissible as substantive evidence but could be referenced to explain the basis of the expert’s opinion; and

The reason for this break was skepticism that juries could maintain a distinction between basis‑of‑opinion use and substantive truth.

The Eleventh Circuit declines to follow this Note, for two reasons:

Notes are not binding and can be outdated. While Advisory Committee Notes are usually entitled to “great weight,” they are not law and may be discounted when later developments undermine their rationale.

The Note’s central assumption has been repudiated by the 2000 amendment to Rule 703. Rule 703 now explicitly requires juries to distinguish between inadmissible information used only as the basis of an expert’s opinion and information that is admissible as substantive evidence. In other words, the Rule now demands exactly the jury distinction that the 1972 Note to Rule 803(4) declared unrealistic.

Given this mismatch, the court concludes that the Note’s rationale and its broad endorsement of admitting statements to litigation‑only physicians as substantive evidence should not control contemporary interpretation of Rule 803(4). Instead, courts must return to the text of the rule and its underlying reliability rationale.

4. Interplay with Rule 703: Basis vs. Substantive Evidence

The opinion carefully separates two distinct questions:

Can the expert rely on the statements? Yes. Under Rule 703, an expert may base her opinion on inadmissible hearsay if experts in the field reasonably rely on such information. The government conceded that Reynolds could rely on Keegan’s statements as part of the basis for her diagnosis.

Can the statements themselves be admitted as substantive evidence for their truth? Not necessarily. That requires a hearsay exception (such as Rule 803(4)), or another independent ground of admissibility.

This distinction is crucial in practice. Under the Eleventh Circuit’s approach:

The expert may testify that she diagnosed Keegan with a dissociative disorder and may explain that she relied on Keegan’s descriptions of past abuse as part of the basis for that diagnosis (subject to appropriate limiting instructions under Rule 703).

The jury may not, however, treat Keegan’s out‑of‑court abuse narrative, as recounted by Reynolds, as independent proof that the abuse occurred, unless a hearsay exception like Rule 803(4) applies.

By insisting on this separation, the court prevents parties from “end‑running” the hearsay rules by converting their own narratives into admissible “medical statements” simply by reciting them to a hired expert witness.

5. Application to Keegan’s Statements

The court applies its interpretation of Rule 803(4) to the facts with a strong dose of deference to the district court’s factual findings:

Timing: Keegan consulted Reynolds only after indictment and after spending four months in jail—suggesting a litigation‑driven motive, not ongoing clinical care.

Retainer Letter: Defense counsel explicitly requested that Reynolds evaluate the impact of alleged abuse “as they relate to [Keegan’s] current legal charges,” focusing the engagement on litigation rather than treatment.

Expert’s Role: Reynolds had spent a decade as a full‑time expert witness without doing clinical work, reinforcing that her function was forensic, not therapeutic.

Prior Diagnosis: Keegan had already received the same diagnosis (dissociative disorder) from a hospital physician years earlier—without sharing allegations of spousal abuse. If her goal was merely to inform the jury she had such a diagnosis, her existing medical record would have sufficed; she did not need a new diagnosis predicated on a more elaborate narrative of abuse.

From these facts, the district court inferred—and the Eleventh Circuit found no clear error in the inference—that Keegan’s primary (indeed exclusive) purpose in making the statements to Reynolds was to prepare a trial narrative, not to seek medical diagnosis or treatment for her own health. As the opinion puts it, “the medical diagnosis was not ‘the object, aim, or purpose’” of Keegan’s statements.

Thus, the statements were not made “for” medical diagnosis or treatment as required by Rule 803(4), and the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding them as inadmissible hearsay.

6. The Concurring Opinion: Textualism in Context vs. Literalism

Judge Newsom’s concurrence focuses on interpretive method. He acknowledges that, taken in isolation, Keegan’s argument has textual plausibility: a person can do something “for” more than one reason, and she did want a diagnosis (even if also for litigation). On a purely semantic level, Rule 803(4) does not expressly exclude dual‑purpose statements.

However, he distinguishes between:

“Sterile semantics”—what might be linguistically possible in a decontextualized setting; and

“Proper textualism”—which seeks the ordinary meaning of the phrase “made for . . . medical diagnosis” as used in the real‑world context of a set of hearsay rules designed to admit only reliably trustworthy statements.

In that context, he argues, no reasonable reader would understand Rule 803(4) to cover a statement made to obtain a medical diagnosis that was itself sought with an eye toward litigation and not for its own therapeutic value. Because such statements do not carry the presumption of reliability that undergirds the hearsay exceptions, they fall outside the ordinary meaning of the rule, properly understood.

The concurrence thus reinforces the majority’s bottom line but underscores that good textual interpretation must incorporate context, manifest purpose, and structure—not just dictionary definitions.

C. Impact and Implications

1. Narrowing Rule 803(4) in the Eleventh Circuit

Within the Eleventh Circuit (Alabama, Florida, Georgia), Keegan significantly narrows the circumstances in which statements to medical professionals—especially forensic or litigation‑consulting experts—can be admitted under Rule 803(4). Key practical consequences include:

Purpose inquiry is now central. Litigants seeking to invoke Rule 803(4) must be prepared to show that the declarant’s purpose in making the statement was to obtain medical diagnosis or treatment, not merely to bolster a litigation position.

Engagement letters and timing will be scrutinized. Courts will look to when and why the expert was retained, the expert’s practice (clinical vs. purely forensic), and whether the same diagnosis or treatment could have been (or was) obtained in a non‑litigation setting.

Defendants cannot insulate themselves from cross‑examination by “laundering” their narrative through experts. Attempts to substitute an expert’s repetition of a defendant’s story for the defendant’s own testimony now face heightened skepticism under 803(4).

2. A Circuit Split and Potential for Supreme Court or Rulemaking Intervention

By explicitly declining to follow O’Gee, Iron Shell, Morgan, and Farley, the Eleventh Circuit has staked out a conflicting approach on the admissibility of statements made to doctors retained solely for trial. While those older cases are decades old and may be ripe for reconsideration in light of the 2000 amendment to Rule 703, they remain good law in their respective circuits unless and until overruled.

This divergence:

Creates a doctrinal split over the scope of Rule 803(4);

Raises the prospect that the Supreme Court could eventually resolve the question; and

May spur the Advisory Committee on Evidence Rules to consider updating the text of Rule 803(4) or revising its 1972 Note to reflect current doctrine and Rule 703’s framework.

3. Effects on Criminal Defense and Prosecution Strategies

The decision has clear implications for both sides in criminal cases:

For defendants:

Using expert witnesses to convey their own narratives without testifying themselves will be harder. Courts will examine whether post‑indictment consultations with experts are truly medical or primarily forensic.

Defendants with existing clinical diagnoses (e.g., from hospital or treating physicians) may be more inclined to rely on those records and treating providers, who can more readily satisfy the “selfish treatment motivation” criterion.

Defense counsel will need to think more carefully about whether and how to instruct experts to recount the defendant’s statements, and whether such evidence can be admitted under Rule 703 (with limiting instructions) rather than Rule 803(4).

For prosecutors:

They can invoke Keegan to challenge defense efforts to introduce elaborate backstory narratives (e.g., abuse, coercion) through retained experts as substantive evidence rather than as mere basis‑of‑opinion material.

However, the same logic may boomerang against prosecution‑retained experts or forensic interviewers in cases involving child victims, domestic violence, or sexual assault, where the line between treatment and litigation preparation is sometimes blurred.

4. Implications for Victim and Child‑Witness Statements

Although Keegan is a defendant‑focused case, its logic is neutral and applies equally to prosecution‑sponsored experts. In some jurisdictions, statements made by child victims of abuse to “forensic interviewers” or SANE (Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner) nurses are admitted under Rule 803(4) on the theory that they are reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment.

Under Keegan’s framework, courts in the Eleventh Circuit may need to:

Examine whether the primary purpose of such examinations is medical (e.g., assessing and treating trauma, physical injuries, or mental health) or evidentiary (collecting statements for prosecution);

Distinguish between portions of the interviews necessary for diagnosis/treatment and those that are primarily investigative or forensic; and

Consider whether parts of such interviews might be admissible only under Rule 703 (as basis‑of‑opinion material) rather than under Rule 803(4) as substantive proof.

While the opinion does not directly address Confrontation Clause issues, the narrowing of Rule 803(4) may indirectly affect the range of out‑of‑court statements that can be admitted consistency with both the hearsay rules and the Sixth Amendment.

5. Strengthening the Basis/Substance Divide in Expert Testimony

Keegan reinforces a trend toward enforcing the distinction between:

What an expert may rely on in forming an opinion (Rule 703); and

What the jury may consider as independent proof of facts (hearsay rules like Rule 803(4)).

By rejecting the 1972 Note’s skepticism about jurors’ ability to keep these concepts separate, the Eleventh Circuit aligns with Rule 703’s post‑2000 architecture and supports the use of careful limiting instructions:

Juries may hear that “the expert considered X” without treating X as fact unless a separate hearsay exception validates X as substantive evidence.

This distinction constrains the risk that experts will be used as vehicles for introducing large volumes of otherwise inadmissible hearsay under the guise of explaining “bases” of opinions.

IV. Complex Concepts Simplified

A. Hearsay and Why It Is Disfavored

Hearsay is an out‑of‑court statement offered in court to prove that what it says is true. For example, if a witness testifies, “My neighbor told me she saw Bill start the fire,” that is hearsay if offered to prove Bill started the fire, because the neighbor is not in court to be cross‑examined.

Hearsay is generally excluded because:

The original speaker is not under oath;

The opponent cannot cross‑examine the original speaker;

The jury cannot observe the original speaker’s demeanor; and

Memories can be faulty, statements can be taken out of context, or motives can be suspect.

However, some hearsay is admitted under carefully defined exceptions where circumstances indicate a high level of reliability—for example, dying declarations, present‑sense impressions, and statements for medical diagnosis or treatment.

B. Rule 803(4): Statements for Medical Diagnosis or Treatment

Rule 803(4) allows hearsay statements that:

Are made for medical diagnosis or treatment (i.e., with the purpose of getting medical help or evaluation), and

Describe medical history, symptoms, or the general cause of the condition.

The underlying idea is that people will usually tell the truth to doctors because their health depends on it. This self‑interest in getting proper care makes the statements more reliable than typical hearsay.

Keegan clarifies that this exception does not apply when:

The person is talking to a doctor or psychologist primarily to prepare testimony for a lawsuit or criminal trial, and

Any “diagnosis” obtained is really a tool for litigation rather than for medical care.

C. Rule 703: Expert Opinions and Their Bases

Rule 703 governs what experts (such as doctors, psychologists, engineers) may rely on to form their opinions and what they may tell the jury about those bases. Experts can rely on information that would not itself be admissible—like hearsay—as long as experts in the field reasonably rely on such information.

But there is an important distinction:

Expert reliance: The expert may consider hearsay in forming an opinion.

Substantive use: The jury cannot automatically treat that hearsay as independent proof of the facts stated unless a hearsay exception applies.

After the 2000 amendments, Rule 703 expects juries to understand this difference, often with help from limiting instructions. Keegan leans on this structure to say: you cannot simply bypass the hearsay rules by putting your story into a medical expert’s mouth.

D. Duress and Mens Rea (Briefly)

Keegan’s defense theory was that she lacked the necessary mens rea (criminal intent) because her husband’s abuse placed her under duress. Roughly speaking:

Mens rea refers to the state of mind required for a crime (e.g., intentionally, knowingly, recklessly).

Duress is a defense arguing that a defendant committed a crime because of unlawful threats or coercion, such that the law should excuse or mitigate the conduct.

Her abuse narrative was therefore central to the case. The evidentiary question was not whether she could present any evidence related to mental health or abuse, but whether she could do so via her own hearsay statements filtered through an expert and protected from cross‑examination.

V. Conclusion

United States v. Keegan establishes an important and carefully reasoned limitation on the medical‑treatment hearsay exception in Rule 803(4) within the Eleventh Circuit. The key takeaways are:

Purpose matters. Statements to medical professionals are admissible under Rule 803(4) only when made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment—rooted in the patient’s “selfish treatment motivation”—and not when made primarily (or solely) to generate evidence for litigation.

Reliability remains central. Even where the rule text does not mention “trustworthiness,” the hearsay exceptions are anchored in reliability concerns that must inform how courts apply terms like “for medical diagnosis or treatment.”

Advisory Notes are subordinate to text and later amendments. The court declines to follow the 1972 Advisory Committee Note to Rule 803(4) where its rationale conflicts with the structure of Rule 703 as amended and where it attempts to expand the exception beyond its traditional, reliability‑based justifications.

Expert testimony is not a hearsay escape hatch. Parties may not circumvent cross‑examination by telling their stories to hired experts and then invoking Rule 803(4) to introduce those stories as substantive evidence.

A circuit split emerges. By rejecting the broader, Note‑driven approach of several other circuits, the Eleventh Circuit has created a divergence that may invite reconsideration by those circuits, intervention by the Supreme Court, or revision of the rules or Advisory Committee Notes.

Two months later, the Trump administration asked Congress in its fiscal 2026 budget request to eliminate OCDETF funding altogether.

His office said his statement referred to joint task forces whose work was previously reimbursed through OCDETF, but is now being carried out through the Homeland Security Task Forces.
“The Trump Administration did not invent interagency cooperation, it has been working for decades.”","For months, there were signs that appropriators were not on board with a Trump administration plan to wipe out funding for a decades-old Justice Department program tasked with coordinating major drug-trafficking and transnational-crime investigations.

Republican-led spending proposals rejected the idea. A Senate report said eliminating the program’s appropriations account would be “infeasible” without more consultation, while a House report touted the program’s “demonstrated ability” to share information efficiently to “keep Americans safe.”

During a September markup, veteran House appropriator Harold Rogers put it this way: “Our commitment to the work of the task forces can’t be underestimated or understated.”

The Justice Department disbanded it anyway.

The fate of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces is one example of how the Trump administration has bulldozed past Congress’ appropriations power as it reorganizes the federal government to match the vision of the president, oftentimes with little to no meaningful public pushback from GOP lawmakers.

DOJ officials first ordered OCDETF resources be used for the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement push, then transferred key operations and all of the program’s cases to other offices or entities, according to DOJ documents and communications with Congress.

They told Congress the program would be “eliminated” and removed from the organizational chart, those documents state. The Trump administration casts the move not as a closure, but as a reorganization that funnels the agency’s money directly to partner agencies to do investigations. The DOJ says it will save millions in “bureaucratic spending” and “ensure continued coordination and direction of high-level cases across multiple components.”

Thomas Padden, a longtime OCDETF official who served as acting director during the closure process, wrote on Substack that the changes are among those that mean America “is left more vulnerable to organized crime threats.”

The administration shifted the work into an unproven structure that places more emphasis on immigration offenses and human smuggling, wrote Padden, who left OCDETF at the end of September. The new model deprioritizes probes that include financial investigations and eliminates a central staffing infrastructure that ensured prosecutors and investigators worked together.

“I don’t understand why an effective program like OCDETF would be eliminated when we have 43 years of proven success going after the most significant organized crime and drug-trafficking threats that the nation faces,” Padden said in an interview.

The move also raises questions about congressional spending authority.

For the previous two fiscal years, Congress has directed $547 million annually to the program. That funding rate was also included in the current continuing resolution, which runs through Jan. 30.

Democrats largely opposed that stopgap measure as well as a yearlong fiscal 2025 CR that they said handed over too much spending flexibility to the Trump administration. And all year, they’ve fought White House attempts to claw back or redirect money from purposes Congress intended in appropriations law.

Cartwright (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)

Former Rep. Matt Cartwright, D-Pa., who previously led the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees DOJ funding, said that repurposing of funds is illegal and pointed to the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which restricts the president’s ability to freeze or claw back appropriated money without congressional approval.

“I worked with presidents from both parties and served in both majority and minority in the House for 12 years and could not imagine DOJ taking this kind of unilateral action during my tenure,” Cartwright said.

“This is an unfortunate precedent for the institution of Congress,” he said. “I am disheartened to see members of Congress allowing themselves to be taken advantage of in this way.”

History of support

Many Americans probably haven’t heard of OCDETF, pronounced “oh-suh-def,” which billed itself as “an independent component” of DOJ and “the largest anti-crime task force in the country.”

But they have probably heard of some of the tens of thousands of investigations it helped coordinate, such as efforts to take down Colombian cartels in the 1980s and violent Mexican cartels in the 1990s.

In 2019, Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, who DOJ dubbed as a principal leader of the Mexico-based organized crime syndicate known as the Sinaloa Cartel, was sentenced to life in prison after an OCDETF-involved investigation that included numerous law enforcement agencies.

The government said the Sinaloa Cartel was responsible for “importing and distributing more than a million kilograms of cocaine, marijuana, methamphetamine and heroin in the United States.”

Established under the Reagan administration in 1982 as part of President Ronald Reagan’s initiatives to respond to drug trafficking and organized crime, OCDETF had federal partners within DOJ and the departments of Homeland Security, Treasury, Labor and State, as well as the U.S. Postal Service and state and local law enforcement, according to a June 2025 Congressional Research Service report.

The program had strike forces around the U.S. to coordinate prosecutions and investigations. The OCDETF director managed the processes for identifying priority drug trafficking and organized crime threats, according to the CRS report.

Padden, the former acting director, said the Reagan administration wanted to overcome “stovepipes,” where intelligence information within one agency is not shared with others.

“These agencies had little incentive to share what they knew, and gaps between their differing authorities, and the purpose for which each agency is funded by Congress, made it challenging to conduct joint investigations of criminal networks,” Padden wrote. “These investigative challenges still exist today.”

The program’s central staffing and separate funding stream from Congress broke the stovepipes, Padden wrote, and agencies had to work together with prosecutors to build cases if they wanted to obtain the additional resources that the program provided.

In a partisan Washington, the program has received funding under both Democrat and Republican control. For years, funding has been consistent at around $550 million per year, though both chambers in their fiscal 2026 bills have proposed cuts.

The first Trump administration embraced OCDETF, and an executive order from President Donald Trump in 2017 stipulated that the program’s mission should cover various kinds of transnational organized crime — human trafficking, corruption and intellectual-property theft.

New operation

But within weeks of Trump’s second inauguration, DOJ leadership would look to OCDETF to fulfill Trump’s campaign promise to crack down on immigration enforcement.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche sent a memo March 6 to establish an initiative called “Operation Take Back America” that would in part use OCDETF resources to “implement core policy objectives” established by Trump.

Among those priorities, Blanche told the department the operation would require OCDETF to “surge existing resources” to address enforcement priorities, including stopping illegal immigration.

He said the operation would include “investigations and prosecutions relating to immigration enforcement, such as cases involving obstruction of immigration objectives by sanctuary jurisdictions.”

All OCDETF-funded personnel and strike forces must contribute to the operation, Blanche wrote, and OCDETF-funded federal prosecutors “must devote a significant number of their weekly hours to the operation.”

The memo also said the operation would help fulfill a portion of a Trump executive order from January focused on “Protecting the American People Against Invasion,” which ordered the creation of Homeland Security Task Forces.

Trump’s executive order described the role of the new Homeland Security Task Forces in a way that largely overlapped the tasks previously given to OCDETF’s strike forces, but added a new focus on immigration issues.

“The objective of each HSTF is to end the presence of criminal cartels, foreign gangs, and transnational criminal organizations throughout the United States, dismantle cross-border human smuggling and trafficking networks, end the scourge of human smuggling and trafficking, with a particular focus on such offenses involving children, and ensure the use of all available law enforcement tools to faithfully execute the immigration laws of the United States,” the executive order states.

In a separate memo later in March, Blanche wrote that “Reorganizing OCDETF” was among many potential reorganizations the DOJ proposed in response to an executive order implementing Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency workforce optimization initiative.

Two months later, the Trump administration asked Congress in its fiscal 2026 budget request to eliminate OCDETF funding altogether. Instead of millions in funding for OCDETF to dole out to agencies working on big investigations, the White House proposed funding go directly to the appropriations of its partner DOJ components, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration, FBI, U.S. Marshals Service, U.S. attorneys, the department’s Criminal Division and the department’s National Security Division.

OCDETF operations would instead be led by a task force director in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, which “returns to past practice and will allow the Department to ensure continued coordination and direction of high-level cases across multiple components.”

The arrangement would allow the department to “more directly and efficiently control resources that support investigations into drug trafficking and organized crime,” the White House budget appendix stated.

Then, in a notification signed July 9, the Justice Department again told Congress that it “plans to eliminate OCDETF as a standalone $547 million appropriation.” Instead, the Trump administration wanted $500 million to go directly to other components as the DOJ “will close the OCDETF Executive Office” by Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year.

Rejected request

Around the time of the July notification, GOP-led Appropriations subcommittees in the House and Senate released separate fiscal 2026 Commerce-Justice-Science spending bills that included funding for OCDETF as a stand-alone funding line, even if at a reduced funding level.

The Senate Appropriations Committee in mid-July approved a bill that would reduce OCDETF funding by about 2 percent, or $10 million. But they made their thoughts clear in a report that accompanied the bill, a document that is often seen as guidance for agencies on congressional intent.

“The OCDETF appropriations account is primarily a reimbursement account and its elimination is infeasible without further consultations between the Committee and the Department,” the Senate report states, adding their proposal “continues to support the OCDETF program.”

Though the House bill included a 27 percent cut, to $400 million, as part of the GOP’s push to reduce government spending, the bill also kept OCDETF as a separate item.

Still, by late July, OCDETF had effectively shut down its investigative and prosecutorial operations, Padden said, as Blanche ordered the program to transfer its 5,000-plus cases to what would become the Homeland Security Task Forces.

Morelle (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)

During a Sept. 10 full-committee markup on the House bill, Rep. Joseph D. Morelle, D-N.Y., offered an amendment to boost OCDETF’s current funding and prohibit money from being used to eliminate or dismantle the program.

Rogers, the longtime appropriator who leads the House Commerce-Justice-Science Appropriations Subcommittee, cited fiscal concerns in opposing the amendment. But he highlighted the significance of the line-item funding remaining intact.

“Equally important is the fact the House C-J-S fiscal year bill retains the task forces on its own appropriation,” the Kentucky Republican said. “Our commitment to the work of the task forces can’t be underestimated or understated.”

Rogers (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)

Additionally, the panel adopted a Rogers-introduced amendment that added language into the report that accompanied the spending bill. It inserted language that the committee “commends the Department’s work regarding OCDETF and its demonstrated ability to share information efficiently and effectively across agencies to keep Americans safe.”

“The Committee directs OCDETF to continue its multi-agency coordinated effort to disrupt and dismantle transnational criminal networks that present distinct transnational organized crime threats to the United States,” the language read.

Winding down

A little more than a week after that House markup, a DOJ official on Sept. 18 signed a notification to the Senate that OCDETF and two other components “will be eliminated.”

The notification said that an estimated two dozen OCDETF executive office employees would receive layoff notifications and referenced plans to have no employees onboard in that office by the end of that month.

The program would release its leased space at the Government Accountability Office building, the DOJ said, and a notification would be sent to Congress in the fall to remove OCDETF from the department organizational chart.

“OCDETF will not require pending or future appropriations,” the notification states.

When he left at the end of September, Padden said the plan was for there to no longer be any OCDETF employees by the end of October.

Meanwhile, after the longest partial shutdown in history this fall, the government reopened under a continuing resolution that lasts through Jan. 30 and requires the current rate of funding to continue for OCDETF. One congressional staffer saw this possibility early in the process and asked the Justice Department about it, according to records filed in an unrelated lawsuit.

Preemptively disbanding OCDETF by Sept. 30 “would render the Department unable to continue activities under a Continuing Resolution or other FY 26 Appropriations Act that specifically funds such activities,” the congressional staffer noted.

The department, in the records, said it recognized “that we may need to reassess the situation once our appropriations are enacted.”

And if funding was provided for OCDETF under a continuing resolution or a full-year appropriation, the department said it would “continue to execute the funding consistent with its underlying purposes, including providing it to law enforcement agencies. This can be accomplished without the existing OCDETF infrastructure.”

A Justice Department spokesman, in response to written questions, said the DOJ “has not ‘closed’ OCDETF as you suggest.”

Resources that OCDETF previously provided to law enforcement organizations will still be provided to those agencies, the spokesman said, and all cases have been transferred to Homeland Security Task Forces, which is “a priority of this administration.”

The move also will save millions in “bureaucratic spending” and “allows for improved interagency integration, operational flexibility, and more legal tools to bear, while mitigating weaknesses attributed to competing interests of non-unified investigations.”

The spokesman did not respond to additional questions. Neither the full House nor Senate has passed the stand-alone C-J-S spending bills approved by their respective appropriations committees earlier in the year.

A White House spokesperson, in a statement, called the Homeland Security Task Forces a “landmark achievement.”

“The American people are safer today because of the HSTFs — and they’re just getting started,” the spokesperson said.

Congressional response

Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., the ranking member on the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that oversees DOJ funding, wrote a letter in September to Attorney General Pamela Bondi that slammed the move away from OCDETF.

“The Department seems to have relinquished its role as the agency leading the country’s fight against illicit narcotics trafficking and the worst of the worst cartels and organized crime syndicates,” Van Hollen wrote.

Van Hollen (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)

The department and Congress have a history of working together on controversial spending plan proposals, Van Hollen wrote. But under the Trump administration, the government moves forward “regardless of the law and clear Congressional intent to do otherwise.”

“I am disappointed by the deterioration of this relationship,” Van Hollen said.

Morelle filed a bill to prevent the disbanding of OCDETF. “The administration, it appears, has no interest in what Congress thinks,” Morelle said in an interview. “Members of Congress I think on both sides support it. I’m going to continue to fight for it.

Unlike the denouncements from Democrats, their Republican counterparts have not publicly raised alarm bells.

In separate statements, the top two Republican lawmakers on subcommittees overseeing Justice Department appropriations did not criticize the move to shutter the program.

Rogers, who voiced support for OCDETF at the September markup, said he’s spoken to the DOJ about fighting transnational criminal networks, and that the House funding bill “reflects our shared intent to protect this great nation.”

“The Trump Administration has successfully ramped up our homeland defense, and we’ll continue to work together on reorganization efforts that lead to reducing foreign threats and making America safer,” Rogers said in a statement.

Moran (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call)

Kansas GOP Sen. Jerry Moran likewise avoided criticizing the administration’s decision to push past congressional intent on OCDETF.

Instead, he said “joint task forces” have been successful in investigating criminal activity. His office said his statement referred to joint task forces whose work was previously reimbursed through OCDETF, but is now being carried out through the Homeland Security Task Forces.

“I will continue working with my colleagues on both the House and Senate appropriations committees on how to best align the budget with the administration’s goals while making certain the work of the law enforcement task forces can continue,” he said.

Moving forward

The Homeland Security Task Forces were fully implemented in September.

As part of the HSTF framework, the FBI and Homeland Security Investigations, which is a part of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, formed the National Coordination Center, which provides the task forces with intelligence and operational support, according to the FBI.

At an event in October, Trump touted the work of the Homeland Security Task Forces, saying it had seized deadly drugs and illegal firearms.

Trump at the event said he directed the creation of the HSTF to bring together “all federal, state and local partners to achieve the national policy goal of eliminating the cartel presence in America once and for all.”

“It’s early and the results are spectacular,” Trump said.

But Padden wrote in his online post that comments at the event were “misleading, self-serving, and unfair,” as the HSTF received cases that had been initiated and developed by OCDETF task forces under the Biden administration.

“The statistics quoted during that White House event should be attributed appropriately,” Padden wrote. “The Trump Administration did not invent interagency cooperation, it has been working for decades.”",https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/12/bondi_BC_171_062325-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 21:57:48.820163

California Assemblymember Alex Lee said California has a recently enacted law, described as a “No Secret Police” measure, that bars law enforcement from wearing facial coverings.","AURORA | State legislators from Aurora, Denver and various states outlined a growing collection of state-level bills they say will protect civil rights, reinforce due process and restrict cooperation with federal agents in response to the Trump Administration’s immigration and deportation policies.

“When the federal government fails to uphold the rule of law, states are stepping up to protect communities and defend constitutional principles,” said Gabby Goldstein, State Futures president and founder.

Lawmakers representing California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia named some of the legislation they introduced or are introducing to push back against the federal government’s tough immigration policing during a Zoom press briefing Thursday. The initiatives include banning agreements or federal pacts between U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and state and local law enforcement, prohibiting law enforcement from wearing masks, protections for “sensitive locations” such as schools and libraries and creating private rights of action for civil rights violations.

Colorado Democratic Aurora Sen. Mike Weissman said Aurora was “ground zero” for heightened political attention on immigration enforcement. He described Colorado’s recent work as part of a multi-state effort to develop remedies to protect constitutional rights.

“You see many states on this Zoom today, because right now, states are not just a laboratory of Democracy, as Justice Louis Brandeis famously said, they are also laboratories where remedies are being developed to protect our country from the disease of authoritarianism that is spreading out from Washington DC,” Weissman said. “As different states work together to defend democracy and civil rights, and basic human decency. It’s never been more important in our lifetimes that like-minded state legislators, like those here, work together to share ideas and strategies.”

Weissman said that Colorado’s Senate Bill 25-276 says the constitution protects everyone regardless of immigration status. The measure was signed into law in 2025, and it bars jail officials from delaying a person’s release to facilitate an immigration enforcement operation and strengthens limits on cooperation with immigration enforcement without proper judicial authorization.

This includes protecting state and local government data sources from “improper prying federal efforts” and requiring data security policies at a number of essential community locations, such as schools, health care facilities, and child care centers, he said.

It also further clarified in state law that so-called ICE detainers are not lawful arrest warrants within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, and it updated and enhanced privacy protections in the Colorado Privacy Act for commercial geolocation data.

Finally, he said, it allows both injunctive relief and the possibility of civil monetary penalties for violation of the above protections “because rights need to be backstopped by remedies to be meaningful to people.”

“I have personally gained ideas from discussions like this that I hope to turn into policy with my colleagues here in Colorado next session,” Weissman said. “I also hope that our efforts that we have shared with colleagues in other states can turn into policy in other parts of our country as well.”

Rep. Lorena Garcia, D-Denver, also brought up Colorado’s 2023 law restricting the use of intergovernmental service agreements to detain people for ICE and limiting certain local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. She said Colorado lawmakers plan to introduce additional bills in the coming session focused on accountability, liability for improper information sharing, and additional trust-building measures.

“We all see that ICE is actually, in fact, not a law enforcement agency,” Garcia said. “It is a lawless agency.”

New York state Sen. Andrew Gounardes said he proposed a bill to limit when local governments and law enforcement can collaborate with ICE, generally requiring a judicial warrant. New York Sen. Zellnor Myrie proposed a bill that would allow people to sue for damages when constitutional rights are violated.

“These are our neighbors,” Gounardes said. “These are our coworkers. These are our children’s classmates. They pay taxes, they have businesses, they have jobs, they’re contributing members of our society.”

New York Sen. Patricia Fahy described legislation she’s sponsoring, dubbed the MELT Act, framed as an effort to require federal immigration agents operating in New York to be clearly identifiable, arguing public safety depends on public trust.

“The idea of federal agents acting like secret police or paramilitary units abducting people off our streets in broad daylight has been destroying that trust,” Fahey said.

New York Assemblymember Michael Asher said he created sensitive location protections to bar civil immigration arrests near schools, houses of worship, health care facilities, homeless shelters, nonprofits and government agencies. New York Sen. Shelly Mayer also enacted school-focused policies requiring judicial warrants and documented procedures before immigration agents could enter school spaces.

“I know that in my district, in urban districts and in rural districts, parents are afraid to send their children to school because of the activities of ICE,” Mayer said.

California Assemblymember Alex Lee said California has a recently enacted law, described as a “No Secret Police” measure, that bars law enforcement from wearing facial coverings. She also mentioned additional laws that restrict immigration enforcement’s access to schools without a judicial warrant, as well as budget investments in immigrant legal services and state litigation capacity.

Illinois Sen. Graciela Guzman described a bill proposal that would combine “safe spaces” guidance for hospitals, courthouses, schools, higher education, and child care centers with accountability provisions, such as a state civil cause of action for constitutional rights violations during civil immigration enforcement.

“This is about the Constitution,” Guzman said. “This is about whether we allow fear to become policy. If the federal government wants to push an agenda of intimidation, the state of Illinois and the states on this call will continue to push back with law, with organizing, with rapid response and with solidarity that does not fracture under pressure.”",https://sentinelcolorado.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-11.33.27-AM.png,N,,2025-12-18 19:56:38.226944

Avelo conducted 20% or more of the ICE Air flights each month from July to October, according to the report.","Why Should Delaware Care?

The involvement of Avelo Airlines, the only commercial air provider for Delaware, with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has become a target of criticism in recent months. A new bill would seek to cut any public support from an airline in such a position.

Delaware lawmakers will introduce legislation this week to strip financial incentives from Avelo Airlines unless they stop conducting deportation flights amid the Trump administration’s ramped-up removal tactics.

State Sen. Ray Seigfried (D-North Brandywine) and Rep. Mara Gorman (D-Newark) will file a bill Thursday that would also bar the Delaware Department of Transportation from working with airlines that deport people without a valid judicial warrant or demonstration of due process. That would essentially prevent the use of state-owned resources like Wilmington Airport for such uses, but wouldn’t end Avelo’s service in Delaware.

While applicable generally, the legislation is geared specifically toward Avelo Airlines, a low-cost airline and Delaware’s only commercial air operator, that entered into a contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in April to deport people as part of a new initiative dubbed, “ICE Air.”

Avelo doesn’t operate deportation flights out of Delaware; it only flies commercial routes from the Wilmington Airport. But the airline does fly deportation flights elsewhere in the country, including in Arizona.

Senate Bill 207 would amend two sections of the Delaware Code to allow for the enforcement of these accountability standards regarding deportations at state airport facilities by the Delaware Department of Justice. Any commercial airlines taking part in deportations would also be disqualified from receiving an aviation jet fuel tax exemption under the bill.

In December 2022, the state of Delaware exempted Avelo from having to pay jet fuel taxes for three years, a tax break that portioned out to about $43,000 each year. The tax exemption is slated to expire this month.

“That’s distressing to think that a company that is knowingly agreeing to [deport people] would get a break for their jet fuel,” Gorman told Spotlight Delaware.

Avelo leadership has repeatedly defended the decision to work with ICE as a financial move to keep the startup airline afloat.

The decision drew immediate and widespread backlash from legislative leaders and Delaware residents as the Trump administration intensified its deportation tactics nationwide. As part of its immigration agenda, the administration has sent people to detention facilities in Guantánamo Bay, high-security prisons in El Salvador and deported immigrants to countries of which they are not from.

Avelo Airlines, which has been known to fly deportees to Mexico, did not respond to Spotlight Delaware’s request for comment on the proposed legislation Wednesday.

Lawmakers also intend to file Senate Concurrent Resolution 123 to discourage the Delaware River & Bay Authority – which manages the Wilmington Airport – from working with any businesses, like Avelo, that have contracts with ICE to deport people who have not been afforded due process.

The Delaware River & Bay Authority, a bi-state agency supported by Delaware and New Jersey that manages the airport, supports Avelo’s Delaware operations through a $500,000 annual marketing campaign using public dollars. Spotlight Delaware first disclosed that relationship in a story last month.

The DRBA previously said the contract is not about politics, but about boosting travel to the Wilmington Airport, which has struggled to retain regular commercial flights for decades. The regional agency also maintains that it uses “user fees” from bridge toll and ferry ticket collections – not direct tax dollars – to fund operations.

“While the DRBA understands and acknowledges community concerns regarding Avelo’s activities at other airports, those activities are outside the scope of the DRBA’s authority,” Delaware River and Bay Authority spokesperson James Salmon said in a statement.

Before Trump took office in 2025, ICE used contract carriers for deportation charter flights. In the spring, ICE contracted small commercial airlines to help carry out the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda.

In November, Avelo operated about 17% of ICE Air charter flights, which include deportation, deportation-related and domestic transfer ICE flights in the U.S., according to Human Rights First’s November ICE Flight Monitor report. The flight monitor uses publicly available aviation data to monitor and document flights conducted by ICE.

Avelo conducted 20% or more of the ICE Air flights each month from July to October, according to the report.

The legislation will be considered during the 2026 Delaware legislative session that begins on Tuesday, Jan. 13.",https://spotlightdelaware.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Avelo-web-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 19:56:48.184488

Now this commitment must become operational: effective returns, structured cooperation with third countries and real measures to support EU member states,” he said.
He said that clear delineations of safe and unsafe nations would rid the EU of “excessive interpretative uncertainty” that led to a kind of paralysis for national decision-makers over border controls.
The measures also allow individual nations within the bloc to designate other countries safe for their own immigration purposes.","The European Union on Thursday said it would drastically reduce asylum claims from seven nations in Africa, the Middle East and Asia by deeming them safe countries of origin, prompting widespread outrage from human rights groups on International Migrants’ Day.

An agreement between European Parliament and the European Council, which is the group of the 27 EU heads of state, said the countries would be considered safe if they lack “relevant circumstances, such as indiscriminate violence in the context of an armed conflict.”

Asylum requests by people from Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, Kosovo, India, Morocco and Tunisia will be “fast-tracked, with applicants having to prove that this provision should not apply to them,” read the announcement of the agreement. “The list can be expanded in the future under the EU’s ordinary legislative procedure.”

In 2024, EU nations endorsed sweeping reforms to the bloc’s failed asylum system. The rules were meant to resolve the issues that have divided the 27 countries since more than 1 million migrants swept into Europe in 2015, most fleeing war in Syria and Iraq.

Under the Pact on Migration and Asylum, which goes into force in June 2026, people can be sent to countries deemed safe, but not to those where they face the risk of physical harm or persecution.

Amnesty International EU advocate Olivia Sundberg Diez said the new measures were “a shameless attempt to sidestep international legal obligations” and would endanger migrants.

French MEP Mélissa Camara said the safe countries of origins concept and others agreed to by the Council and Parliament “opens the door to return hubs outside the EU’s borders, where third-country nationals are sometimes subjected to inhumane treatment with almost no monitoring” and “undoubtedly places thousands of people in exile in situations of danger.”

Céline Mias, the EU director of the Danish Refugee Council, said “we are deeply worried that this fast-track system will fail to protect people in need of protection, including activists, journalists and marginalized groups in places where human rights are clearly under attack.”

Alessandro Ciriani, an Italian MEP with the European Conservatives and Reformists group, said the designation sends a firm message that the EU has toughened its borders.

“Europe wants enforceable rules and shared responsibility. Now this commitment must become operational: effective returns, structured cooperation with third countries and real measures to support EU member states,” he said.

He said that clear delineations of safe and unsafe nations would rid the EU of “excessive interpretative uncertainty” that led to a kind of paralysis for national decision-makers over border controls.

Many hospitals, including in California, have already curtailed such care or shuttered their gender-affirming care programs as a result.
Rob Bonta’s office is already suing the Trump administration for its efforts to curtail gender-affirming care and target providers of such care in California, where it is protected and supported by state law.

But resisting such medical interference isn’t just about gender-affirming care.","The Trump administration and House Republicans advanced measures this week to end gender-affirming care for transgender children and some young adults, drawing outrage and resistance from LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations, families with transgender kids, medical providers and some of California’s liberal leaders.

The latest efforts — which seek to ban such care nationwide, strip funding from hospitals that provide it and punish doctors and parents who perform or support it — follow earlier executive orders from President Trump and work by the Justice Department to rein in such care.

Many hospitals, including in California, have already curtailed such care or shuttered their gender-affirming care programs as a result.

Abigail Jones, a 17-year-old transgender activist from Riverside, called the moves “ridiculous” and dangerous, as such care “saves lives.”

She also called them a purely political act by Republicans intent on making transgender people into a “monster” to rally their base against, and one that is “going to backfire on them because they’re not focusing on what the people want,” such as affordability and lower healthcare costs.

On Wednesday, the House passed a sweeping ban on gender-affirming care for youth that was put forward by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), largely along party lines.

The bill — which faces a tougher road in the U.S. Senate — bars already rare gender-affirming surgeries but also more common treatments such as hormone therapies and puberty blockers for anyone under 18. It also calls for the criminal prosecution of doctors and other healthcare workers who provide such care, and for penalties for parents who facilitate or consent to it being performed on their children.

“Children are not old enough to vote, drive, or get a tattoo and they are certainly not old enough to be chemically castrated or permanently mutilated!!!” Greene posted on X.

“The tide is turning and I’m so grateful that congress is taking measurable steps to end this practice that destroyed my childhood,” posted Chloe Cole, a prominent “detransitioner” who campaigns against gender-affirming care for children, which she received and now regrets.

Queer rights groups denounced the measure as a dangerous threat to medical providers and parents, and one that mischaracterizes legitimate care backed by major U.S. medical associations. They also called it a threat to LGBTQ+ rights more broadly.

“Should this bill become law, doctors could face the threat of prison simply for doing their jobs and providing the care they were trained to deliver. Parents could be criminalized and even imprisoned for supporting their children and ensuring they receive prescribed medication,” said Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign, one of the nation’s leading LGBTQ+ rights groups.

On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services are proposing new rules that would ban such care by medical providers that participate in its programs — which includes nearly all U.S. hospitals. The health department said the move is “designed to ensure that the U.S. government will not be in business with organizations that intentionally or unintentionally inflict permanent harm on children.”

The department said officials will propose additional rules to prohibit Medicaid or federal Children’s Health Insurance Program funding from being used for gender-affirming care for children or for young adults under the age of 19, and that its Office of Civil Rights would be proposing a rule to exclude gender dysphoria as a covered disability.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, meanwhile, issued warning letters to manufacturers of certain medical devices, including breast binders, that marketing their products to transgender youth is illegal.

“Under my leadership, and answering President Trump’s call to action, the federal government will do everything in its power to stop unsafe, irreversible practices that put our children at risk,” Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a statement. “Our children deserve better — and we are delivering on that promise.”

The proposed rule changes are subject to public comment, and the Human Rights Campaign and other LGBTQ+ organizations, including the Los Angeles LGBT Center, urged their supporters to voice their opposition.

Joe Hollendoner, the center’s chief executive, said the proposed changes “cruelly target transgender youth” and will “destabilize safety-net hospitals” and other critical care providers.

“Hospitals should never be forced to choose between providing lifesaving care to transgender young people and delivering critical services like cancer treatment to other patients,” Hollendoner said. “Yet this is exactly the division and harm these rules are designed to create.”

Hollendoner noted that California hospitals such as Children’s Hospital Los Angeles have already curtailed their gender-affirming services in the face of earlier threats from the Trump administration, and thousands of transgender youth have already lost access to care.

Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a statement contrasting the Trump administration’s moves with California’s new partnership with The Trevor Project, to improve training for the state’s 988 crisis and suicide hotline for vulnerable youth, including LGBTQ+ kids at disproportionately high risk of suicide and mental health issues.

“As the Trump administration abandons the well-being of LGBTQ youth, California is putting more resources toward providing vulnerable kids with the mental health support they deserve,” Newsom said.

California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta’s office is already suing the Trump administration for its efforts to curtail gender-affirming care and target providers of such care in California, where it is protected and supported by state law. His office has also resisted Trump administration efforts to roll back other transgender rights, including in youth sports.

On Thursday, Bonta said the proposed rules were “the Trump Administration’s latest attempt to strip Americans of the care they need to live as their authentic selves.” He also said they are “unlawful,” and that his office will fight them.

“If the Trump Administration puts forth final rules similar to these proposals, we stand ready to use every tool in our toolbox to prevent them from ever going into effect,” Bonta said — adding that “medically necessary gender-affirming care remains protected by California law.”

Arne Johnson, a Bay Area father of a transgender child who helps run a group of similar families called Rainbow Families Action, said there has been “a lot of hate spewed” toward them in recent days, but they are focused on fighting back — and asking hospital networks to “not panic and shut down care” based on proposed rules that have not been finalized.

Johnson said Republicans and Trump administration officials are “weirdly obsessed” with transgender kids’ bodies, are “breaking the trust between us and our doctors,” and are putting politics in between families and their healthcare providers in dangerous ways.

He said parents of transgender kids are “used to being hurt and upset and sad and worried about their kids, and also doing everything in their power to make sure that nothing bad happens to them,” and aren’t about to stop fighting now.

But resisting such medical interference isn’t just about gender-affirming care. Next it could be over vaccines being blocked for kids, he said — which should get all parents upset and vocal.

“If our kids don’t get care, they’re coming for your kids next,” Johnson said. “Pretty soon all of us are going to be going into hospital rooms wondering whether that doctor across from us can be trusted to give our kid the best care — or if their hands are going to be tied.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c3b8f57/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2100+0+284/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffa%2Fce%2F1025db0849da8838736725186e94%2Fgettyimages-2251913431.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 18:57:27.573684

We should all be able to travel to visit our loved ones and explore new places. But right now, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is going after immigrants in new and harmful ways. Traveling through U.S. airports can be risky, even if you have active or pending legal immigration status and/or have traveled without issues in the past. That’s why it’s more important than ever to know your rights and how to prepare for risks as you travel.

This resource gives travel safety tips and other resources on how to understand the risks and prepare yourself and your family.

Disclaimer: This resource provides general information. It is not legal advice specific to your situation. We recommend that community members exercise caution and speak to an immigration lawyer about their individual cases.

What’s Happening

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the government agency that handles airport security, is giving passenger information to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This means people who don’t have legal immigration status or whose status is uncertain could be arrested or deported when they go through airport security in the United States.

How does it happen? A few times each week, TSA sends ICE lists of people flying through U.S. airports. These lists include names, photos, and other details. ICE checks these lists against its own records. If ICE finds someone they want to target, they can send officers to arrest that person at the airport.

Isn’t my private information protected? Normally, government agencies have rules about sharing private information. But TSA and ICE are both part of the same department – the Department of Homeland Security – so those rules don’t apply here.

Is ICE already arresting people at airports? Yes. The New York Times reported on December 12, 2025, that TSA is sharing this information with ICE. Before that, there were already reports of ICE arrests at airports. For example, on November 20, ICE arrested college student Ana Luccía López Belloza at Boston’s Logan Airport while she was waiting to board a flight to visit family for Thanksgiving. She had an old deportation order, though she didn’t know it.

Who Is at Risk of Arrest by ICE at U.S. Airports?

If you are undocumented or have temporary immigration status, there is a significant risk of arrest at a U.S. airport. People with deportation orders face a particularly high risk. All non-citizens face some risk, especially people whose status is uncertain or who have risk factors we will describe here. Here is more information to help you understand your risk:

Old deportation orders: If you have an old deportation order on your record, you are at high risk of arrest. This is true even if you didn’t know you had an old deportation order or if the order is from when you were a child. It is also true if your deportation order is from an expedited deportation process.

How do you check if you have a deportation order? If the government ever gave you paperwork with an “alien registration” number (A-number), you can check online using the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) website or by calling this hotline: 1-800-898-7180.

Legal status that the government revoked (or will soon revoke): You are at high risk of arrest if you had temporary legal status, but the government has terminated, or ended, that status, including Temporary Protected Status (TPS). This includes people who entered the United States on parole, but that parole status has expired or the government has ended the parole program. The most common examples are people who entered through the Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan (CHNV) process, Uniting for Ukraine (U4U), and CBP One program. The government also recently announced that it is ending several family reunification parole programs on January 14, 2026 for people from Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, and Honduras.

Pending applications: ICE is arresting and detaining people even if they have submitted an application for immigration status in the United States. This means you may be at risk of arrest at an airport even if you have applied for asylum, a green card (lawful permanent residence), or other types of permanent protection. This also includes applications to change or extend your status while in the United States.

Any criminal history: If you are not a U.S. citizen and have had any criminal arrests (even if the case was dropped), immigration officers may try to arrest you.

Immigration law counts some things as “convictions” even if you were told your case was closed or your guilty plea was withdrawn. It is best to have an immigration attorney with experience in deportation cases review your file to be sure.

Green card holders: Immigration officers can still arrest green card holders if they have certain criminal convictions (even minor ones) or other risk factors. Please review our resource on this topic to assess your risk.

DACA holders and other people with Deferred Action: ICE has detained a number of people with Deferred Action for Certain Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status. Traveling through an airport can be risky, even if you have DACA or another form of Deferred Action. For the latest information on DACA, please review this Home is Here resource.

Travel Safety Tips

Know your rights at the airport.

Be ready for extra screenings or questions from TSA, Customs and Border Protection or other immigration law officers.

The ACLU has a resource that describes what may happen and explains your rights if questioned, and Just Futures Law has additional tips and suggestions.

Bring physical copies of important documents, including:

Proof of lawful status or any pending applications

Certified copies of criminal court orders, if your case was closed.

Secure your devices (phones, laptops, etc.).

If you are traveling with a cell phone or other device, take steps to make it less likely law enforcement will search that device. For example, we recommend you print your ticket so you don’t need to open your phone when you board the plane. You should also sign out of your email accounts.

You can find more detailed tips from Freedom of the Press Foundation and from Just Futures Law.

Make a safety plan – just in case.

Memorize phone numbers for a lawyer and at least one loved one who can be on-call in case you need help.

If you are arrested and detained, ICE will not share information about your case with anyone unless you have signed this specific privacy waiver form. Consider signing one or more of these forms and leaving them with a loved one in case you are detained.

Special consideration for parents:

ICE has a policy that says that parents in detention have the right to make decisions about what happens to their children. However, ICE doesn’t always follow its own policies.

One way to protect your children is to set up temporary guardianships so that a trusted adult or friend can take care of them if you are detained.

The harm is even worse when basic factual evidence, such as full videos and orders, are also hidden from the American people.

Since September, the Trump administration has ordered 26 lethal strikes on civilian boats in international waters, killing 99 people and upending countless lives. The administration continues to push unsubstantiated, fear-mongering claims about who these people were, despite investigations showing that some of those killed were fishermen just trying to make a living for their families. The administration also refuses to release the secret memo that purports to provide a legal justification for these killings, or the full, unedited videos of the strikes themselves.

The danger is not just the body count, horrific as it is. It’s the precedent: a president asserting the power to redefine civilians as “combatants,” and pretend he has the authority to grant advance immunity to federal officials for killing people. That is an egregious abuse of power with life-or-death consequences, and it will only stop if the courts, Congress, and the public make clear that this cannot continue.

Why Trump’s Boat Strikes Memo Must Be Made Public

Under both U.S. and international law, it is flagrantly illegal to use the military to kill civilians suspected only of crimes. The United States is not in an armed conflict with anyone in Latin America. That means the people on these boats are civilians. Civilians, including those suspected of smuggling drugs, are not lawful targets. Just because The Trump administration says these strikes are firmly grounded in law doesn’t make it true.

The Trump administration is relying on a secret opinion from the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) to justify these ongoing strikes. This memo reportedly details the Trump administration’s legal reasoning behind a couple of its totally incorrect conclusions: that the strikes are lawful because the United States is in an “armed conflict” with unspecified drug cartels, and that the officials who have authorized or carried out these strikes should not be prosecuted for murder or other crimes. Even as legal experts from across the political spectrum have debunked these claims, the administration has refused to release the OLC memo or any related records.

That’s why the ACLU, the Center for Constitutional Rights, and the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU) have filed a lawsuit demanding the immediate release of the OLC opinion and related documents about these boat strikes. If the Trump administration is relying on an OLC opinion to justify killing civilians in international waters, the public has a right to read it. Our lawsuit argues that the government has violated the Freedom of Information Act by refusing to release any records, despite FOIA’s clear deadlines and the urgent public interest in understanding how the administration is attempting to legally rationalize ongoing killings. We cannot be a nation of secret laws.

The devastation wrought by the Trump administration’s secret legal reasoning is not hypothetical. On September 2, after Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth reportedly gave an order to “kill everybody” on a boat in the Caribbean, according to media accounts, Admiral Frank Bradley ordered one or more additional strikes on two civilians who survived an initial strike and were ultimately killed after clinging to the boat’s wreckage for more than 40 minutes. After watching the video of this apparent “double-tap” strike, Democratic Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, said to reporters, “What I saw in that room was one of the most troubling things I’ve seen in my time in public service.” When questioned about these heinous strikes, the White House press secretary insisted that they were carried out “in accordance with the law of armed conflict,” citing the “DOJ Office of Legal Counsel opinion and other related documents.”

We’re asking a court to step in. The president doesn’t have the power to create a private, secret legal universe where cold-blooded murder of civilians can be recast as lawful policy. Courts ordering disclosure of these documents is a crucial step toward transparency, accountability, and stopping the strikes.

Congress Must Demand Transparency and Accountability Now

At the same time, we’re pushing Congress to do its job: conduct real oversight, in public. We know that when the U.S. government is implicated in horrific and criminal conduct, transparency cannot wait. For example, in 2008, after reporting revealed that the U.S. was torturing prisoners at a US-run prison in Iraq known as “Abu Ghraib,” the Senate Armed Services Committee moved within days to hold public hearings with the defense secretary and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. By contrast, more than three months after the boat strikes, Congress has not held any hearings on the killings. Everything has been behind closed doors, other than the bits of video that Hegseth wants the public to see.

We have also made clear that oversight cannot stop with the “double-tap” strike, but must probe all the illegal strikes. As the ACLU explained in a letter to the Senate Armed Services Committee, while killing shipwrecked survivors is undoubtedly unlawful and grotesque, so too are the other 24 strikes that have been carried out in our name. As a chorus of legal experts have repeatedly explained, the United States may not use lethal force against any of the civilians in these boats. Upholding the rule of law means stopping illegal killing in its entirety, not just addressing its most nightmarish moments.

Even members of Congress who support the strikes, like Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, agree that the full unedited videos should be released. Military officials have repeatedly told members that they could be released as well.

That’s why we’re calling on Congress to:

Hold immediate public hearings on President Trump’s illegal boat strikes, with testimony from Secretary Hegseth and every official who planned, authorized, or carried them out.

Force transparency by insisting that the secret OLC opinion, unedited videos of the strikes, and the underlying orders be made public.

Make clear that killing civilians is a crime, not a policy choice and that the president does not have the authority to act as judge, jury, and executioner.

Transparency can’t wait while the government murders more people. That’s why we’re asking everyone to send a message to their representatives in Congress urging them to act now. Demanding answers, insisting on public hearings, and refusing to accept secret law as a license to kill, is how we can all help stop these unlawful strikes and defend the basic principle that no one – not even the president – is above the law.",https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/12/trump-boat-strike-2-social.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 17:59:22.503791

It’s unclear if people will be criminally charged for throwing snow at agents.","ICE, meet snow. As federal agents aggressively raid and detain immigrants in cities across the US, people working to prevent these arrests are using the abundant snow on the ground to fight back.

In videos of confrontations in Minnesota and Illinois, people have thrown snowballs at federal agents who are trying to apprehend their neighbors, often as agents are using force or wielding weapons. In many instances, the agents then responded with more aggression, using pepper spray or teargas against protesters.

In Minneapolis on Monday, agents tried to arrest a woman, holding her in a snowbank, according to video of the incident posted by Minnesota Public Radio. At one point, she appears to be partially handcuffed, and an agent drags her around a snowy street. Bystanders shout at the agents to “let her go” as a chorus of car horns and whistles blare to let the neighborhood know agents are there. An agent holds a taser in one hand and points a weapon at the crowd. People start throwing snow at the agents, one of whom holds a canister of orange spray he repeatedly uses on the protesters.

One woman who joined the scene told the Associated Press that ICE agents were aggressive from the start of the interaction. “I didn’t see anybody throw any hard items,” she said. “The snowballs were definitely being thrown, but we didn’t start throwing snowballs until they started dragging her around by her wrist.”

Brian O’Hara, the Minneapolis police chief, spoke out against ICE tactics after the incident. Federal agents called local police to the scene, claiming they were under attack. He said his officers determined the scene was safe, so they “disengaged”.

“We have been training our officers for the last five years very, very intensely on de-escalation, but unfortunately that is … often not what we are seeing from other agencies in the city,” O’Hara said.

Protesters also threw snow at agents in Elgin, Illinois, during a confrontation over a man’s detention. Agents responded with teargas and pepper munitions, local media reported.

As ICE has ramped up its actions, communities have responded with rapid networks seeking to prevent immigrant arrests and deter ICE from patrols – from blowing whistles, to shouting at agents, to throwing snowballs. The American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota sued the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies this week, alleging on behalf of several Minnesota plaintiffs that agents have violated the rights of those observing and protesting ICE actions in the state.

When asked about people throwing snowballs at federal agents in Minneapolis and Chicago, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said: “ICE stays frosty … but rioters should be aware, assaulting an officer is a federal crime.”

According to reporting by CBS, agents have arrested US citizens related to the incident, with DHS saying people throwing snow and objects at agents caused injuries, “including cuts”. It’s unclear if people will be criminally charged for throwing snow at agents.

Throwing snowballs can be assault, if the person on the other end is injured or caused bodily harm, or if the intent is to injure, said Joe Tamburino, a Minneapolis criminal defense attorney. Though criminal charges over snowball-throwing are not common, if the subject is a federal agent, it can be a federal felony with steep penalties depending on the outcome, he said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41f068d61dd718dc04493b1022a75c2c7fa72ccb/34_0_1052_842/master/1052.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=43599213e09a44d0c95e1c4e4755b323",N,,2025-12-18 17:59:37.257373

Gender dysphoria refers to the distress caused by a mismatch between a person’s gender identity and their sex assigned at birth.
HHS is also taking steps to reverse a policy established during the Biden administration that classified gender dysphoria as a disability under federal law.
“Gender-affirming care is lifesaving care,” said Dr Jamila Perritt, an OB/GYN and the CEO of Physicians for Reproductive Health.
On Thursday, the House passed separate legislation introduced by Republican Dan Crenshaw that prohibits Medicaid from funding gender-affirming care for minors.","The Trump administration unveiled new actions aimed at eliminating transition-related medical care for minors across the US on Thursday, referring to such treatments as “sex-rejecting procedures”, a term used by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

As part of the effort, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will initiate a rule-making process that would prevent hospitals from offering puberty blockers, hormone treatments, or surgical procedures to minors if they wish to participate in Medicare or Medicaid.

The proposal would also prohibit Medicaid funds from being used to cover this type of care. Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (Chip) together cover nearly half of all American children.

“Under my leadership, and answering President Trump’s call to action, the federal government will do everything in its power to stop unsafe, irreversible practices that put our children at risk,” Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US health secretary, said in a statement.

“This administration will protect America’s most vulnerable. Our children deserve better – and we are delivering on that promise.”

HHS also announced that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will send warnings to 12 companies that manufacture or sell breast binders intended for minors to treat gender dysphoria. The department alleges these companies are engaging in illegal marketing practices. Gender dysphoria refers to the distress caused by a mismatch between a person’s gender identity and their sex assigned at birth.

“The American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics peddled the lie that chemical and surgical sex-rejecting procedures could be good for children who suffer from gender dysphoria,” Kennedy said at a Thursday press conference. “This is not medicine. It is malpractice.”

It was revealed on Wednesday that the Trump administration terminated several multimillion-dollar grants to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), citing concerns about “identity-based” language. The cuts followed the AAP publicly criticizing Kennedy’s overhaul of federal vaccine policy.

HHS is also taking steps to reverse a policy established during the Biden administration that classified gender dysphoria as a disability under federal law. A newly proposed update to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 would specify that “disability” and “individual with a disability” do not include gender dysphoria unless it stems from a physical impairment.

These moves have already been met with heavy criticism from health experts, lawmakers, and LGBTQ+ rights organizations.

“Gender-affirming care is lifesaving care,” said Dr Jamila Perritt, an OB/GYN and the CEO of Physicians for Reproductive Health. “Today’s proposed rules are a deliberate and targeted attack on transgender youth, their families, and the clinicians committed to providing patients the care they need … This is a lose-lose situation where lives are inevitably on the line.”

Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, the senior vice-president of public engagement campaigns at the Trevor Project, said: “Everyone in this country should have access to the care they need to stay healthy, including transgender and nonbinary young people. Personal medical decisions ought to be made between patients, their doctors and their families – not through a one-size-fits-all mandate from the federal government.”

New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, also released a statement: “This president would rather target young people than lower costs or expand access to health care. It is reprehensible that our federal government is intent on hurting and isolating the adolescents it is supposed to protect. I will use every tool at my disposal to fight this proposal and protect transgender Americans and their families.”

These proposals represent the latest in a series of actions by the Trump administration aimed at limiting access to certain forms of transgender healthcare for both children and adults.

During the opening weeks of his second term, Donald Trump signed several executive orders focused on transgender issues, including one asserting that only two sexes exist and another that barred federal funds from going to hospitals that provide transition-related care to minors.

HHS released a review in May stating that the evidence supporting the effects of gender-affirming care for minors “is very low”, a conclusion that diverges from the position of most major US medical organizations, which support access to such care and have criticized efforts to restrict it.

On Wednesday night, the House passed a bill introduced by Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican, to prohibit people under the age of 18 from receiving gender-affirming care by criminalizing providers.

Democratic congressman Mark Takano, chair of the Congressional Equality Caucus, warned the legislation could criminalize parents, calling it “the most extreme anti-transgender legislation to ever pass through the House of Representatives and a direct attack on the rights of parents to work with their children and their doctors to provide them with the medical care they need”.

On Thursday, the House passed separate legislation introduced by Republican Dan Crenshaw that prohibits Medicaid from funding gender-affirming care for minors.

Neither bill is expected to receive enough Democratic support to advance through the Senate.

“We understand that many of our neighbors may feel concerned for their safety,” Mayor Andrew Ginther said. “Please know that we stand with you and everyone who calls Columbus home.”

Ginther reassured residents that city resources will not be used to aid in federal immigration efforts. Chief Elaine Bryant said Columbus police officers are not involved in ICE operations; residents will not be investigated based solely on immigration status, but only if there’s evidence of a crime.

“We cannot prevent ICE from being here, but if there is illegal or dangerous conduct, CPD officers will be present to maintain public safety,” Bryant said.

ICE has not announced the number or nature of Thursday’s arrests.

“The federal officers operating in our city are not sharing their playbook with us,” Ginther said. “They have not informed us of where they will be, how long they will be here, or the tactics they will use.”

Both the Franklin County Sheriff’s Office and the Ohio State Highway Patrol stated that none of their officers are involved in ICE activities.

City Attorney Zach Klein said he’s aware of the reported operations in the city.

“Our officers do not inquire about immigration status when folks call for help and do not aid federal immigration operations, as has been the case under this and every other presidential administration,” Klein said in a statement.

Ginther urged residents to carry identification and immigration documentation, and to remain calm and truthful when confronted by agents. Officials also said people should not sign anything they don’t understand until they have proper legal representation.

“Do not obstruct federal operations,” Ginther said, adding that people do not have to allow immigration agents onto their private property unless those agents have a warrant from a judge.

“We know many of our immigrant families, friends and neighbors are feeling anxious and afraid,” Klein said. “You are all valued members of our city, and we’re fully committed to your safety. Know that leaders at City Hall have your back and continue to monitor the situation on the ground.”

Ginther called on community members not to share unverified information, which can create additional fear.

“Fear is real and a lot of our immigrant neighbors are scared right now, but courage is how we respond and that courage is what will define us,” Columbus City Council President Shannon Hardin said. “Right now, our neighbors will need us to be brave for them.”

Columbus City Schools officials also said parents have raised concerns, and they will be reminding all superintendents and school principals about policies regarding school access.

“While we see the Trump Administration trying to use religion as a tool to justify repression,the majority of religious Americans see welcoming and caring for those in need a core part of our values,” said Rev.","Interfaith Alliance, a leading national advocate for religious freedom and civil rights, launched a powerful new nationwide advertising campaign today that contrasts ICE’s brutality against immigrant families and communities with the holy season’s religious calling to “love thy neighbor.”

Backed by a $300,000 spend across digital, broadcast television and streaming services, the confronting 30-second ad contrasts images of ICE violence with scenes of families gathering together for Christmas and the holiday season. Set to “O Holy Night,” it shares the message: “In America, We Love One Another. Choose Love Not ICE.” The ad will target several media markets that have seen particularly intense and widespread crackdowns by federal immigration agents, including Charlotte, North Carolina and New Orleans, Louisiana.

The full ad can be viewed here. It will run on digital, broadcast television and streaming platforms nationwide through Christmas.

‍The ad campaign urges religious Americans to sign on to this message: “This holy season, ICE cruelty is threatening our religious calling to love our neighbors — in our houses of worship and in our communities. As faithful Americans, as an expression of our values, we demand that the federal government stop the attacks on our neighbors and we call on our political and religious leaders to stand in solidarity against their cruelty.”

“The holiday season reminds us that religion can be a force for compassion, solidarity and love – and that religious Americans can and must speak out about the cruelty we see against immigrants and other vulnerable communities all around us,” said Reverend Paul Brandeis Raushenbush, president and CEO of Interfaith Alliance. “As the ‘Choose Love Not ICE’ campaign makes clear, people of faith in this country have a huge role to play in supporting democratic, non-violent efforts to help immigrant families, challenge ICE, and to oppose authoritarianism in all its forms.”

Across the country, many faith leaders have put their bodies and congregations on the frontlines to resist ICE and protect immigrant families. In several churches and congregations nationwide, nativity scenes have recently depicted the Holy Family facing or hiding from ICE harassment – a striking call to recognize how today’s oppression goes against core religious beliefs and traditions.

In November, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops released a special video message recognizing the fundamental dignity and rights of immigrants. Religious leaders and groups including Interfaith Alliance have helped spearhead major faith group participation in anti-authoritarian “No Kings” protests this year. Meanwhile, DHS and ICE have sought to use religious scripture to justify ICE’s “righteous” crackdowns.

“While we see the Trump Administration trying to use religion as a tool to justify repression,the majority of religious Americans see welcoming and caring for those in need a core part of our values,” said Rev. Raushenbush. “When we see heavily armed federal agents seizing families, hurting protesters, and in some cases even invading sacred religious spaces and arresting faith leaders, we feel outraged and alarmed. That’s why people of faith have such an important role to play in defending democracy, diversity and dignity for all Americans.”

This guest post does not necessarily reflect the views or expertise of Human Rights First.

We are experiencing an era of democratic backsliding with rights long taken for granted coming under attack by authoritarian tactics at both the federal and state levels. Democratic backsliding is a slow process of consolidating authoritarian power through steady and calculated restrictions. The sanctity of a free press is a litmus test for the health of a democracy-and its repression a litmus test for the strength of authoritarian power. In the United States, we are watching an escalation of targeted attacks against journalists, media platforms, and public dissent writ large. The Trump Administration’s rapid concentration of executive power and far-reaching repressive policies are clear examples of democratic backsliding.

The United States has a complex history with dissent — particularly during moments of political and social upheaval. From the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s to the Vietnam War protests that followed, and more recently the Black Lives Matter demonstrations, authorities have repeatedly responded to times of political unrest with violence, surveillance, and suppression. While the tactics directed against journalists and dissenters are not new, what we are witnessing today is an escalation of the democratic failures of the past. In 2024 alone, at least 48 journalists were arrested or detained in the United States while reporting on protests related to the Israel-Gaza conflict, and yet this is not the first time our democratic values have been tested in this way. Today’s wave of repression marks a troubling evolution, one in which the tools of immigration enforcement and national security are increasingly intertwined with domestic policing to silence both citizens and non-citizens alike.

A recent indicator of democratic erosion in the United States began on April 17, 2024, when protesters at Columbia University gained national attention for their solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. During these demonstrations, journalists covering the events at times faced intimidation, arrests, and aggressive crowd-control tactics – signaling a troubling shift in how this administration and its supporters would deal with those they viewed as political threats. These campus demonstrations were an early warning of how easily dissent can be reframed as disloyalty—a pattern now visible across the country.

The most widespread attacks on free speech are being interwoven with repressive immigration policies, including those targeting foreign journalists. In September the Department of Homeland Security proposed new regulations that would significantly alter the process for journalists to stay and work in the United States. Under the current “duration of status” system, these visa-holders may remain in the country as long as they comply with the terms of their visa. The proposed rule would replace that flexibility with fixed admission periods that limit journalists to 240 days, without explicit or consistent extension criteria. More troubling still, the rule grants immigration officials broad discretion to deny extensions based on political beliefs or affiliations, effectively allowing ideology to dictate who can report within the United States. By transforming visa status from a legal pathway into a precarious privilege, this proposal poses a direct threat to press independence, and the free exchange of ideas.

These visa changes could be used to quash dissenting voices, a critical attack on our democratic norms, using punitive approaches to suppress political dissent by framing journalists as national threats. British journalist Sami Hamdi, an outspoken critic of Israel, was detained by ICE officers, and shortly afterward, his visa was revoked in October. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson defended the action, stating, “The United States has no obligation to host foreigners who support terrorism and actively undermine the safety of Americans.” Hamdi’s detention sends a chilling message: criticism of the U.S. or Israel’s policies could be met with immediate consequences.

Recent actions by this administration are collapsing the distinction between legitimate governance and coercive control, allowing state actors to frame suppression as security and censorship as stability. Some news outlets, like 60 Minutes, have borne the brunt of the Trump administration’s hostility and attacks. Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS’s “60 Minutes,” agreed to a $16 million settlement, rather than fighting a lawsuit brought by Trump against 60 Minutes for broadcasting an edited interview with presidential candidate Kamala Harris.

The administration’s retaliation has extended even to one of the most widely respected news organizations in the world. In February 2025, the Associated Press was outlawed by the White House press pool after publishing reports that contradicted the Trump administration’s public narrative. In response, the Associated Press sought reinstatement through federal courts, a measure that illustrates how far the administration was willing and is willing to go to control who may have access to the White House and what information reaches the mainstream public. Banning a major wire service from the press pool signifies that independent reporting is not just discouraged but actively punished, representing a dangerous escalation. Similarly, on October 15th the Department of Defense issued an ultimatum for Pentagon press, requiring journalists to sign a “pledge” to not gather nor publish any unapproved information, even if it is unclassified. This change resulted in a mass exodus and the New York Times bringing a lawsuit against the Pentagon. This is yet another example of this administration’s blatant attempt to control the flow of information and stifle a free press, a subjugation tactic long embraced by dictators around the world.

The administration’s hostility toward media critics has not been confined to traditional news outlets. On September 11th, host Jimmy Kimmel became a target after criticizing President Trump’s response to political activist Charlie Kirk’s death, stating, “With all these terrible things happening, you would think that our president would at least make an attempt to bring us together, but he didn’t, President Obama did. President Biden did. Presidents Bush and Clinton did. President Trump did not. Instead, he blamed Democrats for their rhetoric.” In response, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Brendan Carr threatened ABC’s affiliate broadcast licenses if they did not “take action.” Soon after on September 15th he was swiftly suspended with ABC news stating he was removed due to his comments — an action reversed soon after in part due to mass public outcry. Kimmel’s suspension underscored how quickly criticism can be met with punitive consequences, reinforcing a climate in which dissenting voices are disciplined rather than debated.

Piece by piece, our quintessential democratic rights are being threatened. Our ability to speak freely, express dissent, and hold power to account without fear of retaliation continues to face challenges. This erosion of rights isn’t abstract — it’s already unfolding in real time. From visa retaliation to the silencing of journalists, these are an emerging pattern that illustrates a democratic crisis on the horizon. Freedom of speech and freedom of the press are bastions of a healthy democracy. Yet, with every arrest, every silenced voice, and every controlled headline, those freedoms are slipping away. History has shown us what happens when truth is seen as the enemy of those in power. This fight is not just for advocates and journalists; it’s for everyone’s right to speak, to question, and to exist without fear. As Americans, we are taught to believe in truth and transparency, and we must refuse to yield because defending free expression is not optional.",https://humanrightsfirst.org/wp-content/themes/launchframe/assets/images/open_graph.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 16:58:23.083805

“In May, the Supreme Court clarified that NEPA is a purely procedural statute after decades of frivolous NGO litigation and judicial activism. While other nations are building out modern infrastructure, increasing energy generation, and pushing to win the AI race, America is stuck in the 20th century. The modernization of NEPA through the SPEED Act adheres to the purely procedural nature of NEPA, requires project specific focus, and provides reasonable judicial review that will provide the certainty needed for a functioning U.S. permitting system.

Background:

NEPA is a procedural statute that established parameters for assessing and disclosing the environmental impact of all major federal actions. However, decades of environmental activism from NGOs and courts morphed our national permitting system to either prevent projects entirely, or to add years and millions of dollars in costs before their completion. The Supreme Court’s decision in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, CO reaffirmed the procedural nature of the law and corrected decades of its misapplication.

The SPEED Act builds off this judicial relief to modernize NEPA by:

Explicitly stating that NEPA is a procedural statute which does not mandate specific outcomes

Refocuses the scope of review for environmental analysis only on effects that are proximately caused by the project itself and may not include effects that are speculative or separate in place and time

Clarifies the major federal action definition to reduce the number of projects requiring NEPA review

Balances the need for a swift, efficient permitting system with early, meaningful consultation with state, local, and tribal partners

Implements much needed judicial review reforms to limit frivolous litigation, such as:

Clarifies that courts may not substitute their judgement on environmental effects for that of the agencies

Removes the ability of courts to vacate or enjoin agency NEPA action

Shrinks the statute of limitation to file a lawsuit under NEPA from 6 years to 150 days and clarifies who has standing to challenge an agency action

In a video posted Thursday morning, Mayor Andrew Ginther and Police Chief Elaine Bryant emphasized that local resources will not be used to support deportation efforts based solely on immigration status.

""Please know that we stand with you and everyone who calls Columbus home,"" Ginther said.

Mayor Ginther and Police Chief Bryant will be holding a press conference at 2 p.m. on Thursday. We will live-stream the event on this page.

Since 2017, the city has maintained a policy that prohibits the use of Columbus resources, including police officers, to assist federal deportation efforts or immigration investigations that are based only on a person’s immigration status.

""Columbus police officers will not investigate Columbus residents solely based on immigration status,"" Bryant said. Columbus police action will occur only when there is evidence that a crime has been committed.

They also acknowledged that they cannot prevent ICE agents from operating in Columbus. However, police officers will be present to maintain public safety if any illegal or dangerous conduct occurs.

Officials encouraged residents to continue calling 911 or Columbus police when they need help, stressing that public safety services remain available to everyone in the city.

They also urged residents to understand their rights during encounters with federal immigration agents, advising people to carry identification or documentation of their status, remain calm and truthful when interacting with law enforcement, and remember they have the right to remain silent. They also warn residents to ""not obstruct federal operations.""

Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein posted this comment on our ABC 6 Facebook Page on Thursday afternoon:

I am aware of reports that federal law enforcement officials, including ICE, are currently engaged in active operations in Columbus. I know this causes alarm and concern. Please know that the Columbus Division of Police is not involved in these sorts of immigration enforcement activities. CPD’s role is public safety, not immigration enforcement. Our officers do not inquire about immigration status when folks call for help and do not aid federal immigration operations, as has been the case under this and every other presidential administration.

If anyone witnesses concerning activity, do not intervene directly or put yourself at risk. If the action is criminal in nature, always trust that you can call Columbus Police. They will respond. Additionally, sharing accurate information and looking out for one another is one of the most powerful ways our community can respond.

Lastly, we know many of our immigrant families, friends and neighbors are feeling anxious and afraid. You are all valued members of our city, and we’re fully committed to your safety. Know that leaders at City Hall have your back and continue to monitor the situation on the ground. - Zach Klein",https://abc6onyourside.com/resources/media2/16x9/2573/1320/0x1/90/6f92eedf-a0d5-48eb-81ff-a86ab12687f7-processed054DA4ECE7B0437FA88050EA91E5E4EA.jpeg,N,,2025-12-18 17:59:59.371392

Nearly 300,000 people have been deported, and a record 65,000 people are being held in detention centers. Aggressive raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents, sometimes with the backing of federalized national guard units, have terrorized immigrant communities from Charlotte to Chicago, New Orleans to New York. Enabled by a supreme court ruling that “effectively legalized racial profiling”, immigration enforcement has separated families, forced targeted individuals to miss work, school and doctors appointments, and caused communities to cancel festivals and gatherings.

Despite the best efforts of the Trump administration to suppress dissent, however, Americans have responded to the aggressive assault on immigrant communities with defiance. In cities and communities across the US, residents disgusted by Trump’s attack on their neighbors are banding together in group chats on Signal, an encrypted messaging app, to coordinate community defense. The Guardian spoke with several activists – some seasoned, some brand new – about what they are doing to help.

The real-estate appraiser chasing ICE agents on bicycle

Jose was working from home on the North Side of Chicago on 9 October when he got the message on Signal: “They’re here.”

The Trump administration had launched “Operation Midway Blitz” in early September, sending hundreds of federal agents to Chicago to crack down on supposedly criminal immigrants and intimidate a largely Democratic-voting population; now they had been spotted in Rogers Park, the neighborhood where Jose had lived his entire life, harassing a well-known tamale vendor. (Jose, like many of the activists interviewed in this piece, asked to be identified by a pseudonym out of fear of being targeted by the government.)

Jose jumped on his bike and rode to the intersection in question, where he spoke to bystanders and workers in a nearby restaurant to find out what had happened. When he and a fellow responder spotted a Jeep that matched the description witnesses had given them, they chased it, catching up at a stop light. Jose pulled in front of the SUV and attempted to impede its way. The driver – possibly an ICE or CBP agent – started yelling and threatening arrest; at the urging of another activist, he decided to let the car go. Three days later, when ICE returned to the neighborhood, Jose and his fellow rapid responders had all begun wearing whistles. They followed the agents’ vehicles through the streets on their bikes, blowing their whistles to alert their neighbors to the raid.

A 49-year-old father who in the past dedicated his free time to performing in Gilbert and Sullivan productions with a local community theater, Jose had no experience in community organizing when he volunteered to join the core team of Protect Rogers Park, a group that had organized resistance activities during the first Trump administration.

“My job is real-estate appraiser of all things,” he told the Guardian. “I mean, what a double life.”

Over the spring and summer, he pitched in as the group organized neighborhood assemblies and trainings to prepare for ICE raids or direct actions. “This might seem cliche but the trainings do work,” he said. “We try to simulate what it’s like when ICE agents are in your face and yelling at you and grabbing. It’s like rehearsal, so you don’t have as much stage fright.” There was also a social component; the group set up a book club and everyone read Timothy Snyder’s On Tyranny together. “It’s community building,” he said. “It’s getting to know the people you’re going to be with when the time comes to go up against ICE. Now, obviously, we’re in it.”

When Operation Midway Blitz began, Jose volunteered to do “rapid response”, but he wants others to know that confrontation is not the only way to help. “You don’t have to go chase after ICE agents,” he said. “If you can be a person behind the computer screen directing people or checking license plate numbers – that’s so helpful. Even just standing on a corner with a whistle around your neck provides incredible peace of mind to vulnerable people.”

For those who are up for chasing ICE around: “We have a few goals,” he said. “The first is you want to get more help if you’re alone. The next is you want to try to help the victim as much as possible. The last thing is slowing them down. I’m not going to be able to go up against armed ICE agents with just my bike, so I’ll just stop traffic. We want to make it so it’s just not worth their while.”

“We’re going to outlast them,” he added. “They can’t sustain this forever.”

The fetish shop owner distributing whistles

The mannequins in the windows of Red Vault in Chicago’s Rogers Park neighborhood tend to wear a selection of the shop’s fashion and fetish wares, from adult onesies to mesh tank tops and leather harnesses. Starting in October, however, store owner Mark Selner added a new accessory to the display: a cheap plastic whistle worn around the neck.

“I’ve been really angry because I was bullied when I was young, and these are bullies,” said Selner, 59, of the ICE and CBP agents who have flooded Chicago during Operation Midway Blitz. “I’m working in the store all the time so I can’t necessarily attend [protests], so what can I do? I saw people handing out whistles and I was like, let me use some of my white privilege for good.”

Sellner ordered a batch of whistles and put up a notice outside the shop that he was giving them away for free. He also posted a sign warning ICE and CBP agents that they cannot enter his business without a judicial warrant, and, on the advice of community organizers, posted a sign on his backroom that says: “Private Area, Authorized Employees Only”. Within a few weeks, he had distributed almost 400 whistles.

“I don’t want any of my customer base to be afraid to be in here,” he said. “I have the sign on the backroom so that, if need be, someone can go back there and [ICE] is not supposed to go back there legally.”

Customers have been supportive and appreciative, Sellner said.

“I had a customer ask me: ‘How much did you pay for the whistles?’ I said it was $22 and he goes: ‘Here’s $22.’ I said: ‘You don’t have to do that,’ but he was like, ‘No I want to. I’m glad you’re doing this.’

“So I used that to buy more whistles.”

The student delivering groceries to families

When the Trump administration launched a series of aggressive immigration raids in Los Angeles in June, Miguel Montes quickly saw the impact on Boyle Heights, the heavily Latino neighborhood where he was born and raised. Montes is in his final year of studies for a degree in public health, and he also works full-time as a certified medical assistant at a public hospital.

“I noticed that people were not showing up to their appointments at my job,” he said. “People were not even going out to get food, because they were scared.”

Montes’s passion for providing public health resources to his community had seen him set up an organization, Raíces Con Voz, that ran educational events about hypertension, diabetes and the health effects of climate change in his community. Now, the needs were much more immediate. With a small group of close friends, Montes spread the word that he was organizing grocery delivery for families scared of being detained by ICE. The group circulated an online signup form for families in need of support and solicited donations of goods and cash.

Since June, Montes and his group have delivered groceries to about 1,500 families. They are hoping to expand their reach to the Inland Empire; they also want to figure out a way to connect more people with mental health resources. It’s a personal issue for Montes, whose mother was undocumented until recently. As a child, he had not realized how difficult her lack of legal status made things for her.

“Being a first generation Latino, I don’t know anybody who started their own non-profit,” Montes said. “Everything that I’ve done has been trial and error.”

The parents making sure everyone gets to school safe

When the Trump administration deployed the national guard and amped up immigration enforcement in and around Washington DC this summer, some parents at a predominantly Latino elementary school in Montgomery county, Maryland, proposed setting up “walking school buses” to accompany children to school. The only problem: not everyone wanted them to.

“The community was like, ‘Nah, we don’t need the white folks walking us to school,” recalled Sarah Hunter, 47. “There were folks saying this is necessary, and folks saying ‘I don’t want you here.’ Sometimes you just have to stand in the fray and be willing to mess up.”

Hunter and her co-parent, Jane Palmer, worked with fellow parents, organizers with the Montgomery County Immigrant Rights Collective and school administration figures to come up with a plan for something that would be actually helpful. The compromise plan they hit upon may still be unwanted for some, but they decided that having to work through any conflict was worth it. “That’s not the worst outcome,” Hunter said. “The worst outcome is that we’re not there and people are getting kidnapped.”

They now have a network of about 30 volunteers who are stationed at set locations around the school for a half hour each morning and afternoon during student arrival and dismissal. The volunteers initially identified themselves with a button, but after a parent had 1,000 made, the button spread to the entire school community.

The parent organizers are in touch with other groups that are organizing ICE watch and rapid response in the area, but their volunteers are focused exclusively on the school. “Whenever ICE has been in our school area, we’ve learned about it on Signal before we saw anything visually,” Palmer said.

“We’re really not trying to do surveillance,” Hunter said. “We are greeting families in our community and getting to know each other, saying ‘good morning’, developing friendships.”

“If this does nothing but build community across these populations, then we’ve succeeded,” said Palmer. On Halloween, she wore an inflatable costume of the school’s mascot during her shift outside the school and handed out stickers with the same design as the buttons.

“It was like I was Lady Gaga or something,” Palmer said. “Everyone was talking pictures with me. Some lady handed me her baby to take a picture with … It’s about ICE watch but it’s also about how we build community.”

The undocumented social worker putting money in commissary accounts

A chilling scene keeps playing out in the halls of Manhattan’s federal office buildings. Asylum seekers attend hearings before immigration judges, receive a future hearing date, and go to leave, only to be surrounded by a crowd of masked ICE agents who arrest them and whisk them away to the bank of elevators.

The detention trap at New York’s immigration courts has attracted a cadre of dedicated court watch volunteers who bear witness to the daily abductions. Their efforts gained national attention in June, when city comptroller and then mayoral candidate Brad Lander was arrested as he attempted to accompany an asylum seeker from his hearing to the subway.

As Lander’s arrest showed, there is nothing the court watchers can do to prevent these detentions. Instead, they do their best to get individuals to fill out a form with their name, A-number and emergency contact. Those forms are then passed on to Mi Tlalli, a volunteer collective whose mission is both simple and expansive. “We provide ongoing care,” said Maria, a member of the collective.

What that care looks like depends on what people need, Maria said. The group has been in contact with 3,000 people and families since May, and has provided direct support to 300 detainees. For those who are being held in ICE detention centers, Mi Tlalli puts $50 in their commissary account weekly. A collective of mental health care providers meets with affected children and family members; the group also has a weekly mutual aid distribution for basic necessities.

“We maintain contact with people who have been deported,” Maria said. “It’s not like we can build them a house, but we can send some money for clothing, and give them some hope that someone cares.”

The knowledge that immigrants are cared for is crucial to Maria, who is a social worker in mental health. She recalled a recent case where an individual was detained on a Friday in New York and sent to a detention facility in Louisiana that Sunday. Mi Tlalli spoke to the individual’s family and contacted an activist group in Louisiana, which arranged to have someone visit the immigrant before they were deported.

“That was the last caring interaction that this person had,” Maria said. “That’s better than going to your court appearance and being put on a plane in chains without ever knowing that someone cared about you.”

“Right now, every undocumented person is at risk,” said Maria, who is undocumented herself. “We may not be able to save everyone, but is that going to keep us from helping anyone? As a person who has had relatives kidnapped, and is at risk of being kidnapped myself, I have to hold on to the idea that there is a way we can organize not just being resilient, not just saying ‘deal with it,’ but coming together to care for each other.”

“Without clarity on how long this broad pause will last, soon-to-be citizens will be left in limbo for perpetuity, and families will be forced to remain separated,” wrote the Members. “What is clear is that no amount of vetting, moral character, or commitment to this country and its democratic values is enough to satiate the Trump Administration.”

Based solely on immigrants’ country of origin, Trump’s USCIS is both pausing and canceling green card interviews, applications, naturalization interviews, and even oath ceremonies for immigrants who have completed rigorous vetting and have secured citizenship. These are people who have followed every process and undergone extensive and repeated vetting to secure legal status.

“These naturalization ceremonies are a time of celebration, as soon-to-be U.S. citizens welcome their friends and family to witness their achievement of becoming a U.S. citizen. To deny this monumental achievement to those who have waited years, if not decades, to pledge the Oath of Allegiance.

,Policy,2025-12-18 19:43:49+00:00,Center on Budget and Policy Priorities,"Trump Administration, Congressional Republicans Are Worsening Affordability Challenges ...","Brendan Duke, Katie Bergh, Dottie Rosenbaum, Jennifer Sullivan, Nicole Rapfogel, Sonya Acosta",,,,,https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/trump-administration-congressional-republicans-are-worsening,"The Trump Administration and House Republicans are pursuing deep cuts to federal rental assistance in annual appropriations bills.
The Trump Administration and congressional Republicans have also taken steps that will make it harder for families with low incomes to buy groceries.
Earlier this year, Republican policymakers took active steps to make health care less affordable to families with low incomes.
The RAP will also ensnare new borrowers with persistently low incomes into longer repayment periods.
These statistics are averages and obscure some of the specific affordability challenges certain families with low and moderate incomes face.","In a nation as wealthy as ours, everyone should be able to afford to meet their basic needs – they should be able to buy enough food to feed their families, have a safe and affordable place to live, and go to the doctor and buy medication if they’re sick. Indeed, President Trump won the 2024 election with a promise to address people’s costs and make life more affordable.

But a look at the Trump Administration’s policy choices and priorities demonstrate that the Administration and congressional Republicans have taken action after action that has or will raise the cost of:

Groceries. Trump has imposed sweeping tariffs on imported food that are raising grocery prices, while enacting the largest cuts to SNAP in history through a deeply harmful Republican megabill that will make affording groceries harder for families with low incomes.

Health care. The megabill’s large cuts to Medicaid and to Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace coverage will make it harder for families to afford the medical care they need. Moreover, the President and congressional Republicans have refused to renew the premium tax credit enhancements that help millions of people afford health care coverage. Together, these policy decisions will result in an estimated 15 million people losing health coverage, many of whom won’t be able to afford care they need.

Housing. The Trump Administration and House Republicans are pursuing deep cuts to federal rental assistance in annual appropriations bills. If enacted, these cuts will cause hundreds of thousands of people to lose support they use to help keep a roof over their heads. Moreover, sweeping tariffs on home construction inputs will add $30 billion to the annual cost of residential investment, reducing housing supply and affordability for renters as well as prospective home buyers.

Education. The Republican megabill makes it harder for new student loan borrowers to repay their debt while ensnaring them in longer maximum repayment periods, especially if they have low incomes. For the first time, new borrowers with the lowest incomes — many of them in poverty and many of whom did not complete a degree program — will have to make payments before they can afford it. And both the Trump Administration and House Republican budget proposals would make college less affordable — and encourage debt accumulation — through cuts to federal work study and the elimination of programs providing financial aid to students with low income and child care to parents attending college.

Energy. The megabill cuts more than $300 billion from energy investments, which will raise energy costs for households and businesses at a time when energy demand is projected to grow. One study estimates that households will face a 13 percent increase ($280 per year) in their energy bills by 2035 as a result of these cuts. Moreover, President Trump has proposed eliminating the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which provides assistance to 6 million low-income households to help them pay their energy bills and prevent utility shutoffs.

People with low and moderate incomes especially will grapple with the costs of these harmful policy choices. Fully 25 percent of households in the bottom of half of the income distribution report experiencing food insecurity or not being able to pay their rent, mortgage, or utility bill compared to 8 percent of households in the top half. (See Figure 1.)

Households with incomes in the bottom half of the distribution (less than $70,000 in 2023) spend almost 90 percent of their incomes on basic items: utilities, groceries, health care, transportation, and shelter. And to help afford those basics, many need assistance, such as Medicaid, SNAP, or LIHEAP, that the Administration has put on the chopping block. Moreover, families affected by cuts in these areas receive the fewest benefits, if any at all, from the megabill’s tax cuts. That includes the bill’s Child Tax Credit expansion, which gave short shrift to 19 million children in families with low and moderate incomes.

Policy efforts to reverse course and actually improve affordability should focus on people with low and moderate incomes, who already struggle the most to afford the basics and have suffered the most from the Trump Administration’s harmful policies. This effort would start with repealing or abandoning the anti-affordability policies the Administration has pursued, and also using tried and true tools — such as extending the enhanced ACA tax credits, expanding rental assistance, and making the full Child Tax Credit available to children in families with lower incomes.

Groceries

One of the most striking challenges families with low and moderate incomes face is the rising cost of groceries, whose prices have grown faster since January 2020 (29.3 percent) than overall prices (25.4 percent). The rising price of food is especially challenging for households with incomes in the bottom half of the income distribution since groceries are a necessity that makes up such a large portion of their incomes (13 percent). For households in the top half, the figure is much lower (about 5 percent).

The Trump Administration imposed sweeping, across-the-board tariffs upon taking office, raising food prices. The tariffs as they stood in October were estimated to raise the short-run price of vegetables and fruits by 3.3 percent and food as a whole by 1.9 percent above pre-tariff levels according to the Budget Lab at Yale. The Trump Administration has frequently justified its tariffs as encouraging people to replace foreign goods with domestically produced ones, but many of its tariffs applied to food products that the U.S. does not have the climate to produce at mass scale, like bananas and coffee. The Trump Administration moved this fall to exempt these products, but tariffs are still expected to raise food prices by 1.2 percent in the short run.

The Trump Administration and congressional Republicans have also taken steps that will make it harder for families with low incomes to buy groceries. The harmful megabill cut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by $187 billion through 2034 (about 20 percent), the largest cut in history. This program helps more than 40 million people with low incomes afford groceries each month, and some of the bill’s cuts have already gone into effect. The megabill used these cuts to cover about 4 percent of the cost of its tax cuts, whose benefits are heavily tilted to people with high incomes.

The megabill’s SNAP cuts come from a combination of slashing billions in federal funding for states’ SNAP programs, thereby forcing unaffordable and volatile costs onto states, and by cutting millions of people off from SNAP by increasing administrative hurdles and red tape. Most states will be required to newly pay 5 to 15 percent of food benefits, in addition to paying a greater share (75 percent, up from 50 percent) of SNAP’s administrative costs. If a state can’t make up for these massive federal cuts with tax increases or spending cuts elsewhere in its budget, it will have to cut its SNAP program or potentially opt out of the program altogether, terminating food assistance in the state.

The megabill also expanded already harsh and ineffective measures taking away SNAP for not meeting red tape-laden work requirements, which the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates will cut 2.4 million people off SNAP in a typical month. It also makes cuts that undermine the adequacy of SNAP benefits to help people afford groceries. Over time, the megabill will cut food assistance benefits for all 40 million participants, including 1 out every 5 children in the U.S.,by restricting future updates to the Thrifty Food Plan, the basis for SNAP benefit levels. This will lead to SNAP benefits becoming increasingly inadequate to afford a healthy diet. Other cuts in the law include a provision that makes it harder to qualify for SNAP’s Standard Utility Allowance, resulting in an estimated 600,000 households losing roughly $100 per month in food assistance. Additionally, many immigrants living lawfully in the U.S. and who have been granted humanitarian protections will now be denied SNAP benefits.

Health Care

Health care costs remain one of the biggest burdens for families with incomes in the bottom half of the income distribution, who spend an average of about 13 percent of their incomes on it. But this average obscures the fact that health care burdens are distributed unequally. Seniors have access to Medicare (but may struggle with other affordability issues), while other adults face a varying landscape depending on whether their state has expanded Medicaid — and on whether congressional Republicans agree to extend premium tax credit (PTC) enhancements that are helping millions afford coverage. Moreover, a medical emergency or sudden illness can cause someone to suddenly begin spending a large share of their income on medical care or incurring medical debt when those costs aren’t affordable.

The PTC enhancements that help marketplace enrollees afford coverage expire at the end of 2025, but the Administration and a majority of congressional Republicans thus far remain implacably opposed to renewing them. Congress’ failure to extend PTC enhancements will leave millions vulnerable to extreme premium increases — over $1,000 annually for the average enrollee receiving the credits, and many times that for some people — and at heightened risk of becoming uninsured. (See Figure 2.) And these increases come on top of other cuts to ACA marketplace coverage in the megabill that will cause more people to become uninsured.

Earlier this year, Republican policymakers took active steps to make health care less affordable to families with low incomes. Their megabill cut Medicaid — the country’s second largest health care program, covering about 70 million people — by more than $900 billion (17 percent by 2034) to partially finance the bill’s tax cuts. One of the principal methods it uses to achieve these cuts is creating several new layers of red tape designed to remove people from coverage. That includes red tape-laden work requirements that research shows take coverage away from people who have been laid off, those who are working, and those who should be exempt. Coverage losses are often due to paperwork burdens that result in people who are still eligible losing coverage. The megabill also put in place new requirements that Medicaid expansion enrollees renew coverage every six months instead of once a year — another set of red tape that will result in coverage loss — and measures blocking eligibility and enrollment rules that would simplify enrollment.

The megabill also directly raises Medicaid expansion enrollees’ out-of-pocket health care costs. It requires states to charge those with incomes just above the poverty line ($16,000 a year for an individual) new cost-sharing charges for many services when they go to the doctor.

Housing

One of the nation’s most persistent affordability challenges is housing. Housing costs have gone up across the board for people purchasing homes, as home prices and interest rates have risen. And millions of renters face serious affordability challenges. Some 42 million people in low-income renter households pay more than 30 percent of their income on housing, a widely used benchmark for affordability, and fully 24 million in low-income renter households pay more than half of their income for housing.

Federal rental assistance is key to addressing the affordability challenges that renters face, along with efforts to boost the supply of housing in areas with shortages. Rental assistance helps roughly 10 million people — such as struggling seniors, people with disabilities, veterans, and families with children — keep a roof over their heads, often by helping them afford rental units they find in the private market. But this assistance, unlike Social Security or Medicaid, is part of the annual appropriations process so it hangs in the balance with each budget season.

And as with other affordability challenges, many Republican policymakers are calling for policies that would exacerbate the problem. House Republicans’ transportation and housing appropriations bill provides far less funding than is needed to cover the cost of existing Housing Choice Vouchers, with the result that about 411,000 fewer people would receive assistance. These vouchers are the most widely used and effective tool to address homelessness and housing instability (see Figure 3), but only about a quarter of those who are eligible for vouchers or other rental assistance receive it due to limited funding. The House bill would make this worse. It would also cut funding for public housing by nearly $1.5 billion (about 17 percent), hampering the maintenance and repairs needed to protect residents’ health and safety. (The Senate bill is better, but still problematic — for example, its funding level for Housing Choice Vouchers is higher than the House but would still result in 243,000 fewer households receiving rental assistance than in 2025.)

President Trump’s budget proposals for rental assistance are even more harmful: the budget plan would replace existing rental assistance programs, including public housing and housing vouchers, with a new state-based formula grant that would receive 43 percent less funding, even as the cost of housing and the number of families struggling to afford rent has risen in recent years. It would also cut off rental assistance after two years even if participants still can’t afford rent on their own, putting over 3 million people at risk of eviction and homelessness. In addition, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) intends to make administrative changes to homelessness programs that would take away assistance that more than 170,000 formerly homeless people use to help them afford housing, unless Congress acts to prevent this.

The Administration’s sweeping tariffs, meanwhile, are increasing the cost of housing construction and home furnishings, raising the cost of renting or buying a home. Those tariffs include one of 10 percent on softwood timber and lumber, 25 percent on upholstered wooden products, and 25 percent on kitchen cabinets and vanities, in addition to its broader country-by-country tariffs on Mexico, Canada, China, and other trade partners key to this sector.

The combined effect of these tariffs is $30 billion in added annual costs to investment in residential structures, including new construction, renovations, and affordable housing development, according to the Tax Policy Center (TPC). Moreover, the prices of major appliances — a critical input for housing construction — have gone up more than twice as fast as overall inflation, according to TPC.

Education

The megabill also restructures student loan repayment plans in a manner that will increase millions of new borrowers’ monthly payments, to the tune of $270 billion which, again, the bill is using in service of its skewed tax cuts. In particular, the megabill consolidates all income-based repayment plans for new borrowers — which help keep payments manageable for borrowers with lower incomes relative to their debt levels — into a single Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP) that requires far higher monthly payments than other income-based repayment plans.

Most concerningly, the RAP abandons the “income protection” approach that all other income-based repayment plans feature. Under the RAP, the lowest-income new borrowers — including those with incomes under the poverty line — will for the first time have to make payments well before they are in a position to afford it. This directly undermines the point of income-based repayment, which is to ensure that monthly payments are affordable by scaling them to income.

The RAP will also ensnare new borrowers with persistently low incomes into longer repayment periods. All previous income-based repayment plans set a maximum repayment term of 10-25 years — if someone makes the monthly payments for that entire period and there is still debt, it gets forgiven. The megabill extends that maximum period to 30 years. New borrowers who will be trapped in repayment for this long are those whose incomes remain low for decades. In many cases, those who will have to continue paying for 30 years are people who were not able to complete their degrees or who went to low-quality for-profit colleges.

The Trump Administration and House Republican budgets have also doubled down on cuts to getting a college education that would put further strain on students from families with low and moderate incomes. For example, both would cut federal work study programs that provide part-time employment to students who need help affording education, increasing these students’ reliance on debt. Similarly, both would eliminate federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, which provide financial aid to low-income students, as well as the Child Care Access Means Parents in School program, which provides child care to parents with low incomes while they are in post-secondary school.

Energy

Household utility bills — including energy — are another large expense for families with incomes in the bottom half of the income distribution, making up 11 percent of their incomes in 2023. The pressures on families’ budgets from utility bills and energy costs may well grow further in part because of policy choices the Administration and congressional majority have made. Household fuel and utility prices have risen 5.9 percent over the last year. And they are expected to continue to rise in the face of increasing construction costs for building energy projects, due to production bottlenecks and tariffs; growing energy demand primarily from data centers; and increased natural gas exports. The Republican megabill dismantled key policies that would have mitigated the price shocks to household budgets. It made over $300 billion in cuts to clean energy tax credits and rescinded close to $8 billion in funding for grants and loans for clean energy, energy waste reduction, improvements to the electric grid, and energy upgrades in affordable housing enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. These cuts drive up energy bills and by making it more expensive to install the lowest-cost forms of energy — solar and wind — and to upgrade the electric grid, and by making it harder for households to use less energy. One study estimates that, as a result of the tax credit cuts alone, cumulative capital investment in U.S. electricity and clean fuels production will fall $500 billion over the decade. And households will face a 7.5 percent increase in household energy bills by 2030, or $165 per year, rising to a 13 percent increase, or $280 per year, in 2035.

In addition to the megabill’s cuts, the Trump Administration has terminated billions of dollars in climate and energy funding contracts that would have contributed to decreasing energy costs, most notably $7 billion that would have gone toward bringing low-cost solar energy to low-income households. Meanwhile the Administration is promoting continued operation of uneconomical coal plants.

Beyond this reduction in energy investment that will drive up costs, President Trump is also pursuing budget cuts that directly reduce low-income households’ ability to afford to heat and cool their homes. The President’s budget would eliminate LIHEAP, which provides heating and cooling assistance to 6 million households with low incomes, to help prevent utility shutoffs.

Affordability Struggles Should Be Eased for Families With Low and Moderate Incomes, Not Exacerbated

An important theme in the Trump Administration and House Republicans’ policies is just how much they are stacking the deck against families already facing affordability challenges. While some policies, like the tariffs and repealing energy investments, affect families throughout the income distribution, cuts to Medicaid, SNAP, LIHEAP, and Housing Choice Vouchers largely, if not exclusively, hurt low-income families’ purchasing power.

It is this precise group for whom affordability was already the biggest challenge before Trump took office. Families with incomes in the bottom half of the income distribution (making less than $70,000) spend a large share of their income on the basics: $3,700 on utilities (12 percent of income), $4,500 on groceries (13 percent of income), $4,500 on health care (13 percent of income), $7,400 on transportation (21 percent of income), and $10,600 on shelter (30 percent of income) in 2023. Those categories combined accounted for 89 percent of their income and do not include other essentials, such as clothes or household items like diapers, paper towels, and cleaning supplies. Families with incomes in the top half of the income distribution, on the other hand, spend only 43 percent of their income on utilities, groceries, health care, transportation, and shelter.

These statistics are averages and obscure some of the specific affordability challenges certain families with low and moderate incomes face. For example, child care is a small expense for families as a whole since many people do not have young children, but families close to the poverty line who use child care in a given week spend 17 percent of their income on it.

Another way to see how families with low incomes struggle with affordability is to look at how much more likely they are to report being unable to pay their rent, mortgage, or utility bill, or to report food insecurity. Fully 25 percent of households in the bottom of half of the income distribution report not being able to pay one of those housing bills and/or food insecurity, while 8 percent of households in the top half do.

Any serious affordability agenda must start with improving the finances of families with low and moderate incomes. This agenda should, of course, begin with repealing the Trump Administration and congressional Republicans’ harmful policies, like cuts in health coverage and food assistance as well as broad-based tariffs. More broadly, it should make use of the proven policy tools for reducing these families’ costs in the areas where they spend the most, such as extending the enhanced ACA tax credits to address health care costs, ensuring that all states adopt the ACA’s Medicaid expansion, and expanding rental assistance to keep more people’s housing costs in check. The ultimate success of an affordability agenda should be measured by whether everyone has the opportunity not just to get by, but thrive.

Refugee Admissions Program.
I urge you to support the GRACE Act to ensure we uphold our commitment to protecting those who are forced to flee from their homes.
Support the GRACE Act to ensure the refugee admissions program remains resilient so we can all thrive and flourish.","Tens of thousands of refugees who had already been approved for resettlement in the U.S. are stranded overseas in dangerous conditions in the wake of President Trump’s indefinite refugee ban. At the same time, the Trump administration is subjecting refugees living in U.S. communities to an onslaught of attacks.

With refugee admissions still indefinitely suspended, the administration says it plans to subject all refugees who arrived in the United States between January 20, 2021 and February 20, 2025 to “review and reinterview.” The process could jeopardize individuals’ ongoing protection in the United States. Simultaneously, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has announced a barrage of discriminatory policy changes that target people based on their nationality, including Afghans and other individuals from the 19 countries on the travel ban list.

Compounding the most recent attacks on newcomers, in October, the Trump administration announced it would set the refugee admissions target – or Presidential Determination (PD) on Refugee Admissions – at a historic low of just 7,500, with most capacity set aside for a group of predominantly white South Africans known as Afrikaners. Right now, the only people arriving in the United States via the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) are Afrikaners, even as tens of thousands of refugees fleeing violence and persecution remain unable to enter the U.S., despite completing years of vetting and screening.

The Guaranteed Refugee Admission Ceiling Enhancement Act (GRACE Act) would establish crucial safeguards to prevent presidential administrations from undermining the refugee admissions program.

The GRACE Act would protect the refugee admissions program from future attacks by setting a minimum annual refugee admissions target of 125,000, increasing transparency and congressional oversight to ensure USRAP is functioning as intended, and ensuring that the refugee admissions target responds appropriately to global resettlement needs.

Use the tool below to join us in urging your two Senators and one Representative to support the GRACE Act to protect the spirit of welcome that animates the refugee program.

Sample email: My name is [insert name], and as your constituent from [City/Town] and a [person of faith/refugee/member of community], I urge you to cosponsor the Guaranteed Refugee Admissions Ceiling Enhancement Act (GRACE Act) to protect the spirit of welcome that animates the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP).

Right now, refugees in our communities are facing unprecedented attacks. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) intends to “review and reinterview” refugees who arrived in the U.S. between January 20, 2021, and February 20, 2025. Additionally, the administration continues to implement discriminatory policies that specifically target Afghans as well as those from the 19 countries on the travel ban list.

Meanwhile, tens of thousands of highly-vetted refugees remain stranded in dangerous conditions overseas, as the Trump administration has barred all refugees from entry except for a group of predominantly white South Africans.

The GRACE Act includes a broad range of safeguards to prevent presidential administrations from undermining the refugee admissions program by establishing transparency, strengthening congressional oversight, and ensuring that the refugee admissions target is responsive to global need. The bill, led by Senator Markey and Representative Lofgren, would:

Set a minimum annual refugee admissions goal of at least 125,000. Should the administration fail to abide by statutory requirements to issue a determination before the beginning of the fiscal year, the minimum target would be automatically established. The bill also requires presidential administrations to create actionable plans to rectify challenges in the event they fall significantly behind the goal.

Encourage the administration to consider global resettlement needs and require the White House and State Department to justify their regional priorities when determining how to allocate processing capacity.

Implement guardrails that promote robust congressional oversight of USRAP, including requiring the administration to issue quarterly reports on their progress in meeting the admissions goal.

Again I urge you to cosponsor the GRACE Act to promote the strength and longevity of the U.S.’s capacity to welcome refugees fleeing violence and persecution. The evidence is clear, welcoming refugees helps us all flourish. Thank you.

Sincerely,

As refugees and other newcomers in my community face unprecedented attacks, tens of thousands of refugees who fled persecution and were approved for resettlement when President Trump took office remain stranded overseas in dangerous conditions.

Washington, D.C. (December 17, 2025)—Rep. Pramila Jayapal, Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement, led subcommittee Democrats in exposing the Trump Administration’s lawless and indiscriminate crusade against legal immigrants, taking aim at the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program and recklessly throwing more than one million individuals into legal limbo.

The hearing included testimony from: Mr. Jimmy Williams, Jr., President, International Union of Painters and Allied Trades; Mr. George Fishman, Legal Fellow, Center for Immigration Studies; Mr. Larry Celaschi, Councilman, Borough of Charleroi, Pennsylvania; and Mr. James Rogers, Senior Counsel, America First Legal.

In its quest for mass deportations and to meet Stephen Miller’s arrest quotas, the Trump Administration has done everything it can to end legal immigration, including dramatically limiting the use of Temporary Protected Status (TPS).

Ranking Member Jayapal asked Mr. Williams if his union members feel safe coming into work amid the Trump Administration’s lawless crackdown. He explained: “No. We have had horror story after horror story of members of ours that have been granted status in this country, that have been targeted on the job site for removal, followed to their homes and on the way to work, being pulled over by local law enforcement and being detained, only not to be heard from again.”

Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García said: “The Trump Administration and its loyalists in Congress continue their efforts to persecute immigrants and undermine our legal immigration system. Today, their target is Temporary Protected Status. They are here to scapegoat and demonize people with TPS, to justify Trump and Miller’s decision to send a million people with legal status back to countries with extreme levels of armed conflict and other conditions.”

Ending TPS has thrown more than 1 million individuals into legal limbo—making people who have been lawfully present in the U.S. for decades suddenly undocumented and throwing their communities into chaos.

Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon said: “In my district and across the country, Venezuelans, Haitians, Afghans and others living here under TPS status have had the rug pulled out from under them. TPS is a bipartisan program created by Congress, which allows people from countries facing war, unrest, natural disasters to stay in the U.S. until it’s safe to return.”

Rep. Deborah Ross said: “U.S. law permits TPS designation for nationals of a country when ongoing armed conflict poses a serious threat to their personal safety. I recently sent a letter(link is external) to the Administration with the Ranking Member calling out the hypocrisy of revoking TPS for South Sudan, a country plagued by armed clashes, with DHS claiming that there have been improvements in the civil safety outlook. But at the very same time, the Administration has designated South Sudan as a Level 4 travel advisory zone, ‘Do Not Travel,’ stating that the armed conflict is ongoing and includes fighting between various political and ethnic groups.”

The Trump Administration’s anti-immigrant policies have already wreaked havoc on the U.S. economy.

Rep. García asked: “Do these raids at work sites make workers safer, or does it put them at risk?” Mr. Williams explained: “It puts them at extreme risk. And listen, you can’t work safely when you’re worried about being targeted for removal. You know, the truth is, people just won’t show up to work, which we’ve seen in North Carolina and Florida, where you have a disproportionate amount of TPS holders.”

Rep. Jasmine Crockett said: “We’re in the middle of the largest, most inhumane deportation program in American history. And guess what? Housing is still unaffordable. Health care is still too expensive. Groceries are still too expensive. Wages aren’t keeping up with inflation. Jobs are still being outsourced. So maybe it’s not the immigrants, maybe it's the failed Republican policies.”

Ranking Member Jayapal said: “TPS has also allowed hundreds of thousands of people to work legally, often in industries that are already experiencing severe labor shortages. These are folks working in construction, hospitality, food processing, and manufacturing—the kinds of jobs that keep our economy running and that many businesses are struggling to fill. They pay taxes, support local businesses, and contribute billions of dollars to our economy every single year. In all, TPS holders contribute about $21 billion annually to the U.S. economy, and they pay $5.2 billion in combined federal, payroll, state, and local taxes. They also contribute about $690 million annually to Social Security.”",,N,,2025-12-18 14:58:15.836480

Around 150,000 Sikhs drive trucks in the United States.
“This, in turn, inflames anti-immigrant bias towards immigrant truck drivers, especially Sikh drivers,” the filing said.
The job has long attracted immigrants hoping to earn a potentially substantial wage soon after arriving in the United States.
No studies have been conducted to show how many holders of non-domiciled licenses have been involved in crashes.","The Trump administration’s effort to reduce the number of accidents involving large trucks has taken aim at deficient truck driving schools and tightened a rule requiring that drivers are proficient in English.

But a major part of its trucking crackdown — a new emergency rule that prohibits certain classes of immigrants from obtaining truck driver’s licenses — has drawn fierce criticism and legal challenges. The moves are in line with the administration’s continued efforts to remove certain foreigners from the United States and bar others from entering.

The immigrants targeted by the new regulation are those in the United States as asylum seekers, refugees and recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Previous policies allowed such immigrants to obtain a so-called non-domiciled commercial driver’s license if they were authorized to work in the United States.

The administration, citing recent fatal accidents, says these classes of immigrants can be dangerous drivers. But critics of the rule say the administration has not produced data showing that they are less safe.

“It doesn’t look believable to anyone in the industry when you accuse them of being unsafe,” said Al Bagiro, chief insurance officer at Cogo Insurance, a truck insurer, referring to the targeted drivers.

Other opponents of the new policy, which was stayed by a federal appeals court last month, say it discriminates against immigrants.

“The rule succeeds at perpetuating the myth that all immigrant drivers (regardless of their legal status) are unqualified or dangerous,” groups representing Sikhs in the United States argued in a legal filing opposing the rule. Around 150,000 Sikhs drive trucks in the United States.

“This, in turn, inflames anti-immigrant bias towards immigrant truck drivers, especially Sikh drivers,” the filing said.

Trucking can be a demanding job, often requiring that drivers be on the road for long periods. The job has long attracted immigrants hoping to earn a potentially substantial wage soon after arriving in the United States. Trucking companies, particularly smaller ones, have struggled financially in the last couple of years, with too many drivers chasing too little business.

Fatal crashes involving large trucks have declined in recent years. In the 12 months through September, there were 3,632, down 15 percent from 4,292 in the same period a year earlier, according to data from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the part of the Department of Transportation that regulates trucking and bus services.

No studies have been conducted to show how many holders of non-domiciled licenses have been involved in crashes.

In making the case for its crackdown, the Trump administration has highlighted fatal crashes involving semis driven by immigrants, contending that they should not have had truck driving licenses.

In August, a minivan on Florida’s turnpike crashed into a truck that was, according to the state’s department of highway safety, making an illegal U-turn. Three people in the minivan died. The driver of the truck, who survived the crash, obtained his commercial driver’s license in California and was, according to the Department of Homeland Security, in the United States illegally. To obtain a non-domiciled C.D.L., a person must have documentation to work in the United States.

The driver, Harjinder Singh, has pleaded not guilty to charges of vehicular homicide and vehicular manslaughter, and a representative for Mr. Singh said he had authorization to work in the United States.

When the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration imposed the rule barring certain types of noncitizens from getting a non-domiciled commercial driver’s license, it said state licensing agencies could not check the driving histories of such applicants in their home country because they existed “predominantly or solely within a foreign jurisdiction.” The rule allows people in the United States on employment-based visas to get commercial driving licenses.

In a defeat for the Transportation Department, a federal appeals court last month stayed the rule, saying the safety administration did not appear to show that the regulations “would produce any net safety benefit.” The judges also noted that, when formulating the rule, the safety administration itself had said there was not sufficient evidence to show a measurable relationship between the nation of domicile of a commercial driver and “safety outcomes in the United States.”

The F.M.C.S.A. said that it was going to reissue the rule after reviewing public comments, and that it might be changed.

Sean Duffy, the transportation secretary, has focused his criticisms about non-domiciled drivers on Democratic states like California and New York, saying federal audits of the states have shown that they issued licenses when they should not have. He has threatened to withhold tens of millions of dollars in federal funds from states if they do not overhaul their licensing operations.

California has since acknowledged that it issued some 17,000 non-domiciled driver’s licenses and learner permits that did not comply with regulations, but a spokeswoman for the California State Transportation Agency did not respond when asked for specifics. There are some 65,000 holders of non-domiciled licenses and permits in California.

And in response to Mr. Duffy’s accusation that it had unsafe licensing practices, California said truck drivers of all types licensed in the state had a lower rate of being involved in fatal crashes than those from most other states.

The California transport agency said drivers with C.D.L.s. issued in that state were involved in fatal accidents at a rate of 0.84 per 1,000 license holders in 2023.

Asked whether the Trump administration was overly focused on Democratic states and not applying sufficient scrutiny to red states like Texas, the Transportation Department spokeswoman said its policies were being applied evenly.

“The nationwide audit will continue until all illegally issued licenses are identified and the unqualified drivers are off America’s roads,” she said.

Of Texas’ 576,389 commercial drivers, 700 were involved in fatal crashes in 2023, or a rate of 1.21 crashes per 1,000 license holders, according to California’s data.

If the Trump administration’s policies end up removing thousands of drivers from the industry, it will not lead to the sort of driver shortage that would roil supply chains, logistics experts said.

“I don’t see a large impact on the industry with what I’ve seen thus far,” said Logan Cooper, a senior manager at OEC Group, an international logistics company.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/17/multimedia/00biz-truck-crackdown-01-qhml/00biz-truck-crackdown-01-qhml-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 14:58:23.947097

Federal agents have staged armed raids into apartment buildings, broken car windows to forcibly remove people and used chemical irritants on bystanders filming the actions.
“We’ve been told repeatedly that law enforcement cannot interfere with or assist ICE, yet we’ve seen ICE escort people out of the county jail and then detain them,” she said.
“When federal agents operate as if they are above the law, this is not law enforcement.
Rayfield told attendees that under Oregon law he is not allowed to give legal guidance to local law enforcement or local governments, but he said he has had conversations with local police leaders in many parts of the state.","Concerns over aggressive federal immigration enforcement dominated Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield’s final town hall of the year.

About 150 people attended Wednesday night’s event at Portland Community College’s Sylvania Campus, where Senate President Rob Wagner, a Lake Oswego Democrat who represents the area in the state Legislature, joined Rayfield.

Over the course of an hour, more than a dozen people stood up to ask the same question: What could the state do to hold federal immigration agents accountable for violating due process laws and using excessive force and to require agents to wear identification?

Many demanded the state issue guidance to local governments and police, ensuring people can call 911 and receive help if they are being unlawfully arrested, detained or treated.

Hundreds of people have been arrested and detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and other federal agents in Oregon during the last three months, including parents dropping their kids at school and a high school student and U.S. citizen on his lunch break. Federal agents have staged armed raids into apartment buildings, broken car windows to forcibly remove people and used chemical irritants on bystanders filming the actions.

Former McMinnville Mayor Remy Drabkin told Wagner and Rayfield that despite Oregon’s sanctuary laws prohibiting local law enforcement from working with immigration officers, police are confused about where to draw the line and are not showing up when people call 911 for help.

“We’ve been told repeatedly that law enforcement cannot interfere with or assist ICE, yet we’ve seen ICE escort people out of the county jail and then detain them,” she said. “Our request would be that you release statewide guidance for law enforcement that the public can easily access and understand.”

Refugees and immigrants from Ukraine and Afghanistan discussed fear of going out in public for risk of being wrongfully targeted and detained by ICE officers.

“When federal agents operate as if they are above the law, this is not law enforcement. That is lawlessness,” said Abdul Hassan, board president of the nonprofit Community Empowerment Foundation in Portland, and an Afghan who formerly served as a language advisor to the U.S. military in Afghanistan.

“When lawlessness is tolerated under the excuse of immigration control, the rule of law itself is being undermined. Let me be very clear: public safety cannot be built on racial profiling, collective punishment and intimidation,” he said.

Wagner suggested lawmakers in the upcoming February legislative session would produce a framework for local governments and police to understand how they can protect Oregonians from ICE agents’ use of excessive force and to ensure the state’s sanctuary law is enforced.

Rayfield told attendees that under Oregon law he is not allowed to give legal guidance to local law enforcement or local governments, but he said he has had conversations with local police leaders in many parts of the state. He asked attendees to continue being the justice department’s eyes in Oregon, and to continue documenting misconduct and reporting it to the Oregon Department of Justice’s Sanctuary Promise Violations Hotline.

Rayfield and several Oregon district attorneys wrote in November to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, saying that the state justice department would be monitoring federal agents’ conduct for potential prosecution.

And he recently told the Capital Chronicle that he was evaluating potential cases to refer to local prosecutors.

“It doesn’t matter who you are, whether you’re a law enforcement officer, whether you’re myself, whether you’re one of my family members or just a community member, all of us have to follow the laws of the state of Oregon, and that includes ICE officers as well,” Rayfield told reporters before the townhall. “There is certain immunity that is afforded to federal officers, but that immunity is not absolute, and so our responsibility here in Oregon is to make sure that people are following the law, investigating, monitoring and ensuring that when people are violating that law, that we are holding them accountable.”

Antonia Lopez of Aloha said she had hoped Rayfield and Wagner would have a more concrete plan to get local law enforcement to protect Oregonians from federal officers.

“There seems to be a disconnect in what the chiefs of police, the sheriffs, all of these people are saying about what they can’t do when ICE shows up” she said. “Can they give them direction as to what they can do? And they can start doing that?”

Lakanwal was admitted to the United States under Biden, and the Trump administration approved his asylum claim in April.
While investigators have not disclosed any motive for the attack, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said he was “radicalized” in the United States.
Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.)’s office did not respond to a request for comment about whether the New York Republican still supported the Enduring Welcome Act.","Until the shooting, GOP lawmakers had mostly worked to protect programs to aid Afghans seeking asylum from the larger Trump administration crackdown on foreign nationals in the United States. Now once-stalwart backers of programs for these Afghans are hedging their support and calling for changes to the vetting process. Some of those making the biggest reversals face voters in 2026.

“I’m sympathetic, obviously, to people who have helped America in the war effort, but all that support was predicated upon a rigorous vetting process, which I don’t have confidence in,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas). Cornyn, who faces two formidable primary challengers this year, helped write a 2021 law that updated the Special Immigrant Visa category for Afghans who helped the United States during the two decades America spent fighting Taliban insurgents in the country.

Asked his current stance on the SIV program, Cornyn said, “I don’t have any confidence in it” in light of the vetting issues.

Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), who has previously backed the resettlement of Afghan allies and condemned the Biden administration for inaction in helping Afghans, is also focusing on the need for reforms.

“We can be grateful President Trump is taking decisive action to strengthen vetting and prevent such a tragedy from ever happening again,” said Blackburn, who is retiring from the Senate and running for Tennessee governor, in a speech on the Senate floor.

It’s a stunning reversal of fortunes for the effort to help Afghans who aided the U.S., coming just weeks ahead of the end-of-year deadline for Congress to extend the deadline for Afghans to apply for Special Immigrant Visas. And it comes as advocates warn that there is an insufficient number of visas for the number of applicants waiting to enter the United States.

The U.S. admitted nearly 200,000 Afghan nationals in the wake of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Officials who served in the Biden administration have maintained that the U.S. did adequately vet and screen those who were admitted and that only a small number have encountered legal trouble since then.

Thousands of Afghans who worked with the U.S. military and their families still wait at military bases and refugee camps around the world for a small number of SIVs. Military personnel at U.S. bases overseas typically conducted initial vetting of Afghans.

Republican leaders, said one congressional staffer, have “poisoned the Afghan allies conversation” even as a small bipartisan group of lawmakers tries to keep the efforts to help Afghans alive.

“Republicans want this debate to die,” the staffer added. The individual, like others, was granted anonymity to discuss internal conversations about the legislation.

Shawn VanDiver, head of a nonprofit called AfghanEvac that advocates for programs to help Afghans who aided the U.S., said he was shocked by House Speaker Mike Johnson’s decision to ax the provision reestablishing State’s Office of the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts from the NDAA.

“Speaker Johnson has been good on this” previously, VanDiver said. “We expected the president to turn this into a circus … This is the president using a terrible tragedy to turn prejudice into policy.”

The plight of Afghans who helped U.S. forces has been one of few issues to unite Democrats and Republicans in Washington, even as Congress became more polarized. Congressional Democrats and Republicans joined forces during the Biden administration to increase the number of Special Immigrant Visas available to Afghans following the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of the country. Legislation to provide Afghans with a path to U.S. citizenship or permanent residency has also enjoyed bipartisan co-sponsorships, though it has not become law.

Since the Nov. 26 shooting of two West Virginia National Guard members, which killed one service member and critically injured another, there’s been little appetite in Congress to increase the number of visas — let alone increase the legal pathways to citizenship — for Afghans.

The shooter, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, served in an Afghan military unit with ties to the CIA. Lakanwal was admitted to the United States under Biden, and the Trump administration approved his asylum claim in April. While investigators have not disclosed any motive for the attack, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said he was “radicalized” in the United States. Republicans have seized on the issue to renew their attacks on the resettlement of Afghan refugees and the security screening process.

It has also become politically dangerous for Republicans up for reelection in the midterms to voice any support for the Afghan visa programs.

One of Cornyn’s primary challengers, Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-Texas), has seized on his past support of the visa programs to portray his opponent as out of touch with voters. Hunt himself previously backed efforts to support Afghans who helped the U.S. in Afghanistan.

“When a senator from Texas takes 11 votes to support mass amnesty and then votes to accelerate Afghan SIV pathways, it doesn’t signal America First. It signals a bid for clout among Washington insiders,” Hunt’s campaign said in a statement.

Democrats and some Republicans have asked for caution. While the Biden administration’s process was criticized in a 2022 Department of Homeland Security inspector general’s report, which found that federal officials “did not always have critical data” to properly vet Afghan refugees, they argue that thorough vetting still occurs.

“Individuals are already vetted through numerous interagency databases including through the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the National Counterterrorism Center,” a group of House Democrats led by Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.) wrote in a Thursday letter to Trump and Noem.

Democrats are particularly incensed about the removal of the CARE office provision from the NDAA. That office, eliminated during a July overhaul of the State Department, was a hub across the U.S. government to process visas for, and manage the relocation and integration of, Afghans allowed into the United States.

Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove (D-Calif.), who co-sponsored the original legislation to reauthorize State’s CARE office, said her Republican colleagues are turning their backs on Afghans.

“My colleagues need to grow a spine and stop letting Stephen Miller do their jobs, or else they will go down in history as betraying the very Afghans we promised we would never leave behind,” she said, referring to the Trump adviser who is seen as the main architect of the president’s immigration policy.

Johnson’s move dashed hopes that any legislation to help Afghans who supported the U.S. war effort could advance in this Congress.

“That was everyone’s hopes and dreams on this issue,” said a second congressional staffer. “It was literally authorizing the CARE office at State. If that’s dead, you can extrapolate that nothing more substantive on this is ever going to pass.”

Lawmakers have until Dec. 31 to decide whether to extend the SIV program. About 35,000 Afghans are approved to enter the United States, but fewer than 7,000 SIVs remain to be allocated, based on the numbers Congress authorized in previous years.

In the past, when the number of visas has come close to running out, Congress has increased the cap.

Another bipartisan bill, the Afghan Adjustment Act, would create a pathway for Afghans to obtain permanent residency and eventually U.S. citizenship. That bill already faced headwinds during both the Trump and Biden administrations given political opposition to immigration.

VanDiver said he wants lawmakers to use a discharge petition to bring the CARE office legislation and other bills to help Afghans to a vote in the House without Johnson’s approval. It is unclear whether such a petition will materialize before Congress adjourns for the holidays.

The Republican co-sponsors of the legislation to reestablish the CARE office have not commented on its removal from the NDAA. Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.)’s office did not respond to a request for comment about whether the New York Republican still supported the Enduring Welcome Act.

Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) still backs the legislation — but he’s not running for reelection.

“The creed of the military is no man left behind,” McCaul said in an AfghanEvac video. ”And we promised them that we would protect them and yet we failed in that duty, in my judgment.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F06%2F40%2F52a2d09b4499a1b365885cf09d8f%2Fu-s-congress-67936.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 13:57:35.105958

An agreement between European Parliament and the European Council, or the group of the 27 EU heads of state, said that the countries would be considered safe if they lack “relevant circumstances, such as indiscriminate violence in the context of an armed conflict.”

Asylum requests by people from Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, Kosovo, India, Morocco and Tunisia will be ""fast-tracked, with applicants having to prove that this provision should not apply to them,” read the announcement of the agreement. “The list can be expanded in the future under the EU’s ordinary legislative procedure.”

In 2024, EU nations endorsed sweeping reforms to the bloc’s failed asylum system. The rules were meant to resolve the issues that have divided the 27 countries since well over 1 million migrants swept into Europe in 2015, most fleeing war in Syria and Iraq.

Under the Pact on Migration and Asylum, which goes into force in June 2026, people can be sent to countries deemed safe, but not to those where they face the risk of physical harm or persecution.

Amnesty International EU advocate Olivia Sundberg Diez said the new measures were “a shameless attempt to sidestep international legal obligations"" and would endanger migrants.

French MEP Mélissa Camara said the safe countries of origins concept and others agreed to by the Council and Parliament “opens the door to return hubs outside the EU’s borders, where third-country nationals are sometimes subjected to inhumane treatment with almost no monitoring” and “undoubtedly places thousands of people in exile in situations of danger.”

Céline Mias, the EU director of the Danish Refugee Council said that ""we are deeply worried that this fast-track system will fail to protect people in need of protection, including activists, journalists and marginalized groups in places where human rights are clearly under attack.”

Alessandro Ciriani, an Italian MEP with the European Conservatives and Reformists group, said the designation sends a firm message that the EU has toughened its borders.

“Just stop it,” Higgins told host Chris Cuomo.

“It’s bad for our economy, it’s horrifying for our families, and we cannot proceed this way as a nation.”

Since President Trump returned to office, the Department of Homeland Security has conducted operations in cities nationwide, from Los Angeles to Chicago to Charlotte, N.C.

Higgins, elected to lead the Magic City earlier this month, specifically criticized the administration for partnering with the Florida government in opening an immigrant detention facility in the Everglades.

The site, dubbed Alligator Alcatraz by Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier (R), opened in June. Trump visited the facility days later.

Through Oct. 15, more than 6,700 men entered the facility — 22 percent of whom were convicted of crimes more serious than non-DUI traffic offenses — according to NBC6 in South Florida.

More than 4 in 10 detainees had pending criminal charges, while more than 3 in 10 of the about 1,200 individuals held there on July 25 had a final order of removal, the news outlet added.

Amnesty International, a human rights organization, said last week that the use of a confined space called the “box” at the facility “constitutes torture.”

Mayor Andrew Ginther, Police Chief Elaine Bryant, City Attorney Zach Klein and City Council President Shannon Hardin spoke at the address.

The Columbus Department of Public Safety released a video on Thursday addressing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in the city of Columbus.

The video features Ginther and Bryant.

""In light of the deployment of federal immigration and custom enforcement agents in our city, we understand that many of our neighbors may feel concerned for our safety,"" Ginther said. ""Please know that we stand with you and everyone who call Columbus home.""

Bryant added, ""Please know that CPD will not investigate Columbus residents solely based on immigration status. We will only investigate or apprehend someone if there is evidence of a crime or if there is illegal or dangerous conduct. CPD officers will be present to maintain public safety.""

During the press conference, Ginther said while some say the federal agents are in Columbus to make the city safer, he said the city is already safe.

The mayor points to lower number of homicides in recent years, with Ginther saying homicides are down 35% from last year and at the lowest point they've been in almost 20 years. He also said felonious assault cases are down 22%, non-fatal shootings are down 26%, car thefts are down 18% and felony theft is down 11%.

""These statistics are important because they show our city is the safest its been in years and they paint a picture of trust between Columbus residents and law enforcement is the strongest it's been in some time,"" Ginther said.

Bryant said Columbus is a diverse and welcoming city.

""We do not want our neighbors living in fear. We don't want anyone in our community calling the police in a time of need. That does not serve public safety,"" Bryant said.

The police chief said the department's mission is to maintain and public safety for everyone in the community.

Klein issued the following statement:

""I am aware of reports that federal law enforcement officials, including ICE, are currently engaged in active operations in Columbus. I know this causes alarm and concern. Please know that the Columbus Division of Police is not involved in these sorts of immigration enforcement activities. CPD's role is public safety, not immigration enforcement. Our officers do not inquire about immigration status when folks call for help and do not aid federal immigration operations, as has been the case under this and every other presidential administration.

If anyone witnesses concerning activity, do not intervene directly or put yourself at risk. If the action is criminal in nature, always trust that you can call Columbus Police. They will respond. Additionally, sharing accurate information and looking out for one another is one of the most powerful ways our community can respond.

Lastly, we know many of our immigrant families, friends and neighbors are feeling anxious and afraid. You are all valued members of our city, and we're fully committed to your safety. Know that leaders at City Hall have your back and continue to monitor the situation on the ground.""

Hardin posted on Facebook, stating that ""we know ICE is in Columbus.""

""Columbus will stand shoulder to shoulder with our immigrant neighbors,"" he said in his post.

The PROTECT Immigration Act would: Repeal the statutory authority for the 287(g) Program; and Clarify that state and local law enforcement lack “inherent authority” to arrest people for suspected immigration offenses.","Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Representatives Mike Quigley (IL-05), Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Sarah McBride (DE-At Large), and Valerie Foushee (NC-04) re-introduced the Protecting the Rights of Towns against federal Enforcement contrary to Constitutional Tenets for (PROTECT) Immigration Act, legislation which would end the deputization of local and state police departments to enforce immigration law. The PROTECT Immigration Act would rescind the statutory authority for the federal government’s 287(g) Program, which allows the Department of Homeland Security to enter into agreements with state and local law enforcement agencies to enforce federal immigration law.

“The Trump administration just spent months terrorizing immigrants in the Chicagoland area. Their actions led to domestic violence victims fleeing a courthouse rather than receive restraining orders against their abusers, all out of fear that ICE or local law enforcement would detain and deport them,” said Representative Mike Quigley (IL-05). “I met with immigrants and their neighbors who are afraid to call for help or report crimes in their neighborhoods because of Trump’s deliberate erosion of trust between communities and local police. And now the Trump administration is running ads targeting local police and offering $50,000 signing bonuses to pull critical law enforcement away from day-to-day policing in order to arrest and detain hardworking immigrants with no criminal records. We must bring an end to the 287(g) program and cut off one of the avenues this administration has exploited to intimidate immigrant communities.”

“Allowing local law enforcement to be deputized to kidnap and disappear immigrants undercuts the trust that local police rely on to maintain public safety in our communities,” said Representative Pramila Jayapal (WA-07). “Immigrants and their U.S. citizen loved ones stop reporting crimes out of fear of being kidnapped and deported. Local police are spread thin enforcing federal civil immigration law. We know that Trump is not targeting criminals, he is targeting our friends, neighbors, co-workers, and pillars of our community. This lawlessness must end immediately.”

“I’m proud to co-lead this legislation with Congressman Quigley to restore trust, safety, and integrity to our immigration system. For too long, the 287(g) program has drained local resources, fueled racial profiling, and made communities less safe — and it’s time we end it. The PROTECT Immigration Act makes clear that immigration enforcement belongs with trained federal authorities, guaranteeing that local law enforcement can focus exclusively on keeping our communities safe. This bill would take a step toward restoring trust between local communities and police departments so every family can live with dignity and without fear,” said Representative Sarah McBride (DE-At Large).

“The Trump Administration’s attempt to expand the 287(g) Program is a direct assault on civil rights and the Constitution,” said Representative Valerie Foushee (NC-04). “Having served in local law enforcement for more than 20 years, I know policing should protect and support our communities, not divide it, and deputizing local officers into immigration enforcers only erodes public trust, undermines public safety, and deepens fear. We need laws in place that restore fairness and uphold justice. That’s why I’m proud to join my colleagues in introducing the PROTECT Immigration Act, which will reverse this harmful program and take an important step toward repairing the flaws in our broken immigration system.”

“In just one year, the Trump administration has massively expanded the 287(g) program and distorted it in ways Congress never intended, exploiting local law enforcement resources for its dystopian mass deportation agenda,” said Naureen Shah, director of policy and government affairs for the ACLU’s Equality Division. “Enlisting local law enforcement for mass deportations isn’t just a waste of taxpayer dollars – it terrorizes our communities, undermines public safety and fuels racial profiling. We thank Congressman Quigley for his leadership and urge our members of Congress to pass the PROTECT Immigration Act without delay.”

“The rapid expansion of the 287(g) program under the Trump administration represents yet another way that mass deportation undermines public safety for all Americans. When local police serve as a force multiplier for ICE, people become more afraid to report crime and less trusting of local police officers. Local law enforcement agencies should prioritize real public safety concerns in their communities rather than waste limited manpower making traffic stops that turn into detention and deportation for long-standing community members who pose no threat. The PROTECT Act takes the overdue step of repealing a program that is unnecessary for effective enforcement of immigration laws, but continues to have a harmful track record for public safety,” said Nayna Gupta, Policy Director at the American Immigration Council.

Quigley has championed the PROTECT Immigration Act since 2017.

This was about going after the Republican party and most importantly it was about going after our candidate for president, President Trump,” Jordan told Fox News’s Fox and Friends.
Smith has said his prosecutors followed justice department policy and were not influenced by politics.
“President Trump and his associates tried to call members of Congress in furtherance of their criminal scheme, urging them to further delay certification of the 2020 election,” Smith said.
“I didn’t choose those Members; President Trump did.”","Jack Smith, the former US justice department special counsel who brought two now-dropped criminal cases against Donald Trump, has defended his investigation before a House of Representatives panel, telling lawmakers that the basis for the prosecutions “rests entirely with President Trump and his actions”.

Smith gave private testimony to the Republican-controlled House judiciary committee following months of disclosures from Trump appointees at the justice department, and Republican lawmakers intended to discredit Smith’s investigation and bolster Trump’s claims that the cases were an abuse of the legal system.

Smith and his team secured indictments in 2023, accusing Trump of illegally retaining classified documents following his first term in office and plotting to overturn his defeat in the 2020 election. Smith dropped both cases after Trump won the 2024 election, citing a justice department policy against prosecuting a sitting president.

“If asked whether to prosecute a former president based on the same facts today, I would do so regardless of whether the president was a Republican or Democrat,” Smith told the committee, according to excerpts from his opening statement seen by Reuters.

His appearance at the Capitol came after the Republican chair of the House judiciary committee, Jim Jordan of Ohio, subpoenaed Smith for a closed-door deposition. Smith had requested a public hearing.

“This was political. This was about going after the Republican party and most importantly it was about going after our candidate for president, President Trump,” Jordan told Fox News’s Fox and Friends.

Speaking to reporters outside the interview room, Democratic lawmakers said Smith’s testimony should have been conducted in public. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the panel’s top Democrat, said a public hearing would have been “absolutely devastating to the president”.

“He’s answered every single question to the satisfaction of any reasonable-minded person in that room,” Raskin said.

Democratic depresentative, Pramila Jayapal of Washington, said Smith told lawmakers that Trump’s conduct in seeking to overturn the 2020 election, culminating in the January 6 attack on the Capitol, could have been “catastrophic” for the US democracy.

Republican lawmakers have expressed outrage at disclosures from the justice department that investigators sought information from a wide range of conservative organizations as part of the investigation into Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss and also obtained limited cellphone data from eight Republican senators during the period around the January 6 attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters.

Trump allies have pointed to those disclosures as evidence that Smith’s investigation was overzealous and targeted the political opposition.

Smith has said his prosecutors followed justice department policy and were not influenced by politics. He told lawmakers in his opening statement that the records were “relevant to complete a comprehensive investigation”.

From Trump’s unprecedented moves to expand domestic military operations and cut funding to public media, to the targeting of immigrant families and activists like Mahmoud Khalil, these stories reveal a society grappling with the consequences of abuse of power, political retaliation, and discrimination. Our work explaining Trump’s executive orders undermining protections for transgender people, and revealing how immigrant parents pushed back against Donald Trump’s attacks on birthright citizenship show our communities actively fighting for their rights.

These stories are not just headlines; they are evidence of the forces threatening democracy, free speech, and human dignity. They also show the resilience of individuals and advocates pushing back. Together, they offer a snapshot of the issues defining 2025 and the ongoing fight for justice.

Trump 2.0 and Abuse of Power

Starting mere hours after he was sworn in, Trump’s dangerous abuse of power threatens core democratic principles and civil liberties. These stories show how his expanded domestic deployment of the military and his attacks on press freedom risk silencing dissent and put vulnerable communities at risk.

Trump's Expanded Domestic Military Use Should Worry Us All

Starting in January, we sounded the alarm that military troops do not belong on our streets and should not be used to police civilians here at home. Since he took office, President Donald Trump has deployed military troops and federal agents in cities across the country in an effort to scare our communities, target political opponents and intimidate those who protest his policies.

This is all part of a continued effort by President Trump to abuse his power and deploy federal agents and military troops anywhere he wants, against whoever he wants. Cities and communities have pushed back, joining the ACLU and our partners to stop our neighborhoods from becoming places where people feel afraid to leave their homes.

What Happens Next: Courts have so far blocked the Trump administration’s attempts to federalize state National Guard troops and deploy them to multiple cities, including Portland and Chicago. But the government has now asked the Supreme Court to affirm its attempt to federalize and deploy troops to Chicago. The ACLU continues to urge both the courts and Congress to block these deployments and hold the Trump administration accountable for any abuses that stem from these activations.

Trump's Attacks on Press Freedom Escalate: NPR, PBS Funding Cuts Explained

Trump’s efforts to defund NPR and PBS were a historic assault on press freedom. In a May 2025 executive order titled “Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media,” Trump directed agencies to cut both direct and indirect federal funding to these public media outlets, accusing them of biased reporting. In response, NPR and several local stations filed a lawsuit, arguing that the order violates the First Amendment by retaliating against them for their editorial choices. The ACLU filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support.

What Happens Next: These lawsuits, and the fight for press freedom, is ongoing.

Safeguarding Immigration and Speech Rights

Trump’s immigration policies violate constitutional protections and basic human rights. Key concerns include threats to birthright citizenship, as well as the detention and deportation of individuals for political advocacy.

A Letter From Palestinian Activist Mahmoud Khalil

Our client, Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil wrote a powerful letter to his newborn son from an immigration detention center in Louisiana, where he was held for three months after ICE arrested him without a warrant in retaliation for his protected speech. In his letter, he appeals to students, advocates, and elected officials to defend the right to protest — framing his case not just as personal persecution but as part of a broader attack on immigrants, the rule of law, and people who spoke out in support of Palestinian human rights.

What Happens Next: Khalil was released from detention in June 2025 after a federal judge ordered his release and blocked the administration from deporting him as the case proceeds. His immigration case and his lawsuit challenging his unconstitutional detention are both ongoing.

‘My Child is Now a Political Debate’: Immigrant Families Battle Trump’s Birthright Citizenship Threats

Across the country, iImmigrant parents—many of whom have U.S.-born children—had to confront the reality that their own kids could be treated like political bargaining chips. The ACLU represented several families in their lawsuit against the Trump administration's unlawful executive order targeting birthright citizenship. They told us that revoking citizenship for children born in the U.S. was not only terrifying, but a violation of their constitutional rights.

What Happens Next: The Supreme Court announced in December that it will hear our case challenging Trump’s attempt to deny birthright citizenship to babies born in the U.S. We’re prepared to remind the court that the administration’s attempt to end birthright citizenship is a direct violation of the 14th Amendment.

Protecting Our Communities and Ourselves

Trump’s unlawful policies targeting transgender people endanger safety, compromise health, and strip transgender and intersex people of dignity and autonomy. We continue to challenge these actions in court

Trump's Executive Orders Promoting Sex Discrimination, Explained

In January, Trump’s executive orders targeting transgender people ordered the Federal Bureau of Prisons and Department of Homeland Security to force transgender women into men’s prisons and detention centers, ignoring safety guidelines, and withdraw medically-necessary care, putting more than 2,000 incarcerated trans people at high risk of abuse. The order also blocked transgender and intersex people from updating sex markers on new passports, visas, and trusted traveler documents, effectively outing them and limiting their ability to travel.

What Happens Next: The Supreme Court allowed the government to enforce a discriminatory passport policy against transgender people.

For such entities, the absence of California-specific targeting may no longer bar suit in California if the alleged data extraction from Californians is part of the platform’s designed operations.
Given the legislative standstill on CIPA, the litigation environment will remain active and uncertain through at least 2026.","The past year has seen sweeping developments in personal jurisdiction doctrine as applied to online privacy litigation, particularly in California. In April 2025, the Ninth Circuit’s en banc decision in Briskin v. Shopify, Inc.1 recalibrated the specific-jurisdiction analysis for nationwide e-commerce platforms accused of harvesting and monetizing consumer data, expressly rejecting any requirement of “differential targeting” of the forum. In the months that followed, however, two California district courts—addressing suits against a hotel holding company2 and a Georgia retailer3—dismissed privacy claims for lack of personal jurisdiction, underscoring the continuing burden on plaintiffs to connect alleged data practices to defendants’ own, forum-directed conduct. Meanwhile, Sacramento has put on ice a legislative effort (SB 690)4 to narrow the scope of the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA), ensuring that current litigation dynamics will persist at least through 2026. Together, these crosscurrents define a more nuanced and fact-intensive landscape for companies that sell online, deploy tracking technologies, or publish omnibus privacy statements.

Briskin’s Reframing: Purposeful Direction Without ‘Differential Targeting’

In Briskin, the Ninth Circuit revived a putative privacy class action against Shopify, holding that the plaintiff made a prima facie showing of specific jurisdiction in California.5 The complaint alleged that Shopify’s platform installed tracking tools, intercepted communications, and extracted personal and transactional data from California consumers, using the data for Shopify’s own commercial benefit.6 The court held that such conduct—designed into the platform’s business model—constituted purposeful direction at California even though Shopify cultivated a nationwide audience.7 Crucially, the en banc court overruled prior circuit precedent to the extent it demanded “differential targeting” of the forum, clarifying that an interactive platform “expressly aims” conduct at a state when the relevant contacts are the product of the defendant’s own choices and are not random, isolated, or fortuitous.8 The court also concluded the claims “arose out of or related to” those forum contacts and that the exercise of jurisdiction was reasonable given California’s interest in protecting resident privacy and the efficiencies of litigating where the alleged data extraction occurred.9

Briskin thus lowers a doctrinal hurdle that had often shielded nationwide platforms: plaintiffs need not show that a defendant singled out California with bespoke marketing or state-specific features if the business model itself predictably and deliberately extracts Californians’ data for commercial gain. At the same time, Briskin did not dispense with the requirement that jurisdiction be anchored in the defendant’s own forum contacts—not those of third parties—and that the alleged harms relate to those contacts.

District Courts Draw Lines: Passive Policies, Third-Party Scripts, and General Online Sales Are Not Enough

Two subsequent district court rulings illustrate the remaining limits of specific jurisdiction where the defendant’s own California-directed conduct is thin.

First, in a Northern District of California case against a hotel holding company, the court granted a Rule 12(b)(2) motion and dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction.10 Plaintiffs alleged the company operated a website facilitating shopping for and leasing rooms in California and pointed to a global privacy statement referencing California law and opt-out rights.11 The court credited an uncontested declaration establishing that the holding company did not itself operate hotels or maintain a California presence and emphasized that the complaint alleged data collection via third-party scripts on the website, not by the defendant itself.12 Distinguishing Briskin, the court found no allegations that the defendant targeted California consumers or compiled their data for its own use; nor would a general, globally accessible privacy statement, standing alone, create jurisdiction in every state where it is read.13 The dismissal was with leave to amend, but the court warned that failure to cure the jurisdictional defects could lead to dismissal without further leave.

Next, the Central District of California dismissed with prejudice a CIPA “trap and trace” action against a Georgia-based e‑commerce retailer.14 The plaintiff alleged the retailer installed TikTok’s software on its website, which collected and transmitted visitor data (including device and geolocation information) to TikTok.15 Despite amended allegations that the retailer sells and ships to California, the court held there was no express aiming at California and no showing that the plaintiff’s injury arose out of California‑focused conduct by the retailer itself.16 The court again distinguished Briskin, explaining that the defendant was not a nationwide platform cultivating a ubiquitous audience for commercial gain and that the forum contacts of a third-party technology provider (TikTok) could not be imputed to the retailer.17 Because the plaintiff failed to satisfy either of the first two prongs of the Ninth Circuit’s specific-jurisdiction test, the case was dismissed in its entirety with prejudice.

Read together, these decisions signal that Briskin is not a jurisdictional panacea. Plaintiffs must still plausibly allege that the defendant’s own business choices foreseeably involved extracting or exploiting data from California users and that their claims arise out of those contacts. Passive website features, generalized privacy statements that acknowledge California law, routine interstate sales and shipping, and the mere incorporation of third-party code will not, without more, establish specific jurisdiction.

Legislative Stasis: CIPA Reform Deferred, Litigation Continues

In parallel, California’s attempt to cabin CIPA exposure has stalled. SB 690—introduced to add a “commercial purpose” exception to several CIPA provisions (including Sections 631, 632, and 638.50)—passed the Senate 35–0 but failed to advance in the Assembly and has been reclassified as a two-year bill.18 The earliest it could be reconsidered is 2026, with no effect before 2027 even if enacted. The bill would have clarified that routine website practices such as session replay, chat support, and third‑party analytics do not amount to unlawful wiretapping or eavesdropping when employed for legitimate commercial purposes. With reform delayed, businesses remain exposed to continuing CIPA litigation and statutory damages of $5,000 per violation amid inconsistent judicial interpretations, as reflected in recent appellate activity involving website tracking and chat technologies.

Practical Implications for Online Businesses

The immediate takeaway is twofold. First, Briskin expands potential jurisdictional exposure for platforms whose business models inherently rely on the collection and commercialization of consumer data across state lines, including California. For such entities, the absence of California-specific targeting may no longer bar suit in California if the alleged data extraction from Californians is part of the platform’s designed operations. Second, for traditional retailers and brand owners that merely operate an online storefront, ship to California, and implement off‑the‑shelf tracking pixels or SDKs19 provided by third parties, the recent district court dismissals demonstrate that specific jurisdiction in California remains contestable—often successfully—unless plaintiffs can tie their privacy claims to the defendant’s own forum-directed conduct.

Given the legislative standstill on CIPA, the litigation environment will remain active and uncertain through at least 2026. Companies should expect continued, early-stage battles over personal jurisdiction, with outcomes turning on the specificity of pleadings concerning a defendant’s business choices, the locus of any alleged data extraction, and the relationship between those contacts and the asserted harms. Briskin has shifted the center of gravity, but it has not erased the boundaries between nationwide platforms that deliberately harvest data from Californians and out‑of‑state retailers whose incidental California web traffic and generalized privacy policies, without more, do not constitute purposeful direction.

The US-born pope chose 58-year-old Ronald Hicks, the current bishop of Joliet, Illinois, to lead the church in New York, replacing retiring Cardinal Timothy Dolan who has served for 16 years after being selected by Pope Benedict XVI in 2012.

Dolan is regarded as a conservative figure in the US Catholic church hierarchy. Hicks takes on the role of cardinal after Dolan last week finalized a plan to establish a $300m fund to compensate victims of sexual abuse who had brought legal action against the archdiocese.

Hicks addressed the issue at news conference on Thursday.

“As a church, we can never rest in our efforts to prevent abuse, to protect children and to care for survivors,” he said. “While this work is challenging, it’s difficult, it’s painful, I hope it will continue to help in the areas of accountability, transparency and healing.”

Notably, Leo and the US hierarchy have shown willingness to challenge the administration on its immigration policies. In October, Leo questioned whether the policies were in line with the Catholic church’s “pro-life” teachings and described them as “inhuman”.

Hicks, 58, grew up in South Holland, Illinois, close to the Chicago childhood home of Leo, the former Robert Prevost. Both men served the church abroad: Leo spending 20 years as a missionary in Peru; Hicks spent five years in El Salvador heading a church-run orphanage.

Last month, Hicks endorsed a special message from the US Conference of Catholic Bishops condemning the Trump administration’s immigration raids. The bishops said they “are disturbed when we see among our people a climate of fear and anxiety around questions of profiling and immigration enforcement. We are saddened by the state of contemporary debate and the vilification of immigrants”.

Hicks said the message expressed “our solidarity with all our brothers and sisters” and underlined their “concerns, opposition, and hopes with clarity and conviction”.

Leo and Hicks only met last year, when the provost and bishop visited one of Hicks’s parishes, according to CNN. Hicks told local Chicago WGN-TV after Leo was elected pope that he recognized their shared backgrounds and priorities.

“We grew up literally in the same radius, in the same neighborhood together. We played in the same parks, went swimming in the same pools, like the same pizza places,” he said.

Hicks was born on 4 August 1967, in Harvey, Illinois, and received degrees in philosophy, divinity and ministry. He was ordained to the priesthood for the archdiocese of Chicago in 1994, according to the New York archdiocese.

In 2005, he moved from Chicago to El Salvador to begin his five-year term as regional director of Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos (NPH) in Central America. NPH is a home dedicated to caring for more than 3,400 orphaned and abandoned children in nine Latin American and Caribbean countries.

He returned to Chicago and in 2020 Pope Francis named him Bishop Hicks as the sixth bishop of the Catholic diocese of Joliet, Illinois, serving about 520,000 Catholics in seven counties. Hicks will now serve roughly 2.5 million Catholics in Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island in New York City (Brooklyn and Queens are part of the Brooklyn archdiocese).","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88bada2c2a114a29acb5981d07b91062bd6de539/260_0_4179_3342/master/4179.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=06a7f95212b4a296a2cdc6fdb467a1be",N,,2025-12-18 14:58:31.406136

WASHINGTON — Heading into the new year, immigrants’ rights and civil rights advocates are busy preparing for Supreme Court arguments, expected in the spring, in a case challenging President Trump’s unprecedented birthright citizenship executive order that seeks to deny U.S. citizenship to many babies born in the United States. Cecillia Wang, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union and a second-generation American, will argue this landmark case, Trump v. Barbara, at the Supreme Court.

An ACLU lawyer for more than two decades, Wang has played a central role in shaping the organization’s civil rights and constitutional litigation. Under her leadership during the first Trump administration, the ACLU challenged the Muslim ban, family separation policy, illegal funding of border wall projects Congress had rejected, and attempts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

Earlier in her career, she directed the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, which won cases involving immigration detention, racial profiling, and discriminatory state and federal immigration laws. As a second-generation American, her own citizenship was made possible by the repeal of racially discriminatory immigration laws through the enactment of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, and by the 14th Amendment’s birthright citizenship guarantee. Those reforms grew directly out of the anti-slavery and civil rights movements and expanded who has citizenship and belonging in the United States.

“This is the case of the century — the stakes are unfathomably high. Can a president of the United States unilaterally end birthright citizenship by executive order — overriding more than 150 years of settled constitutional law, and redefining who is recognized as American at birth? Absolutely not,” said ACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero. “Cecillia Wang is one of the country’s great litigators, which is why she’s the ACLU’s top lawyer. She has decades of experience fighting government overreach, including two trial victories against Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s racial profiling and contempt of court. Now, she’s up against a more formidable adversary as this case is a linchpin to Donald Trump and Stephen Miller’s agenda. Our clients are in the best possible hands with Cecillia Wang and this incredible co-counsel team presenting arguments — they will do all it takes to make sure birthright citizenship remains a cornerstone of our democracy.”

The Barbara case is a nationwide class action brought by the national ACLU, ACLU of New Hampshire, ACLU of Maine, ACLU of Massachusetts, the Legal Defense Fund, Asian Law Caucus, and Democracy Defenders Fund on behalf of babies who would be subject to the executive order.

This summer, the federal court in the Barbara case granted a preliminary injunction that protects birthright citizenship for all children born on U.S. soil, prompting the Trump administration’s appeal to the Supreme Court.

Courts have uniformly rejected President Trump’s attempts to strip away a core constitutional protection and blocked his birthright citizenship executive order.

The groups will argue that the administration’s assault on birthright citizenship — the legal principle guaranteed by the 14th Amendment that every baby born in the United States is a U.S. citizen — flouts the Constitution’s dictates, longstanding Supreme Court precedent, a statute passed by Congress, and fundamental American values.",https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/themes/aclu-wp/img/content-types/fallback-press-release.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 10:57:49.145672

Our reporting reveals how federal agencies moved them through the Trump administration’s expanded network of detention facilities — many rife with complaints of inhumane conditions.

The analysis of recently released Immigration and Customs Enforcement data found that Illinois saw the sharpest increase in ICE arrests of any U.S. state in the first five weeks after the blitz began. And those who were arrested were quickly shuttled to a sprawling array of detention facilities that cut a wide swath down the middle of the country.

When federal agents launched “Operation Midway Blitz” in September, they arrested thousands of people, at times near schools or child care centers, and used chemical agents like tear gas on protesters. In response to the often chaotic and high-profile raids, city residents blew whistles to alert neighbors of approaching agents and organized “magic school buses” to accompany children to school.

The Marshall Project analyzed ICE data that includes arrests and detentions through the middle of October, the most current detailed records publicly available. People who ICE arrested during that time were later detained in 13 states, at county jails, privately run detention centers and a rapidly constructed facility on a military base, the data shows.

“Without that infrastructure, without mass detention, you can’t carry out mass raids or mass deportation,” said Stacy Suh, program director at Detention Watch Network, a coalition of grassroots organizations that seeks to end immigration detention.

The ICE data, obtained by the Deportation Data Project, allowed The Marshall Project to trace individuals as they were transferred between facilities, and in some cases, deported.

President Donald Trump has rapidly ramped up immigration arrests in an attempt to deport 1 million people in his first year back in office. At the same time, a new Department of Homeland Security policy denies detainees the right to bond hearings in immigration court, leading the number of people in detention to reach record-highs.

Examining the records of people who were arrested in the Chicago area, The Marshall Project found that nearly all of them were first held at a facility in Broadview, Illinois, a suburb west of the city. In November, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order compelling ICE to address conditions there.

The order cites “serious conditions” at the facility, similar to those reported at detention centers across the nation, and requires ICE to provide access to sleeping space, bedding, toiletries, medication, regularly cleaned areas, regular meals, telephone calls and clear information about paperwork the government asks detainees to sign.

The suburban facility, which has been the site of a lot of protests against the immigration raids, was the first stop for many who were arrested off the street as federal agents moved through the region. Dayanne Figueroa, a U.S. citizen who was pulled from her SUV by federal agents in a Chicago neighborhood, was detained at the Broadview facility. Figueroa, who was recovering from kidney surgeries when she was taken to Broadview, told Congress that she “begged for help” but was ignored by agents and “thrown into a filthy jail cell,” until blood in her urine prompted them to get her medical care.

After being booked into ICE custody, more than 380 people arrested in the Chicago area were transported to a recently revived detention facility in the rural town of Baldwin, Michigan. The facility, North Lake Processing Center, tops the list of places where the most people were held in the first weeks of the Operation Midway Blitz raids.

North Lake, which is run by GEO Group, was previously a federal prison until the Biden administration ended Department of Justice contracts with private prison companies. It reopened in June under a new contract with the Department of Homeland Security, becoming the largest immigration detention center in the Midwest.

Nahomi Ramirez, whose father is detained there, said North Lake still looks and feels like the prison it once was.

“It’s concrete walls, it’s barbed wire fences everywhere, like for no one to escape,” Ramirez said. “I haven’t even fully processed that in my brain, to be honest.”

Ramirez’s father, a semitruck driver arrested in Indiana, told her he was moved to a freezing-cold, filthy ward with other people who have diabetes. The detainees in the ward were not always fed on time, which caused their blood sugar to crash, Ramirez said, and her father’s allergy to the blankets in his room has left him huddling under his jacket for warmth.

U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan has reported receiving similar complaints from North Lake detainees about inadequate food, lack of medical care and freezing temperatures, as well as visitation issues, lack of access to legal counsel and suicide attempts. The concerns prompted her to visit the facility.

Since Trump’s second term began, more privately run immigration facilities have opened, or reopened, around the U.S. to keep up with the pace of raids and detentions. Meanwhile, advocates have warned of inhumane conditions for detainees.

Eighteen people, more than half of them children, arrested in the Chicago area were transferred to the Dilley Immigration Processing Center in Texas, run by CoreCivic. President Joe Biden ended the practice of detaining children with their families in 2021, but Trump recently reversed that policy and resumed operations.

Families at Dilley have testified in court filings to troubling conditions, including worms and mold in food and little access to education or recreation for children. They said their children were so distressed that they had hit their own faces and soiled themselves, despite being potty-trained.

In 2021, Illinois banned local jails from supplying detention space to ICE, leaving the agency to rely on neighboring states instead.

At least 300 people from the Chicago raids went through the Clay County Justice Center in Indiana, a jail that has long relied on federal detention contracts to supplement the county budget. After a heated public debate, Clay County opened up a new, 285-bed wing last year to house immigrants. ICE book-ins at the jail nearly tripled in the first half of the year, according to the IndyStar.

As a part of a lawsuit filed in 2022, attorneys for detainees claim the jail wrongfully passed inspection in violation of ICE standards and that ICE’s lack of oversight has allowed the county to misappropriate funds meant for the care and custody of people detained.

Robin Valenzuela, co-founder of Indiana AID, which supports immigrants detained in the state, said even with the expansion, the Clay County facility is overcrowded. People have developed infections from sleeping on floors, she said, and are not being provided with enough hygiene products during menstruation.

The conditions and the indefinitely long stays in detention have led many detainees to sign “voluntary departure” agreements to leave the U.S., she said.

“This whole thing is about deterrence,” Valenzuela said. “So it’s like, how can we make people as miserable as possible in these facilities so that they just say, ‘Screw it, I want to leave.’”

Other counties in Indiana are also cashing in on federal contracts. Immigration detention expanded to four more Indiana county jails this year, according to an analysis from the National Immigrant Justice Center. Data shows Marion County Jail in Indianapolis held at least 42 people arrested in the Chicago raids.

Noelle Smart, principal research associate at the Vera Institute of Justice, said ICE significantly expanded its jail contracts as the agency ramps up enforcement, and that it is increasingly relying on transfers to out-of-state facilities, particularly when it lacks detention space nearby.

A new Texas detention center, mostly composed of gigantic tents, is an archetype for the kinds of large facilities the Trump administration plans to continue building. More than 50 people arrested around Chicago during the federal enforcement blitz were last held at Camp East Montana before they were deported. The grounds, located on the Fort Bliss military base in El Paso, Texas, began holding immigrants in August, before its construction was finished.

More than 100 Chicago detainees remained there in mid-October. By the end of November, the camp hit an average daily population of over 2,700.

In the few months that it has been operational, the camp has been the subject of reports of abuse and dangerous conditions. In September, The Washington Post reported that an internal ICE inspection report showed it failed to meet at least 60 detention standards.

This month, civil rights groups sent a letter to federal officials detailing abuses based on interviews with dozens of people detained at Fort Bliss. The letter claimed federal officers used threats of violence in an attempt to force detainees to cross the border into Mexico, despite having migrated from Cuba. The letter also details reports of sexual abuse, toilets overflowing into sleeping areas, and detainees being denied access to medication and adequate food.

The family of Victor Miranda, a landscaper from the South Side of Chicago arrested during the blitz, said his medical conditions worsened after his transfer to Fort Bliss. Miranda’s 16-year-old daughter, Ashley, said her father has not had proper meals or been given the breathing equipment he uses to sleep.

“They keep calling them criminals, and they tell them there that the lawyers aren’t going to do anything for them,” said Ashley, translating for her mother, who speaks Spanish. “That you have no chance, you should just give up.”

Miranda is one of hundreds of people detained during the Chicago raids who were allegedly arrested by ICE without warrants.

On Dec. 11, a federal appeals court blocked the collective release of people arrested without warrants in Illinois and other states covered by a consent decree — but said a judge could review individual cases to determine who should be freed. If the Trump administration appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court, that could create more obstacles and delays.

In the meantime, Chicago residents and community organizations are readying themselves for more raids and arrests with the return of the federal blitz.

Erin Tobes, a stay-at-home mother in the Bowmanville neighborhood, launched a mutual aid committee with other mothers that organized rapid response tactics during the first spate of raids. The group continues to support families of people detained and deported by creating GoFundMes, coordinating legal representation and providing staples like diapers and food.

“I’m proud to be able to put that forward and let my kids know that I’m out there working with the community,” Tobes said. “And that they are safe, their friends are safe, and we’re going to do everything we can to help them.”",https://mirrorball.themarshallproject.org/G4nAcc2_vHHho7aZSCi_-7i-TVKGam7WkLOAU3703GE/w:1200/aHR0cHM6Ly9kMm0x/OXBtdnRzNWJvYi5j/bG91ZGZyb250Lm5l/dC82ajZ1Mm44eXM2/ZDJ3YmV6Z2oxMW11/NmZmcDF2LzI1MTIx/OF9BUF9BR3JheV9N/SURXQVktTlVNQkVS/Uy5qcGc,N,,2025-12-18 11:58:14.469484

Most were state or federal prisons, though some had been ICE detention centers.
In Texas this year, the private prison company CoreCivic reopened a shuttered ICE detention center in Dilley.
During COVID, prisoners there held hunger strikes, alleging inadequate food and medical care, and a vindictive use of solitary confinement.
It is a longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters ICE custody,"" the spokesperson added.","There are empty prison buildings all over the country. They shut down for a variety of reasons: staffing issues, allegations of abuse, even simply that there are fewer people in prison today than a few decades ago. Some prisons have sat vacant for years.

But the Trump administration is now holding more than 65,000 people in immigration detention — the highest level in history, and that has created huge demand for these properties.

""There's definitely been this pattern over the last nine months of the Trump administration looking to shuttered state prisons, shuttered former federal prisons as a way to quickly expand ICE detention,"" says Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at the Detention Watch Network, a non-profit seeking to end immigration detention.

She says this trend isn't new, but President Trump's immigration crackdown has accelerated the pace. That worries Ghandehari: Many of these prisons faced allegations of poor conditions while they were open, and they're reopening at a time when the government has cut oversight measures.

""A lot of them have a long history of really deplorable conditions. And a lot of times, they shut down only to reopen and detain a different population. It's just this continual cycle and conditions never get better,"" Ghandehari added.

NPR identified at least 16 shuttered facilities across a dozen states that have reopened as Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers since President Trump took office in January. Most were state or federal prisons, though some had been ICE detention centers. Almost all the properties were owned or operated by private prison companies, and many had a troubled past.

In Texas this year, the private prison company CoreCivic reopened a shuttered ICE detention center in Dilley. In 2017, immigrants there reported poor conditions, such as a lack of clean water and inadequate medical care. In 2024, the facility closed. Today, a lawsuit alleges much of the same.

""Our facilities are subject to multiple layers of oversight and are monitored very closely by our government partners to ensure full compliance with policies and procedures, including any applicable detention standards,"" Brian Todd, a spokesperson for CoreCivic, told NPR in a statement.

In Georgia this year, ICE reopened the Irwin County Detention Center in Ocilla. That facility, previously an ICE detention center managed by the private prison company LaSalle Corrections, had closed in 2021 amid allegations of medical abuse against the women held there, according to a bipartisan Senate investigation.

And in Michigan, the North Lake Processing Center in Baldwin, owned by the private prison company GEO Group, has closed and reopened several times over the last few decades.

In the late nineties, North Lake was a juvenile detention facility. The University of Michigan documented allegations of understaffing, medical neglect and abuse during that time.

Later, it became a federal prison. During COVID, prisoners there held hunger strikes, alleging inadequate food and medical care, and a vindictive use of solitary confinement.

It closed in 2022 after the Biden administration banned privately-owned prisons in the federal system. But this past June, North Lake opened again — this time, as an ICE facility.

""There are all these echoes of past injustices and so much of what we're hearing right now from people held there is exactly the same,"" says JR Martin, a member of the advocacy group No Detention Centers in Michigan.

Jose Contreras Cervantes was detained at North Lake this fall. He was arrested during a traffic stop on suspicion of being in the U.S. without authorization. Contreras Cervantes has a wife and three young children, and he also has Leukemia.

He says he told officials he was taking oral chemotherapy pills. But for nearly a month, he says he did not receive them, according to a lawsuit filed by the ACLU of Michigan. When the chemotherapy pills did start coming, they were inconsistent, and sometimes he wouldn't receive his nausea pills, so he would vomit up the chemo regimen. He worried his cancer would spread.

""Every minute, every second that went by felt like a ticking clock to me,"" Contreras Cervantes told NPR in Spanish.

A spokesperson for GEO Group told NPR in a statement that they act in compliance with federal detention standards and that their services are monitored by the federal government.

""We are proud of the role our company has played for 40 years to support the law enforcement mission of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,"" the spokesperson said. ""The support services GEO provides include around-the-clock access to medical care, in-person and virtual legal and family visitation, general and legal library access, translation services, dietician-approved meals, religious and specialty diets, recreational amenities, and opportunities to practice their religious beliefs.""

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, told NPR that any claims of poor conditions at North Lake are false, and that all detainees have access to medical care.

""At no time during ICE detention is an alien denied emergent care. It is a longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters ICE custody,"" the spokesperson added. ""This is the best healthcare that many aliens have received in their entire lives.""

Yet the allegations made by Contreras Cervantes do not surprise Eunice Cho, senior counsel at the ACLU's National Prison Project, especially because in March, DHS made sweeping cuts to the divisions that oversee conditions in ICE facilities.

""Immigration detention has always been a dangerous place. It has been an abusive place across administrations,"" Cho says. ""What we are seeing is the clear degradation of accountability measures over conditions of confinement in detention facilities.""

The vast majority of people in ICE custody are in facilities run by for-profit companies, and Cho says that can create an incentive to cut corners.

""There is always a profit motive involved in trying to fill the facility with people. And the people who are profiting are the private prison companies,"" she says.

During the first nine months of this year, GEO Group reported a total revenue of nearly $2 billion – about 5% more than the same period last year.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5464x3074+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F92%2Ff5%2Fd1e7f9324031b69e9ad7b014729c%2Fgettyimages-2223938108.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 11:58:18.462759

At a Dec. 17 Business Meeting, Binghamton's City Council unanimously passed resolution R25-73, officially banning all city agencies from collaborating with federal immigration efforts, including with ICE. The legislation was introduced by Councilmember Rebecca Rathmell at a Dec. 15 press conference.

In September, Binghamton Mayor Jared Kraham expressed his concern following potential ICE activity in the Binghamton area, stating any actions taken by ICE were done without the involvement or prior notification of the Binghamton Police Department.

According to Deputy Mayor Megan Heiman, Kraham’s stance on the issue has not changed since September.

“Mayor Kraham’s position on ICE operations under the Trump administration has not changed. Binghamton won’t waste its police resources on civil immigration matters, and rather will focus efforts on making our neighborhoods safer,” said Heiman. “The Binghamton Police Department already has a strong policy on the books to that effect.”

Binghamton City Council passes anti-ICE legislation

At a Dec. 15 City Council Work Session, City Council members voted to expedite voting on the legislation to Dec. 17, just two days after it was introduced.

On Dec. 17, City Council members voted 6-0, with Councilmember Michael Dundon absent, to pass the legislation. According to Councilmember Robert Cavanaugh, speed in approving the legislation was paramount not only to protect Binghamton residents but the city itself from potential liabilities or legal trouble.

According to Rathmell, the law has seen an outpouring of support from leaders both local and outside of Binghamton.

""This legislation was drafted in accordance with guidance issued by the New York State Attorney General's Office,"" said Rathmell. ""It's been reviewed, edited and signed off by the city's operational corporation council, and I think it is also valuable to point out that it was announced with the full support of the American Civic Association, the NAACP, the Binghamton Human Rights Commission, multiple county legislators, multiple faith leaders and at least three human rights organizations that are boots on the ground working with immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers, folks that are directly affected by the risks.""

At the Dec. 17 meeting, several residents spoke or wrote statements in support of the legislation. The Dec. 15 press conference was attended by leaders of faith groups and civic associations including Hussein Adams, Executive Director and CEO of the American Civic Association.

""City resources should never be used to support unlawful raids and illegal police tactics that place irreparable damages and burdens on the city, destroys trust, jeopardizes public safety, affects refugee and immigrant population, affects new Americans who are frontline workers and affects every single resident of the city,"" said Adams.

Broome County agreement drew previous criticism

In March, the Broome County Jail signed an agreement with ICE as part of the 287g program. The program allows corrections officers to perform ""specified immigration officer functions,"" including executing administrative warrants within the jail.

At the Dec. 15 press conference, Rathmell referenced Sheriff Fred Akshar's decision to participate in the program, calling it a ""unilateral decision"" that has eroded trust in law enforcement.

One amendment to the legislation was made before it was voted on, with councilmembers unanimously voting to add the word ""emergency"" to section three of the legislation.

""City employees shall not expend time, money, or resources to assist or cooperate with any ICE investigation, operation, or enforcement action, except as required by law.

The National Council of Provinces (NCOP), in its final sitting of 2025 today, passed the Immigration Amendment Bill. This crucial piece of legislation aligns the country's immigration detention procedures with Constitutional Court rulings.

The Bill amends the Immigration Act of 2002 to address two specific Constitutional Court judgments. One amendment requires that any illegal foreign national detained for deportation purposes must be brought before a court in person within 48 hours of arrest. The court must then determine whether further detention is in the interests of justice before authorising deportation.

This amendment provides critical judicial oversight and provides clear guidance to immigration officers and the courts when exercising detention powers. With this Bill, a balance is struck between government's need to manage immigration effectively and the need to protect the rights of persons. This fosters a more just and transparent administrative system.

The passage of this Bill has significant implications for the administration of justice and the operations of the Department of Home Affairs. Among these are upholding constitutional rights as the Bill ensures that the fundamental right to freedom and security of the person is protected and mandates prompt judicial review of any immigration-related detention. The Bill also provides a clear, legally sound framework for immigration officials to reduce legal ambiguity and the potential for litigation. In this regard, the amendments are in the interest of justice. The Bill also improves oversight by requiring a court to authorise extensions to detention, thereby strengthening the rule of law and oversight within the immigration system.

The NCOP's Select Committee on Security and Justice processed the Bill, which included an extensive public participation process from 3 to 24 October 2025. By passing the Immigration Amendment Bill, Parliament has reaffirmed its commitment to ensuring that laws comply with the highest standards of constitutional democracy.

His mother’s absence has left an immeasurable gap in their family, Harman Singh said.
His parents watched as people around them — friends, cousins, neighbors — were disappeared and later found dead, Harman Singh said.
“That was hard enough, just knowing that he’s gonna be battling cancer, but Mom was by his side,” Harman Singh said.","Babblejit “Bubbly” Kaur and her husband, Amarjit Singh, celebrated their 41st wedding anniversary in Long Beach in late November. The pair cradled a mint-frosted cake in their hands and beamed as their daughter, Joti, snapped pictures.

The couple endured a lot in those years, more than 30 of which have been spent in the U.S., after they fled religious persecution in India.

They arrived in 1994 with three young children and little money, facing a daunting asylum process. But the couple found their niche, operating a beloved Indian restaurant for decades, and saw their children through college.

This year had already been tough for the family. Singh was diagnosed with cancer and Kaur was laid off from her cashier job at Rite Aid, where she’d worked for decades, after the company closed in October. But the biggest hurdle for the family would come only days after the couple’s anniversary, on Dec. 1, when Kaur was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement during a routine fingerprinting appointment and eventually taken to the Adelanto ICE Processing Center.

Joti Kaur, the couple’s youngest daughter, collapsed at work when she heard the news.

“I tell her, ‘Anytime you’re thinking of me, I was already thinking of you,” she said from the patio of her Long Beach apartment. “You’re literally the only thing I can think about, and getting you out of there.”

Kaur had an approved green card, but the government had not yet released it, said Harman Singh, her eldest son. The family’s lawyer filed a habeas corpus complaint early last week requesting the court review the legality of Kaur’s detention.

Kaur and her husband operated a restaurant, Natraj Cuisine of India, for decades and became familiar and beloved faces in the coastal city. When she wasn’t working at Rite Aid, she’d be greeting customers at Natraj, alongside her husband, who also took charge in the kitchen as needed. Community members came out in droves to support the family, setting up a GoFundMe that has garnered over $26,000 and a Change.org petition with over 1,600 signatures.

Within days of her arrest, a popular Long Beach food group on Facebook had posted the news and caught the attention of Congressman Robert Garcia, who represents the state’s 42nd Congressional District, including Long Beach.

Garcia has filed a petition to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that processes immigration applications, requesting the expedited release of Kaur’s green card given the urgency of her husband’s care. His office has also sent requests to ICE and the Adelanto ICE Processing Center for her release.

The congressman said Kaur’s detainment is one of many cases across the country where “we’re encouraging people to do things the right way and to show up to appointments, and then we’re detaining them at appointments that we invited them to.”

“The Long Beach community is outraged about this,” he said. “It’s absolutely crazy and inhumane. It’s no way to treat people.”

Kaur’s arrest was carried out by FBI agents, Laura Eimiller, the agency’s media coordinator confirmed to The Times, as “part of our ongoing assistance to ICE relative to immigration enforcement.”

One of the main tactics of the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration in recent months has been detaining people at appointments during their asylum or visa proceedings and, in some cases, deporting them.

His mother’s absence has left an immeasurable gap in their family, Harman Singh said. They’ve had to pick up where she left off, handling bills and navigating their father’s cancer treatment. In a way, he said, it felt like mourning a loved one’s death, only “they’re physically still here in the world, you just can’t reach out to them.”

“This vacuum, this gap, it’s all over America,” Harman Singh said. “This is not just our story.”

Kaur and Singh had been joined at the hip since they wed in 1984, the same year violence against Sikhs, their religious community, erupted in India. India’s Punjab state was a Sikh kingdom before the British took over, and the community had long been fighting for a separate Sikh state in the region.

In 1984, tensions came to a head when a siege, ordered by Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on the holiest site in Sikhism, turned deadly. In retaliation, two Sikh bodyguards assassinated her. Hindu mobs then went on a rampage, killing thousands of Sikhs, in what the California Legislature has labeled a genocide.

Large swaths of the Sikh community began to flee India. His parents watched as people around them — friends, cousins, neighbors — were disappeared and later found dead, Harman Singh said.

They left for the U.S. a decade later. Now, their son said, they’re facing persecution similar to that from which their parents fled all those years ago.

“This was supposed to be the place where you have freedom to live without fear … but it’s sort of turning into that nightmare again,” Harman Singh said. “We’re just repeating what our parents ran away from.”

Today, the Sikh diaspora, who have mostly settled in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom, are still targeted. Canadian-Indian relations were strained after the murder of Sikh leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar on Canadian soil in 2023. The Canadian government alleges India’s government was behind the slaying, claims New Delhi has denied.

In August 2024, a truck transporting a Sikh political leader came under fire in Sacramento. In 2023, U.S. officials announced they had foiled an assassination attempt connected to the Indian government against a Sikh activist.

Natraj Cuisine of India on 2nd Street in Belmont Shore, Long Beach, was like a fourth child to Kaur and Singh.

Singh first worked as a waiter at the old Laguna Beach location before transferring to Long Beach. Eventually, they became the face of the restaurant, often working more than 12-hour days. The couple managed the restaurant’s daily operations until their departure in 2020.

“The best way to describe my mom, she will feed everybody in this room and the neighbors before she feeds herself,” Joti Kaur said. “That was their love language, feeding us, the community, and anyone they could.”

Kaur worked at Natraj whenever she wasn’t picking up a shift at Rite Aid and would head to the restaurant during her lunch breaks.

The couple left the restaurant just weeks before COVID-19 hit in 2020. They recently became involved in another restaurant, Royal Indian Curry House, which is still in development.

“They were looking forward to help doing that and getting back into serving meals, because that’s what they love to do,” Joti Kaur said.

Singh depends on his wife for nearly everything, their children said. She took the lead in getting the family settled in the U.S., learning English, getting a driver’s license and even figuring out how to hook up Harman Singh’s PlayStation.

When Singh was diagnosed with cancer, his wife once again took charge. The family looked to her whenever a crucial decision needed to be made.

The day of her appointment, she felt something was wrong.

“She called me that morning and she was anxious,” Joti Kaur said. “I wish I would’ve stayed on the phone with her a little bit longer. She already knew something wasn’t right.”

Harman Singh, who now lives in Sacramento, was also on edge, having seen the countless cases of immigrants detained at government-set appointments.

Fingerprinting appointments had become common practice for the family, who have been tangled in a web of asylum proceedings since they landed at a New York airport in 1994. The two oldest children, including Harman Singh, have since become naturalized citizens. Joti Kaur and her dad have green cards. The only one left waiting was Kaur.

The government already had Kaur’s fingerprints on file, which is why the family was puzzled when they received notice of this appointment.

“You have a hearing coming up and it’s like, if they don’t go, they’re in trouble. If they go, they’re in trouble,” Harman Singh said. “They set it up in such a way that they’re going to get the result they want.”

Now, for the first time in decades, Kaur and Singh have been forced to sleep in separate beds,their children said, and neither gets much sleep at all.

“That was hard enough, just knowing that he’s gonna be battling cancer, but Mom was by his side,” Harman Singh said. “Now there’s just a sense of loneliness that they both have. We are helpless, and we can’t do anything to fix that.”

The lights in the Adelanto ICE Processing Center never turn off, which is enough to keep most awake. It’s the noises, often cries from newly arrived detainees, however, that keep Kaur up, often well past 2 in the morning.

She’s lucky if she gets a couple of hours of sleep a night, her children said.

The guilt creeps into both children at all hours of the day. Joti Kaur often feels it late at night, when she’s curled up under the covers of her bed and is suddenly reminded of how cold her mom must be. Her brother feels it every time he puts on a jacket or turns on the hot water in the shower.

Every family dinner Joti Kaur missed or phone calls she cut short when her mother was still home add to the guilt.

“I wish I could take it back and go to those dinners and have spent that time, because now, I don’t know when the next dinner is going to be with her,” she said.

A light amid the worry, however, is the community that her mother has built at the detention center. She’s met women of all ages and from all walks of life, one as old as 85.

When Harman Singh arrived at Adelanto to visit his mom for the first time in early December, he heard the women inside erupt in cheers. The noise felt jarring in such a cold facility.

But it’s what the women do for one another every time one of them gets bonded out, his mother told him.

“There’s just a sense of camaraderie. They’re like, ‘We’re in this together,’ which I’m very grateful for,” Harman Singh said. “She has girls to talk to. She goes, ‘If they weren’t there, I would just be in depression right now.’”

His mother has connected with two Indian women. The trio often pray together, and ration whatever milk they get that day to make tea. One is younger, and has started calling Kaur mama.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/99c7a4e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1536x806+0+621/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4e%2F9d%2F69f2956d40d2a243a9b016083f41%2Fme-babbeljit-kaur-detained-ice09.JPEG,N,,2025-12-18 11:58:21.424915

U.S. CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC OPERATIONS

The U.S. military yesterday killed four people in a strike on a boat accused of smuggling drugs in the eastern Pacific, U.S. Southern Command said on social media. The attack brought the total number of known boat strikes to 26, with at least 99 people killed, according to numbers announced by the Trump administration. AP News reports.

“We’re not going to be letting anybody going through who shouldn’t be going through,” President Trump told reporters yesterday when asked about his blockade against oil tankers travelling to or from Venezuela. “You remember they took all of our energy rights. They took all of our oil not that long ago. And we want it back. They took it — they illegally took it.” David Klepper and Aamer Madhani report for AP News.

Several ships sailed from Venezuela towards Asia with a Venezuelan naval escort between Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning, three sources said. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has ordered his navy to escort ships carrying petroleum products from port, risking a confrontation with the United States at sea. A U.S. official said Washington was aware of the naval escorts and was considering various courses of action. Edward Wong, Anatoly Kurmanaev, and Eric Schmitt report for the New York Times.

The U.S. House of Representatives yesterday voted 216-210 against a resolution that would remove U.S. armed forces from hostilities with “any presidentially designated terrorist organization in the Western Hemisphere” unless authorized by Congress. It also voted 213 to 211 against a resolution directing the president to ask Congress for authorization to use military force before engaging in hostilities within or against Venezuela. Both votes were almost exclusively along party lines. Patricia Zengerle reports for Reuters; Robert Jimison reports for the New York Times.

Rep. Mike Rogers (R-AL) said yesterday that the House Armed Services Committee has finished examining a U.S. military strike on Sept. 2, where two survivors were killed in a follow-up attack, after viewing the full video of the strike in a classified briefing led by Adm. Frank M. Bradley. Rogers said that the Pentagon had fully met his expectations for congressional oversight and that he was satisfied that the lawful process was followed. Robert Jimison reports for the New York Times.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR – INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

EU member states are set to decide today on 2026-2027 funding for Ukraine, with discussions centered on plans to use tens of billions of euros in frozen Russian assets to underwrite a loan. Hungary and Slovakia have voiced opposition to using frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine. Belgium, Bulgaria, Italy and Malta have expressed reservations and remain undecided. “We just can’t afford to fail. We have to show that we are strong,” EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaja Kallas said, adding that leaders would stay as long as needed at the Brussels summit to find a solution. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is now planning to participate in the summit in person, having previously said he would attend by video call. Lorne Cook, Sam McNeil, and Angela Charlton report for AP News; Jan Strupczewski and Andrew Gray report for Reuters.

Belgium today reiterated that its EU partners must provide ironclad guarantees that it will be protected from Russian retaliation before it would support the use of frozen Russian assets to back a loan for Ukraine. “I have not yet seen a text that could satisfactorily address Belgium’s concerns,” Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever said, “I hope to see one today.” Lorne Cook, Sam McNeil, and Angela Charlton report for AP News.

Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev is expected to visit Miami this weekend for talks with U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner on the current U.S. plan to end the war in Ukraine, a White House official and another source said. A Ukrainian delegation is also expected to arrive in Miami later this week for talks with Witkoff and Kushner. There is no plan for a trilateral meeting, the sources said. Barak Ravid reports for Axios.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

Israeli troops fired a mortar shell over the ceasefire line into a residential area in Gaza, wounding at least 10 people, health officials at Al-Ahli hospital said yesterday. The Israeli military said the mortar was fired during an operation on the Israeli-controlled side of the Yellow Line. The military did not say what the troops were doing or whether they had crossed the line, but said that the mortar had veered from its target. Julia Frankel reports for AP News.

The U.N. and more than 200 other aid groups yesterday warned in a joint statement that humanitarian operations in the Palestinian territories, particularly Gaza, are at risk of collapse if Israel does not lift restrictions that include a “vague, arbitrary, and highly politicized” registration process. Dozens of aid groups face de-registration by Dec. 31, which would mean they have to close operations entirely within 60 days, the statement said. Michelle Nichols reports for Reuters; UN News reports.

SUDANESE CIVIL WAR

Sudanese Rapid Support Forces paramilitary killed over 1,000 civilians in April during the takeover of the Zamzam camp, according to the U.N. Human Rights Office published today. The findings are based on interviews conducted in July 2025 with 155 survivors and witnesses who fled to Chad. Emma Farge reports for Reuters.

More than 1,600 people have been killed in attacks on medical and health care centers in Sudan so far this year, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said yesterday. Ghebreyesus said the agency has documented 65 attacks on health facilities since January. Samy Magdy report for AP News.

ISRAEL-HEZBOLLAH – CEASEFIRE

French, Saudi Arabian, and U.S. officials will hold talks with the head of the Lebanese Army in Paris today aimed at finalising a roadmap to enable the disarmament of Hezbollah, diplomats said. The talks plan to create more robust conditions to support the disarmament process and dissuade Israel from escalation, four diplomats told Reuters. The idea would be to reinforce the existing ceasefire mechanism with French, U.S. and possibly other military experts along with U.N. peacekeeping forces, the diplomats and officials said. John Irish and Jana Choukeir report.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Rwanda-backed M23 rebels yesterday claimed to have begun withdrawal from the city of Uvira in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, Betrand Bisimwa, leader of the M23, told AP News, adding that the withdrawal would be complete by this morning. When asked who would take control of the city following his forces withdrawal, Bisimwa said the responsibility fell to the mediators and that M23 had “requested a neutral force, and we believe that those who asked us to withdraw will be able to deploy them very quickly.”A spokesperson for the governor of South Kivu said he was unable to confirm the withdrawal late Wednesday night. Ruth Alonga and Wilson McMakin report for AP News

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday announced that he had approved an unprecedented $35 billion deal to sell natural gas to Egypt. Barak Ravid reports for Axios.

Brazil’s Senate yesterday voted 48-25 to approve a bill to shorten former President Jair Bolsonaro’s sentence from 27 years to just over two years. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has not said whether he will sign it into law or veto it. Maria Carolina Marcello reports for Reuters.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

The United States yesterday approved $11.1 billion in arms sales to Taiwan. The proposed arms sales cover eight items, including HIMARS rocket systems, howitzers, Javelin anti-tank missiles, Altius loitering munition drones and parts for other equipment, Taiwan’s defence ministry said in a statement. Ben Blanchard and Michael Martina report for Reuters.

The U.S. State Department yesterday demanded that Honduras’ National Electoral Council (CNE) immediately begin counting a manual count of ballots from last month’s presidential election. The NEC has blamed protests for preventing it from starting the manual count of hundreds of thousands of ballots that it said showed inconsistencies and were therefore excluded from the initial tally. “Any call to disrupt public order or the [CNE’s] work will be met with consequences,” the State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs said on social media. Laura Garcia reports for Reuters.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

The Trump administration has asked U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services field offices to “supply Office of Immigration Litigation with 100-200 denaturalization cases per month,” according to internal guidance issued on Tuesday and obtained by the New York Times. By comparison, between 2017 and this year, there have been just over 120 cases filed, according to the Justice Department. Hamed Aleaziz reports.

Guan Heng, a Chinese man who secretly filmed Uyghur detention camps in Western China and later applied for asylum in the United States in 2021, was detained by ICE in August. On Monday, the Trump administration moved to continue deportation proceedings, arguing that Guan should be sent to Uganda under third-country asylum rules. Emily Feng reports for NPR; Amy Qin and Chris Buckley report for the New York Times.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

The Senate yesterday voted 77-20 in support of the $901 billion National Defense Authorization Act. Connor O’Brien reports for POLITICO.

Former special counsel Jack Smith yesterday told lawmakers in a closed-door interview with the House Judiciary Committee that his team of investigators “developed proof beyond reasonable doubt” that Trump had criminally conspired to overturn the results of the 2020 election, according to documents obtained by AP News. Smith also said investigators had accrued “powerful evidence” that Trump broke the law by hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Eric Tucker and Lisa Mascaro report.

Sens. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Jacky Rosen (D-NV) this week put holds on the nomination of Adm. Kevin Lunday to lead the U.S. Coast Guard, citing concerns with a new workplace harassment policy that downgrades the definition of swastikas and nooses from hate symbols to “potentially divisive.” In a statement, Duckworth questioned why Lunday would not update the policy manual “to delete the absurd characterization that clearly states a noose and swastika are merely potentially divisive symbols,” adding that the admiral had previously affirmed that both “are symbols of hate.” Rosen said the hold will remain in place “until the Coast Guard provides answers.” Tara Copp, Marianne LeVine, and Michelle Boorstein report for the Washington Post.

The Navy disciplined 18 Navy SEALS earlier this year after military investigators found a group chat that contained racist memes targeting a Black SEAL who was also in the chat, according to documents and a Naval Special Warfare spokesperson. The punishments ranged from reduction in rank and forfeiture of pay to administrative measures, according to the Navy spokesperson. CBS News learned that Rear Adm. Milton Sands, then the head of Naval Special Warfare Command, acted swiftly once the allegations surfaced in March. Sands has since been removed from his position by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The reason for his removal is unknown. Eleanor Watson and James LaPorta report.

Ghislaine Maxwell yesterday asked a federal judge to set aside her December 2021 conviction, alleging that a series of constitutional violations had denied her a fair trial. Benjamin Weiser reports for the New York Times.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said yesterday that he plans to step down from the bureau in January. After Bongino’s announcement, FBI Director Kash Patel called him “the best partner I could’ve asked for in helping restore this FBI.” Ryan Lucas reports for NPR; Dareh Gregorian reports for NBC News.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

A federal appeals court yesterday ruled that National Guard troops stationed in Washington, D.C., since August could remain while the court considered the legality of the deployment. The three-judge panel wrote, “Because the District of Columbia is a federal district created by Congress, rather than a constitutionally sovereign entity like the 50 states, the defendants appear on this early record likely to prevail on the merits of their argument.” Zack Montague reports for the New York Times

A federal judge yesterday ruled that ICE cannot enforce newly adopted policies that require lawmakers to provide seven days notice before visiting detention facilities and entirely barring congressional visits to field offices being used to detain immigrants. Josh Gerstein and Kyle Cheney report for POLITICO.

Instead, migration has reached unprecedented levels, accompanied by rising human cost and suffering. Contrary to dominant political narratives, migration is rarely a simple choice; it is often a last means of survival for millions whose homes have been stripped away by war, poverty, repression, and the collapse of political systems. Yet today, more than ever, migrants are treated not as human beings but as a “security problem.”

From Afghanistan to Palestine, from Somalia to Sudan, the roots of migration lie in crises largely shaped by prolonged wars, foreign interventions, political instability, and economic collapse. Afghanistan, following the Taliban’s return to power, stands as a stark example of a country whose citizens have been forced into an impossible choice: remain under constant threat or flee toward an uncertain future. Women, journalists, civil society activists, and minorities have borne the greatest burden. For them, migration is not a pursuit of opportunity but an escape from systematic erasure.

The degrading treatment and forced deportation of Afghan migrants from Iran, Pakistan, Turkey, and other countries reflect a practical collapse of human rights commitments and the dominance of a security-driven approach to a profoundly humanitarian issue. Under this lens, Afghan migrants are no longer seen as victims of war, repression, and political breakdown, but as a vague, uniform threat — a narrative that deliberately ignores distinctions between women, children, workers, asylum seekers, and the sick. This “one-size-fits-all” policy has paved the way for humiliation, mass arrests, and rushed deportations, effectively hollowing out the fundamental principle of non-refoulement. These actions are less about enforcing the law and more about rising nationalism and governments attempting to manage domestic crises by sacrificing the most vulnerable.

At the same time, these deportations highlight the international community’s failure to assume responsibility for the Afghan crisis. Iran and Pakistan, under economic and political pressure, are bearing the cost of a crisis whose roots extend far beyond their borders. Yet the chosen response has been to shift suffering onto the weakest link. Forcibly returning Afghans to a country where security, basic freedoms, and a foreseeable future are absent amounts to knowingly placing human lives at risk. Such policies neither halt migration nor create stability; they normalize injustice and deepen the crisis.

In Palestine, migration takes a different but equally painful form. Blockade, repeated wars, and the destruction of infrastructure have condemned generations to permanent displacement — people deprived not only of the right to migrate safely but even of the right to remain with dignity. Gaza today is not merely a humanitarian catastrophe; it is a symbol of the global system’s failure to protect civilians, where migration itself is often not even a viable option.

In Somalia, decades of civil war, terrorism, and drought have made migration part of daily life. Those forced from their land fall prey to deadly human smuggling routes, becoming victims of networks that feed on despair. This pattern repeats across parts of Africa and the Middle East: the geography changes, but the suffering remains the same.

On the other side of this equation lie the migration policies of the United States and Europe — policies that have grown increasingly restrictive over the past two decades. By intensifying border controls, accelerating deportations, and narrowing legal pathways, the United States has made migration more dangerous, not less. Borders may be tighter, but migration has not stopped; only the number of victims has increased.

In Europe, border deals, walls, maritime patrols, and outsourcing responsibility to third countries have reshaped a continent once seen as a champion of human rights into one primarily focused on “crisis management.” The Mediterranean has become one of the deadliest migration routes in the world, claiming the lives of thousands of women, men, and children each year — lives largely absent from policy calculations.

What is most striking is the deep contradiction between human rights rhetoric and operational reality. Western governments speak of human dignity while blocking migrants at their borders. International refugee conventions remain formally valid, but political will to enforce them has eroded dramatically. Migration, rather than being understood as a consequence of global crises, has been reduced to a domestic threat.

The reality is clear: migration cannot be stopped by walls or suppressed by laws. As long as war continues in Afghanistan, occupation and blockade persist in Palestine, collapse endures in Somalia, and injustice spreads across the Global South, people will keep moving. Hardline policies may alter official statistics, but they do not change the human reality.

World Migration Day should remind us of a fundamental truth: migrants are neither numbers, burdens, nor threats. They are human beings carrying the weight of political failure, war, and injustice on their bodies. The migration crisis is not, at its core, a border crisis — it is a crisis of global conscience, one that remains unresolved because the world has yet to confront its root causes.

Among those rallying support for the bill has been Heather R. Yountz, senior immigration staff attorney with the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute.
As much as the bill would help immigrants authorized to work in the United States, it would also help employers, Yountz adds.
“There needs to be the ability to help our workers here in Massachusetts.” As countermeasures go, Lewis’ bill may be modest, Yountz acknowledges.
“Nothing is going to be a silver bullet in this time, but each step that we can take will make a difference in the lives of millions of immigrants,” Yountz says.","The proposal would add only one operative sentence to the state law governing the employment of “aliens,” G.L.c. 149, §19C.

But the 45 words in a bill on the move on Beacon Hill could make a world of difference for lawfully permanent residents authorized to work in the United States, says a longtime immigration litigator.

Under federal law, the Department of Homeland Security must provide employers with three days’ notice before arriving to inspect employees’ I-9 employment eligibility verification forms and supporting documentation.

Sen. Jason M. Lewis’ bill, S. 2665, would ensure that employees get the same three-day warning by requiring their employers to post a notice about an imminent inspection of I-9 records in a visible area. The bill was recently reported favorably out of the Joint Committee on Labor and Workforce Development.

Among those rallying support for the bill has been Heather R. Yountz, senior immigration staff attorney with the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute. Yountz has been litigating immigration matters for 17 years.

During the first Trump administration, Yountz and her former law partner, Susan B. Church, challenged the Muslim travel ban in federal court in Boston. They also brought a case seeking monetary damages for those who had been directly affected by the administration’s family separation policy.

Yountz joined MLRI in 2021, and while Joe Biden was in the White House, one of her focuses was advising Massachusetts Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey.

“But then, when Trump took office, it became clear that the Senate and the House and essentially the Supreme Court are all Republican-leaning, it didn’t make sense for me to be in the federal space anymore,” she says.

So, Yountz shifted her focus.

“The thought would be that I could use my way of trying to predict what Trump will do next in the litigation world and find state legislation that would protect as many immigrants as possible in Massachusetts — to try to get out ahead of it, basically,” Yountz says.

The weaponization of what had previously been a less consequential process quickly came to the fore, according to Yountz.

When employees start a new job, they fill out an I-9 form and provide certain forms of identification, such as a passport, Social Security card, driver’s license or, in the case of immigrants, a work authorization card.

Since the passage of the Immigration Reform and Control Act in 1986, the federal government has had the right to inspect I-9 forms.

“They don’t need a warrant to access it,” Yountz says. “All they need is to give three days’ notice to the employer.”

When previous administrations discovered technical or substantive violations, employers would typically get opportunities to cure those defects. But the Trump administration is taking a different approach.

“They’re collecting the data so that they can make an arrest of an immigrant in their home, in the workplace, on the streets, as we’ve all seen,” she says.

Because they are almost entirely within the authority of the federal government, raids are inevitable, according to Yountz.

“We can’t do anything about raids,” she says. “We can, however, do something about the information that the Trump administration is accessing before they can raid, or before they can make arrests.”

Lewis’ bill would simply ensure employees get the same notice their employers receive. Similar laws are already in place in California, Illinois and Oregon and have withstood legal challenges, Yountz says.

“The Trump administration sued California in 2018, lost, and they appealed it to the [9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals], lost again,” she says. “They recently sued the state of Illinois in 2025 and also lost.”

The administration’s main argument is that IRCA preempts states’ attempts to legislate in this area. But so far, that argument has not carried the day.

“I don’t want to say [the proposed Massachusetts law is] preemption proof, but that’s the thing that you worry about the most when you’re legislating in the state space on a federal issue like this,” Yountz says.

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid at the Allston Car Wash in early November that led to nine employees being detained illustrates how important the three days’ lead time can be, Yountz notes.

One detail that has emerged from the Allston raid is that some workers with documentation were allegedly not allowed to go to their lockers to retrieve it for ICE officers. With notice of an inspection, immigrants could ensure that they are carrying their documentation on their person, Yountz says.

Employees can also use those three days to talk to an attorney about what they need to demonstrate their status in the United States. The second Trump administration has slowed or even stopped the production of work authorization cards, Yountz says. That means that many immigrants, though still eligible to work, have expired cards.

“They sometimes have to print something off of the internet, out of the Federal Register, or demonstrate [their status] with a receipt or some other way,” Yountz says.

Immigrants can also use the time to develop answers to tough questions like, “Who’s going to take care of my kids if I get wrongfully arrested and thrown in a detention facility? Who’s going to access my bank accounts? Who’s going to hire an attorney for me to fight this unlawful detention?” she adds.

Even lawful immigrants are being forced to confront such questions, Yountz says.

“It’s this combination of the Trump administration accessing all of this data and using it for enforcement purposes, and at the same time, ICE officers acting with a high level of impunity and disregarding the lawful status of immigrants, or perhaps not understanding that an immigrant is indeed ‘in status,’ but the documentation might, on its face, not look that way,” she says.

As much as the bill would help immigrants authorized to work in the United States, it would also help employers, Yountz adds.

“The concern about losing your employees at a time where hiring is so difficult and restricted is terrifying,” she says. “A large percentage of businesses that are being targeted for these inspections are small businesses, and there’s a real concern about having to close their doors if they are not able to have even one cook in the kitchen, or one landscaper working that day.”

If S. 2665 becomes law, the state would provide a template for the notice employers would be required to post, making it straightforward for owners of small businesses who might not have the benefit of the services of an immigration attorney to understand what the law requires of them.

The transparency the notices would provide can also help smooth employer-employee relations at a fraught time, Yountz says.

“Employees don’t understand why their boss would give their private information over to the federal government this way,” she says. “But if the employer [says], ‘Look, we have to do this, the federal government is forcing us by law,’ that makes more sense to them.”

Yountz has been pleasantly surprised that the proposal — a late-filed, standalone bill in August — has gotten traction so quickly on Beacon Hill. It has no known opposition, and it has gained the endorsement of the Massachusetts Restaurant Association and the Massachusetts Bar Association’s House of Delegates, among other organizations.

“I’m so grateful to the Legislature for taking this seriously and recognizing that this is not your average, everyday bill,” she says. “This is something that we need now.”

For example, on Feb. 3, approximately 15,000 Haitian residents of Massachusetts are going to lose their temporary protected status, Yountz notes.

“We really need to be prepared for whatever enforcement action may result from that,” she says. “There needs to be the ability to help our workers here in Massachusetts.”

As countermeasures go, Lewis’ bill may be modest, Yountz acknowledges.

“Nothing is going to be a silver bullet in this time, but each step that we can take will make a difference in the lives of millions of immigrants,” Yountz says.",https://masslawyersweekly.com/files/2025/12/Heather-R.-Yountz.webp,N,,2025-12-18 10:58:05.978280
