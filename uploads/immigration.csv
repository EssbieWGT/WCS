Some of these cuts are to FEMA programs, and involve the elimination of jobs specifically focused on building climate resilience.
Others are to NOAA weather stations and climate change monitoring outposts, as well as cuts to the National Weather Service.
Since Trump’s inauguration in January, roughly one-third of FEMA’s staff have either been fired, resigned, or retired, leaving the agency desperately short-handed.
Agencies with only a handful of staff can’t generate the sort of response that a huge federal agency — with extensive pools of manpower, equipment, and expertise — can draw on.","Late last month, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) announced that it waspreparing to slash $1 billion from grants that it gives communities to prepare for disaster, even though the agency’s internal memos acknowledge that this will leave the U.S. more vulnerable to “catastrophic incidents.” The cuts will target everything from transport infrastructure to the much-touted Next Generation Warning System, which used local media to help communities issue alerts to residents in the face of extreme weather events.

In an era of multibillion-dollar climate disasters, Donald Trump’s administration is fixated on both denying the realities of climate change — and hence the need for government agencies to prepare for climate-related disasters — and on eviscerating the roles of key federal government agencies, including FEMA.

In 2023, FEMA’s budget was just shy of $30 billion. This year, it was more than $33 billion. But that increase in overall spending hasn’t protected certain parts of FEMA’s budget from significant cuts, particularly those that are aimed at protecting communities from the worst impacts of disasters. The agency has seen mitigation efforts it coordinates reduced by $25 million; port security grants have lost $40 million; education, training, and exercises have lost $100 million; and federal assistance programs have seen a whopping $700 million hit.

Unless Trump follows through on his stated plans to scrap the entire agency, the overall FEMA budget for next year will again grow to $36 billion if the administration’s current budget proposals are enacted. But FEMA’s fiscal year 2026 budget hides a vast redistribution of funds away from disaster preparation and response, especially around climate change and anti-homelessness efforts.

Showcasing the new priorities, in a truly obscene departure from FEMA’s traditional disaster-relief mission, the agency is offering up more than $600 million to states to help them build immigration jails. And, earlier this year, FEMA froze the distribution of more than $10 billion to help rebuild disaster-hit hospitals, community centers, and other organizations, in an effort to root out any agency or group that might in any way be aiding undocumented immigrants. It has also slow-walked the distribution of funds to help rebuild Los Angeles’s Altadena and Palisades areas following the historic fires, likely worsened by climate change, this past January. Moreover, FEMA has put a hold on dollars already allocated to the Emergency Food and Shelter Program spending, while, according to reporting by the American Prospect, preparing to divert dollars from its Shelter and Services program to reimburse Florida for costs associated with building the so-called “Alligator Alcatraz” concentration camp.

The latest cuts to federal grants come on top of a tranche of other reductions in spending on vital climate change-related areas — and in addition to ongoing Trump administration efforts to eliminate the agency. Some of these cuts are to FEMA programs, and involve the elimination of jobs specifically focused on building climate resilience. Others are to NOAA weather stations and climate change monitoring outposts, as well as cuts to the National Weather Service.

Since Trump’s inauguration in January, roughly one-third of FEMA’s staff have either been fired, resigned, or retired, leaving the agency desperately short-handed. At the same time, the federal government is raising the financial damage threshold for when to declare a disaster, and is limiting how much the feds will reimburse victims of these disasters. The Urban Institute has calculated that had these more restrictive criteria been in place between 2008 and 2024, 71 percent of disasters would not have qualified for federal relief, shifting more than $40 billion in disaster-response spending from the federal government onto the backs of already cash-strapped states and local governments.

None of this is accidental. The Trump administration appears to be operating on the assumption that if it just denies the realities of the climate crisis loudly enough, then magically, global warming will not occur. Witness the news that the Environmental Protection Agency is in the process of unraveling its own rules that allow it to regulate, and set limits on, the emissions of CO2, methane and the other gases that contribute to global warming. The result will be massively increased emissions (as much as 7.2 billion additional tons by 2055); an accelerated climate calamity; billions of dollars a year in health expenses related to global warming and dirtier air; and a federal government emergency response system that simply shrugs in the face of disaster.

Of course, not all disasters will be responded to equally. We are getting a glimpse of the desperately uneven and politicized disaster response future in the denial of FEMA assistance to communities in the western part of Maryland after heavy flooding in May. Maryland is Democrat-led (though the most-flooded counties voted for Trump in 2024). By contrast, West Virginia, which is heavily pro-Trump, quickly received assistance following flooding from a similar weather system a few weeks later. And Trump went out of his way to say GOP-dominated Texas would be taken care of following the deadly floods this summer, quickly signing a disaster declaration to allow federal dollars to flow to the state, even while he continued to threaten to deny disaster-response dollars to California because of its opposition to his immigration policies.

Yet in this era of stark cuts, even the reddest of states aren’t guaranteed that the feds will open the financial spigot. Communities in Arkansas, Kentucky, and North Carolina have also had their aid requests nixed in the wake of massive tornado, hurricane, and storm damage, with the feds arguing — in language reminiscent of the anti-welfare arguments long used by conservatives — that if FEMA is seen as being too lax on states, it encourages something of a dependency culture.

State and local officials are warning that they are struggling to hold the line. Agencies with only a handful of staff can’t generate the sort of response that a huge federal agency — with extensive pools of manpower, equipment, and expertise — can draw on. Anyone who has ever bought insurance can understand this concept: A large insurer has the resources to pay out claims allowing homeowners and communities to rebuild after a disaster that those individuals wouldn’t have if simply left to their own devices. Yet, under Trump, FEMA’s role of pooling resources in order to marshal large responses to disaster is being deliberately eviscerated by the ideologues now in charge of the federal government. As a result, many communities — especially those that are smaller and poorer (and, paradoxically, oftentimes more Republican) — will struggle more than would otherwise have been the case to recover from disasters.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2221173527-1200x800.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 15:57:28.984715

The report, published in Psychiatric News, was authored by mental health professionals in the UCR School of Medicine and outlines how detention, deportation and workplace raids are contributing to widespread emotional trauma among both immigrant and U.S.-born children.

“Psychiatry, as both a clinical discipline and a social institution, cannot remain on the periphery,” the authors wrote. “The current moment calls for a reexamination of how structural and intergenerational trauma are diagnosed, understood, and treated.”

The study details how children experience chronic anxiety, developmental disruptions and academic difficulties due to fear of family separation. Infants and toddlers may suffer attachment issues, while school-age children show signs of fear and anxiety, and adolescents often take on adult responsibilities, a phenomenon known as “parentification.”

“We are witnessing the effects of chronic fear, disrupted attachment, and intergenerational trauma on a massive scale,” said Dr. Lisa Fortuna, chair of psychiatry and neuroscience at UCR and lead psychiatrist on the report. “The threat or reality of separation from a caregiver fundamentally reshapes a child’s development and mental health.”

The report urges members of the media, policymakers and clinicians to confront the “human costs” of enforcement-driven immigration systems and to prioritize the emotional wellbeing of the youngest and most vulnerable.

“It’s hard to see how current enforcement can ever be humane,” said coauthor Dr. Kevin Gutierrez. “These practices create chronic stress and trauma in children and meet criteria for PTSD.”

The report also includes case studies and community data that researchers say illustrates how trauma transfers across generations, and is made worse by poverty, racism and the constant threat of enforcement.

The latest wave of immigration enforcement raids began earlier this summer and has continued despite ongoing legal challenges that have placed limits on some enforcement tactics.

Federal agents have conducted high-profile operations across Southern California, including one this week in Los Angeles that coincided with a speech by Gov. Gavin Newsom.

Since the surge began, at least two people have died during these immigration enforcement operations, including a farmworker in Camarillo who fell from a greenhouse in July, and a man struck by a vehicle after fleeing a Home Depot in Monrovia on Thursday.

The Los Angeles Unified School District celebrated the new school year earlier this week, but the joy was short-lived after a 15-year-old boy with disabilities was detained outside Arleta High School on Monday, according to District Superintendent Alberto Carvalho.

“This is the exact type of incident that traumatizes our communities; it cannot repeat itself,” Carvalho told reporters.",https://ktla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/08/AP25192726071193.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-16 15:57:34.135149

The stadium on South Mint Street is home to the Charlotte Knights Triple A minor league baseball team.

“This would have been our fourth anniversary, but the current immigration climate has created a challenging environment for large Latino events in our city,” organizers said in a statement.

“This decision was not made lightly,” Ashley Manzano, vice president of Charlotte-based Ultra Festivals Group, told The Charlotte Observer on Saturday. “But it comes in response to the current political climate surrounding immigration in the country.”

“We believe that the festival should be a time of unity and celebration,” Manzano said in an email. “However, given the sensitive and challenging environment, we feel it is in the best interest of our community to pause this year’s event.”

Friday, event organizers said their priority “is to ensure safety, great entertainment, and a full house for all who attend. We believe this is not the right moment to celebrate in such a large format, and we prefer to step back this year so we can return even stronger next year.”

“We look forward to hopefully resuming next year under more favorable circumstances,” Manzano said.

Organizers said they were “deeply grateful” for the community’s “support and love” over the years, “and we promise to make our 2026 festival one to remember.”

“Until then, we stand with our Latino community and look forward to celebrating together in the future.”

ICE has arrested people near a Charlotte school, the Mecklenburg County Courthouse and other locations this year, sparking fears and calls for law enforcement transparency as new state laws increase local-federal cooperation, the Observer reported.

If there is one company most associated with the immigration crackdown by the Trump administration, it's Home Depot. Its stores have been the location of dramatic federal raids targeting day laborers. But the company has largely been quiet. NPR's Alina Selyukh reports.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Welcome to the Home Depot. Please enjoy your shopping experience.

ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: Ray Hudson came to his local Home Depot in Los Angeles, preparing for a move.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Non-English language spoken).

SELYUKH: He picked up plastic crates, and usually, he would hire day laborers for help. They tend to gather nearby looking for work.

RAY HUDSON: See, and I could have used a couple of them.

SELYUKH: But they weren't there. Earlier that day, there was an immigration raid during which federal agents in tactical gear jumped out of a rental moving truck. Hudson heard it on the news.

HUDSON: It's just not right. They're not hurting nobody. They're not bothering nobody.

SELYUKH: Immigration officials have raided several Home Depot stores around Los Angeles and more around the country. This week, a man died as he ran from a raid by a Home Depot onto a freeway and was hit by a car. Home Depot did not comment on the death and has generally said little about the raids. A statement to NPR was the same it has issued time and again, that the company does not get notified, it's not involved, it has to follow federal and local rules, and its employees are instructed not to engage for their safety. This hands-off response has Chris Newman growing frustrated with Home Depot.

CHRIS NEWMAN: I sympathize with the fact that they are now ground zero for a big polarizing political and cultural issue.

SELYUKH: Newman advocates for day laborer rights as the legal director of the National Day Labor Organizing Network.

NEWMAN: However, I think that they have a responsibility and certainly a moral obligation to defend day laborers, who are both customers and service the stores where they seek work.

SELYUKH: Home Depot does not have a formal relationship with day laborers, but their history runs deep. As the chain grew to the biggest home improvement store by the 1990s, it set the stage for new demand for day laborers. Contracting crews used to compete for business on the cost of their supplies, but now everyone shops at Home Depot, and that makes the cost of labor a key way to get the edge over rivals. And there is a cheap, on-demand workforce right outside the store.

NEWMAN: Immigration laws change. Attitudes toward immigration change. But, you know, the law of supply and demand is immutable.

SELYUKH: About half of Home Depot's sales are to professional contractors who might need quick help with demolition, construction or cleanup. The other type of customer, Home Depot essentially created. It taught home owners to DIY and skip the contractor. And those shoppers now hire day laborers, too, for quick repairs or landscaping.

NEWMAN: In general, day laborers love Home Depot, and Home Depot's bottom line loves day laborers.

SELYUKH: Home Depot has said that day laborers are not part of its business model, and Wall Street analysts argue they're not a huge customer base and people who hire them would shop at Home Depot either way. Investors, so far, have shrugged off the rates.

JOE FELDMAN: I don't think that it's had any impact really on their sales.

SELYUKH: Joe Feldman is a financial analyst at Telsey Advisory Group.

FELDMAN: It's more of a perception. Is it a safe place to go shop?

SELYUKH: As Home Depot stays quiet, critics have zeroed in on the company's perceived politics. Two of its three founders have supported President Trump, except they have not run Home Depot for about 20 years. One of them died last year. The company donates to both political parties.

Back at the same Home Depot in Los Angeles a few hours after a raid, shopper Margarita Ochoa is noticing a change.

MARGARITA OCHOA: This parking lot is always full. So right now there is, like, so many spaces.

SELYUKH: Ochoa runs a housekeeping business and usually sends her employee to stock up on cleaning supplies and liquids for her pressure washer. But today, she's here herself for the first time in a while.

OCHOA: Because they afraid to come. They afraid to be here, so they didn't want to come today.

SELYUKH: Ochoa says, she hopes Home Depot would say more against the raids and do more, maybe protect people who run inside by closing the doors to immigration agents. She says she is thinking of taking her business elsewhere. But for now, this Home Depot is still the most convenient, and it's been her store for 33 years. Alina Selyukh, NPR News.

The arrest occurred near the elementary school while the father was waiting to pick up his child, minutes before students were dismissed from their classrooms. The child’s mother was informed about the arrest and was able to pick them up from school, district officials said.

The Department of Homeland Security confirmed the name of the man arrested is Juan Jose Martinez Cortes, a Mexican national without legal status.

In an emailed statement Tricia McLaughlin, assistant DHS secretary for public affairs, told KPBS Martinez was ""fraudulently using an American’s social security number.""

""Officers approached Martinez after he pulled over in a parking lot. On August 14, ICE arrested Martinez and placed him in removal proceedings,"" she said. “Allegations that ICE targeted Linda Vista Elementary School are false. (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) was never on school grounds.""

On Friday, district officials held a press conference to address the incident.

“Let me be clear: Our schools and our neighborhoods that surround them should be off limits to enforcement actions like this,” said SDUSD Superintendent Fabiola Bagula. “These are spaces for safety, for growth, for belonging, for joy. And there may be a lot of debates about immigration reform, but there should be no debate that this kind of tactic is inhumane.”

San Diego Unified Trustee Sabrina Bazzo said Linda Vista Elementary experienced a decline in attendance Friday as a result of the arrest.

In a letter sent to parents, the district said it’s working “to ensure the impacted family has the resources they need during this difficult time.”

This is the second time in two weeks ICE has conducted a targeted detainment outside an elementary school. Last week, a mother was arrested at Camarena Elementary in Chula Vista for allegedly overstaying her visa; her children were in the car at the time.

It’s Noah Goldberg, with assists from Julia Wick, Seema Mehta and David Zahniser, giving you the latest on city and county government.

Days after the Trump administration’s mass immigration raids came to Los Angeles, City Councilmember Ysabel Jurado started looking for money to help the city’s undocumented residents.

In a June 10 motion, she asked City Administrative Officer Matt Szabo to detail options for finding at least $1 million for RepresentLA, which provides legal services for undocumented Angelenos facing deportation.

A week later, an official from Szabo’s office said they were “unable to identify eligible funding sources” for the $1 million, which would come on top of $1 million the city has already allocated to RepresentLA.

This summer in L.A., an immigration crisis is colliding with a budget crisis, leaving some councilmembers frustrated that the city cannot do more, as federal agents whisk thousands of immigrants away to detention centers and potential deportation.

The city has been active in court, joining an ACLU lawsuit that temporarily blocked federal agents from using racial profiling to carry out indiscriminate immigration arrests. Mayor Karen Bass also announced a program to provide immigrants with gift cards, funded by private philanthropy, when many were afraid to go to work.

But coming up with another $1 million for immigrant legal defense, after city officials closed a nearly $1-billion deficit through cuts and slated layoffs, has proved a slog.

“Why is it that we can’t find the money for this?” asked Councilmember Hugo Soto-Martínez during a Civil Rights, Equity, Immigration, Aging and Disability Committee meeting on Aug. 1. “It appears that level of urgency is not being transmitted through this report, because when we’re in other situations, we find the money.”

Jurado piggybacked off her colleague.

“This is an immigration legal crisis,” she said, adding that she felt “disappointment, frustration and, frankly, anger with the outcome here that we can’t find a single dollar to support immigrant communities and this legal defense fund.”

“I find it really hard to believe that the CAO couldn’t find any money for it,” she said in an interview.

RepresentLA, which is a public-private partnership with the county, the city, the California Community Foundation and the Weingart Foundation, has seen a surge in demand for legal services since the immigration raids began in June, said Jorge-Mario Cabrera, a spokesperson for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, or CHIRLA, which manages RepresentLA.

“The need is higher than the needs being met,” Cabrera said.

The city has contributed funding for RepresentLA since its inception in 2021 — initially $2 million each fiscal year before dropping to $1 million in 2024-2025 and $1 million this year out of a total budget of $6.5 million, with the other $5.5 million coming from L.A. County.

RepresentLA, which has served nearly 10,000 people, provides free legal representation for undocumented immigrants facing removal proceedings, as well as other services such as help with asylum applications. Some attorneys are on staff, while others are outside counsel.

In April, Bass said in her State of the City speech that the city would “protect every Angeleno, no matter where you are from, no matter when you arrived in L.A ... because we know how much immigrants contribute to our city in so many ways. We will always stand strong with you.”

But behind the scenes, the city’s financial struggles put even the initial $1 million for RepresentLA in jeopardy, with the mayor proposing to slash it to zero for this fiscal year.

“Getting the initial $1 million back was quite a battle,” said Angelica Salas, CHIRLA’s executive director. “It had been zeroed out. We were able to get just the money enough to continue the program for those who are currently in the program.”

The City Council managed to claw back the $1 million during budget negotiations by slowing down hiring at the LAPD, as well as “ending duplicative spending,” said Naomi Villagomez-Roochnik, a spokesperson for Councilmember Eunisses Hernandez, who sits on the budget committee. (The mayor and Council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson have since said they are looking for money to reverse the hiring slowdown.)

“It’s a crumb when you compare it to the rest of the city budget,” Hernandez said.

RepresentLA has 23 attorneys working on deportation hearings, and Salas said each represents about 35 clients at any given time. An additional $1 million “would allow us to expand our capacity for the new people — the thousands of people who have now been picked up in this new sweep,” she said.

At the committee hearing earlier this month, Councilmember Monica Rodriguez said the City Council should find savings in other areas to help pay for important programs like RepresentLA.

“Next time the city attorney comes asking us for outside counsel money, you could say ‘No’ and redirect those resources. ... When the mayor comes for Inside Safe, for additional discretionary money that she is unaccountable for, you could say, ‘No, we’re taking $1 million and putting it for RepresentLA,’” she said. “Let’s effing go.”

The committee called on the city administrative officer’s staff to research options for funding RepresentLA, including grants or reallocating money from elsewhere.

Szabo confirmed to The Times that things will be different at the next committee meeting.

“Our next report will provide options to fund RepresentLA at the level requested,” he said in a text message.

State of play

BALLOT ROYALE: Labor unions and business groups have been locked in a heated battle of ballot measures for the last three months, after the City Council hiked the minimum wage for hotel and airport workers. Each side is trying to get measures on the ballot that would have far-reaching effects, including one that would put the minimum wage increase to a citywide vote. Unite Here Local 11, which represents hotel and restaurant workers, has proposed four ballot measures that, according to critics, would wreak havoc on the city’s economy. Business leaders, in turn, have filed a ballot petition to repeal the city’s $800-million business tax — a move denounced by city officials, who say it would gut funding for police and other essential services.

— SAGE ADVICE: The Jurado staffer who was arrested during an anti-ICE demonstration in June gave a heads-up to her boss that she planned to take part, according to text messages obtained by The Times through a public records request.

“Going to the protest at [City Hall] fyi,” Luz Aguilar wrote to Chief of Staff Lauren Hodgins.

Hodgins responded with words of caution.

“To reiterate what we spoke about a few mins ago, if you choose to take part in any community action, please ensure that you approach the event with peace and care for those around you and stay safe,” Hodgins wrote. “This is not a city-sanctioned activity and you are participating on your own accord so want to ensure your safety along with the safety of those around you.”

Aguilar did not text back. She was later arrested at the demonstration and ultimately charged with resisting arrest after allegedly assaulting a police officer.

— BACK TO COURT: Prosecutors filed two new corruption charges against City Councilmember Curren Price this week. The charges were connected to two votes he cast on funding for the city housing authority and the L.A. County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, both of which were paying Price’s wife, Del Richardson. Price’s attorney called the new charges “nothing more than an attempt to pile on to a weak case.”

Sources told The Times this week that prosecutors tried to get Richardson to testify in front of a grand jury as part of Price’s case. She did not ultimately do so.

— IT’S FUN TO STAY AT THE YMCA: Bass, L.A. County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath and City Councilmember Traci Park were all in the Palisades Thursday morning at a ceremony where Horvath pledged $10 million from her discretionary funds toward rebuilding the Palisades-Malibu YMCA.

— GIFT ECONOMY: Our public records request for all the gifts Bass received in the last year and a half came back, with the list largely composed of ceremonial gift exchanges with her foreign counterparts (chopsticks and a teacup from the mayor of Sejong, South Korea, estimated cost $32; a scarf and a hat from Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, estimated cost $45).

There were a few interesting tidbits: Bass received flowers (~$72) from race and gender scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw, who coined the term intersectionality. There were also fancy Dodgers tickets and food (~$590, but marked as “paid down”) from her longtime lawyers at Kaufman Legal Group, along with flights and travel for two speaking engagements.

— NOT RULING IT OUT: When Bass appeared on the podcast “Lovett or Leave It,” host Jon Lovett gave her a “crazy pitch”: What if the city of Los Angeles broke off from the county, forming its own city-county? Bass said it “wasn’t that crazy” and asked (jokingly) whether Lovett would be taking on the messy ballot initiative … before reverting back to her standard line on the need for intergovernmental cooperation. Bass also told Lovett that the city is still looking at ways to carve out an exemption to Measure ULA taxes for Palisades fire survivors selling their lots. And, she said, the city is in the process of hiring its long-promised film liaison “as we speak.”

— HOT SEAT: Gov. Gavin Newsom and Democratic lawmakers launched a special election campaign on Thursday, urging California voters to approve new congressional districts to shrink the state’s Republican delegation, as Texas Republicans fight to redraw their own maps to favor the GOP. If the plan moves forward through the many hoops ahead, another district could be created in southeast Los Angeles County, which would undoubtedly kickstart frantic maneuvering ahead of 2026. (L.A. County Supervisor Hilda Solis’ name is already getting thrown around as a potential candidate, though her office didn’t respond to a half-dozen queries.)

— DON’T ASK, DON’T TELL: City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto came out swinging against SB 79, state Sen. Scott Wiener’s latest housing density bill, back in May. Now, both proponents and opponents are clamoring to know whether Bass will take a position on the controversial bill. The Times has been asking too, but so far the mayor and her team have not responded to questions.

QUICK HITS

Where is Inside Safe? The mayor’s signature homelessness program did not carry out any new operations this week. Her Shine LA initiative, which aims to clean up city streets and sidewalks, will be back Aug. 21.

On the docket for next week: The Charter Reform Commission will meet at City Hall twice — yes, twice — to discuss planning and infrastructure on Monday and “government structure” on Friday.

When he was taken into custody Friday morning, immigration agents tied his dog to a tree and then unclipped his collar, allowing the animal to run loose on Sepulveda Boulevard, according to the GoFundMe page.
In April, immigration agents attempted to enter two elementary schools seeking information about several students but were turned away by administrators.
On Monday, federal agents reportedly drew their guns on and handcuffed a 15-year-old boy with disabilities outside Arleta High School.
“When children witness peers, parents, or other individuals detained, the image is not easily erased,” Carvalho said in a statement Monday.","Benjamin Marcelo Guerrero-Cruz was walking his family’s dog in Van Nuys on a recent morning when he was taken into custody by federal immigration officials, according to authorities and published reports.

Guerrero-Cruz, who turned 18 this month, was set to start his senior year at Reseda Charter High School on Thursday, according to a GoFundMe page set up to support his family and legal fees. Instead, he’s being held in Department of Homeland Security custody pending removal from the United States, the agency confirmed in statement to The Times on Friday.

“Benjamin Guerrero-Cruz, an illegal alien from Chile, overstayed his visa by more than two years, abusing the Visa Waiver Program under which he entered the United States, which required him to depart the United States on March 15, 2023,” the statement read.

The department did not immediately respond to an email from The Times for further comment.

When he was taken into custody Friday morning, immigration agents tied his dog to a tree and then unclipped his collar, allowing the animal to run loose on Sepulveda Boulevard, according to the GoFundMe page.

“He is more than just a student — he is a devoted son, a caring brother, a loyal friend, and a valued member of our community. He carries a tremendous amount of responsibility at home, helping care for his five-month-old twin brothers and his six-year-old brother. He is a good student, with a kind heart, who has always stepped up for his family,” according to the GoFundMe page.

Los Angeles Unified School District Supt. Alberto Carvalho said during a news conference Thursday that he spoke to the boy’s mother, who described the dismal conditions her son is facing in custody. She said her son was in a small holding area filled with 40 men, most much older than her son.

“He is 18 years old, but he’s a kid. He has not been exposed to anything in his life,” Carvalho said, recounting his discussion with Guerrero-Cruz’s mother. “He drinks water once a day. The food is insufficient. Mom said that there was not enough room for everybody to sit or lie down at the same time.”

During their conversation, Carvalho said, she “was having difficulty holding back tears. She was crying with every word that came out of her mouth.”

A friend of Guerrero-Cruz’s, identified as Ronny C., said in a statement that the young man’s soccer team was devastated by his sudden disappearance.

“On the field, he was rock-solid—always showed up, worked hard, and could be counted on week after week. Off the field, he was just as reliable: kind, respectful, and someone who lifted up the people around him. He brought consistency, heart, and a quiet strength that made the team better in every way,” Ronny C. said.

Guerrero-Cruz’s arrest comes amid already heightened fears among Los Angeles students and parents over whether they might be targeted by immigration officials while traveling to or from school.

A person with knowledge of Guerrero-Cruz’s situation who declined to be named for fear of reprisal confirmed that he attended the high school in Reseda for his junior year. The person added that teachers are working to “make sure all students feel safe” despite the ongoing raids.

Agents have already focused enforcement efforts at LAUSD schools at least twice since the Trump administration launched raids targeting undocumented immigrants this year.

In April, immigration agents attempted to enter two elementary schools seeking information about several students but were turned away by administrators.

On Monday, federal agents reportedly drew their guns on and handcuffed a 15-year-old boy with disabilities outside Arleta High School. Federal officials said they were looking to apprehend a suspected MS-13 gang member and instead took the person’s cousin by mistake. The teen was ultimately released.

Carvalho has called for limits on immigration enforcement near schools, saying it impedes student learning.

“When children witness peers, parents, or other individuals detained, the image is not easily erased,” Carvalho said in a statement Monday. “These moments imprint on young minds, distracting them from academic lessons and replacing intellectual curiosity with worry.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/25c04dc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1338x702+0+280/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F53%2Ff3%2F33eb1a374f63927dfd87a6685a96%2Fme-benjamin-guerrero-cruz-taken-by-ice-01.JPG,N,,2025-08-16 14:56:44.264223

U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles issued her ruling a week after holding a hearing with the federal government and legal advocates representing immigrant children in custody.

Gee called last week's hearing “déjà vu” after reminding the court of the federal government's attempt to terminate the Flores Settlement Agreement in 2019 under the first Trump administration. She repeated the sentiment in Friday's order.

“There is nothing new under the sun regarding the facts or the law. The Court therefore could deny Defendants’ motion on that basis alone,"" Gee wrote, referring to the government's appeal to a law they believed kept the court from enforcing the agreement.

In the most recent attempt, the government argued they made substantial changes since the agreement was formalized in 1997, creating standards and policies governing the custody of immigrant children that conform to legislation and the agreement.

Gee acknowledged that the government made some improved conditions of confinement, but wrote, “These improvements are direct evidence that the FSA is serving its intended purpose, but to suggest that the agreement should be abandoned because some progress has been made is nonsensical.”

Attorneys representing the federal government told the court the agreement gets in the way of their efforts to expand detention space for families, even though Trump’s tax and spending bill provided billions to build new immigration facilities.

Tiberius Davis, one of the government attorneys, said the bill gives the government authority to hold families in detention indefinitely. “But currently under the Flores Settlement Agreement, that’s essentially void,” he said last week.

The Flores agreement, named for a teenage plaintiff, was the result of over a decade of litigation between attorneys representing the rights of migrant children and the U.S. government over widespread allegations of mistreatment in the 1980s.

The agreement set standards for how licensed shelters must provide food, water, adult supervision, emergency medical services, toilets, sinks, temperature control and ventilation. It also limited how long U.S. Customs and Border Protection could detain child immigrants to 72 hours. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services then takes custody of the children.

The Biden administration successfully pushed to partially end the agreement last year. Gee ruled that special court supervision may end when HHS takes custody, but she carved out exceptions for certain types of facilities for children with more acute needs.

In arguing against the Trump administration’s effort to completely end the agreement, advocates said the government was holding children beyond the time limits. In May, CBP held 46 children for over a week, including six children held for over two weeks and four children held 19 days, according to data revealed in a court filing. In March and April, CPB reported that it had 213 children in custody for more than 72 hours. That included 14 children, including toddlers, who were held for over 20 days in April.

The federal government is looking to expand its immigration detention space, including by building more centers like one in Florida dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” where a lawsuit alleges detainees’ constitutional rights are being violated.

Gee still has not ruled on the request by legal advocates for the immigrant children to expand independent monitoring of the treatment of children held in U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities. Currently, the agreement allows for third-party inspections at facilities in the El Paso and Rio Grande Valley regions, but plaintiffs submitted evidence showing long detention times at border facilities that violate the agreement's terms.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/immigrantchildrenpolicyAP25228073183977,N,,2025-08-16 13:57:37.656986

“Competition is the cornerstone of a thriving economy.
We will continue to champion legislation and policy that breaks up monopolies, protects people and small businesses from abuse, and makes markets work for everyone.”","August 15, 2025 – The Monopoly Busters Caucus Chairs, U.S. Representatives Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Chris Deluzio (PA-17), Pat Ryan (NY-18), and Angie Craig (MN-02), released the following statement strongly condemning President Trump for revoking the Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy, which had established a whole-of-government federal policy to address the harmful effects of market concentration across various sectors.

“We strongly condemn the decision to revoke the executive order on competition, a move that green lights more consolidation and signals to corporate America that they can continue padding their pockets at the expense of working people without fear of government intervention. This action proves that ‘make America competitive again’ was just a hollow slogan. President Trump can’t claim to care about competition while systematically dismantling the very tools designed to prevent concentration of power and monopolies in the hands of the very few largest players.

“The executive order made competition a national priority and gave agencies the mandate they needed to challenge corporate gatekeepers in every corner of the economy, from Big Tech’s control over our data to hospital mergers that inflate healthcare costs. It was a commitment to use the power of the government to fight for the people who are tired of paying more for prescriptions, getting hit with surprise airline junk fees, having their right to repair a simple tractor or smartphone stripped away, or trying to run a small business that competes on an uneven playing field.

“By gutting this policy, the administration is actively choosing to return to a status quo where the biggest corporations dictate the terms of our lives. The consequences of this decision will be felt when small businesses close and as people spend more, get less, and earn less – all so that billionaires can have more.

Monrovia City Manager Dylan Feik said the man was fleeing an Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid at the Home Depot on Thursday morning. Witnesses said they saw him run across the store’s parking lot and onto the eastbound 210 Freeway, where he was struck by an SUV and killed.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not respond to a request for more information from Nexstar’s KTLA. But a representative told the Los Angeles Times that the man was not being pursued by their agents when he ran onto the freeway.

Protesters at Thursday’s event, however, believed the man’s death was a direct result of ICE raids like the one in Monrovia.

“I was heartbroken,” said Selene Lockerbie, who attended Thursday’s protest. “I feel like Monrovia was violated … to know that a man lost his life today just trying to work. Just trying to take care of himself and his family.”

Karen Suarez, another demonstrator, said she consoled the victim’s daughter at the scene.

“I just went up to her and said, ‘I’m really sorry about your dad.’ She was so shaken up,” Suarez told KTLA’s Sandra Mitchell.

Immigrant advocates say 13 people were detained by federal agents during Thursday’s raid. Several were also injured, according to Pablo Alvarado from the National Day Laborer Union.

Read on... for details on the ruling.

A federal judge in Los Angeles denied a motion from the Trump administration Friday to throw out a decades-old settlement that outlines protections for immigrant children in federal detention.

In her ruling, U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee said the federal government had not shown that Homeland Security regulations satisfy the agreement's requirements, including that minors be released quickly and that family detention centers be properly licensed.

She also said the government failed to ""identify any new facts or law"" since she rejected an effort to end the agreement in 2019.

The White House did not immediately respond to LAist's request for comment.

Gee heard arguments from the federal government and immigrant advocates in a hearing last week. Lawyers representing immigrant children said minors were being held in U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities for extended periods of time and asked the judge to appoint an independent monitor.

The hearing centered on the Flores Settlement Agreement, a 1997 consent decree that outlines minimum standards for conditions for children in immigration custody. It broadly requires the government to quickly move minors out of immigration detention and into facilities licensed to care for children.

Last year, Gee ended part of that agreement for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees care for unaccompanied immigrant children in the U.S., with some exceptions. But the requirements of Flores are still in place for Homeland Security facilities like Border Patrol.

It's those requirements that the government was seeking to end, arguing that the executive branch needed more flexibility and citing recent legislation like the ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" which includes billions of dollars for new detention facilities including for families.

""We're raising this early in an administration that ran on immigration issues,"" Justice Department attorney Tiberius Davis told the judge last week.

Multiple immigrant rights groups represented the Flores plaintiffs in court. Sergio Perez, executive director for the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, told LAist the government's attempt was ridiculous.

"" It's an absurd and political move that reflects this administration's seemingly insatiable disdain for the checks and balances,"" he said.

The judge also heard a second motion from immigrant advocacy organizations alleging that the government is violating the Flores agreement by keeping children in ""prison-like"" conditions for extended periods of time.

"" Nobody's supposed to be held in Border Patrol facilities for more than 72 hours,"" Diane de Gramont is an attorney with National Center for Youth Law told LAist. ""But kids had been held for over a week, even two weeks, three weeks. And there have been children held for over a month in a holding cell with no access to daylight or recreation, and infrequent access to even showers.""

The judge has not yet ruled on that motion, but she expressed concern about holding times at Border Patrol facilities at last week's hearing.

The origins of the Flores agreement protections are in Los Angeles in the 1980s. Lawyers brought the federal government to court over the treatment of a 15 year-old girl from El Salvador in federal custody in a Pasadena hotel.

The arrest happened around 3 p.m. outside a church just steps away from Linda Vista Elementary School, where parents were gathering to pick up their children. Witnesses said the man had been waiting to collect his child when ICE agents, with their faces covered, approached his vehicle.

“They were like hitting the car and telling the guy, ‘get out of the car,’ and he was like, ‘why? why?’” said Michelle, a bystander who recorded the arrest and asked not to be identified for safety reasons. She said she watched in horror as the man was handcuffed and taken away.

San Diego Unified Superintendent Fabiola Bagula condemned the timing and location of the arrest, saying it left families and staff shaken.

“It left children, families, staff with questions and fears that no one, especially our youngest learners, should have to carry,” Bagula said during a press conference. “A child did not get picked up from school by their parent. This is traumatic. There’s a reason why those people are wearing masks — because they know it’s wrong to do.”

Bagula emphasized that ICE agents are not allowed to enter campuses without a warrant and called on federal officials to avoid enforcement near schools.

“Our schools and the neighborhoods that surround them should be off limits to enforcement actions like this,” she said. “There may be a lot of debates about immigration reform, but there should be no debate that this kind of tactic is inhumane.”

Cody Petterson, president of the San Diego Unified school board, echoed those concerns.

“When you show up and cut out from work early to pick up your kids to make sure they are safe, you should not be abducted as you are waiting for your child to come out of school,” he said. “It doesn’t matter where you are on the political spectrum — no one thinks that’s a good thing.”

Thursday’s arrest comes one week after a similar incident outside Camarena Elementary School in Chula Vista, where ICE agents detained a parent who had previously been ordered deported.

School officials said the Linda Vista student whose father was detained was later picked up safely by their mother.

Ester Soliman was deported to the Philippines on Friday after living in Lancaster for 25 years, her family said.

Her family said they received a call from their mother from the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City, just before Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials were putting her on a plane.

“We are heartbroken and reeling, and we want her home more than we can communicate,” the family said in an update on its fundraising page to pay for an immigration attorney. “Please keep our entire family in your prayers as we determine our next steps.”

ICE arrested Soliman on Aug. 4 when she reported to a meeting under the Alternatives to Detention program at the agency’s York office.

Soliman’s family never received notification from ICE that their mother was being deported, according to Damon Myers, a friend who has been acting as their spokesperson. Instead, the husband of a fellow detainee at the Clinton County Correctional Facility called Ester Soliman’s son, Sam, to say his mother had been moved. Sam and Soliman’s other two adult children, Sandra and Sanjee, remain in Lancaster.

As of 1 p.m. Friday, Soliman was still shown in ICE’s online detainee locator, but the correctional facility had been removed. Once people are deported, they are removed from the system entirely. Efforts to reach Soliman’s attorney on Friday were not immediately successful.

When ICE returned Soliman’s phone in the airport, she called her children, according to Myers. In another statement to the fundraising page, the family called the situation “a nightmare.”

ICE was not immediately available for a comment or to confirm the deportation but had previously released a statement on Soliman’s case.

""She legally entered the U.S. on a B-2 tourist visa that allowed her to remain in the U.S. until March 4, 2000,” Tricia McLaughlin, the head of the Department of Homeland Security’s public communications, said Monday. “Over 25 years later, she is still illegally in the U.S. A judge issued her a final order of removal in 2011, and her appeal was denied.”

According to state court records, Soliman has two traffic tickets on record and no other incidents. A Manheim Township police officer issued Soliman citations on July 28, 2025, for improper safety restraints for a child under four years and for driving without a license. She was allowed to leave the scene after the citations when someone came to pick her up, according to Manheim Township Police Department spokesperson Sgt. Barry Waltz, Jr.

Soliman came to the U.S. with her husband, Albert S. Soliman, who died in 2015, according to a death notice published in LNP. Soliman never went back to the Philippines, according to Myers. Soliman still has family there, who have been notified and who plan to be at the airport when she lands. Her full name, as used by ICE, is Estrelita Soliman-Ramos.

Earlier Friday, the family posted an update to the fundraising page that the government denied a legal motion, called a “stay of removal,” meant to postpone deportation.

In that post, they called for help from the public to amplify Soliman’s case by calling elected officials in the hopes of keeping her in-country.

The advocacy and affinity group Lancaster Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders released a statement Friday evening calling Soliman “a cherished mother and friend” and said her deportation was a worst-case scenario.

“We are overwhelmed with grief and fury that our beloved Ester is not with her family in Lancaster, a place she has called home for 25 years,” Cindy Lam, president of Lancaster AAPI, said. “We are holding the entire Soliman family in our hearts right now as we process and mourn this new tragic reality.”

Over the last week, the family raised $88,431 through a crowdsourced fundraising tool called GoFundMe, an outpouring of support that surpassed their original goal of $35,000.

Attorney General Pam Bondi on Thursday sought to install an “emergency police commissioner” to approve any new Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) policies, while also demanding the department aid in federal immigration arrests.

It has led the administration in the span of a week to lose the cooperative tone struck Monday, when Bondi claimed she had a “productive meeting” with D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) and said the two would “work closely” together.

City officials have had their own evolution, from the controlled disappointment initially conveyed by Bowser when she said she would “work every day to make sure it’s not a complete disaster” to the city’s attorney general launching a suit challenging the police takeover.

The week ended with the fight landing in the courtroom of U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, who at a hastily scheduled hearing raised concerns about portions of Bondi’s new order but urged the two sides to work together. After convening privately for nearly two hours, the administration agreed to walk back the new commissioner appointment and instead make him a liaison.

“I am very happy that it looks like hopefully this can get figured out without a judge having to do anything, because I think these are the kind of issues that should be decided between the district and the government,” Reyes said.

Despite the détente, it’s likely not the end of the legal battle. Reyes said she’ll hold additional proceedings next week, and the city made clear it stands ready to renew its emergency legal effort if it isn’t satisfied. The judge even gave out her clerk’s cellphone number so the parties could reach out if any issues come up over the weekend.

“My sincere hope is that we don’t have to be back fighting over this issue again,” D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb (D) said at a press conference at the close of the hearing.

The move to court is a shift from when Bowser initially shrugged off a legal challenge at her Monday press conference after Trump moved to take over MPD. When asked about the possibility, Bowser noted that once Trump declares an emergency, the Home Rule Act “authorizes the president to make those requests and it says the mayor shall comply with those requests.”

But city leaders’ tune quickly changed following Bondi’s order Thursday that installed Drug Enforcement Agency Administrator Terry Cole to effectively command the force.

Bondi also rescinded an hours-old D.C. order directing more MPD cooperation on immigration in favor of something stronger – likewise lifting policies that barred officers from conducting immigration arrests for individuals who have no other criminal arrest warrant and to not inquire about someone’s immigration status for the sole purpose of “enforcing civil immigration laws.”

“In my nearly three decades in law enforcement, I have never seen a single government action that would cause a greater threat to law and order than this dangerous directive,” MPD Chief Pamela Smith wrote in a sworn court filing.

Bowser said that she was caught off-guard by the late Thursday order.

“We were surprised,” Bowser said after the close of the court hearing, noting that Bondi had called their earlier meeting productive.

“And without notice, we got the order.”

But in court, Justice Department attorney Yaakov Roth suggested it was the city that was responsible for any breakdown in cooperation.

“We want it to work. We’re not looking to create delay and confusion,” Roth said.

The tensions come as the administration’s efforts in the capital ramp up, with 800 National Guard troops now having been mobilized to the city alongside a surge of federal law enforcement agents and city police.

They’ve been conducting checkpoints across the city along with other actions, with arrests nearing 200.

City and federal leaders are also at odds over the purpose of the policing activities.

Of the 33 arrests on Thursday, nearly half, 15, were of non-U.S. citizens.

And of the 135 arrests this week broken down by Bondi, 75 were listed as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests.

Federal officials have also stressed the seizure of illegally purchased weapons, something that Bowser indicated was a priority for her after decades of D.C. efforts to limit handguns, including in a ban that was struck down by the Supreme Court.

“We know that we have to get illegal guns off of our streets, and if we have this influx of enhanced presence, we know that it’s going to make our city even better,” Smith said earlier this week as she discussed how the city would be “working side by side with our federal partners.”

But immigration seems to be another matter, one where the city has traditionally sought to keep its officers outside of enforcement, though they may be compelled under the order.

D.C. officials on Thursday directed MPD officers to be even more cooperative with federal officials, allowing the sharing of citizenship information for those pulled over for traffic stops and also allowed local officers to provide transportation for detained subjects.

But under existing city policy, it still prohibited to use databases for the sole purpose of checking someone’s immigration status and for arresting people for civil immigration violations when they had no other outstanding criminal warrant.

It was that latest order, as well as the existing policies, that were targeted late Thursday by Bondi as she installed Cole, igniting the suit challenging the federal takeover.

The city asserts that Bondi went beyond the Home Rule Act’s emergency authorities, which only require D.C. to provide the president with MPD’s “services.” While that provision may mean Trump can ask for officers and resources, the city says it does not allow the administration to upend MPD’s command structure or upend D.C.’s immigration laws.

That suit said the shoving aside of D.C.’s protocols for officers when it comes to immigration matters failed to take into account the “considered judgment of MPD leaders who are deeply familiar with the District’s law enforcement and public safety needs.”

But even Schwalb’s office on Friday acknowledged the city may ultimately not have the power to resist demands to help with federal operations.

“Look we know that the law under the Home Rule Act allows the federal government, during a course of an emergency, to request the services of MPD in furtherance of a federal purpose. And whether it’s clearing [homeless] encampments that are adjacent to or near federal land or that might interfere with federal employees, if it’s enforcement of immigration laws…we will have to confront that as it comes,” he said.

“We have made very clear that we have laws in our city and that the services that MPD provides in furtherance of a request from the President, those services must comply with the law.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/washington_federal_enforcement_081425gn07_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-16 11:58:06.663027

The ACLU said HHS issued the directive last month, restricting access to 13 programs that had previously been open to everyone. Under a reinterpretation of the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), which allowed noncitizens to access federal public benefits, HHS now considers an expanded list of services as limited to U.S. citizens.

Programs at stake include Head Start, which provides early childhood education to low-income families, and community health clinics that offer primary care to underserved areas. Other restricted services include mental health and substance use disorder support programs, family planning, and homeless assistance projects—all of which were previously open regardless of immigration status, according to the ACLU.

Since the late 1990s, federal administrations from both parties have taken a narrower view of PRWORA, with the Clinton administration allowing undocumented immigrants to access such services on the grounds that they were not “federal public benefits.” The HHS directive reverses that approach.

“The directive conflicts with PRWORA and upends longstanding guidance respected by four prior administrations,” the ACLU said. The group warned that HHS’s reinterpretation ignores decades of administrative precedent.

Backing the directive, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said, “For too long, the government has diverted hardworking Americans’ tax dollars to incentivize illegal immigration.” Kennedy added that the directive “enforces the rule of law.”

“This arbitrary and harmful directive exemplifies this administration’s tunnel vision, which prioritizes its anti-immigrant crusade, no matter the harm,” said Ming-Qi Chu, deputy director of the ACLU Women’s Rights Project.

Chu said the directive could strip medical and educational access from millions of children, immigrants with disabilities and individuals recovering from substance use disorder, as well as survivors of gender-based violence. “It serves no one’s interest to deny people these essential services, and HHS must withdraw this incredibly misguided directive,” Chu said.

The ACLU also warned that the directive fails to consider the toll on immigrant families who rely on these programs for health, education and basic stability.

“The directive has triggered chaos and uncertainty both for administering agencies and the individuals, families and communities who rely on the services at stake,” the ACLU’s filing said. “It will deprive children of access to crucial early educational programming and undermine access to essential and life-saving health care for children and their families. It will also disproportionately burden mixed-status families, people with disabilities and survivors of gender-based violence.”

Public health experts have highlighted the health and economic risks of the policy under a second Trump administration. The Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) has reported that immigrants, including those without legal status, contribute billions in taxes each year and play a crucial role in the health care sector. KFF warned that restricting access could harm public health and economic stability nationwide.

The foundation also noted that many immigrant families may already avoid seeking health care due to fear and confusion. The Trump administration’s “public charge” policy likely decreased coverage for millions of noncitizens under Medicaid or CHIP, as families feared assistance would jeopardize residency.

Those fears may now be worsened by the HHS directive, deepening health disparities and limiting critical services for immigrant communities.

The 30-day public comment period on the policy closed this week, and the revised directive is set to take effect immediately upon publication in the Federal Register, according to HHS.

Advocates including the ACLU continue to demand its withdrawal, warning that implementation will disrupt access to essential health care, education and social services for millions.

This mirrors the Nazi recruitment strategy: draw from those already trained to execute state directives.
The current ICE recruitment drive is not a historical aberration.","In the last month, ICE has launched a recruitment campaign of unusual scale and persistence. Reports document emails sent to county deputies in Florida, outreach to FEMA personnel, targeted solicitations to retired federal workers, and policy changes that expand the age range for applicants well past forty. The campaign is not framed as an emergency measure but as a permanent expansion, made possible by a $170 billion appropriation for immigration enforcement under the Trump administration. ICE’s leadership has portrayed this as necessary to fulfill the agency’s mission. Local law enforcement leaders, particularly in Florida, have voiced both irritation and unease, objecting to the federal government’s bypassing of their command structures and raising concerns about losing trained officers to ICE’s ranks.

The practical explanation is straightforward: ICE is attempting to rapidly scale up its workforce to meet the Trump administration’s stated political goal of removing an estimated 20 million Latino people from the United States. In 2024, Donald Trump described these individuals as “poisoning the blood” of the country. The recruitment model—its targets, its institutional framing, its bypassing of local intermediaries—mirrors patterns visible in the historical record of the Einsatzgruppen, the Nazi mobile killing units deployed in Eastern Europe during the Second World War. The comparison is not rhetorical excess. It is a study in method. The question is not whether ICE today is equivalent to the Einsatzgruppen. It is whether the logic of building a force for extraordinary enforcement has recurring features that should trigger historical alarm.

The Einsatzgruppen emerged from the SS security apparatus as Germany prepared for the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. According to Richard Rhodes in Masters of Death, they were formed from an existing pool of police officers, security agents, and civil servants. Recruitment was highly targeted. Men with experience in policing, intelligence, and military command were sought out for their capacity to operate under orders and within a rigid hierarchy. History makes clear that these were not simply volunteer fanatics. Many were approached through professional networks, offered postings that promised status and advancement, and placed within a structure that normalized their assignments as legitimate state work.

The current ICE recruitment drive is not a historical aberration. It is a recognizable pattern in the history of state enforcement agencies preparing for expansive and potentially coercive missions.

Stefan Kühl, in Ordinary Organizations, underscores that the Einsatzgruppen operated according to the routines of bureaucratic administration. Orders were written in formal language, couched in terms of security and order maintenance. Missions were framed as operational tasks rather than moral questions. Men were told they were combating “banditry” or “partisan activity,” categories that erased the civilian status of their victims. This was a central mechanism for recruiting and retaining participation: the transformation of killing into a technical job, embedded in the standard practices of an organization.

Zygmunt Bauman’s Modernity and the Holocaust identifies this as a hallmark of modern bureaucratic violence. The Holocaust was not an eruption of irrational savagery but the product of systems designed to translate political directives into manageable administrative processes. The Einsatzgruppen were a case study in how to assemble a killing force from ordinary professionals, train them to think in technical rather than moral terms, and deploy them with minimal overt coercion.

The contours of ICE’s recent recruitment push follow a comparable bureaucratic logic. The recruitment targets a pre-screened pool of law enforcement and security professionals. Florida deputies, FEMA personnel, and retired federal agents are not random job seekers. They are individuals whose careers have conditioned them to follow formal orders, work within hierarchical structures, and frame their actions in procedural rather than purely moral language. This mirrors the Nazi recruitment strategy: draw from those already trained to execute state directives.

ICE is actively lowering entry barriers. The policy change lifting the maximum age limit above forty broadens the eligible pool in a way that signals volume as the overriding goal. In Nazi recruitment, similar expansions occurred when the need for personnel outpaced the available pool, with the result that older men or those with less ideal physical profiles were nonetheless brought into field operations. ICE is also leveraging bureaucratic legitimacy. The agency’s recruitment messages describe “enforcement opportunities” and “critical response positions” in terms that emphasize lawful authority, federal mandate, and organizational purpose. This is the same language of legitimization that Kühl and Bauman document in the Einsatzgruppen’s framing: orders presented as components of a rational plan, embedded in established institutional structures.

The campaign shows a willingness to bypass local institutional intermediaries. Florida sheriffs’ complaints that ICE directly contacted their deputies without coordination recalls historical cases in which Nazi units were introduced into territories without consulting local military or police commanders. In both cases, central authority overrode local norms in pursuit of a larger strategic objective.

The deepest similarity lies in the bureaucratic ability to render extraordinary measures administratively ordinary. Bauman warns that this capacity is intrinsic to modern organizations. The division of labor fragments moral responsibility. Language reframes acts of violence as technical assignments. In the Einsatzgruppen, mass shootings of civilians were described as “executions” or “security operations,” terms that masked the nature of the task from the participant’s own conscience.

In ICE’s case, the recruitment pitch itself functions as this kind of framing device. Potential hires are told they will be part of “national security” and “public safety” operations. In the context of an administration that has already pursued mass deportations, family separations, and expanded detention, such language situates controversial or coercive actions within the acceptable vocabulary of law enforcement.

Franklin Mixon’s concept of the “entrepreneurial bureaucrat” sharpens this point. Bureaucracies, and the officials within them, seek opportunities to expand their remit. ICE’s leadership has seized on a political moment—backed by unprecedented funding—to expand its manpower. In historical terms, the Einsatzgruppen leadership did the same within the SS apparatus, enlarging their operational scope whenever political conditions permitted.

The United States is not operating under the same conditions as the Nazi Reich in 1941, but the present safeguards are functionally nonexistent. Judicial review now functions as a rubber stamp for the Trump administration, with courts repeatedly validating executive actions that stretch or disregard statutory limits. Congressional oversight is, in practice, nonexistent, with leadership unwilling to confront or even meaningfully question enforcement policy.

The United States is not operating under the same conditions as the Nazi Reich in 1941, but the present safeguards are functionally nonexistent.

National media outlets remain cautious to the point of self-censorship, their corporate owners fearing retaliatory measures against other business holdings. In this environment, the assumption that legal and institutional checks will restrain an expanded, specially recruited force is untenable. Political leadership can and does issue directives that push beyond the law’s original intent, and the mechanisms designed to resist such directives have already shown their willingness to accommodate them. When that reality is combined with a rapidly enlarging enforcement body trained to operate under centralized command, the potential for escalation is immediate and concrete.

The modern state’s capacity for violence is not determined by the moral character of its personnel but by the institutional and political boundaries within which it functions. Ordinary organizational processes can adapt to deliver extraordinary harm when circumstances shift. The Einsatzgruppen were assembled and deployed in exactly this way, with bureaucratic procedures serving as the mechanism rather than an afterthought.

The current ICE recruitment drive is not a historical aberration. It is a recognizable pattern in the history of state enforcement agencies preparing for expansive and potentially coercive missions. Its targeting of trained law enforcement personnel, lowering of entry barriers, bypassing of local intermediaries, and reliance on bureaucratic framing are all features visible in the assembly of past forces that went on to commit atrocities. To note this is not to equate the present with the past in outcome. It is to recognize the continuity in method, and to understand that method as a warning. The Einsatzgruppen remind us that the path from “ordinary” enforcement to extraordinary violence is often paved with administrative memos, recruitment drives, and appeals to professionalism. The time to interrogate such patterns is before the mission expands and the boundaries shift.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61468305&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C76%2C0%2C76,N,,2025-08-16 13:57:23.259753

Dayra, an Ecuadorian student at P.S. 89 The Jose Peralta School of Dreamers in Queens, and her mom were separated from her 19-year-old brother during an immigration check-in on Tuesday at 26 Federal Plaza, according to the family and their advocates. Her last name is being withheld as a minor.

“We were all very scared,” Patricio, Dayra’s mom’s boyfriend who lives with the family, said in Spanish. “Because we knew they were going to arrest them.”

Dayra and her mom, Martha, were shipped off to a detention center in Texas, advocates said. The U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement locator showed Martha as of Friday afternoon at South Texas Family Residential Center, one of the largest immigration facilities in the country. The center was reopened this year after the Biden administration shuttered it. (The locator does not provide information for detainees under 18.)

“She called me yesterday, she told me she was fine. But she is very afraid of returning to Ecuador,” Patricio said of Martha, who fled domestic violence in the country. An immigration judge had previously denied her asylum bid and ordered the family deported, according to court records, but they continued to report to their check-ins as required by law.

Dayra’s brother, Manuel, 19, was being held at 26 Federal Plaza, before being moved to a detention center in Newark, New Jersey, according to the locator. He recently graduated high school on Long Island and was supposed to start college this year, Patricio said.

The Department of Homeland Security, the agency that houses ICE, did not immediately comment.

“We are hearing extremely concerning reports about an immigrant family, including a 7-year-old local public school student and her 19-year-old brother, detained by ICE,” Councilman Shekar Krishnan (D-Queens) said in a statement. “My office is working actively to obtain all the details. We are in contact with the local school, DOE officials, and federal offices to learn more and fight to make sure the family can be reunited.”

“Family separation is horrific, and ICE must stop these cruel tactics.”

In the Elmhurst neighborhood of Queens, P.S. 89 hosts a Spanish dual-language program and is in the process of launching a similar program in Bengali, according to school data and social media. More than half of students are learning English as a new language.

“The abuses of the federal government and neglect from City Hall have created an environment of terror for families in the streets of New York,” said Naveed Hasan, an advocate for the city’s immigrant students. “7-year-old Dayra is among the youngest children taken by ICE, and if she’s not immediately released, our own government will illegally deprive her of her right to learn and thrive with her loving PS 89Q community.”

Dayra and Manuel are the latest in a slew of New York students to be swept up in President Trump’s deportation agenda, including two young men, Dylan and Mouctar, who attend the city’s alternative high schools for students behind on credits. On Thursday, local lawmakers and advocated rallied for their release ahead of the school year, which begins on Sept. 4.

The Patchogue-Medford School District, where advocates say Manuel attended high school, did not return a request for comment Friday.

Earlier this month, another parent was detained after a morning drop-off outside of an elementary school in Chula Vista.","SAN DIEGO (FOX 5/KUSI) — A father waiting to pick up his child from school in the Linda Vista neighborhood was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement this week, sparking outrage and inciting fear within the local community.

Officials from the San Diego Unified School District (SDUSD) publicly addressed the incident Friday morning, confirming that the situation unfolded around 3:10 p.m. the day before near Linda Vista Elementary School.

Though not technically on campus, SDUSD Superintendent Fabiola Bagula said the parent was detained about five minutes before the dismissal bell at a nearby location, with multiple families witnessing the encounter.

“I am told that the father who was detained was concerned about his child’s welfare and who was going to get them from school,” Bagula explained.

The Department of Homeland Security contacted the school’s principal, Dr. Miriam Atlas, after the parent was detained, according to the superintendent.

“She [Dr. Atlas] had the difficult responsibility of contacting the child’s mother to inform her of what happened,” said Bagula. “The mother was able to pick up the child from school.”

School officials emphasized that students at Linda Vista Elementary School are very young, just 3 to 11 years old. To that point Bagula added, “You can have your immigration reform without traumatizing children.”

The principal also explained that immigration status is not something that is discussed during school enrollment as California law mandates that all school-aged children residing in the state be enrolled in school, regardless of their citizenship or immigration status. Additionally, schools cannot inquire about documents related to a student’s or their family’s immigration status.

Bagula relayed the following message to the community:

“To our families and to every child, documented or not, every child had the legal right to attend public school in the United States. We will protect that right and we will do so together. As Americans and as neighbors and as democracy, we must demand more from our leaders. We must call for laws and policies that reflect both justice and humanity.”

The status of the Linda Vista Elementary School father who was detained and taken away by ICE is unknown.

This isn’t the first time a San Diego-area parent has been approached by ICE near a school. Earlier this month, another parent was detained after a morning drop-off outside of an elementary school in Chula Vista.

Sondra Cosgrove, a College of Southern Nevada political science professor and executive director of civic engagement for the nonprofit Vote Nevada, agreed.
If undocumented immigrants are not counted, the biggest impact to Nevada is how much federal aid the state gets, Damore said.
Experts said it was unclear what exactly Trump was calling for, whether it was changes to the 2030 census or a mid-decade census.
A census citizenship question In a 2019 decision, the Supreme Court effectively blocked Trump from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has instructed the Commerce Department to change the way the U.S. Census Bureau collects data, seeking to exclude immigrants who are in the United States illegally, he said last week.

The census' data collections will be based on ""modern day facts and figures and, importantly, using the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024,"" the Republican president said on his social media platform, an indication he might try to inject his politics into a head count that determines political power and how federal funding is distributed.

Trump stressed that as part of the changes people in ""our Country illegally"" will be excluded from census counts.

In Nevada, there were nearly 290,000 noncitizens and 2.7 million citizens, according to the 2020 census.

Excluding undocumented immigrants would have minimal impact on Nevada’s representation in the U.S. House of Representatives, said David Damore, a political science professor and executive director of Brookings Mountain West and the Lincy Institute. Nevada gained its fourth and newest congressional seat after the 2010 census.

“We are not positioned to get a new [House] seat and the likelihood of losing one is small given current [population] growth patterns,” Damore said in a statement.

He noted that Trump unsuccessfully tried to include a question on citizenship status in the 2020 Census and suggested this attempt was likely to be unsuccessful. Additionally, Damore noted, Trump’s presidential successor would have to carry out Trump’s plan.

Sondra Cosgrove, a College of Southern Nevada political science professor and executive director of civic engagement for the nonprofit Vote Nevada, agreed. She said the 14th Amendment clearly states “the whole number of persons in each state” shall be counted.

“[The amendment] does not say citizens, it does not say voters, it doesn't say men or women. It just says whole persons. And so the president is going to have the same problem if he tries to say to the Census Bureau, ‘Go out and only count people who are citizens,’” Cosgrove said in an interview.

What Cosgrove is worried about, however, is if Congress revokes or withholds funding from the Census Bureau to comply with Trump’s directives. That could be problematic right now as the bureau hires people and gears up for the 2030 census.

“Every state is basically going to be told we don't have enough money to accurately count the number of people in your state,” Cosgrove said in an interview. “So every state is probably going to have to then step up and backfill with enough money to make sure that the census happens.”

Cosgrove said that with other federal agency budget cuts, if Congress withholds funding for the census, Nevada will have to make difficult choices on which services the state can afford to provide.

If undocumented immigrants are not counted, the biggest impact to Nevada is how much federal aid the state gets, Damore said. Billions of dollars of federal aid are based on formulas that use census data to determine a state’s population.

Experts said it was unclear what exactly Trump was calling for, whether it was changes to the 2030 census or a mid-decade census. If it’s the latter, the question is whether it would be used for a mid-decade apportionment, which is the process of divvying up congressional seats among the states based on the population count.

A new census?

Any changes in the conduct of a national census, which is the biggest non-military undertaking by the federal government, would require alterations to the Census Act and approval from Congress, which has oversight, and there likely would be a fierce fight. While the Census Act permits a mid-decade census for things such as distributing federal funding, it can't be used for apportionment or redistricting and must be done in a year ending in 5, said Terri Ann Lowenthal, a former congressional staffer who consults on census issues.

""He cannot unilaterally order a new census. The census is governed by law, not to mention the Constitution,"" Lowenthal said. ""Logistically, it's a half-baked idea.""

It would be almost logistically impossible to carry out a mid-decade census in such a short period of time, New York Law School professor Jeffrey Wice said.

""This isn't something that you can do overnight,"" said Wice, a census and redistricting expert. ""To get all the pieces put together, it would be such a tremendous challenge, if not impossible.""

Trump's Truth Social post fits into an overall pattern in which he has tried to reshape basic measures of how U.S. society is faring to his liking, a process that ranges from monthly jobs figures to how congressional districts are drawn going into the 2026 midterm elections. But there could be legal challenges if he were to reshape the census, which also guides the distribution of $2.8 trillion in federal funds to the states for roads, health care and other programs.

A census citizenship question

In a 2019 decision, the Supreme Court effectively blocked Trump from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census. The 14th Amendment says that ""the whole number of persons in each state"" should be counted for the numbers used for apportionment, the process of allocating congressional seats and Electoral College votes among the states based on population.

The last time the census included a question about citizenship was in 1950, and the Census Bureau's own experts had predicted that millions of Hispanics and immigrants would go uncounted if the census asked everyone if he or she is an American citizen.

Changes to the census could also play into the efforts by Trump to urge several Republican-led states, including Texas, to redraw their congressional maps ahead of schedule in ways that would favor GOP candidates.

Redistricting efforts

Redistricting typically occurs once every 10 years following the census, as states adjust district boundaries based on population changes, often gaining or losing seats in the process.

Despite Texas having redrawn its maps just a few years ago, Trump is pressuring Republicans in the state to redistrict again, claiming they are ""entitled"" to five additional Republican seats. Texas Republicans have cited population growth as justification for redrawing the congressional map. The state currently has 38 House seats, 25 held by Republicans.

Trump's team is also engaged in similar redistricting discussions in other GOP-controlled states, including Missouri and Indiana.

Earlier this month, Trump fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer, after standard revisions to the monthly jobs report showed that employers added 258,000 fewer jobs than previously reported in May and June. The revisions suggested that hiring has severely weakened under Trump, undermining his claims of an economic boom.

The White House insists that the problem was the size of the revisions and that it wants accurate numbers. But outside experts disagreed with that assessment.

""Trump is basically destroying the federal statistical system,"" said Margo Anderson, a professor emerita at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee who has written extensively on the history of the census. ""He wants numbers that support his political accomplishments, such as he sees them.""

After the citizenship question was stopped by the Supreme Court in 2019, Trump made another effort in 2020, announcing a plan to exclude people living in the country illegally from the apportionment figures.

After states, cities and organizations sued, lower courts ruled the plan was illegal. By the time the Supreme Court weighed in, Trump had lost his re-election bid.

The justices sidestepped a decision on the legality of Trump's plan, throwing out the case on technical procedural grounds. The court said in an unsigned opinion that spoke only for the six-justice conservative majority that ""we express no view on the merits of the constitutional and related statutory claims presented. We hold only that they are not suitable for adjudication at this time.""

The three liberal justices dissented, saying the effort to exclude people in the country from the population for divvying up House seats is unlawful.

""I believe this Court should say so,"" Justice Stephen Breyer wrote, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor.

The American people have a right to know who’s here, and a key component of Trump’s “self-deportation” push is now in place — for the time being, at least.

A Brief History of Alien Registration in the United States

This story begins during the lead-up to our entry into World War II, when in response to concerns about so-called “fifth columnists” in the United States, Congress passed the “Alien Registration Act of 1940”, also known as the “Smith Act” after its primary sponsor, then-Rep. Howard W. Smith (D-Va.).

As Britannica explains, the Smith Act “made it a criminal offense to advocate the violent overthrow of the government or to organize or be a member of any group or society devoted to such advocacy”.

That’s true, but Title III of the Smith Act also required aliens 14 or older who were in this country for 30 days or more to be registered and fingerprinted (if they had not been registered and fingerprinted when they obtained their visas), while mandating that the parents and guardians of aliens under 14 years of age complete this process for their kids.

Aliens would register at the local post office or other locations designated by the then-Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) commissioner, and those who willfully failed or refused to comply with these requirements (or a separate change-of-address requirement) were subject to a fine or imprisonment.

Aliens were then issued a Form AR-3 as proof they registered, but as Judge McFadden explained in his April order:

Over the decades, the administrative state would dilute these statutory requirements by regulation. In 1944, the [INS] eliminated the division responsible for universal registration and shifted registration from post offices to ports of entry and INS offices. ... And in 1950, the INS suspended the use of the AR-3. ... Instead, the INS subbed in preexisting immigration forms that were only available to aliens with legal immigration status, like the Form I-151 for lawful permanent residents or the Form I-94 for aliens with a record of lawful entry. ... So through regulation, aliens who had entered the country illegally were effectively exempt from the statutory registration requirements, since there existed no process by which they could register. [Internal citations omitted.]

Regardless, when the INA was first enacted in 1952, the Smith Act registration regime carried over to the immigrant visa requirement in section 211 of the INA and to the “Registration of Aliens” provisions in sections 261 through 266 of the INA.

Actually, as Judge McFadden noted, section 264(e) of the INA goes the Smith Act one better, requiring aliens 18 and older to carry and have in their “personal possession any certificate of alien registration or alien registration receipt card issued to” them or face a $100 fine and a 30-day jail sentence.

So, if you’ve never seen an actual “green card”, just ask one of your lawful permanent resident alien friends to show you theirs — nearly every LPR I’ve known carries it.

Trump’s Executive Order 14159

Illogically, for 80 years, the INS and DHS only required legal aliens who had been vetted and complied with the visa-issuance and admissions processes to register. Respectfully, that’s like requiring only DEA-certified physicians and licensed pharmacists to obey our drug laws.

That changed on January 20, 2025, the day Trump returned to the White House and issued Executive Order (EO) 14159, “Protecting the American People Against Invasion”.

Section 7 of that EO, captioned “Identification of Unregistered Illegal Aliens”, directed the DHS secretary, in coordination with the State Department and attorney general, to: “immediately announce and publicize information about the legal obligation of all previously unregistered aliens in the United States to comply with” the INA registration requirements; “ensure that all previously unregistered aliens in the United States comply with” those requirements; and “ensure that failure to comply with” those “legal obligations ... is treated as a civil and criminal enforcement priority.”

The New “Alien Registration Requirement”

In accordance with EO 14159, as I’ve previously reported, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem announced on February 25 that she would begin enforcing the INA registration requirements as part of a suite of tools her department would use “to track illegal aliens and compel them to leave the country voluntarily”.

DHS then set up an “Alien Registration Requirement” web page for aliens to use to determine whether they are required to register, with a link to the new Form G-325R, “Biographic Information (Registration)”, which they can complete online.

And, on March 12, DHS published an interim final rule (IFR) laying out these new requirements (to take effect on April 11) and inviting public comments on them.

Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights v. U.S. DHS

Which brings me to the challenge brought against the new requirements in the IFR, and a complaint filed on March 31 in the D.C. District Court captioned Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights [CHIRLA] v. U.S. DHS.

In their complaint, CHIRLA and three other organizations — the United Farmworkers of America, CASA, and Make the Road New York — alleged that the IFR “violates the procedural and substantive requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act” (APA), and that “absent intervention” by the district court, “all [aliens] — as well as U.S. citizens wrongly suspected of being [aliens] — will be exposed to a new criminal enforcement regime and a ‘show me your papers’ country, ... without regard to the statutorily mandated guardrails of the APA”.

As my then-colleague Rob Law explained in February 2022, “before a regulatory change can occur” under the APA, “the relevant executive branch department must publish the proposed change in the Federal Register, explaining the justification for the revision and giving the public at least 30 days to provide feedback”.

DHS asserted, however, that it was publishing this rule as an IFR “without prior notice and opportunity for comment” because it is a “procedural rule”, that is, “a rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice”.

On the contrary, the CHIRLA plaintiffs argued:

With just 30 days’ warning, the IFR abandons the eighty-year-old approach to registration and imposes a new universal registration scheme and attendant civil and criminal liabilities on an enormous number of people. According to Defendants’ own estimates, between 2.2 million and 3.2 million people would be newly required to register.

Judge McFadden’s Order

In his April order, Judge McFadden never got to the facts of that argument or any of the others that the plaintiffs raised in their motion or complaint, finding instead that they failed to show they have standing to bring the case to begin with.

As he explained:

Standing is a “bedrock constitutional requirement.” ... It requires that a plaintiff “possess a personal stake” in the outcome, which “helps ensure that courts decide litigants’ legal rights in specific cases, as Article III [of the U.S. Constitution] requires.” ... Standing doctrine thus “serves to protect the ‘autonomy’ of those who are most directly affected so that they can decide whether and how to challenge the defendant’s action.” ... And it ensures that “the Framers’ concept of the proper — and properly limited — role of the courts in a democratic society” is vindicated, by ensuring decisions meant for the political process are left to the political process. [Internal citations omitted.]

The first ellipsis above referenced U.S. v. Texas, the 2023 opinion in which the Supreme Court rejected a challenge brought by Texas and other states to Biden administration’s policies that ignored INA mandates requiring DHS to detain criminal aliens, on the ground that even states lack standing to force the federal government to take enforcement actions.

Thus, enforcement advocates who were sore about the ultimate outcome of Texas should take comfort in the knowledge that what goes around comes around.

Judge McFadden’s standing analysis consumes 14 pages of his 21-page order, and it gets arcane, but the key takeaways are that none of the four plaintiffs showed that they had either “organizational standing” — that is, that they “suffered a concrete and demonstrable injury to [their] activities” because of the rule — or that it had “associational standing”.

With respect to associational standing, as the court explained:

An organization has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when three requirements are met. First, “its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right.” ... Second, “the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization’s purpose.” ... And third, “neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.” [Internal citations omitted.]

Here, Judge McFadden concluded, none of the groups showed that “any of their individual members would independently have standing to challenge the” IFR.

Because the groups failed to demonstrate a “’substantial likelihood’ of standing”, the judge denied their motion to stay the effective date of the IFR and a preliminary injunction.

D.C. Circuit Court’s Per Curiam Order

On April 28, the CHIRLA plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of Judge McFadden’s order with the D.C. Circuit, and on May 2, they filed a Motion for Stay or, in the Alternative, Injunction Pending Appeal of his order.

Not surprisingly, they disagreed with Judge McFadden’s standing conclusions, arguing that each of them has organizational standing (and that CHIRLA had associational standing to boot) in the course of ultimately asserting that they would face “irreparable harm” if the IFR were to remain in effect.

On August 12, a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit issued a brief per curiam order (unsigned but issued for the panel as a whole) denying plaintiffs’ motions for a stay or injunction pending appeal and allowing the IFR to proceed for now.

Simply put, the circuit panel concluded that the plaintiffs “have not satisfied the stringent requirements for an injunction pending appeal”, but the panel did order expedited consideration of the case.

Note that this wasn’t what most would think of as a “pro-Trump” panel. Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson has been on the circuit court since she was appointed by President George H.W. Bush in 1990, Judge Robert L. Wilkins was a 2014 appointee of President Obama, and President Biden nominated Judge Bradley Garcia, who was confirmed in May 2023.

Trump administration requested voter data.
But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.","BILOXI, Miss. — The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.

Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.

The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.

Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.

SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.

The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.

“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”

Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.

Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.

“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.

Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.

But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.

Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.

Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”

“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.

At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.

Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.

Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.

The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.

“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.

Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.

“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.

The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.

In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.

“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.

“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”

GOP pressure

Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.

Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.

Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.

Trump administration requested voter data. Secretary Bellows says, ‘Go jump in the Gulf of Maine’

After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.

On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.

As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.

The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.

Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.

Unreliable data?

But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.

The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.

The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.

A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.

Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.

“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.

During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.

“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.

Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.

Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.

Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.

“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.

Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.

When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.

“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/naturalization-ceremony.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 06:56:30.368734

“Despite the President’s signature, this remains an unconstitutional, illegal, and foolish attempt to undermine California’s clean air protections,” she said after Trump signed the resolution in June.","The Trump administration has intensified its efforts to limit California’s ability to impose clean air standards, filing a motion in federal court to join a trucking industry lawsuit that seeks to end the state’s Clean Truck Partnership, which includes a plan to switch to battery operated heavy trucks by 2045.

The motion, which would make the federal government a plaintiff in the industry lawsuit filed Monday in federal court in Sacramento, is the latest in several actions taken by the administration to weaken California’s air quality regulations, many of which are more stringent than those imposed by the federal law and the Environmental Protection Agency.

It targets a decision by the California Air Resources Board to continue enforcing the state’s standards even after President Donald Trump signed a congressional resolution aimed at invalidating them. A similar motion was filed in a lawsuit in Illinois, and another that takes aim at regulations regarding light-duty vehicles such as automobiles was filed this week in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.

“In a stunning act of defiance, the State of California is attempting to use its own vehicle and engine emissions standards through a so-called ‘Clean Truck Partnership’ to ban internal-combustion engines in heavy-duty trucks, notwithstanding duly enacted federal statutes specifically providing that those regulatory standards are preempted,” the administration said in its motion.

Trump signed a congressional resolution in June revoking California’s ability to impose its own standards, which had been previously allowed under a waiver of federal rules what would otherwise have banned such state-level regulations.

However, the state continued to insist that an agreement it had reached with the trucking industry two years ago that required a reduction in emissions and a shift to electric trucks by 2045 was still enforceable. California is also challenging the congressional resolution in federal court.

The industry’s top manufacturers sued on Aug. 11, and on Thursday the Trump administration filed its motion to join the lawsuit.

The move highlights the administration’s determination to end what it sees as regulatory overreach by California and other Democratic-led states, and marks the latest in a series of lawsuits that have targeted California’s policies on immigration, rights for transgender people, environmental protection and even the price of eggs.

The motion was filed on the same day that California Governor Gavin Newsom announced a proposal to begin to redraw the state’s congressional districts to favor more Democrats in response to actions by the state of Texas to draw more Republican seats as requested by Trump. It names the Air Resources Board, the board’s executive director Steven Cliff and Newsom as defendants.

“Agreement, contract, partnership, mandate — whatever California wants to call it, this unlawful action attempts to undermine federal law,” Acting Assistant Attorney General Adam Gustafson said in a statement Friday.

In their initial lawsuit, truck manufacturers Daimler Truck North America, International Motors, Paccar, Inc., and Volvo Group North America said that they were “caught in the crossfire” between the federal government and the state of California.

California, they said, continues to insist on compliance with its stricter rules and has threatened sanctions against the companies if they do not do so. But at the same time, their lawsuit says, the U.S. Department of Justice has sent the manufacturers cease-and-desist letters ordering them to stop complying with California’s demands.

“California demands that (manufacturers) follow preempted laws; the United States maintains such laws are illegal and orders (manufacturers) to disregard them,” the lawsuit says. “This situation is not tenable.”

In its motion, the federal government laid out the timeline for its decision to join the lawsuit. On Aug. 11, the day the trucking companies filed their complaint, a congressional committee sent a letter to the Air Resources Board demanding that it comply with federal regulations, the motions says.

The next day, the U.S. Department of Justice requested consent from the trucking companies to join their lawsuit. Government lawyers met via a video conference to discuss the matter on Aug. 14 and filed their motion the same day, documents in federal court show.

CARB spokeswoman Lynda Lambert said the agency continues to believe that the federal government’s actions limiting the state’s ability to enforce its environmental regulations were illegal.

“On June 12, 2025, President Trump signed unconstitutional and illegal resolutions purporting to overturn three of U.S EPA’s decisions to grant California waivers, including its Advanced Clean Cars II, Advanced Clean Trucks, and Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle Omnibus regulations,” Lambert said. “CARB disputes the legality and effect of these resolutions, and they are being challenged in court.”

CARB chair Liane Randolph declined to comment on the lawsuit itself.

But she has harshly criticized the administration’s efforts to weaken California’s environmental rules.

“Despite the President’s signature, this remains an unconstitutional, illegal, and foolish attempt to undermine California’s clean air protections,” she said after Trump signed the resolution in June. The action, she said, was the latest in a series of “vindictive” moves aimed at trapping consumers into using fossil fuels.

“CARB will use every tool at its disposal to continue our critical work to clean the air and address the climate crisis,” she continued at that time. “The health and well-being of all Californians depends on it.”

A hearing on whether to allow the federal government to join the lawsuit has been set for Sept. 19 in federal court in Sacramento.

Rep. Gabe Evans' bill would provide legal status to some undocumented immigrants

Brandon Richard

As the Trump administration ramps up immigration enforcement efforts, farms have been among the locations U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have set their sights on.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 42% of farm workers in the U.S. are without legal work authorization.

The raids not only have leaders in the agriculture industry worried, but some leaders in the restaurant and hospitality industries are also concerned. They say increased enforcement actions and the lack of a clear path to legal status have created fear among workers and their families. They say that unless a solution is found, it will harm other parts of the economy.

“We're going down what I would call [a] great risk for the economy, and that is empty shelves, rising prices and businesses closing. That is the path we're on if we don't do something,” said Emily Knight, the CEO and president of the Texas Restaurant Association. “And that is not just a risk to our immigrant population, it is a risk to every American.”

Knight was among a group of restaurant and hospitality leaders who participated in a press conference on Thursday to mark the launch of a national campaign highlighting the contributions of immigrant food workers. The American Business Immigration Coalition (ABIC) and the James Beard Foundation launched the campaign.

The group also urged President Donald Trump and federal lawmakers to provide work permits for food workers.

""There is a very large percentage of individuals that are preparing food every day, that are contributing in our kitchens, that are making a difference, that need to have a path to a work permit to continue paying their taxes and contributing to the economy and their communities,"" Knight said.

Colorado Congressman Gabe Evans also participated in the press conference. He said the Dignity Act, which he introduced along with a bipartisan group of lawmakers in July, would provide a long-term solution by giving agriculture, hospitality and other workers who are unauthorized a pathway to legal status.

“They want to work hard; they want to pay their taxes; they want to raise their families here. They want to be those contributing members of American society,” Evans said. “We just have to give them a pathway forward to be able to legally have that work authorization. And so that's what the Dignity Act does.”

The bill would create a program that would offer legal status to undocumented immigrants who were in the country before 2021. They would be required to pay any back taxes they owe and $7,000 in restitution. They must also remain in good standing.

""We know this is something that is critical, not just for those immigrants who are looking for that pathway forward, but for the American economy,” said Evans.

Read the full Dignity Act legislation below

While immigrants who meet the conditions would be allowed to stay, they would not be eligible for federal benefits. The bill would also increase border security, target traffickers and criminal smugglers, and mandate the use of E-Verify for employers nationwide.

Knight described Evans' proposal as a ""common sense solution.""

Evans said now is the time to pass the legislation because the Trump administration has made significant progress securing the border.

""That's why I think now is the perfect time to have this conversation, because we do have that border security and that strong emphasis on the rule of law and making sure that the bad elements no longer can really taint this conversation,"" Evans said. ""We can actually have a productive conversation about how do we fix the broken immigration system.""

Evans has received criticism from some who call his proposal amnesty. He said those claims are inaccurate because the bill does not offer citizenship and requires immigrants to meet several requirements, including paying back taxes.

“This is not an amnesty bill,” Evans said. “This is a bill for people who want the accountability of earning a path to some sort of legal status.”

Superior Court, the California Supreme Court held that the Federal Arbitration Act does not preempt California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1281.98. The statute, intended to deter the “strategic nonpayment of arbitration fees,” provides that a business or employer materially breaches its arbitration agreement if it fails to pay required arbitration fees within 30 days of the due date. Upon the resulting breach, a plaintiff may proceed in court and pursue sanctions against the defendant or seek an order compelling the defendant to pay the required fees and proceed in arbitration. Plaintiffs’ firms strategically leveraged these provisions to avoid arbitration, leading corporate defendants to argue that the FAA preempts the statute.

This question percolated in California appellate and federal courts with differing results. The California Courts of Appeal held that the FAA does not preempt the California statute while federal courts in California held the opposite. This split led the California Supreme Court to take up the issue in Hohenshelt.

The California Supreme Court held that the FAA does not preempt Section 1281.98, but explained that Section 1281.98 does not create a strict, unwaivable 30-day deadline to pay. The Court’s opinion does not disturb existing federal case law holding that Section 1281.98 is preempted by the FAA. The U.S. Supreme Court will likely need to take up the issue to fully resolve the question. Until then, businesses should consider procedures that limit or mitigate their potential liability related to arbitration fees.

Background

Section 1281.98 provides that “if a company or business that drafts an arbitration agreement does not pay its share of required arbitration fees or costs within 30 days after they are due, the company or business is in ‘material breach’ of the arbitration agreement. In the case of such a material breach, an employee or consumer can, among other things, withdraw his or her claim from arbitration and proceed in court.” The employee or consumer can also bring a petition for “an order compelling the drafting party to pay all arbitration fees that the drafting party is obligated to pay.”

The California Courts of Appeal interpreted the 30-day requirement to be a strict, unwaivable deadline, requiring that fees be received before the 30-day deadline with no exceptions for good cause. The statute provided plaintiffs’ firms a potent weapon in the arbitration space, particularly in the context of mass arbitrations.

In mass arbitrations, plaintiffs’ law firms file thousands of individual claims before a single arbitral forum and seek to leverage the threat of millions of dollars in arbitration fees to extract an early settlement from corporate defendants. Corporate defendants argue that these claims often are baseless, include claimants who never signed an arbitration agreement with the defendant, were not customers of the defendant or do not exist. In response to this tactic, corporate defendants at times refused to pay the hefty arbitration invoices, and plaintiffs’ firms used Section 1281.98 to obtain an order compelling the defendants to pay. If defendants continue to refuse to pay and plaintiffs proceed to court, the plaintiffs’ firms often relied on Section 1281.98 to argue in favor of sanctions under Section 1281.99 that might include a court-ordered prohibition on conducting discovery or a judgment of default. In response, corporate defendants invoked the protections of the FAA and argued that it preempts Section 1281.98.

Hohenshelt Litigation

In Hohenshelt, the plaintiff’s sexual harassment claims against his former employer were compelled to arbitration before JAMS pursuant to a pre-dispute arbitration agreement. The court case was stayed pending the arbitration. On July 29, 2022, JAMS sent an invoice to the employer defendant, and the employer failed to pay that invoice within 30 days. The plaintiff withdrew from the arbitration, citing Section 1281.98, and filed a motion to lift the stay in the trial court. Although the trial court denied the motion, the appellate court reversed, reasoning that Section 1281.98 does not empower the arbitrator to cure a party’s missed payment. The appellate court rejected the defendant’s argument that the FAA preempts Section 1281.98.

The California Supreme Court agreed and held that “section 1281.98, properly construed, is not preempted by the FAA.” The Court explained that California appellate courts have incorrectly interpreted the statute “to impose an inflexible and sometimes harsh rule resulting in loss of arbitral rights.” The Court rejected rigid construction of the statute and held that it “does not abrogate the longstanding principle, established by statute and common law, that one party’s nonperformance of an obligation automatically extinguishes the other party’s contractual duties only when nonperformance is willful, grossly negligent, or fraudulent.”

The statute was intended to deter “strategic nonpayment of arbitration fees” and not “to strip companies and employers of their contractual right to arbitration where nonpayment of fees results from a good faith mistake, inadvertence, or other excusable neglect.” With this construction in mind, the California Supreme Court concluded that Section 1281.98 is not preempted because it does not deviate from general state contract law principles, disfavor arbitration or invent a special arbitration-favoring rule. The statute’s default 30-day timeline encourages the speedy resolution and “makes arbitration contracts enforceable on the same grounds as those that apply to other contracts: When a party breaches its contractual obligations willfully, fraudulently, or with gross negligence, it cannot escape the consequences by pointing to a lack of harm to the other party.”

His enforcement of mass deportations has various communities fearful of the worst. We hear things online talking about people being taken and put into detention centers. Trump said he wanted to deport “the worst of the worst,” however, among these individuals there are many who come in hopes of having a better future for their children (“Los Angeles public schools to open with unprecedented protections for immigrant children,” Aug. 13).

These recent raids that have occurred all over the states are specifically affecting the minds of the younger generation, having to see the families of friends, people online and even sometimes their own family be separated. The children are now living in a world in which they have to be scared they won’t see their families anymore. This is bringing them so much stress, anxiety and depression.

The man who died on the 210 Freeway was identified as Roberto Carlos Montoya Valdez from Jutiapa, Guatemala, according to the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, which said the Guatemalan consulate confirmed the identity.

Cellphone video from the deadly crash appears to show a passerby on the 210 Freeway, showing the body of a man who has been hit by a car just yards from where federal officers were arresting day laborers below.

The man ran from the scene, crossed Evergreen Avenue and entered the eastbound 210 Freeway, said Monrovia City Manager Dylan Feik. CHP officers said they received a report just before 10 a.m. that someone had been hit by a SUV on the freeway near Myrtle Avenue.

What exactly led up to the man running onto the freeway is unclear.

“Was it intentional? I don’t think that is the case, but it ended up with a father, a brother being killed,” said Pablo Alvarado, co-executive director of the National Day Laborers Organizing Network.

The Department of Homeland Security told NBC Los Angeles in a statement that Montoya Valdez was not being pursued by federal officials. But Alvarado blamed the federal officials’ tactics that, he said, created fear.

“Whether they were chasing him or not, the fact is that when you have operations of this kind, the first reaction of any human being is to run,”

Many others in the same Home Depot parking lot also ran, according to people who witnessed or experienced the raid.

“My boss told me to run because immigration was there,” Mattias, a worker who escaped the raid, said in Spanish. “Some people ran regardless of their immigration status because nowadays, they don’t know if undocumented or documented people will be detained.”

Mattias said he hurt himself while jumping a fence.

“The DMV and ICE have remained in communication, have seemingly been collaborative,” ACLU Executive Director Athar Haseebullah said during a press conference.
It is not valid identification to obtain benefits or services for federal purposes, according to the Nevada DMV website.
During President Donald Trump’s first administration, it was revealed that at least three states shared drivers’ immigration information with ICE.
In June, The Indy filed a similar public records request with the DMV.","The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Nevada announced a lawsuit against the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for failing to disclose public records related to potential collaboration with federal immigration officers.

In the Thursday lawsuit, the ACLU said the DMV had failed to turn over correspondence between the agency and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in response to multiple public records requests since February. After sending a formal demand letter through the Nevada Attorney General’s Office, the Nevada DMV turned over heavily redacted and incomplete documents.

Exhibits the ACLU released Friday show email exchanges between the DMV and ICE where someone with an ICE email address gave the DMV the names, date of birth and driver’s license numbers of three individuals they were looking for, asking the DMV to turn over photos and information related to the three individuals.

The ACLU further said the records suggest there was a chat on Signal — an encrypted messaging platform known for its enhanced security — between staff at ICE and the Nevada DMV, which has never been disclosed to the public.

“The DMV and ICE have remained in communication, have seemingly been collaborative,” ACLU Executive Director Athar Haseebullah said during a press conference.

The DMV declined to comment because of “ongoing litigation.”

In an email between the agency and the ACLU, they said that “there are no records of memoranda, policies, trainings or guidelines in effect related to collaboration with immigration and customs (ICE) officers. The reason there are no policies is because we do not work with ICE.”

However, in another email exchange between the DMV and ICE, a DMV representative wrote, “we have confirmed that there are no faxes or Signal messages responsive to your request. Our research indicates that Signal is not a DMV-managed application and one of which our agency has never had access to, therefore no additional communications would be stored there.”

Nevada is one of 19 states that allow undocumented people to get driver’s licenses, known as driver authorization cards. Those cards allow people who cannot meet proof of identity requirements for a standard license to still drive. It is not valid identification to obtain benefits or services for federal purposes, according to the Nevada DMV website.

It was unclear whether the information that the DMV shared with ICE was related to driver authorization cards because the exchanges were heavily redacted, Haseebullah said.

During President Donald Trump’s first administration, it was revealed that at least three states shared drivers’ immigration information with ICE. Then Nevada DMV spokeswoman Brandi Alexandra Smith told the online outlet Governing that it does not release any information relating to immigration status, nationality or citizenship from license application files. She further said that state law prevents the DMV from sharing information with any other agencies “for the purpose of immigration.”

During the 82nd legislative session in 2023, Assm. Max Carter (D-Las Vegas) introduced AB407, which would eventually become the state law prohibiting the DMV from sharing personal information regarding a license, identification card or vehicle registration to federal entities for immigration enforcement.

“We brought AB407 to give some confidence to our communities that due process would be followed,” Carter said.

He called the communications between the DMV and ICE ""disappointing,” and noted Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo approved the law in 2023.

A spokesperson for the governor did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“It's eroding that belief that the government respects the people who live here,” Carter said about the need to enact a law preventing state agencies from sharing personal information.

The only exceptions to the law are if the requester submits a written release from the person or the DMV director releases the information pursuant to a lawful court order, subpoena or warrant.

Without an act from Congress, the DMV is required to follow Nevada’s law, said Christopher Peterson, the ACLU’s legal director.

“When it comes to immigration enforcement, the federal government can't make the state help them. They can't force them to do it,” said Sadmira Ramic, an ACLU attorney.

Under the Privacy Act of 1974, federal agencies are supposed to tell the public how they intend to use and safeguard personal data before they begin collecting it. They are not supposed to use data beyond the intended purpose.

The lawsuit is the latest pushback against increasing collaboration between ICE and state officials. Last Friday, The Indy broke news that the state's national guard was authorized to help ICE with administrative tasks. Earlier that week, Nevada landed on a federal list of “sanctuary states” despite having no laws prohibiting collaboration between state officials and federal immigration agents.

Several police departments, including Las Vegas Metropolitan Police, have active partnerships with ICE, through which local officers are deputized to carry out federal immigration enforcement duties.

In June, The Indy filed a similar public records request with the DMV. The agency said that the request was “exempt from disclosure” as “any information between DHS and our compliance division are on-going cases, which are not public records and cannot be released.”

Regulatory and Government updates

GPAI Code of Practice published

On 10 July, the European Commission (the ""Commission"") published the final General-Purpose AI Code of Practice (the ""Code""), which is intended to help providers of general-purpose AI (""GPAI"") models comply with certain provisions of the EU AI Act (the ""AI Act""). Although the Code is voluntary and non-binding, the Commission has stated that it will provide a practical way for providers to demonstrate compliance and reduce legal uncertainty.

The Code supports compliance with Articles 53 and 55 of the AI Act, which set out obligations for providers of GPAI models, including those defined in the AI Act as having systemic risk (i.e. when the cumulative amount of computation used for a system's training exceeds ""10(^25)"" or when the system has an impact equivalent to this amount). The AI Act's requirements take effect from August 2025, becoming fully enforceable for new GPAI models by August 2026 and for existing GPAI models by August 2027.

The Code is organised into three chapters: Transparency, Copyright, and Safety & Security. Some key takeaways from the Code are as follows:

Providers must maintain comprehensive, up-to-date documentation for each GPAI model, using a template supplied by the Commission. They are required to make contact information publicly available for information requests and ensure the accuracy, integrity, and security of all documented information.

To comply with copyright obligations, providers need to implement a copyright policy in line with EU law, ensure only lawfully accessible content is used for training the models, and respect machine-readable rights reservations. Technical safeguards must be in place to prevent copyright-infringing outputs, and a clear complaints mechanism for rightsholders is required.

For GPAI models with systemic risk, providers must adopt a robust safety and security framework, identify and mitigate systemic risks, and implement cybersecurity protections. Providers are also required to prepare a Safety and Security Model Report, define clear internal responsibilities, and report serious incidents to authorities.

The publication of the Code marks a significant step in operationalising AI regulation in the EU. Organisations developing or deploying GPAI models should review their practices against the Code’s requirements to ensure good governance and regulatory readiness as the AI landscape continues to evolve.

Mandatory template released for GenAI model providers

In July, the Commission published a template to aid GPAI providers with summarising the content which they use to train their AI models. The Commission intends for the template to be an effective way for providers to increase transparency in line with their obligations under the AI Act. This template is a supplement to the guidelines on the scope of rules for GPAI models and the Code.

Designed to be user-friendly, its goal is to help providers of GPAI models fully comply with the AI Act. By streamlining compliance, the initiative supports broader efforts to build public trust in AI and unlock its full potential for economic and societal benefit.

Inquiry into Human Rights and the regulation of AI

On 25 July 2025, the Joint Committee on Human Rights (the ""Committee"") has launched an inquiry (the ""Inquiry"") into the impact of AI on human rights in the UK.

The Inquiry aims to assess both the risks and opportunities that AI presents for human rights and to determine whether current legal and regulatory frameworks are adequate to address these challenges as AI technology evolves and if not, what changes should be made to these frameworks. AI technologies offer clear benefits to society but also raise serious concerns, including the risk of reinforcing bias and discrimination through the use of flawed data. Their use in surveillance may threaten privacy and freedom of expression, while the data used to train AI models could lead to opaque decision-making and bias.

The Inquiry is particularly interested in the way that AI can influence individual human rights both positively and negatively in areas such as: (i) privacy and data usage; (ii) discrimination and bias; and (iii) access to effective remedies for human rights violations.

The Committee is seeking written submissions on the above key issues from any member of the public. It will also examine whether the UK's legal framework and government policies sufficiently protect human rights in the context of AI, and what future legislation might be needed.

Additional topics include the challenges of regulating AI given its international nature, accountability for human rights breaches, the appropriate point in the AI lifecycle for liability, and whether different types of AI require distinct regulatory approaches. The Inquiry will also consider lessons from other jurisdictions, such as the European Union.

Feedback can be submitted here until 5 September 2025.

Government publishes AI Action Plan for Justice

The Ministry of Justice's AI Action Plan for Justice (the ""Plan for Justice""), launched in July 2025, sets out a comprehensive strategy to integrate AI across the justice system in England and Wales. The Plan for Justice aims to make justice services faster, fairer, and more accessible through, among other things, the automation of routine tasks and personalising services for citizens and staff. Developed with input from both the judiciary and legal regulators, the Plan for Justice supports AI adoption across courts, prisons, probation, and supporting services.

It focuses on three main priorities which are as follows: (i) strengthening the foundations for AI adoption through establishing a dedicated Justice AI Unit, governance, creating an AI & Data Ethics Framework, and robust data infrastructure; (ii) embedding AI in courts, tribunals, prisons, and probation to enhance productivity and streamline work, such as by ensuring all staff have a secure AI assistant, using speech and translation AI, and using AI coding assistants to modernise legacy systems; and (iii) investing in people and partnerships by developing AI talent, fostering collaboration with legal service providers, and supporting responsible innovation. Importantly, the Plan for Justice emphasises the importance of human oversight when using AI, noting that ""[the Ministry of Justice] will monitor outputs, apply de-biasing techniques, and use representative datasets to ensure AI augments, not replaces, human judgment"".

The Plan for Justice emphasises transparency to maintain ethical standards and uphold public trust as this will ensure AI supports rather than replaces human judgment. Early pilots have shown promising results, with AI tools already reducing administrative burdens and improving service quality. The roadmap involves a phased approach, with continuous evaluation and adaptation over a 3-year period that starts in April 2025. The Ministry of Justice is committed to working with partners, regulators, and the wider justice sector to ensure AI delivers tangible benefits to uphold an equitable justice system.

The Plan for Justice can be read in full here.

Trump's AI Action Plan

On the 23 July the White House revealed its vision for future AI policy in the form of a 28-page AI action plan (the ""Plan""). According to the White House's press release, this Plan is part of a ""shift toward policy aimed at fostering U.S AI dominance in the fact of fierce competition from China."" This statement is just another example of the competitiveness between world powers and the interconnected nature of geopolitics and technology in the global AI race. Emphasising this, the first line of the Plan's introduction states that ""America is in a race to achieve global dominance in artificial intelligence.""

Key aspects of the Plan include: (i) using federal agencies to develop new standards and improve those that already exist; (ii) removing regulatory barriers and red tape to foster AI innovation; and (iii) improving risk prevention. It is expected that President Trump will use executive orders to put some of the Plan's points into action.

According to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Director, Michael Kratsios, the Plan ""galvanizes Federal efforts to turbocharge our innovative capacity, build cutting-edge infrastructure, and lead globally, ensuring that American workers and families thrive in the AI era."" Organisations will welcome the Plan's explicit efforts to remove red tape.

The Plan has already been met with varying reactions from concerned parties, with several privacy and AI safety groups coming together to sign the People's AI Action Plan – a statement within which they urge the US government to focus on the environmental and social needs of the country rather than the wants of the technology industry.

Law Commission releases AI discussion paper

Last month the Law Commission published a discussion paper (the ""Paper"") focusing on AI and the law. The aim of the Paper is to raise awareness of legal issues concerning AI, to encourage discussion around the topic and to aid in identifying the areas that are in most pressing need of reform.

The Paper explores:

AI autonomy and adaptiveness;

Interaction with and reliance on AI; and

AI training and data.

While the Paper considers how legal issues may arise, it does not include any specific proposals for law reform. However, it does consider the ""perhaps radical, option of granting AI systems some form of legal personality"" which it considers might be a solution to the immediate problem of liability - likely to become a more pressing issue as AI becomes more sophisticated.

Sir Peter Fraser, Chair of the Law Commission, emphasised the rapid development and expanding use of AI across various fields, including automated driving and medical diagnosis. He noted that AI is likely to continue influencing many aspects of daily life in significant ways – posing both benefits and risks. Fraser stressed the importance of ensuring that the laws of England and Wales evolve to keep pace with the changes brought about by AI.

Enforcement and Civil Litigation

Voice actors sue AI startup for voice cloning

A federal judge in New York has allowed two voice actors who allege their voices were used without their permission to proceed with a lawsuit against AI voiceover company Lovo Inc. (""Lovo""). The actors claim they were hired through the freelancing app Fiverr for limited projects, but later discovered Lovo had sold AI-generated versions of their voices as digital personas which the actors deemed to be unauthorised ""clones"" of their voices. While the judge has dismissed most federal copyright and trademark claims, he permitted the actors to pursue claims under New York's right of publicity laws and to amend their complaint regarding copyright infringement related to AI training.

This case is part of a broader trend of legal challenges against tech companies accused of using creative works to train AI systems without consent. Similarly in the UK, there was a prolonged ""ping-pong"" of debate between the House of Lords and the House of Commons around the inclusion of protective measures for rights holders in the Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 (the ""DUAA""), which we covered in a previous edition of Neural Network and more generally in our DUAA series (a deep-dive into various provisions of the DUAA, the most recent of which can be found here). The House of Commons consistently blocked the inclusion of any such clauses, noting that, among other things, the DUAA was not the right instrument for this change. Creatives, including Elton John and Dua Lipa were vocal about the issue, urging the Prime Minister to appropriately consider legislative protections for artists' copyright. Protective provisions were ultimately not included, but the government agreed to publish a report on copyright and AI proposals within nine months of the DUAA being passed.

Technology developments and market news

A new partnership: UK and OpenAI

Last month the UK government signed a ""strategic partnership"" with artificial intelligence organisation OpenAI.

This new partnership forms part of the government's strategy to attract increased investment into the UK's artificial intelligence sector - in January of this year, the digital secretary Peter Kyle announced an ""AI opportunities action plan"" in order to uplift the UK's AI sector. Currently, the UK is home to pioneering AI laboratories such as Google DeepMind. However, the levels of funding available within the nation are dwarfed by AI powerhouses such as the USA and China. This is best exemplified with the amounts of private AI investment each of these countries received last year; the USA boasted $109.1 billion, China had a healthy $9.3 billion while the UK lagged behind with only $4.5 billion.

The ""strategic partnership"" between the UK government and OpenAI is set out in a voluntary memorandum of understanding that includes a series of pledges from both parties. The government commits to discovering ways to adopt OpenAI's technologies in public services in a variety of sectors such as justice and education technology. On the flip side, OpenAI pledges to ""explore"" investing in AI infrastructure within the UK and to hire more staff in the UK.

This partnership seems promising and may help alleviate some of the concerns voiced by UK entrepreneurs regarding technology regulation, most notably highlighted by the recent enactment of the DUAA on 19 June 2025.

China proposes a global regulatory body for AI

China has announced an ambitious plan to expand its influence in global AI governance, aiming to establish a new international cooperation organisation and promote open-source technology sharing. Speaking at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, Premier Li Qiang highlighted the need for a unified global AI governance framework, criticising technological monopolies and export restrictions – arguably implicitly referring to US policies.

China's foreign ministry released a 13-point proposal advocating for new UN-led dialogue mechanisms and a safety governance framework. The plan emphasises collaboration on open-source platforms and sharing key technologies, including semiconductors, to benefit global development, particularly in the global South. This reflects China's strategy of continuing in its attempts to grow its global influence, also exemplified by gradually increasing its involvement in UN agencies, particularly those focused on development, technology, and technical standards. The aim of this could be to fill the political lacuna left since the Trump administration began pulling back from the UN. Despite contributing over 15% of the UN’s regular budget (second only to the US), China remains under-represented among the organisation's staff.

This initiative comes amid escalating US-China competition in the technology sphere, with Washington imposing export controls on advanced semiconductor chips with the aim of maintaining its technological edge. We previously reported that China is making the switch from Nvidia due to these restrictions, while the US is growing the number of data centres on its shores. Given that a key aim of the US's AI Action Plan is to ""Counter Chinese Influence in International Governance Bodies"", the extent of China's role in any prospective international AI governing body remains to be seen.

Despite these restrictions, Chinese AI groups like DeepSeek and Alibaba have continued to advance rapidly, raising concerns in the US about losing global dominance.",,N,,2025-08-16 12:57:40.847716

City leaders spoke out Friday afternoon following recent U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in the community.

Officials said ICE agents entered the parking lot of the Norwalk Police Department on Thursday but were immediately asked to leave by local police. Mayor Harry Rilling said agents returned again Friday morning.

At a press conference, Rilling, joined by other city officials, criticized ICE’s tactics, including the use of face masks, plain clothes and unmarked vehicles, which he said made agents difficult to identify.

Rilling emphasized that Norwalk police were not involved in any ICE operations in the city over the past several days.

He said the city is working with the state attorney general, police and members of the Common Council to determine how best to protect residents moving forward.

“There’s no one person that is going to be able to assist us in interfering with the immigration and customs enforcement activities,” Rilling said. “The only thing we can do is protect the people who are in our community, make sure they’re not abused, and make sure that their constitutional rights are not violated.""

Immigration attorney Alex Meyerovich said the recent uptick in enforcement activity is unprecedented and may signal government overreach.

“This is getting ridiculous,” Meyerovich said. “Not because they’re trying to create some sort of order in the immigration world, it’s just because there are no stop signs, there are no brakes. When there are no brakes, it can go as far as the administration wants.”",https://images-cf.news12static.com/3kqcuzntcg31/6utrcFkKaOO98JwhR5nMMa/9c6ef05f1b3e3f778e451bfe4e70eb26/b244622f-4775-4ddd-afaa-03ed26c5984b.jpg?fit=thumb&w=600&h=340&q=80&fm=webp,N,,2025-08-16 00:56:53.190031

Roberto Iztep-Caba, who has lived in the United States since he was 4 years old after immigrating from Guatemala, was pulled over for a traffic violation on Aug. 8, which led to his detention by ICE, WJCL-TV reports.

“Everyone is heartbroken. We’re confused,” said Maritza Zamorano, Roberto’s girlfriend, told the TV station. “We’re all just like, there’s no way.”

Roberto was stopped by law enforcement for failing to come to a complete stop at a stop sign while on his way to school after dropping his mother off at work, a routine he has followed for years.

The Society of Professional Journalists has renewed its calls for an immediate end to the continued detention of journalist Mario Guevara.

A coalition of local and national press freedom organizations and civil liberties groups, including SPJ, sent a letter Thursday to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security recognizing the “grim milestone” in Guevara’s case: He has been detained for two months.

“The case of Mario Guevara, an Emmy-winning reporter with thousands of subscribers, represents an erosion of democratic norms in the United States and a curtailment in journalists’ ability to do their jobs, as guaranteed by the First Amendment, without fear of prolonged detention,” says the letter from the coalition, which was led by the Committee to Protect Journalists and Free Press.

Guevara, a Spanish-language digital reporter, was arrested June 14 while livestreaming a protest in a suburb of Atlanta. Although all misdemeanor charges have been dropped and a federal immigration judge granted him bond on July 1, Guevara remains in custody at Georgia’s Folkston Immigration and Customs Enforcement Processing Center. He has been transferred through five different detention facilities despite having legal work authorization in the United States.

“The continued detention of Mario Guevara is deeply troubling and sends a chilling message to journalists, especially those from immigrant and minority communities,” said SPJ President Emily Bloch.

SPJ previously joined CPJ in a June 20 letter to DHS, which has gone unanswered, as well as a July 22 initiative urging ICE to release Guevara, who remains in detention despite the dropped charges and a judicial order for his release.

“Despite all charges being dropped and a judge ordering his release, he remains behind bars. This is not just a violation of his rights, it’s a threat to press freedom. SPJ calls on DHS and ICE to immediately comply with the court’s order and release him,” said SPJ Executive Director Caroline Hendrie.

Even so, only a slim majority of Republican/conservative immigrants support banning birthright citizenship (52%), and an even smaller share back the administration’s approach to curbing inflation (59%).","Trump’s sweeping immigration crackdown amid mass deportation raids, immigration protests, and a slew of judicial rulings on the birthright citizenship ban, have thrust immigrant communities squarely into the public eye. In this article, I analyze how foreign-born or first-generation immigrants (both with and without U.S. citizenship) view the administration’s policies during its initial months, how those views have evolved since the past election, and what this could portend, electorally, for future election cycles among immigrant communities.

Public approval among foreign-born immigrant voters varies across issue areas but overall is declining

November 2024 saw many naturalized citizen immigrant voters1, a traditionally Democratic-leaning bloc, rally around Trump’s campaign pledge to tame spiraling inflation and immigration. However, several months into his second term, overall approval of the president’s policy agenda has dipped, whereas some specific policies, such as immigration, remain relatively less affected.

During the prior election, according to Pew Research’s post-election findings, which confirm prior analysis conducted by Brookings, Democrats’ share of the total foreign-born vote steadily decreased during that period, even more so than the overall U.S. electorate, and was consistent across racial and ethnic lines. Between 2020 and 2024, the Democratic share shrunk from roughly 59% to 51%, whereas the Republican share increased from around 38% to 47%, a nearly 17+ point swing in favor of the Grand Old Party and a near even split between the two parties in 2024.

Trump flipped many of the key battleground states (including Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, and Pennsylvania) in 2024 where immigrant voters represent a sizable portion of the total U.S. electorate: 14% of all eligible voters in Nevada, 9% in Arizona, 7% in Georgia, and 5% in Pennsylvania are foreign-born. Additionally, based on pre- and post-election data from the American National Election Studies, roughly 43% of immigrants who voted in the 2024 election believed the Republican Party would do a better job of handling immigration: a positive nine-point spread over Democrats and a staggering reversal from the 2020 election where Democrats had a 25+ point edge over Republicans.

And several months into the Trump presidency, these policy issues continue to be important to voters today. According to a national survey2 of immigrant voters (fielded from April 22 to April 27, 2025), the top three issue area priorities ranked by them is still consistent with what drove them to the polls: inflation/prices (27.4%), jobs/economy (13%), immigration (9.2%), and health care (7.9%), respectively.

Still, similar to the general public, immigrant assessments of the president’s overall performance have slipped into negative territory across several key areas: 47.8% disapprove of the president’s overall performance while 45.1% approve; 50.4% believe the country is on the wrong track versus 42.1% who believe it is on the right track. Further, regarding inflation/prices and the economy, there is roughly a negative 10-point spread between those who disapprove and those who approve, respectively, for each area.

Nevertheless, the president’s immigration agenda garners the most support with a slight majority of immigrants in support of it (50.5% to 41.1%). This was also true of the broader public until more recently in August—where there is now a roughly negative 5.9point margin of disapproval across most major polls. What’s more, according to a recent Gallup poll completed in June, almost 80% of Americans now view immigration positively—the highest share on record—and only 30% of Americans want immigration reduced, a sharp decline from a year earlier in 2024 when the share was 55% of Americans. While this decline was spread across all parties, the shift was most prominent among Republicans: 88% of Republicans wanted immigration reduced in 2024 compared to 48% of Republicans today—a sizeable 40-point turnaround.

Additionally, across most of the key issue area priorities, there appears to be growing signs of a narrowing margin between foreign-born swing voters or switchers—the coalition who switched from voting for Biden in 2020 to Trump in 2024—who approve and disapprove of the administration’s policies. Although, according to post-election data from Pew Research, swing voters were not the primary contributors to Trump’s gains among immigrants compared to the new, low propensity voters that were (roughly 22% of foreign–born 2024 voters were new voters with Trump netting roughly 57% of them), it is likely that both groups were motivated by similar cost of living and immigration-related concerns. Further, according to national-level perceptions after the first 100 days, only 46.8% of Biden-Trump foreign-born switchers say the country is better off, while 35.5% say it is worse off—a gap of just over 10 points

This pattern appears, generally, to be most pronounced along economic affordability, exhibiting only narrow to moderate majority levels of approval. A slim majority of overall Biden-Trump switchers believe their economic situation has improved after 100 days (33.4% to 32.1%); 35.9% are more confident in the president’s ability to handle inflation and prices, compared with 34.6% who are less confident; on jobs and the economy, 39% express greater confidence, versus 24.2% who express less. Conversely, immigration policy stands as an outlier—roughly 61% of Biden-Trump immigrant switchers, overall, are more confident in the president’s immigration policy after 100 days compared to about 17% who are less confident, a whopping 43.7+ point margin.

Remarkably, in stark contrast to public support for economic concerns, which have sunk since the election, public support for immigration appears to have instead relatively endured since last fall. The fact that the U.S. experienced the highest influx of immigration on record between 2021 and 2023, during the Biden administration, with a majority of those immigrants lacking legal status, may partly explain why.

Even so, there are important caveats to consider. First, while a majority of immigrant voters are in support of the president’s immigration policy, it is a fairly slim majority, and these sentiments, taken from the most recent publicly available data, were captured before subsequent developments such as immigration protests, intense deportation raids, travel bans, and other occurrences. The American public has since formed a more negative attitude about the administration’s handling of immigration, suggesting there is still room for immigrant public attitudes to follow suit as well.

Second, when the nuances of immigration policy are unpacked to show which specific parts elicit the most appeal, it’s evident that it’s context-specific, and there is seemingly a disconnect between policy goals and implementation. The administration’s overall goals appear popular, but support drops sharply for its specific tactics and implementation—especially on deportations—even among Trump supporters. When distinguishing between the two main immigration issues—border security and deportations—border security appears to garner more support, while deportation policies and their ties to the legal system receive far less.

While a very slight majority approve of deporting all undocumented immigrants, a one-point difference, the data suggests that this is narrower in scope and pertains only to more recent arrivals or those convicted of violent crimes. A plurality of both immigrant switchers and immigrant voters overall—roughly 60% to 75% in each group—largely disapprove of deporting undocumented immigrants who are employed, have strong family ties (such as being married to a U.S. citizen or parenting a U.S.-born child), or have lived in the country for a decade or more, with family separation drawing the strongest disapproval.Some of the margins are even wider in key swing states that flipped from blue to red, as in Nevada and Georgia. Similarly, a clear majority of immigrant voters oppose deporting non-U.S. citizens with legal status, such as student or work visa holders, as well as international students participating in protests.

What’s more, regarding other aspects of immigration policy such as enforcement in certain areas and perceived lack of adherence to court orders, immigrant public opinion largely disfavors the administration’s approach. A majority do not approve of deporting immigrants without proper due process or a judge’s order, deporting undocumented migrants to other countries—such as to the El Salvador prison, publicized by the high profile case of the mistakenly deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia—or conducting enforcement activities in sensitive locations. Further, the bulk of both Biden-Trump immigrant switchers and overall immigrant voters, respectively, believe the administration should obey court orders regarding deportations and believe mistakes/errors are being made in who is being deported.

The continued flurry of immigration policy directives have helped to fuel this public backlash and have also led to widespread economic and social upheaval for many immigrant families. Mass immigration raids have rippled across shopping centers, farms, hotels, and workplaces—not only gripping many immigrants in a web of fear, chaos, and deep social unrest, but also shattering longstanding economic and socially vibrant communities.

International students with minor infractions or without any prior criminal record have faced abrupt visa cancellations and deportations, leaving their educational hopes and aspirations stranded overseas. What’s more, not only have policies to strip naturalized citizens of their citizenship due to certain crimes been enacted but U.S. citizens and other legal residents have found themselves swept up in deportation and detention efforts. Additionally, since Trump took office, only a minority (roughly 40%) of illegal immigrants being detained by ICE have been found to have a criminal record and only about 8% have a violent criminal conviction.

The combination of these developments may be fueling views that there is a growing gap between the administration’s intended policy objectives and actual implementation. Most of the shift in immigrant voter support was driven by Trump’s policy campaign mandate: mostly to ease economic burdens and immigration levels—largely centered on border security and deporting illegal immigrants convicted of violent crimes.

However, on both accounts, immigrant public sentiment reveals that they believe this is not being adequately tackled, at least in the initial months, and that the broader scope of deportations of both undocumented and legal immigrants appears to be a departure from what he campaigned on. Still, even amidst the dampening of public support for immigration, the administration has sought to intensify its policy arsenal—injecting an additional $170 billion into immigration enforcement and $75 billion into ICE alone—making it the most funded law enforcement agency in the U.S. federal government.

Public approval among all immigrants is negative overall but varies across racial and party lines

Among all immigrants—not just those who voted—disapproval of the administration’s policies is higher across naturalized U.S. citizens, immigrants with legal status (permanent residents or work/student visa holders), and undocumented immigrants, with notable differences by race and ideology.

According to a recent national survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation, fielded from March 6 to April 13, 2025, the sentiment of immigrant voters is largely reflective of the broader immigrant community. However, among non-U.S. citizens, there are much higher levels of dissatisfaction, particularly on immigration-related issues. Overall, with respect to immigration, concerns for either themselves or a family member being detained/deported have almost doubled from 2023 to 2025 for nearly all immigrant groups. Roughly four in 10 immigrants overall, and six in 10 immigrants with legal status, express concern about detentions or deportations.

Among Latinos, these concerns have risen from 41% to 59%; and for Asians, from 14% to 19%. Fellow Brookings scholar Gabriel R. Sanchez and a team of researchers also arrive at similar conclusions in their recently released survey on Latino immigrant sentiment toward deportation policy. What’s more, AAPI data show that Asian Americans—who are the only racial group with a foreign-born majority at 65%—tend to oppose the administration’s deportation policies. Only 43% support deporting all undocumented immigrants, while roughly 80% support deporting those charged with violent crimes.

While Asians and Latinos represent the bulk of the immigrant pool (roughly two-thirds), there is limited statistically representative data of the early public views of other racial groups (i.e. Blacks, whites etc.). Further, on immigration policy, 54% of naturalized citizens express disapproval—but when all immigrant groups are considered, regardless of legal status, that share rises to 63%. This is largely driven by non-U.S. citizen immigrants3 who exhibit higher dissatisfaction numbers around immigration-related issues.

Nonetheless, as with the broader foreign-born electorate, breaking down specific immigration policies shows deportations are widely unpopular, while a slim majority of all immigrants support the administration’s border enforcement efforts (54%) and the deployment of additional troops to the border (53%).

Conversely, only 21% of all immigrants supported the proposed birthright citizenship ban, which would limit automatic citizenship to children with at least one U.S. citizen or permanent resident parent. While the Supreme Court has not ruled directly on its constitutionality, it has restricted judges from issuing universal or nationwide injunctions against Trump’s executive orders. As a result, until the Court resolved the policy’s legality, some second-generation Americans could have faced a patchwork system in which their citizenship was recognized in some states but not in others.

However, beyond universal injunctions, the Supreme Court’s ruling left room for narrower injunctions or other legal avenues—such as class-action lawsuits—to challenge the birthright citizenship ban. Several recent lower court decisions have done so, finding the ban unconstitutional and either granting nationwide protection for U.S.-born children through class actions or upholding prior universal injunctions, arguing these do not constitute judicial overreach. Anticipating the issue’s return to the Supreme Court, the administration has released an implementation plan directing agencies like Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration to require additional parental documentation to verify a child’s eligibility for U.S. citizenship. Until the Court rules, the ultimate impact on immigrant communities remains uncertain.

Still, while immigrant public opinion is less supportive of the president’s policies overall, it is sharply divided along party lines. About 64% of all immigrants disapprove of his performance, yet 75% of Republican immigrants approve compared with just 13% of Democratic immigrants. Likewise, 81% of Republican immigrants back his immigration policy, versus 19% of Democratic immigrants. Even so, only a slim majority of Republican/conservative immigrants support banning birthright citizenship (52%), and an even smaller share back the administration’s approach to curbing inflation (59%).

The policy path forward for immigrants

In sum, support for the administration’s policy agenda has waned—not only among the loose coalition of immigrant voters who helped secure victories in key battleground states, but also across the broader immigrant population. Public sentiment indicates that expectations for easing everyday economic hardship remain unmet, and that while border security enjoys broad backing, the administration’s broader deportation efforts and judicial tactics have been uneven and diverge from its original campaign mandate. While these findings draw from some of the most recent publicly available data on immigrant views, they were captured before the administration’s latest policy actions, and forthcoming data could paint a strikingly different picture going forward.

Overall, the socio-political views of foreign-born immigrants largely align with those of the broader American public, and—as in the last presidential election, when immigration and inflation were dominant issues—their electoral influence could again prove pivotal in future races. This underscores the need for elected officials and policymakers to advance policies that address the pressing socioeconomic needs and lived realities of a broad and diverse immigrant population.",https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-01-29T141931Z_1507208541_MT1CVMD54472355_RTRMADP_3_COVER-IMAGES-1.jpg?quality=75,N,,2025-08-16 00:56:43.591127

Lawyers representing the children argued that they could not trust the Trump administration to uphold standards that it had previously violated.","A federal judge rejected on Friday the Trump administration’s second attempt to end a decades-old legal agreement that mandates basic standards of care and oversight for children in U.S. immigration custody.

Judge Dolly M. Gee of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California ruled that the Flores Settlement Agreement, in effect since 1997, must remain in place. Court-appointed monitors and lawyers will continue to have access to migrant children in border stations and family detention centers to ensure that the government is complying with the agreement.

The first Trump administration tried and failed in 2019 to dissolve the settlement agreement. And in a 20-page ruling, Judge Gee criticized the government for trying again, even though, she wrote, “they point to no meaningful change either in factual conditions or in law since their last motion to terminate.”

Under the 1997 consent decree, migrants who are 17 years old and younger must be held in the “least restrictive” setting while efforts are made to expeditiously release them. The minors must receive adequate meals, clean water, clothing, education and medical assistance, among other basic needs.

The judge said that neither the Homeland Security Department nor the Department of Health and Human Services, which are responsible for migrant children, were in “sufficiently substantial compliance to warrant termination of the Flores Settlement Agreement.”

The Homeland Security Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But the Trump administration is expected to appeal the ruling again, setting the stage for the case to reach the U.S. Supreme Court.

Leecia Welch, a lawyer with Children’s Rights who has for years interviewed children and parents in detention facilities, said that Friday’s ruling “comes as great relief.”

“Flores is the last line of defense against this administration’s plans to round up and detain children indefinitely in conditions no child deserves,” she said.

The government blames the Flores settlement for incentivizing parents to bring children so that they can be released quickly into the country.

In its motion, the administration said Flores had fueled unlawful border crossings by families and had hampered the government’s ability to effectively detain and deport families.

In her decision, the judge indicated that she was not persuaded by any of the administration’s arguments.

“Incredulously,” she wrote, government lawyers tried to argue that the “expeditious release” from detention under Flores was intended to apply only to children who enter alone and not to those who enter the country with their families.

“This is plainly incorrect,” she wrote.

In a motion filed in May, the Trump administration said that the Flores agreement was no longer necessary because Congress had enacted legislation and government agencies had established standards to guarantee proper care.

“The legal basis for the agreement has withered away,” the administration said, describing Flores as an “intrusive regime” that had “ossified federal immigration policy.”

“The Flores Settlement Agreement itself has changed the immigration landscape by removing some of the disincentives for families to enter the U.S. unlawfully,” the motion said.

Minors who cross the border are first held at Customs and Border Protection stations for processing. Those who arrive unaccompanied are then transferred to government-run shelters, where they remain until a relative in the United States can claim them. Children who arrive in the United States with family members are either released into the country with their parents or placed in family detention facilities while their immigration cases proceed through the courts.

Terminating the agreement would have eliminated independent oversight and left the government to monitor itself.

Lawyers representing the children argued that they could not trust the Trump administration to uphold standards that it had previously violated.

“Defendants demand release from the settlement not because they have complied with and will continue to observe its fundamental principles, but because they want the flexibility to treat children however they wish,” they wrote in court filings.

Preserving the agreement is “even more vital under this administration,” Carlos Holguin, lead counsel, who filed the lawsuit in 1985, said during a hearing last week.

Judge Gee appeared to agree. She said it was contradictory that detention conditions were deteriorating, even as the number of border crossings had plunged — “unless it’s willful,” she told government lawyers.

Reports of unsafe and unsanitary conditions in border stations have mounted since President Trump took office, according to court filings that have included firsthand accounts from children who described being confined for days in frigid, windowless rooms without access to showers, private toilets or the outdoors. Migrants are taken to the facilities for processing immediately after they are apprehended, and successive administrations have kept them there for no more than 72 hours, the judge said.

After recent visits to a family detention facility in Dilley, Texas, lawyers reported inadequate medical care, stifling heat and limited access to recreation, as well as prolonged detentions, with no end in sight, that are taking a toll on mental health.

Signed during the Clinton administration, the Flores agreement resolved a lawsuit that had stretched over more than a decade, which was filed on behalf of unaccompanied minors held in poor conditions without access to medical care.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/15/multimedia/HFO-NAT-IMMIG-FLORES-tzlv/HFO-NAT-IMMIG-FLORES-tzlv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 00:56:48.879971

The order from Bondi came after officials in the nation’s capital sued Friday to block President Donald Trump’s takeover of the Washington police.

The night before, his administration had escalated its intervention into the city’s law enforcement by naming a federal official as the new emergency head of the department, essentially placing the police force under the full control of the federal government.

The order from Bondi came after officials in the nation’s capital sued Friday to block President Donald Trump’s takeover of the Washington police.

The night before, his administration had escalated its intervention into the city’s law enforcement by naming a federal official as the new emergency head of the department, essentially placing the police force under the full control of the federal government.

Trump’s takeover is historic, yet it had played out with a slow ramp-up in federal law enforcement officials and National Guard troops to start the week.

As the weekend approached, though, signs across the city — from the streets to the legal system — suggested a deepening crisis over who controls the city’s immigration and policing policies, the district’s right to govern itself and daily life for the millions of people who live and work in the metro area.

A push for compromise

The two sides sparred in court for hours Friday before U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, who is overseeing the district's lawsuit. She indicated the law likely doesn’t grant the Trump administration power to fully take over city police, but it probably does give the president more power than the city might like.

The police takeover is the latest move by Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the United States illegally.

It also marks one of the most sweeping assertions of federal authority over a local government in modern times. While Washington has grappled with spikes in violence and visible homelessness, the city’s homicide rate ranks below those of several other major U.S. cities, and the capital is not in the throes of the public safety collapse the Trump administration has portrayed.

The president has more power over the nation’s capital than other cities, but D.C. has elected its own mayor and city council since the Home Rule Act was signed in 1973.

Trump is the first president to exert control over the city’s police force since it was passed. The law limits that control to 30 days without congressional approval, though Trump has suggested he’d seek to extend it.

Chief had agreed to share immigration information

Bondi’s Thursday night directive to place the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terry Cole, in charge of the police department came even after Smith had told MPD officers hours earlier to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody, such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint.

The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief’s instructions because they allowed for continued practice of “sanctuary policies,” which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.

“Even with the most anti-immigrant administration, we would always tell our clients that they must call the police, that they should call the police,"" Sanai said. “But now we find ourselves that we have to be very careful on what we advise.”

ICE said in a post on X that their teams had arrested “several” people in Washington Friday. A video posted on X showed two uniformed personnel putting handcuffs on someone while standing outside a white transport van.

Residents are seeing a significant show of force

A population already tense from days of ramp-up has begun seeing more significant shows of force across the city. National Guard troops watched over some of the world’s most renowned landmarks, and Humvees took position in front of the busy main train station. Volunteers helped homeless people leave long-standing encampments — to where was often unclear.

Friday night along the district's U Street, a popular nightlife corridor, an Associated Press photographer saw officers from the FBI, the DEA, the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Park Police, U.S. Marshals and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

An attorney with the Department of Homeland Security moves to dismiss asylum-seekers’ cases during hearings, rendering the asylum-seekers without the protection from deportation they had when their cases were active. Next, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officers swoop in, “re-encounter” the asylum-seekers as if they are back at the border, and fastrack them out of the country.

In San Francisco, judges rarely grant those moves to dismiss. But ICE officers nearly always arrest immigrants whose cases DHS has moved to dismiss anyway.

On Friday, ICE officers in San Francisco went a step further: arresting an indigenous speaker whose case the DHS attorney did not even move to dismiss. In fact, the Trump administration attorney agreed to hear her case in two months’ time, but that did not matter to ICE.

A woman from Guatemala, who appeared to be middle-aged, attended her hearing in Judge Joseph Park’s courtroom, at 630 Sansome St.

The woman spoke only Mam, a Mayan language. Park, who appeared via video, tried to speak to the woman through the court’s Spanish interpreter.

Do you speak Spanish? the interpreter asked.

“Very little,” she responded, in Spanish.

Park tried to find a Mam interpreter who could dial in over the phone. The task proved tricky. Park eventually gave up, and asked the woman to come back in October, when he had already scheduled several other hearings with Mam-speakers and would have an interpreter available.

By that point in the morning, the attorney representing DHS had already moved to dismiss three other cases.

Two of the three asylum-seekers had been arrested in the hallway the moment they left the courtroom.

The third, a woman from Colombia, clearly petrified, was still inside the courtroom. She would stay there for another hour, completely inconsolable, saying she was worried about her children.

Unlike the first three cases, the DHS attorney did not move to dismiss the Mam woman’s case. Instead, the attorney agreed to pick the case back up in October, when there would be an interpreter.

A lawyer with the Attorney of the Day program, which provides free legal advice to immigrants at their asylum hearings, seemed concerned anyway.

She pulled the woman aside, and tried to explain to her in Spanish that she could be arrested. The attorney resorted to communicating with the woman by phoning in a family member who could interpret from Mam to Spanish.

When the Guatemalan woman finally did leave the courtroom, ICE officers were waiting. They called her name.

The attorney of the day tried to protest: She told the ICE officers that the DHS attorney had not moved to dismiss the case.

It did not seem to matter. Two male ICE officers immediately whisked the woman out of the hallway and through an unmarked door.

Asylum-seekers who are held in immigration court are typically taken to be processed at an ICE field office on the sixth floor of 630 Sansome St. A lucky few have been released from there with habeas corpus petitions. Most are sent from there to longer-term detention facilities elsewhere in California, or the country.

Back inside the courtroom, Park wrapped up his 8:30 a.m. hearings, then called for a 45-minute break. He switched off his camera. The DHS attorney stayed in her seat at the front of the courtroom, working on her computer. She did not look back once at the rest of the courtroom.

The final of the four asylum-seekers who would be arrested that day — the woman from Colombia — was still inside the court and still crying. The DHS attorney had moved to dismiss her case almost an hour earlier.

At around 10:30 a.m., with a volunteer court observer and the attorney of the day, the woman managed to collect herself, and stood up to walk outside. When the door swung open, and she saw the ICE officers waiting for her, she panicked. She started to cry again, and turned around and immediately sat down in the courtroom.

It took another 30 minutes or so for her to calm down enough to stand up and leave the courtroom again.

As the democracy reporter for WITF, I will cover any kind of story that has to do with how we govern ourselves. That will include doing a lot of election coverage about how to access the ballot, how public officials administer elections, the technology used to run and secure elections, and the laws that govern it all.

My work will also include accountability coverage for elected officials that use their positions to then undermine democratic institutions, like the legislators that voted against the certification of the presidential election results on January 6, 2021. If that weren’t enough, I foresee covering some local government decisions, fights over public records and transparency, and some candidate coverage around the major elections. As seen in my coverage of immigrant of LGBTQ+ communities, I also report on the consequences of elections for minority groups.

Update: This story was updated Aug. 15 between 6 to 7 p.m. to include a statement from an advocacy organization and to clarify the nature of a traffic incident.

Ester Soliman was deported to the Philippines on Friday after living in Lancaster for 25 years, her family said.

Her family said they received a call from their mother from the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City, just before Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officials were putting her on a plane.

“We are heartbroken and reeling, and we want her home more than we can communicate,” the family said in an update on its fundraising page to pay for an immigration attorney. “Please keep our entire family in your prayers as we determine our next steps.”

ICE arrested Soliman on Aug. 4 when she reported to a meeting under the Alternatives to Detention program at the agency’s York office.

Soliman’s family never received notification from ICE that their mother was being deported, according to Damon Myers, a friend who has been acting as their spokesperson. Instead, the husband of a fellow detainee at the Clinton County Correctional Facility called Ester Soliman’s son, Sam, to say his mother had been moved. Sam and Soliman’s other two adult children, Sandra and Sanjee, remain in Lancaster.

As of 1 p.m. Friday, Soliman was still shown in ICE’s online detainee locator, but the correctional facility had been removed. Once people are deported, they are removed from the system entirely. Efforts to reach Soliman’s attorney on Friday were not immediately successful.

When ICE returned Soliman’s phone in the airport, she called her children, according to Myers. In another statement to the fundraising page, the family called the situation “a nightmare.”

ICE was not immediately available for a comment or to confirm the deportation but had previously released a statement on Soliman’s case.

“She legally entered the U.S. on a B-2 tourist visa that allowed her to remain in the U.S. until March 4, 2000,” Tricia McLaughlin, the head of the Department of Homeland Security’s public communications, said Monday. “Over 25 years later, she is still illegally in the U.S. A judge issued her a final order of removal in 2011, and her appeal was denied.”

According to state court records, Soliman has two traffic tickets on record and no other incidents. A Manheim Township police officer issued Soliman citations on July 28, 2025, for improper safety restraints for a child under four years and for driving without a license. She was allowed to leave the scene after the citations when someone came to pick her up, according to Manheim Township Police Department spokesperson Sgt. Barry Waltz, Jr.

Soliman came to the U.S. with her husband, Albert S. Soliman, who died in 2015, according to a death notice published in LNP. Soliman never went back to the Philippines, according to Myers. Soliman still has family there, who have been notified and who plan to be at the airport when she lands. Her full name, as used by ICE, is Estrelita Soliman-Ramos.

Earlier Friday, the family posted an update to the fundraising page that the government denied a legal motion, called a “stay of removal,” meant to postpone deportation.

In that post, they called for help from the public to amplify Soliman’s case by calling elected officials in the hopes of keeping her in-country.

The advocacy and affinity group Lancaster Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders released a statement Friday evening calling Soliman “a cherished mother and friend” and said her deportation was a worst-case scenario.

“We are overwhelmed with grief and fury that our beloved Ester is not with her family in Lancaster, a place she has called home for 25 years,” Cindy Lam, president of Lancaster AAPI, said. “We are holding the entire Soliman family in our hearts right now as we process and mourn this new tragic reality.”

Over the last week, the family raised $88,431 through a crowdsourced fundraising tool called GoFundMe, an outpouring of support that surpassed their original goal of $35,000.

Several notable public figures and community leaders gave money, including Rep. Izzy Smith-Wade-El, a Democrat whose 49th District includes half of Lancaster city.

The Supreme Court of California ruled that the FAA does not preempt a state law requiring prompt payment of arbitration fees, interpreting the requirement in the context of other statutes and legal principles that may excuse an untimely payment.

The court clarified that employers may not automatically forfeit their right to arbitration for late fee payments if those delays are not willful or grossly negligent.

The ruling emphasizes that parties can negotiate their own payment timelines in arbitration agreements.

In Hohenshelt v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County (Golden State Foods Corp., Real Party in Interest), the California high court addressed a state court split over whether the FAA preempts Code of Civil Procedure Section 1281.98, which imposes a thirty-day deadline to pay arbitration fees. California courts have interpreted the statute as deeming a failure to pay in a timely manner to be a material breach of the arbitration agreement, regardless of the circumstances, and automatically deny companies their rights to arbitration.

Some courts have held that such an inflexible rule hinders arbitration and conflicts with the FAA, which requires states to place arbitration agreements on equal footing as other contracts. According to those courts, because other contracts are not forced to comply with this stringent rule, the FAA preempts this law. Other courts have held that the statute is not preempted because it promotes the goals of the FAA by ensuring the timely payment of invoices and keeping arbitration proceedings moving without unnecessary delay.

In Hohenshelt, the California supreme court rejected a “rigid construction” of the statute The court held that the statute is not preempted by the FAA, but also concluded that the law does not stop a court from excusing the untimely payment based on established contract principles unless the “nonperformance is willful, grossly negligent, or fraudulent.” Importantly, the court also held that the parties to the arbitration agreement can set by agreement the due date for arbitration fees payments.

Background

Section 1281.98 was added as part of the 2019 amendments to the California Arbitration Act in Senate Bill (SB) 707. The statute provides that when an employment or consumer arbitration requires the drafting party to pay arbitration fees and costs, “if the fees or costs are not paid within 30 days after the due date, the drafting party is in material breach of the arbitration agreement, is in default of the arbitration, and waives its right to compel the employee or consumer to proceed with that arbitration.” The statute then allows the employee or consumer to “unilaterally … [w]ithdraw the claim from arbitration and proceed” to court. The employee or consumer is entitled to mandatory sanctions and attorneys’ fees accrued in arbitration upon return to court.

In Hohenshelt, an employee of Golden State Foods Corp. sought to withdraw his claims from arbitration after the employer paid arbitration fees more than thirty days after the arbitrator invoiced them, but before a final payment deadline set by the arbitrator.

The California Second District Court of Appeal ruled that the clear language of Section 1281.98 requires that payments are “due upon receipt,” any extension of time for fee payment must be agreed upon by all parties, and that the statute does not let an arbitrator cure a party’s missed payment. The appellate court sent the claims back to the trial court even though the arbitration proceedings had been ongoing for a year and the employer had spent more than $50,000 in arbitration fees and costs.

FAA Preemption

The Supreme Court of California read the statute in a way that saves it from FAA preemption. The court said Section 1281.98 must be considered in the context of the “backdrop of longstanding statutes that authorize courts to prevent unjust forfeitures of contractual rights” and legislative history suggesting the law was meant to stop parties from “strategically withholding” the payment of arbitration fees and costs as a tactic to delay and frustrate the arbitration proceedings. (Emphasis in the original.)

The court interpreted Section 1281.98 as not mandating that fees “invariably be paid within 30 days of the arbitrator’s invoice regardless of the parties’ preferences.” Instead, the statute imposes a “default rule” for when fees are due, and “parties are free to contract for any due date they want by adopting their own ‘provision in the arbitration agreement stating the number of days in which the parties to the arbitration must pay any required fees or costs.’”

In this context, the supreme court found that the statute does not treat arbitration agreements differently from other contracts and does not undermine the goals of the FAA. The supreme court admitted that if the statute were read only by the plain text, without incorporating other elements of California law, “any failure to make timely payment, regardless of the circumstances, invariably results in forfeiture of arbitral rights, the statute would be anomalous in the context of general contract law principles.” This would result in FAA preemption. However, the court explained that “a drafting party can avoid forfeiture of its right to arbitration by showing that the delay was excusable” under other laws and background legal principles that generally apply to contracts.

Key Takeaways

The Supreme Court of California’s decision in Hohenshelt found that the FAA does not preempt Section 1281.98, by allowing courts to keep claims in arbitration even if arbitration fees are not paid in accordance with the statute. The ruling states that mere technical violations or oversights could excuse employers’ late payment so long as there is no evidence that the late payment was deliberate or due to gross negligence.

Additionally, the court said parties may agree to other terms as the statute only provides a “default rule.” That means employers concerned with the time limits in Section 1281.98 may include a provision in arbitration agreements setting when invoices are due. Employers may want to consider adding such a provision or revising and updating existing arbitration agreements with such a provision to avoid the deadline in Section 1281.98.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-08/California%20State%20Flag%20CA%20Litigation%20Gavel%20Court-467322005.jpg.webp?itok=7UnBuKDV,N,,2025-08-16 11:59:15.130214

Trump’s takeover is historic, yet it had played out with a slow ramp-up in federal law enforcement officials and National Guard troops to start the week.
An attorney for the Trump administration, Yaakov Roth, said the move to sideline Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith came after an immigration order that still held back some aid to federal authorities.
The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief’s instructions because they allowed for continued practice of “sanctuary policies,” which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.
As the District challenged the Trump administration in court Friday, more than 100 protesters gathered less than a block away in front of police headquarters, chanting ""Protect home rule!” and waving signs saying “Resist!""","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Friday reversed course and agreed to leave the Washington, D.C., police chief in control of the department, while Attorney General Pam Bondi, in a new memo, directed the District’s police to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement regardless of any city law.

The order from Bondi came after officials in the nation’s capital sued Friday to block President Donald Trump’s takeover of the Washington police. The night before, his administration had escalated its intervention into the city’s law enforcement by naming a federal official as the new emergency head of the department, essentially placing the police force under the full control of the federal government.

The attorney general’s new order represents a partial retreat for the Trump administration in the face of intense skepticism from a judge over the legality of Bondi's earlier directive. But Bondi also signaled the administration would continue to pressure D.C. leaders to help federal authorities aggressively pursue immigrants in the country illegally, despite city laws on the books that limit cooperation between police and immigration authorities.

In a social media post Friday evening, Bondi criticized D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, saying he “continues to oppose our efforts to improve public safety.” But she added, “We remain committed to working closely with Mayor Bowser.”

Mayor Muriel Bowser’s office said late Friday that it was still evaluating how it can comply with the new Bondi order on immigration enforcement operations. The police department already eased some restrictions on cooperating with federal officials facilitating Trump’s mass-deportation campaign but reaffirmed that it would follow the district’s sanctuary city laws.

In a letter sent Friday night to D.C. citizens, Bowser wrote: “It has been an unsettling and unprecedented week in our city. Over the course of a week, the surge in federal law enforcement across D.C. has created waves of anxiety.”

She added that “our limited self-government has never faced the type of test we are facing right now,” but added that if Washingtonians stick together, “we will show the entire nation what it looks like to fight for American democracy – even when we don’t have full access to it.”

The legal battle was the latest evidence of the escalating tensions in a mostly Democratic city that now has its police department largely under the control of the Republican president's administration. Trump’s takeover is historic, yet it had played out with a slow ramp-up in federal law enforcement officials and National Guard troops to start the week.

As the weekend approached, though, signs across the city — from the streets to the legal system — suggested a deepening crisis over who controls the city’s immigration and policing policies, the district’s right to govern itself and daily life for the millions of people who live and work in the metro area.

The two sides sparred in court for hours Friday before U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, who is overseeing the district's lawsuit. She indicated the law likely doesn’t grant the Trump administration power to fully take over city police, but it probably does give the president more power than the city might like.

“The way I read the statute, the president can ask, the mayor must provide, but the president can’t control,” said Reyes, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden. The judge pushed the two sides to make a compromise.

An attorney for the Trump administration, Yaakov Roth, said the move to sideline Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith came after an immigration order that still held back some aid to federal authorities. He argued that the president has broad authority to determine what kind of help police in Washington must provide.

The police takeover is the latest move by Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the United States illegally.

It also marks one of the most sweeping assertions of federal authority over a local government in modern times. While Washington has grappled with spikes in violence and visible homelessness, the city’s homicide rate ranks below those of several other major U.S. cities, and the capital is not in the throes of the public safety collapse the Trump administration has portrayed.

The president has more power over the nation’s capital than other cities, but D.C. has elected its own mayor and city council since the Home Rule Act was signed in 1973.

Trump is the first president to exert control over the city’s police force since it was passed. The law limits that control to 30 days without congressional approval, though Trump has suggested he’d seek to extend it.

Bondi’s Thursday night directive to place the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terry Cole, in charge of the police department came even after Smith had told MPD officers hours earlier to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody, such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief’s instructions because they allowed for continued practice of “sanctuary policies,” which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.

Meanwhile, advocates in Washington were trying to advise immigrants on how to respond. Anusce Sanai, associate legal director for the Washington-based immigrant nonprofit Ayuda, said they're still parsing the legal aspects of the policies.

“Even with the most anti-immigrant administration, we would always tell our clients that they must call the police, that they should call the police,"" Sanai said. “But now we find ourselves that we have to be very careful on what we advise.”

Amy Fischer, an organizer with Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid, said that before the federal takeover, most of what they had seen in the nation’s capital was Immigration and Customs Enforcement targeting specific individuals. But since last Friday night they’ve seen a “really significant change,” she said, with ICE and federal officers doing roving patrols around the city.

She said a hotline set up by immigration advocates to report ICE activity “is receiving calls almost off the hook.”

ICE said in a post on X that their teams had arrested “several” people in Washington Friday. A video posted on X showed two uniformed personnel putting handcuffs on someone while standing outside a white transport van.

A population already tense from days of ramp-up has begun seeing more significant shows of force across the city. National Guard troops watched over some of the world’s most renowned landmarks, and Humvees took position in front of the busy main train station. Volunteers helped homeless people leave long-standing encampments — to where was often unclear.

Twenty federal law enforcement teams had fanned out across the city Thursday night with more than 1,750 people joining the operation, said a White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the operation. They made 33 arrests, including 15 migrants who did not have permanent legal status, the official said. Others were arrested on warrants for murder, rape and driving under the influence.

As the District challenged the Trump administration in court Friday, more than 100 protesters gathered less than a block away in front of police headquarters, chanting ""Protect home rule!” and waving signs saying “Resist!""

Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis has told members of the California congressional delegation that she is thinking about running for the new seat.","A decade and a half after California voters stripped lawmakers of the ability to draw the boundaries of congressional districts, Gov. Gavin Newsom and fellow Democrats are pushing to take that partisan power back.

The redistricting plan taking shape in Sacramento and headed toward voters in November could shift the Golden State’s political landscape for at least six years, if not longer, and sway which party controls the U.S. House of Representatives after the 2026 midterm elections — which will be pivotal to the fate of President Trump’s political agenda.

What Golden State voters choose to do will reverberate nationwide, killing some political careers and launching others, provoking other states to reconfigure their own congressional districts and boosting Newsom’s profile as a top Trump nemesis and leader of the nation’s Democratic resistance.

The new maps, drawn by Democratic strategists and lawmakers behind closed doors, were submitted to legislative leaders by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee on Friday. They are expected to appear on a Nov. 4 special election ballot, along with a constitutional amendment that would override the state’s voter-approved, independent redistricting commission.

The changes would ripple across hundreds of miles of California, from the forests near the Oregon state line through the deserts of Death Valley and Palm Springs to the U.S.-Mexico border, expanding Democrats’ grip on California and further isolating Republicans.

The proposed map would concentrate Republican voters in a handful of deep-red districts and eliminate an Inland Empire congressional seat represented by the longest-serving member of California’s GOP delegation. For Democrats, the plans would boost the fortunes of up-and-coming politicians and shore up vulnerable incumbents in Congress, including two new lawmakers who won election by fewer than 1,000 votes last fall.

“This is the final declaration of political war between California and the Trump administration,” said Thad Kousser, a political science professor at UC San Diego.

How will the ballot measure work?

For the state to reverse the independent redistricting process that the electorate approved in 2010, a majority of California voters would have to approve the measure, which backers are calling the “Election Rigging Response Act.”

The state Legislature, where Democrats hold a supermajority in both the Assembly and Senate, will consider the ballot language next week when lawmakers return from summer recess. Both chambers would need to pass the ballot language by a two-thirds majority and get the bill to Newsom’s desk by Aug. 22, leaving just enough time for voter guides to be mailed and ballots to be printed.

The ballot language has not been released. But the decision about approving the new map would ultimately be up to the state’s electorate, which backed independent redistricting in 2010 by more than 61%. Registered Democrats outnumber Republican voters by almost a two-to-one margin in California, providing a decided advantage for supporters of the measure.

Newsom has said that the measure would include a “trigger,” meaning the state’s maps would only take effect if a Republican state — including Texas, Florida and Indiana — approve new mid-decade maps.

“There’s still an exit ramp,” Newsom said. “We’re hopeful they don’t move forward.”

Explaining the esoteric concept of redistricting and getting voters to participate in an off-year election will require that Newsom and his allies, including organized labor, launch what is expected to be an expensive campaign very quickly.

“It’s summer in California,” Kousser said. “People are not focused on this.”

California has no limit on campaign contributions for ballot measures, and a measure that pits Democrats against Trump, and Republicans against Newsom, could become a high-stakes, high-cost national brawl.

“It’s tens of millions of dollars, and it’s going to be determined on the basis of what an opposition looks like as well,” Newsom said Thursday. The fundraising effort, he said, is “not insignificant... considering the 90-day sprint.”

The ballot measure’s campaign website mentions three major funding sources thus far: Newsom’s gubernatorial campaign, the main political action committee for House Democrats in Washington, and Manhattan Beach businessman Bill Bloomfield, a longtime donor to California Democrats.

Those who oppose the mid-decade redistricting are also expected to be well-funded, and will argue that this effort betrays the will of the voters who approved independent congressional redistricting in 2010.

What’s at stake?

Control of the U.S. House of Representatives hangs in the balance.

The party that holds the White House tends to lose House seats during the midterm election. Republicans hold a razor-thin majority in the House, and Democrats taking control of chamber in 2026 would stymie Trump’s controversial, right-wing agenda in his final two years in office.

Redistricting typically only happens once a decade, after the U.S. census. But Trump has been prodding Republican states, starting with Texas, to redraw their lines in the middle of the decade to boost the GOP’s chances in the midterms.

At Trump’s encouragement, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called a special legislative session to redraw the Texas congressional map to favor five more Republicans. In response, Newsom and other California Democrats have called for their own maps that would favor five more Democrats.

Texas Democratic lawmakers fled the state to deny the Legislature a quorum and stop the vote. They faced daily fines, death threats and calls to be removed from office. They agreed to return to Austin after the special session ended on Friday, with one condition being that California Democrats moved forward with their redistricting plan.

The situation has the potential to spiral into an all-out redistricting arms race, with Trump leaning on Indiana, Florida, Ohio and Missouri to redraw their maps, while Newsom is asking the same of blue states including New York and Illinois.

California Republicans in the crosshairs

The California gerrymandering plan targets five of California’s nine Republican members of Congress: Reps. Kevin Kiley and Doug LaMalfa in Northern California, Rep. David Valadao in the Central Valley, and Reps. Ken Calvert and Darrell Issa in Southern California.

The map consolidates Republican voters into a smaller number of ruby-red districts known as “vote sinks.” Some conservative and rural areas would be shifted into districts where Republican voters would be diluted by high voter registration advantage for Democrats.

The biggest change would be for Calvert, who would see his Inland Empire district eliminated.

Calvert has been in Congress since 1992 and represents a sprawling Riverside County district that includes Lake Elsinore, Menifee, Palm Springs and his home base of Corona. Calvert, who oversees defense spending on the powerful House Appropriations Committee, comfortably won reelection last year despite a well-funded national campaign by Democrats.

Under the proposed map, the Inland Empire district would be carved up and redistributed, parceled out to a district represented by Rep. Young Kim (R-Anaheim Hills). Liberal Palm Springs would be shifted into the district represented by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Bonsall), which would help tilt the district from Republican to a narrowly divided swing seat.

Members of Congress are not required to live in their districts, but there would not be an obvious seat for Calvert to run for, unless he ran against Kim or Issa.

Leaked screenshots of the map began to circulate Friday afternoon, prompting fierce and immediate pushback from California Republicans.

The lines are “third-world dictator stuff,” Orange County GOP chair Will O’Neill said on X, and the “slicing and dicing of Orange County cities is obscene.”

In Northern California, the boundaries of Kiley’s district would shrink and dogleg into the Sacramento suburbs to add registered Democrats. Kiley said in a post on the social media site X that he expected his district to stay the same because voters would “defeat Newsom’s sham initiative and vindicate the will of California voters.”

LaMalfa’s district would shift south, away from the rural and conservative areas along the Oregon border, and pick up more liberal areas in parts of Sonoma County,

In Central California, boundaries would shift to shore up Reps. Josh Harder (D-Tracy) and Adam Gray (D-Merced). Gray won election last year by 187 votes, the narrowest margin in the country.

Valadao, a perennial target for Democrats, would see the northern boundary of his district stretch into the bluer suburbs of Fresno. Democrats have tried for years to unseat Valadao, who represents a district that has a strong Democratic voter registration advantage on paper, but where turnout among blue voters is lackluster.

Democrats eye open seats

The maps include a new congressional seat in Los Angeles County that would stretch through the southeast cities of Downey, Santa Fe Springs, Whittier and Lakewood. An open seat in Congress is a rare opportunity for politicians, especially in deep-blue Los Angeles County, where incumbent lawmakers can keep their jobs for decades.

Portions of that district were once represented by retired U.S. Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, the first Mexican American woman elected to Congress. That seat was eliminated in the 2021 redistricting cycle, when California lost a congressional seat for the first time in its history.

Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis has told members of the California congressional delegation that she is thinking about running for the new seat.

Another possible contender, former Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon of Lakewood, launched a campaign for state superintendent of schools in late July and may be out of the mix.

Other lawmakers who represent the area or areas nearby include state Sens. Blanca Rubio (D-Baldwin Park) and Bob Archuleta (D-Pico Rivera) and Assemblywoman Lisa Calderon (D-Whittier).

In Northern California, the southern tip of LaMalfa’s district would stretch south into the Sonoma County cities of Santa Rosa and Healdsberg, home to Senate Pro Tem Mike McGuire. McGuire will be termed out of the state Senate next year, and the new seat might present a prime opportunity for him to go to Washington.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/73bac84/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3d%2Fe9%2F5a2d1f694926ab3532c6d847e055%2F1518278-me-newsom-redistricting-plan10-ajs.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 20:56:40.407533

On August 13, 2025, ICE arrested Noelia Saray Martinez-Avila—a criminal illegal alien from Honduras—who struck a vehicle while driving the wrong direction on a highway, killing 18-year-old Hallie Helgeson at the scene on July 20. Martinez-Avila also gravely injured 19-year-old Brady Heiling who died from his injuries on July 25.

Noelia Saray Martinez-Avila was charged with two counts of felony vehicular homicide and impaired driving by Wisconsin law enforcement. ICE lodged an arrest detainer for this illegal alien’s arrest and removal from the country. Despite this sanctuary jurisdiction giving ICE less than an hour notice to make the arrest, ICE nabbed this criminal alien.

The administration filed motions to join existing cases against the state over its rules seeking to reduce pollution and planet-warming emissions from trucks.

The moves come after the Trump administration axed California’s rules — but did so in a legally contested manner.

Now, the Trump administration and truckmakers are accusing the state of enforcing the now-overturned standards through its “Clean Truck Partnership” under which truck companies agreed to follow the state’s rules in exchange for some additional flexibility.

The California Air Resources Board, which is in charge of the truck rules, declined to comment.

At issue are California rules including the Advanced Clean Trucks rule, which would require a large percentage of trucks sold in the state to be electric by 2035.

Under the Clean Air Act, California is required to get federal approval for its auto regulations. The Biden administration approved the state’s rule.

This year, however, Congress and President Trump approved a resolution using the Congressional Review Act to overturn the approval of the California rule.

The move occurred despite determinations from the Senate parliamentarian and the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog, which said that it was not subject to the Congressional Review Act.

Now, the Trump administration is arguing in court that California has sought to enforce its rules through the Clean Truck Partnership, describing the state’s effort as a “a stunning act of defiance.”

Section 740 of the Home Rule Act allows the president to request the use of the Metropolitan Police Department for federal law enforcement purposes in emergency situations, but the act keeps control of the department with the mayor and police chief. The authority is also limited to no more than 30 days without congressional approval.

Bondi’s original directive claimed to replace MPD Chief Pamela Smith by appointing Drug Enforcement Administration Administrator Terry Cole as “emergency police commissioner,” granting him “all the powers and duties vested in the D.C. Chief of Police.”

During an evidentiary hearing Friday, Reyes appeared skeptical of the DOJ’s claim that Bondi could replace Smith and issue orders directly to the MPD. The judge said such an arrangement would effectively give Trump personal control over the police department.

“The statute would have no meaning at all if the president could just say we’re taking over your police department,” Reyes said.

Reyes also noted that the DOJ was arguing Trump could personally control the MPD even though the Home Rule Act bars the president from directly communicating with the department.

“You’re making the argument that the president can basically run the entire police department based on language that doesn’t even allow the president to talk to the police department,” she told DOJ lawyers.

Bondi’s Backtrack

By Friday evening, Bondi issued a revised directive. The new order abandons the provision giving Cole full control over the MPD and instead lists specific “services” the attorney general deems necessary under Section 740(a). The mayor must provide these services and Cole is tasked only with overseeing those limited functions.

The revised order still directs MPD to:

Assist with enforcing federal immigration law and locating undocumented immigrants.

Comply with all federal law enforcement database and information requests.

Strictly enforce D.C.’s unlawful public space occupancy law.

The changes avoid directly replacing the chief or requiring all MPD orders to go through Cole, but they maintain aggressive policy shifts on immigration enforcement and homelessness.

Legal Stakes

In his suit, Schwalb alleged Trump, through Bondi’s directive, far exceeded his authority under the Home Rule Act and violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Constitution.

The lawsuit argues Bondi’s original directive endangered public safety by upending MPD’s command structure.

“There is no greater risk to public safety in a large, professional law enforcement organization like MPD than to not know who is in command,” the complaint reads.

During the hearing, DOJ lawyers acknowledged Trump will have no authority to continue using the MPD if Congress does not pass legislation extending his order federalizing the department — contradicting the president’s earlier claims that he could act without Congress in an emergency.

“If it’s a national emergency we can do it without Congress, but we expect to be before Congress very quickly,” Trump said earlier this week.

The Trump administration is expected to appeal to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.

In addition to attempting to federalize the MPD, Trump has sent hundreds of federal law enforcement agents and deployed the D.C. National Guard to the capital.

He claimed the National Guard deployment and surge in federal personnel were needed to address rampant homelessness and violent crime, even as MPD data show crime is declining.

Trump’s use of the National Guard within the district could be affected by an upcoming court decision over his deployment of military troops in Los Angeles earlier this year.",https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2229574059-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 20:56:45.706741

The detention has been condemned by the county’s top judge and the man’s lawyers, who said such operations will deter people from showing up to court.

Video obtained by the Los Angeles Times shows the man being carried away with his hands bound behind his back. Those detaining him are in plainclothes, and some are wearing masks. The detained man repeatedly screams, “Can you help me, please?” as his body flails.

The man is then pushed into the back seat of an unmarked car. It’s not clear where he was taken.

Neither ICE nor the Department of Homeland Security responded to CNN’s questions about whether ICE was involved in the detention or why the man was detained. But the incident happened as ICE increasingly make arrests at courthouses under recent guidance from the Trump administration.

Los Angeles County Superior Court’s presiding judge issued a critical statement in response to questions about Wednesday’s incident, saying such operations will have a negative effect on the judicial system.

“While the court is rarely notified of federal immigration enforcement activity occurring outside our courthouse, I am deeply disturbed by such actions,” the presiding judge, Sergio C. Tapia II, said in a release.

“These intimidating and unnecessary displays undermine public trust in the justice system, deter people from seeking justice, and send a dangerous message to immigrant communities that they are not safe to fully and freely participate in the legal process.”

In Wednesday’s video, an onlooker asks for the name of the man being detained, and he replies, “Steven Reyes.”

Court records show a man named Steven Reyes, who is represented by the Los Angeles County Alternate Public Defender’s Office, had an appearance at the county’s criminal justice center Wednesday on a state felony charge of having or buying illegal drugs with the intent to sell them. Records show he had pleaded not guilty to the charge on July 31 and was free on his own recognizance.

The man detained in the video is represented by the Los Angeles County Alternate Public Defender’s Office, spokesperson Jenny Cheng said. She did not confirm if the man detained is the same Steven Reyes with the drug charge.

“These alleged ICE agents, without a warrant or any explanation, clearly deprived our client of his liberty without due process,” Cheng said in an email to CNN.

“It shocks the conscience to see any human violently abducted by a group of mostly masked unidentified individuals. Such aggressive ICE abductions threaten the integrity of the court system and discourage participation.”

Wednesday’s detention happened outside the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center, according to the Times and the LA Public Press, which told CNN it obtained the video from a witness and published a shorter, edited clip on social media.

In the longer video published by the Times, an onlooker asks one of the men detaining Reyes whether he is from ICE. The man responds, “yes.”

When further questioned by an onlooker, the man quickly flashes a badge twice. While the footage is too blurry to show exactly what the badge says, it resembles a Homeland Security Investigations badge.

The person who appears to be taking the video asks if the men have arrest warrants, and the men do not respond to that question.

CNN has reached out to ICE for information about the arrest, whether Reyes is in the country illegally, whether he is in ICE custody, where he is being held, and exactly what charges he faces.

ICE and the Department of Homeland Security previously operated unde r guidelines that limited immigration enforcement at or near courthouses, but the Trump administration rescinded those guidelines shortly into the president’s second term. Masked law enforcement officers have been showing up at courthouses across the country to arrest migrants.

Trump officials have argued the previous guidance hampered the ability of immigration enforcement officers to apprehend people they say are dangerous individuals.

“The ability of law enforcement to make arrests of criminal illegal aliens in courthouses is common sense,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a May news release. “It conserves valuable law enforcement resources because they already know where a target will be. It is also safer for our officers and the community. These illegal aliens have gone through security and been screened to not have any weapons.”

Immigrant rights groups have said th e increasing number of courthouse arrests by ICE reflect a broader trend of enforcement extending into places once considered out of bounds and no longer confined to border crossings or work sites.

The Los Angeles County district attorney’s office, which is prosecuting Reyes for the drug charge, said it had no prior knowledge of and played no part in Wednesday’s detention outside of court.

“Our ultimate goal is to seek justice for victims and hold criminals accountable,” the district attorney’s office wrote in a statement. “Detaining a defendant before the judicial process has concluded interferes with our ability to prosecute cases and is not to the advantage of the pursuit of justice.”

Despite public dispute, Dane County apparently released suspect into ICE custody After Martinez-Avila's arrest, the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS, asked Dane County law enforcement officials to help transfer her to ICE custody so she could be deported.","MADISON — A Dane County judge raised bail to $5 million for a Honduran woman accused of killing two teens in a drunken-driving crash and ordered federal immigration authorities to return her to county custody.

State prosecutors are fighting for custody of 30-year-old Noelia Martinez-Avila amid a dispute with federal immigration authorities over whether she can be deported before she faces homicide charges.

Martinez-Avila's attorney posted her $250,000 bail on Aug. 13, and she was taken into federal custody as soon as she was released from Dane County Jail.

That prompted prosecutors to request a hearing to raise her bail amount and raised questions about how federal authorities knew of her release despite the sheriff's public pledges that he does not cooperate with immigration agents.

According to a press release by the Department of Homeland Security, Dane County Sheriff's Office gave U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, less than an hour’s notice before Martinez-Avila was released.

The sheriff's office did immediately not respond to questions Friday evening about why it notified ICE despite pledges not to cooperate with the agency.

Martinez-Avila is accused of drunkenly driving the wrong way on Highway I-90 in DeForest on July 20 and crashing into a car carrying Hallie Helgeson, 18, and Brady Heiling, 19.

Helgeson died at the scene. Heiling, her boyfriend, died from his injuries five days later.

President Donald Trump's efforts to ramp up his nationwide immigration crackdown have led ICE agents to increasingly go after people who have been charged but not yet convicted of crimes. Some have been deported before they could face trial or serve their sentence.

Some prosecutors have criticized this practice, saying it makes communities less safe and denies victims the opportunity to get justice.

Martinez-Avila faces six felony and three misdemeanor charges, including two counts of homicide by intoxicated use of a vehicle. Her initial $250,000 bail was set before Heiling died and before her immigration status came into question.

In Wisconsin, defendants are required to post their entire bail amount before being released. Prosecutors can request judges hold defendants without bail for certain serious offenses, but that does not include homicide by intoxicated use of a vehicle.

At an Aug. 15 hearing, Heiling's mother begged Dane County Circuit Judge Dianne Schlipper to raise or revoke bail to force Martinez-Avila to face the charges.

""She took my baby, my beautiful boy,"" said Jennifer Heiling through tears, while she was flanked by her husband and two children on a video call. ""She chose this, and they were just trying to come home to us.""

Deputy District Attorney William Brown asked the judge to increase Martinez-Avila's bail amount to $20 million, noting she was able to post a $250,000 bail within a few weeks.

Brown said if she remains in federal custody, it's likely ICE will move to deport her to Honduras, effectively ending the case against her.

""My fear is if bail is not raised that will likely happen very soon, and as soon as she is out of the country, there is little to no chance we will ever prosecute this person,"" he said.

After setting bail at $5 million, the judge also agreed to sign an order proposed by Brown to transport Martinez-Avila back to Dane County Jail.

Martinez-Avila did not appear in person and remained in custody at Waukesha County Jail on an ICE hold. An interpreter relayed the court proceedings by phone.

Her attorney, Anthony Delyea, opposed the order to return her to Dane County. He said prosecutors were seeking to ""get around the constitution"" by denying her right to face federal proceedings.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Aug. 15.

Despite public dispute, Dane County apparently released suspect into ICE custody

After Martinez-Avila's arrest, the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS, asked Dane County law enforcement officials to help transfer her to ICE custody so she could be deported.

DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin also called out Dane County as having ""a history of not honoring ICE arrest detainers, often leading to the release of murderers and other heinous criminals.""

At the time, those demands were resisted by Dane County Sheriff Kalvin Barrett, who said allowing her to be deported would amount to a ""get out of jail free"" card.

But this week, ""it appears the jail released the defendant into ICE custody after business hours"" on Aug. 13 after her bail was posted, wrote Assistant District Attorney Alexandra Keyes in a court filing.

In a press release, DHS said ICE was given less than an hour’s notice by “this sanctuary jurisdiction” to arrest her.

Prosecutors also argued the jail did not follow court-ordered conditions of her release, including giving her a GPS and alcohol monitor and obtaining prior approval by Pretrial Services.

The Dane County Sheriff's Office disputed that, telling the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that the jail is a 24/7 facility and deputies followed her bail conditions. It is common practice not to use a GPS device if they know a person is being taken directly to another secure facility, according to a statement from the office.

In addition, Martinez-Avila was under the custody of the sheriff's office when ICE detained her, and federal agents had legal authority to do so, the sheriff's office said.

In an email Aug. 14, the sheriff said he stands by his previous statements that Martinez-Avila's deportation would rob victims' families of the opportunity for justice and closure.

""Still, I am fully aware that, as sheriff, certain aspects of the justice system are beyond my control,"" Barrett said.

ICE requests cooperation from local jails as national crackdown continues

Because of the large territory they cover, ICE agents often rely on local sheriff's offices to give them a heads up before people who may be subject to deportation are released from local jails.

ICE often does this through non-legally binding ""detainer"" requests. These are requests from federal immigration authorities to local law enforcement agencies to delay releasing immigrants from their jails until immigration agents arrive to take them into custody.

Amid Trump's nationwide immigration crackdown, local law enforcement officials have been scrutinized for how much — or how little — they cooperate.

Barrett is one of a few sheriffs in Wisconsin who has stated he will not honor detainers, earning the county a reputation as a ""sanctuary"" jurisdiction and the scorn of federal immigration officials.

In July, Barrett told the Journal Sentinel he would not cooperate with ICE unless immigration agents presented an arrest warrant signed by a judge.

Months earlier, he had told the Journal Sentinel that his office does not actively cooperate with ICE unless its cooperation is required by law as part of an effort to build trust with immigrant communities.

The case in Dane County is similar to another playing out in Milwaukee, where local prosecutors and federal immigration officials are in a back-and-forth over the custody of a 36-year-old man charged with sexual assault.

In Milwaukee, prosecutors argued that deporting the defendant, Kevin Lopez, before the end of the case would deny his alleged victims their rights as crime victims. Lopez is being held in Milwaukee County Jail without bail. His trial date is scheduled for December.

Research has shown that undocumented immigrants have lower crime arrest rates than both native-born U.S. citizens and legal immigrants.

Immigration and criminal justice advocates have also pointed out that people charged with crimes are presumed innocent under the law.","https://www.jsonline.com/gcdn/presto/2018/08/15/PMJS/3276c9cd-f2e1-4371-8d22-45e3e31e498f-115_W_Doty_St_in_Madison._.jpeg?crop=2399,1349,x0,y240&width=2399&height=1349&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-15 22:56:33.241022

Rodriguez-Herrera initially claimed to be a Lawfully Admitted Permanent Resident (LAPR), and later explained that he “shared” a LAPR card with a friend who has similar physical attributes. However, when agents found a LAPR card bearing the name “Mario Rodriguez"" located inside Rodriguez-Herrera’s vehicle, they determined that it was a fraudulent document. Agents then confirmed that Rodriguez-Herrera was a citizen of Mexico, illegally present in the United States. Rodriguez-Herrera was charged by criminal complaint with Transportation of an Illegal Alien and Fraud and Misuse of Visas, Permits and Other Documents. [Case Number: 25-MJ-08447]

The three new facilities would expand ICE’s Colorado footprint by a total of 2,560 additional beds.

Colorado is currently home to one ICE detention facility, an Aurora processing center operated by private prison company The GEO Group.

Indiana dubbed the Speedway slammer similar in size to Florida's high security so-called alligator at pass facility Speedway slammer will triple triple the amount of ice beds in the Chicago region.

The announcement comes after orders from the Trump administration to ramp up immigration efforts and Democratic.

Let's to cities the Department of Homeland Security has said a quota of 3,000 arrest per day.

And joining us here today is Indiana State Representative Victoria.

That's Wilburn who represents parts of Indianapolis in Brandon Lee communications director for the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights.

Now, he also invited a number of Illinois and Indiana Republicans to join the conversation.

But the either declined or didn't respond.

Well, thank you both for joining Representative Wilburn, I want to start with Indiana Governor Mike Braun stated Indiana is taking a comprehensive and collaborative approach to combat illegal immigration and will continue to lead the way among state.

Where do you stand?

It's unfortunate that, you know, we have made light of a very grave situation.

>> Dubbing the facility Speedway slammer is dehumanizing at best.

And so Democrats in the state have been vocal all session about their apprehension towards plans.

What are your thoughts?

Pregnant?

You know?

>> As as you mentioned in the introduction, this has the potential to increase you know, it increase capacity 3 times in the in the region overseen by the Chicago office.

And that is the type of that is the type of move by the Trump administration and the governor of Indiana that really sets off the alarm for us that increased enforcement could become a talent as well.

>> And representative the detention center is set to house up to 1000 people awaiting deportation.

Are you concerned about the fiscal responsibilities these new facilities will impose on the state?

That's what I'm concerned about.

Obviously, the humanity issue is what I'm mostly concerned about.

But honestly, Indiana had a hard time making a neutral budget this year.

We had a 3 billion dollar deficit in our state.

Medicaid and we have called for transparency about how much as a state we are looking to fit this bill.

I think it's an egregious error to Hoosiers with what we call Indiana residence and should lawmakers have a say in these centers popping up in their districts?

Absolutely.

I think if we're going to be using state resources, we should be able to have an opinion about how these resources are spent.

And in all transparency, we also have a deficit in public safety officials.

We have a recruitment and retention problem for both our local departments and our sheriffs.

And I'm wondering if that is going to have the implication at detention centers as well.

What are you hearing from people live there?

The residents in Indiana?

Yeah.

I think there's apprehension.

Protests have started.

I have heard from my constituents directly that they don't want their law enforcement officers.

We've asked our law enforcement officers to do multiple things in Indiana.

Everything from mental health ambulance, Ryans to obviously fighting crime.

In addition to being in our local schools.

And now we're asking them to do another thing.

Our citizen see that our law enforcement is stretched very thin.

And this is a federal issue and we need to make sure that their federal resources that are being allocated to this.

But unfortunately, there's not a lot of transparency and Brandon members of ICE or have been active in traveling from Illinois to Indiana detention centers in the past.

What would you say?

They have observed and reported yet.

So.

>> In Illinois, we have supported state boat state legislation that has prevented the opening of additional ICE detention centers within our state.

We have also had members, individual leaders, faith leaders who have taken up the call to speak out against ICE detention in Indiana and elsewhere in the Midwest.

Truthfully.

It has been in conditions in ICE detention centers have been an ongoing concern for immigrant rights advocates for many, many years across multiple administrations.

And now the Trump administration is time to stand up additional detention centers seemingly overnight to house thousands of people.

With no oversight from the federal government are from representatives who aren't even being allowed view detention.

Reading what you said let's just say people who have been.

>> Residents here who of Chicago, lived here in called Chicago home for decades.

And, you know, our undocumented should they be worried?

>> I think that.

The worry is.

Brought on by the Trump administration creating this atmosphere of fear and by ice having seemingly no oversight and no accountability as coming to Chicago and the suburbs and everywhere across the country so I think that the best defense against Trump and the best way to sort of overcome that, the feeling the fear is to build community to be organized, to know your rights to look out for your neighbors and to know the resources that are available within your community and within your state.

Representative, what are your thoughts on what Brandon is saying?

Absolutely agree.

And I'm I'm so thankful for the strong coalitions that do exist here.

And Alan >> We in Indiana, really don't want to make another negative headline.

And unfortunately with Governor Braun at the how it's really difficult to say national headlines for all the wrong reasons.

And so there are several immigrant groups that mobilizing in Indiana as well.

The irony is that one of the detention centers was a former welcome center for Afghan refugees.

And we have come so far and that time, I mean, it's almost a cruel joke to now see it being used as a detention center and how many members would just save your community have been responding to the presence of ICE agents in a negative way.

I would say that, you know, there are people wanting to create and continue to create a sense of community and mobilization.

And so I think that they have been more vocal.

They have been more present and they're demanding lawmakers to pay attention and talking about there.

Is there any legislative action that can help that he needs in the facility?

Us?

We are working very hard to think about a bipartisan approach to humanity.

And so my caucus were certainly be working for towards next session towards offering a bell to make sure that I'm human rights are maintained.

And let's talk about agriculture as we know mass deportation efforts have cause a significant impact on the agriculture industry.

What have you seen in district?

Absolutely.

I mean, make no mistake about it.

Indiana isn't high cultural state.

That house is migrant seasonal farm workers.

Now the word migrant does not mean illegal.

There are several migrant farm workers from states like Texas and Colorado that choose to farm that are American citizens that we have seen cases in California and being swept up in this process and wrongfully detained.

Do you plan to offer any protections for these immigrant workers currently meeting with interested farm will be thinking about some creative legislation to make sure that their rights are preserved or use a passion about this.

I come from a migrant farm worker family.

So my father used to always say that they didn't cross the border.

The border crossed Generations of Americans.

My parents got very poor.

My mother actually farmed this tomato fields of Indiana.

And so if the irony isn't lost on me that I am proud to serve in the state legislature seemingly the highest seed of government.

that's why I'm so passionate about it for stories like my mother's and Brandon, what would use would like to see from legislative leaders as deportation efforts continue?

Yeah.

So.

>> You know, we're we're very pleased that a federal court recently upheld the state and local welcoming bus that community the immigrant community members and allies have fought for over the course of of years that trust at the Chicago.

city ordinance in the county detain policy.

And what we are hoping for is to strengthen those policies, including the trust act.

“OK, it looks like they’re starting,” the camera operator said into the radio to the Border Patrol agents.
They hear you guys.” The camera operator and the other personnel spoke in the professional, matter-of-fact tone of 911 operators.
“If you cut due south from your current location,” the drone pilot said to the camera operator.
“You should pick up some sign.” The camera operator, as directed, panned across the desert, scanning farther and farther south.","Inside a windowless and dark shipping container turned into a high-tech surveillance command center, two analysts peered at their own set of six screens that showed data coming in from an MQ-9 Predator B drone.

Both were looking for two adults and a child who had crossed the U.S.-Mexico border and had fled when a Border Patrol agent approached in a truck.

Inside the drone hangar on the other side of the Ft. Huachuca base sat another former shipping container, this one occupied by a drone pilot and a camera operator, who pivoted the drone’s camera to scan 9 square miles of shrubs and saguaros for the migrants. Like the command center, the onetime shipping container was lit mostly by the glow of the computer screens.

The hunt for the three migrants embodied how advanced technology has become a vital part of the Trump administration’s efforts to secure the border.

The Department of Homeland Security allocated 12,000 hours of MQ-9 drone flight time this year at the Ft. Huachuca base, and says the flights cost $3,800 per hour, though an inspector general report in 2015 said the amount is closer to $13,000 when factoring in personnel salaries and operational costs. Maintenance issues and bad weather often mean the drones fly around half the allotted hours, officials said.

With the precipitous drop in migrant crossings at the southern U.S. border, the drones are now tasked with fewer missions. That means they have the time to track small groups or even individual border jumpers trekking north through the desert.

This type of drone, first used in warfare, was operated by the National Air Security Operations division of Customs and Border Protection at the Army base about 70 miles south of Tucson. A reporter was allowed to observe the operation in April on the condition that personnel not be named and that no photographs be taken.

The drone flying this day was mounted with a radar, called Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar, or VaDER, that could identify any moving object in the drone’s sight, and pinpoint them with color-coded dots for the two analysts in the first container. The program had already located three Border Patrol agents, one on foot and two on motorcycles, searching for the migrants. The analysts had also identified three cows and two horses, headed toward Mexico.

Then, one of the analysts spotted something.

“We got them,” he said to his colleague, who had been scanning the terrain. “Good work.”

The analyst dropped a pin on the migrants and the VaDER program began tracking their movement in a blue trail. Now, he had to guide agents on the ground to them.

“We’ve got an adult male and a child, I think, tucked in this bush,” the analyst radioed to his team, as he toggled between the live video to an infrared camera view that showed the heat signature of every living thing in range. The analyst saw his Border Patrol colleagues approaching on motorcycles.

The roar of the oncoming machines scared up a bird, the tracking program showed. The migrants began running.

“OK, it looks like they’re starting,” the camera operator said into the radio to the Border Patrol agents. “They’re hearing the bikes. They hear you guys.” The camera operator and the other personnel spoke in the professional, matter-of-fact tone of 911 operators.

One adult and the child began scrambling up a hill. “They’re moving north and west, mainly,” the camera operator said. “Starting to pick up the pace going uphill.”

The agents rushed in on the pair and detained them. It was a mother and her child. The drone team turned its attention to the third person, who was stumbling through the brush and making a beeline for the Mexican border.

“If you cut due south from your current location,” the drone pilot said to the camera operator. “You should pick up some sign.”

The camera operator, as directed, panned across the desert, scanning farther and farther south.

“I’ve got them,” he said when he spotted someone running. He radioed the coordinates to the Border Patrol team.

By now, the man, carrying a backpack, had scaled a hill.

“He’s on the ridgeline right now, working his way up due south, slowly,” the camera operator radioed.

Then the man dropped something.

“Hey, mark that spot,” the camera operator said. “He just threw a pack, right here where my crosshairs are at. ”

Agents would go back later and see if the backpack contained drugs, an analyst said. “Usually, if it’s food or water, they’re not going to do that,” he said.

On this spring morning, the drone wasn’t the only airborne asset deployed. A helicopter had joined the chase to catch the southbound man, who stumbled, got up and kept running.

“He took a pretty good spill there,” an analyst said into the radio.

“We have a helo inbound, three point five minutes out,” the camera operator said.

A helicopter came into the drone’s view. It swooped in, circling the location of the man, who was by now hiding under a bush.

“You just passed over him,” the camera operator radioed the helicopter pilot. “He’s between you and that saguaro.”

With a keystroke, he switched to infrared vision to find the man’s heat profile through the brush to make sure he still had him.

Guided by the camera operator, the pilot landed the helicopter in a cloud of dust near the cowering target. The video feed showed agents jump out of the aircraft, detain the man and load him into the helicopter. The chopper lifted off and tilted back north toward a nearby Border Patrol post. “Thanks, sir, appreciate all the help,” the analyst said to the helicopter pilot.

Mission accomplished, the drone pilot turned the MQ-9 back along the U.S.-Mexico border, scanning the vast desert in search of more migrants. The military is planning to deliver a third MQ-9 drone to the base this fall after spending a year retrofitting it for civilian authority use.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/695d826/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+213/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F97%2Fba%2F45c8cf0f493483009efa171c3d04%2Fborder-drone-patrol.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 18:57:08.324052

The parties will continue to meet and discuss other issues raised against Bondi’s order in the DC attorney general’s lawsuit.
Reyes was appointed to the DC District Court by former President Joe Biden in February 2023.
The order misspelled Cole’s name as “Terrence.” “They misspelled his name on his badge” and on the order, Reyes said to DOJ attorney Jacob Roth.
Trump’s takeover of the Washington, DC, police places officers and residents at “grave risk,” the Metropolitan Police Department chief said Friday.","Under the changes to the Justice Department order directed by Judge Ana Reyes, DEA Administrator Terrance Cole will essentially be a liaison to the DC government, but the end result will be the same: The Trump administration retains control of the Metropolitan Police Department.

Mayor Muriel Bowser would still be required under the law to fulfill policing requests made by the Trump administration.

In effect, this does not change the overall impact of Bondi’s order or Trump’s emergency crime declaration earlier this week but instead creates a slightly more cumbersome process.

Attorneys for DC retain the right to go back to the judge if they are not satisfied with DOJ’s changes to the order.

The parties will continue to meet and discuss other issues raised against Bondi’s order in the DC attorney general’s lawsuit.

The Justice Department has until 6:30 p.m. to revamp an order that placed the DEA administrator in charge of DC police, or a federal judge will issue a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration.

Judge Ana Reyes ordered DOJ to rewrite the section of the executive order issued Thursday by Attorney General Pam Bondi that sought to take control of DC police by placing Terrance Cole in charge under President Donald Trump’s crime emergency declaration.

The change would direct Cole to issue directives through Mayor Muriel Bowser’s office, rather than directly to Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith.

“He’s going to have to go through the Mayor,” Reyes said after attorneys for the Justice Department and the DC attorney general said they needed 45 minutes to re-write that part of Bondi’s order.

“This lawsuit looks like a serious uphill climb for the DC Attorney General,” says Elie Honig, a CNN senior legal analyst and former federal prosecutor, “because the law – Section 740 – says the mayor shall provide such services of the Metro PD as the President may deem necessary and appropriate.”

“That is very broad language,” Honig said. “And what DC is trying to argue is, well, ‘provide such services’ does not mean take over our personnel.’”

But that argument, Honig noted, might not get very far in the long term given how it is up to the president to determine what actions are necessary.

Judge Ana Reyes is overseeing the hearing over Washington, DC’s request for a temporary restraining order to stop Trump’s takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department and appointment of an emergency commissioner.

Reyes was appointed to the DC District Court by former President Joe Biden in February 2023. Before being appointed to the court, Reyes spent much of her career as a litigation attorney for Williams and Connolly, LLP. She handled a variety of cases, including international litigation and representing foreign government officials.

Reyes has dealt with a handful of high-profile cases since joining the court. In February, the Justice Department filed a complaint against Reyes and accused her of misconduct while she was overseeing hearings regarding Trump’s executive order that called for banning transgender service members from the US military.

Reyes is often seen around the DC District courthouse with her golden retriever, Scout.

Judge Ana Reyes took a break during Friday’s hearing before telling both parties to try and come to an agreement over the order from Attorney General Pam Bondi at issue.

“I want to get to a practical solution because time is short and and there are people who need to know who they are taking direction from and what they are doing,” Reyes said.

Bondi’s order sought to have DEA Administrator Terrance Cole take over the DC police and void certain DC laws regarding immigration enforcement.

Reyes noted, however, that the Home Rule Act, which Trump relied on to take over MPD, allows for making law enforcement requests of the mayor, but not have direct control over the police force.

“The answer necessarily isn’t just to say this is wrong, start over,” Reyes said of Bondi’s order.

According to Reyes, the wording of the order, which instead of requesting services makes demands to override laws and impose an outside head of police, is the biggest issue.

“The problem is in the details,” Reyes said.

Reyes also questioned attorneys for the DC’s Attorney General over whether Trump’s requests could supersede DC laws and if the mayor is required to follow the president’s requests.

“There is no wiggle room in the statute,” Reyes said, “It says ‘the mayor shall.’ Not the mayor should or the mayor can, or if the president asks nicely. ‘The mayor shall.’”

The Trump administration agreed with the judge that President Donald Trump’s control over the DC police will end after the 30-day period without approval from Congress.

“Does the federal government agree that if the, if the Congress does not act within 30 days to extend the period, then … basically we’re done?” Judge Ana Reyes asked.

”Yes,” Roth responded.

Under the DC Home Rule Act, a request from the president to control the DC police department for over 30 days must be passed into law by Congress.

Trump has indicated he will ask Congress to extend the takeover.

Reyes has focused on the difference between the White House requesting services of the Metropolitan Police Department as opposed to telling the MPD what it cannot do regarding sanctuary city laws in the capital.

Several parts of the Trump administration’s takeover are at issue including whether the president can install an interim police commissioner to take control of the DC police or act more as a liaison between the president and the mayor’s office.

“This is also not a semantic issue,” Reyes said. “The president can’t say, ‘Mayor, I am asking you for the services of your entire police department. I need every single one of them to be at my beck and call, and I want them to listen to every federal agent out there.’”

Reyes added: “I still just do not understand on what basis the president through the Attorney General, through Mr. (Terrance) Cole, can say ‘You, MPD, have to do whatever I say.’”

DEA Director Terrance Cole’s name was misspelled in Attorney General Pam Bondi’s order Thursday evening that solidified his position as “emergency police commissioner,” Judge Ana Reyes pointed out at the hearing Friday.

The order misspelled Cole’s name as “Terrence.”

“They misspelled his name on his badge” and on the order, Reyes said to DOJ attorney Jacob Roth. “Doesn’t give a lot of confidence if we can’t get his name right.”

Reyes also pushed Roth to recognize that, though Cole was tapped by Bondi to act temporarily as the commissioner, Pamela Smith is still in charge of the Metropolitan Police Department.

“He is not the chief of police,” Roth said. “The chief of police is still the chief of police.”

The judge overseeing the DC Attorney General’s lawsuit against the Trump administration’s takeover of MPD said she will not rule today on whether there is a national emergency in the district.

“I am not going to rule today based on whether or not there is a national emergency,” Judge Ana Reyes said. “I am going to take the federal government position on that for today’s purposes.”

Reyes also said it was her understanding that prior to the attack of a former DOGE employee that set off Trump to begin the federal increase in agents on the ground and eventual takeover of the DC police, both Trump and AUSA Ed Martin claimed separately “that the crime rate in the district has been down” despite the administration’s current position.

The hearing on other DC challenges is ongoing.

Demonstrators gathered outside Washington, DC’s, police headquarters on Friday to protest President Donald Trump’s federal takeover of the city’s law enforcement.

One of the protesters – 29-year-old Katie Garcia – has lived in Washington, DC, since last year, and says she now feels unsafe leaving her house.

“I’m in DC Ward 2, and I’ve lived here for about a year, and it’s wild, because I came here for work, and I was really excited about the energy that this city brought. And I’ve always wanted to live here,” Garcia said.

“With Trump’s takeover, I felt what’s going on in DC is terrifying,” she added.

Marta Ames, a 74-year-old DC resident who has been in the city since the 2000s, says she doesn’t participate in protests, but felt compelled to come to the rally today.

“I’ve never seen anything like this. I was stunned. I mean, I’m someone who believes in my First Amendment right, and we know he does not believe people should protest against anything he does,” adding that she’s “scared to death.”

“I’m curious what the federal troops … what they think and feel, because this is a waste of their time.”

CNN observed dozens of protesters gathered outside the Metropolitan Police Department as part of the rally.

Another protester, Michael Segal, 64, lives on Capitol Hill, and says he’s seen people get stopped and asked for documentation to show they are US residents.

“The fact that I’m walking down the street, and I can get stopped for my papers at any time … it’s just mind boggling to me.”

DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb filed a lawsuit Friday against the Trump administration over its moves to take over the city’s police department and appoint an emergency commissioner, the latest sign of pushback from district officials against the federal takeover.

“By declaring a hostile takeover of (the Metropolitan Police Department), the Administration is abusing its limited, temporary authority under the Home Rule Act, infringing on the District’s right to self-governance and putting the safety of DC residents and visitors at risk,” Schwalb said in a statement.

DC is also seeking a temporary restraining order.

It comes after Attorney General Pam Bondi on Thursday ordered the city’s mayor and police department to accept Terry Cole, the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, as the district’s “emergency police commissioner” and give him full control of the department during the federal takeover.

Trump’s takeover of the Washington, DC, police places officers and residents at “grave risk,” the Metropolitan Police Department chief said Friday.

“In my nearly three decades in law enforcement, I have never seen a single government action that would cause a greater threat to law and order than this dangerous directive,” Chief Pamela Smith said in a filing in DC’s lawsuit filed Friday to end the takeover.

It is, Smith wrote, “placing the lives of MPD officers and District residents at grave risk.”

The order would also cause officers to not know how the command structure operates because they are still “required under District law to respect and obey the Chief of Police as the head and chief of the police force.”

Smith confirmed that she was “unaware of President Trump’s plans to assume control of the local police force until he announced it at a press conference” on Monday.

Thirty-three people were arrested in Washington, DC, Thursday night, according to a White House official.

The official highlighted that 15 were undocumented immigrants, though it was unclear if this was why they were arrested.

Twenty multi-agency teams were deployed across the District “to promote public safety and arrest violent offenders,” the official said, adding that over 1,750 participants were involved in last night’s operations.

On average in 2024, DC had about 55 adult arrests per day, according to data kept by the city’s police department.

The White House official noted that eight illegal firearms were seized, and other arrests included warrants for first-degree murder and first-degree rape, aggravated assault, a juvenile carrying a pistol without a license and possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance, including crack cocaine and driving under the influence.

Additionally, three multi-agency teams were assigned to clear homeless encampments in Washington, DC, but the official would not confirm the locations.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2229222360.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-08-15 17:56:59.534387

At Friday's hearing, plaintiffs' attorneys sought an injunction to prevent the law from going into effect, pending the outcome of the court challenge.
""The posting of the Ten Commandments violates our clients' and Texas families' religious freedom.
If U.S. Judge Fred Berry grants a temporary injunction to block SB 10, it would apply only to the school districts directly involved in the case.
All other school districts would have to decide on their own whether to follow SB 10.","A federal court in San Antonio heard arguments Friday in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a Texas law mandating the display of the Ten Commandments in all public-school classrooms in the state.

Senate Bill 10 mandates that, starting Sept. 1, all public-school classrooms in Texas must display a state-approved version of the Ten Commandments, using an explicitly Protestant translation derived from the King James Bible. At Friday's hearing, plaintiffs' attorneys sought an injunction to prevent the law from going into effect, pending the outcome of the court challenge.

Lawyers for those objecting to the law said in court that posting the Ten Commandments ""quote obviously violates"" the freedom of religion guaranteed in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

""The posting of the Ten Commandments violates our clients' and Texas families' religious freedom. It violates our Constitution's promise of separation of church and state, and the First Amendment guarantees that our clients should be able to decide what they believe in, or not, not politicians,"" Amy Tai, senior litigation counsel for the Americans United for Separation of Church and State, told Houston Public Media.

Americans United is one of four civil liberties organizations representing 16 Texas families of varying religious and nonreligious backgrounds in the lawsuit, filed against school districts in the Austin, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio areas. The Houston-area schools listed as defendants are Houston ISD, Cy-Fair ISD and Fort Bend ISD.

A lawyer for the Texas Attorney General's Office, representing the school districts, said the required classroom Ten Commandments poster is a ""passive display,"" ""does not create injury,"" and there is no enforcement provision in the law – so school districts could decide to ignore the law.

The state also argued the Ten Commandments are foundational for the American system of laws. That reiterates arguments the authors of SB 10 made on the floors of the Senate and House during debates prior to voting on the law.

The first witness called by the plaintiffs testified that many of the ideas in the commandments were ""parallel"" to American law but not unique.

We’ve been investigating abusive detention space conditions and the private prison industry’s ties to Trump’s mass detention and deportation goals.","President Trump’s strongman act is on full display in the nation’s capitol.

In a move straight out of the authoritarian handbook, Trump this week declared a crime emergency in Washington, D.C. and took federal control of the city’s police force and deploying National Guard troops into its streets. This federalization of the nation’s capitol is another attempt by the president to project an image of strength and resilience in the face of opposition — and to show what he is willing to do to punish his perceived adversaries.

In targeting D.C., Trump has spewed lies about the city’s history, population, and safety, many of which are based on and perpetuate racist rhetoric and narratives about the city’s large Black population.

That same rhetoric has been used to disenfranchise D.C.’s citizens for decades, and was used as a basis for the city’s lack of representation in Congress in the late 19th century.

Despite Trump’s claims of lawlessness and chaos in D.C., data from both the F.B.I and Metropolitan Police Department shows the city’s crime rate is currently at its lowest in nearly 30 years.

Trump has named specific and vulnerable targets in his takeover of the nation’s capitol; unhoused people and juveniles suspected of being members of “violent gangs” are at the top of his arrest priority list.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that unhoused people who refuse to leave D.C. “will be subjected to fines or jail time,” but advocates have pointed out that there is limited bed space in area shelters.

“This is not about preventing crime, it’s about political theater and federal control,” Clinique Chapman, the chief executive of D.C. Justice Lab, told the New York Times. “Young Black boys will bear the brunt of this, as they are the most likely to be stopped, to be questioned, to just really encounter the police interactions.”

We’re investigating Trump’s brazen efforts to seize control of Democratic power centers. Immediately following his federalization of D.C., we submitted a suite of public records requests to the departments of justice and the interior, as well as to the National Parks Service, the D.C. Mayor’s Office, and the D.C. City Council, for information that could help determine whether the administration’s public-safety rationale is a cover for a broader political effort to strip power from D.C.’s locally elected leaders.

D.C. residents have the right to elect their own mayor and council, but Congress retains power to override local governance.

Trump’s comments and the task force’s sweeping mandate raise concerns that the president could wield that authority to permanently revoke local control.

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser called Trump’s actions an “authoritarian push” and an “intrusion on our autonomy.”

This isn’t the first time we’ve witnessed Trump’s willingness to deploy military personnel on American soil to advance his political agenda and suppress opposition — and it seems like it won’t be the last.

On Monday, Trump vowed, “This will go further,” threatening to extend similar federal crackdowns to New York City, Los Angeles, Baltimore, Chicago, and Oakland — all cities led by Black Democratic mayors.

In June, Trump authorized the deployment of National Guard and Marine troops to quash protests in Los Angeles, despite local and state officials’ objections — a stunning abuse of power that flies in the face of Americans’ right to free speech.

The administration also dispatched thousands of military troops to the southern border in another political stuntearlier this year.

And new reporting suggests that the Trump administration is now evaluating plans to establish a “Domestic Civil Disturbance Quick Reaction Force” of National Guard troops to be deployed into U.S. cities to quash protests or other civil unrest. Such an endeavor could cost hundreds of millions of dollars and poses a serious threat to Americans’ constitutional rights to free speech and assembly.

Congress Must Investigate IRS Commissioner Billy Long’s Ousting

Trump ousted IRS Commissioner Billy Long last weekend, after he reportedly raised concerns about the agency’s data-sharing agreement with ICE. We’re calling on Congress to immediately investigate Long’s removal.

Long, a former Republican congressman from Missouri, was hand-picked for the role by Trump, but was removed after just two months, following a reported dispute with the administration over its use of IRS records for immigration enforcement.

According to the Washington Post, last week the Department of Homeland Security sent the IRS a request for personal tax information about 40,000 individuals. The IRS refused to provide most of the information, citing privacy laws. Long was removed soon afterward.

“Removing the head of the IRS for refusing to violate this already controversial agreement is as alarming as it is telling,” American Oversight’s executive director Chioma Chukwu said. “That the Trump administration reportedly sought to weaponize confidential taxpayer information to advance its nativist and anti-immigrant agenda — and, when Commissioner Long appeared to stand in the way, pushed him out after only two months on the job — should alarm all Americans.”

“If this kind of abuse goes unanswered, it will embolden the administration to further trample privacy protections for immigrants and citizens alike,” Chukwu added.

We previously uncovered details of a data-sharing agreement between ICE and the IRS that showed ICE was seeking IRS records containing the addresses and other personal information of people it was investigating.

The government repeatedly attempted in federal court to keep the details of the agreement hidden. Our successful efforts to lift the redactions revealed the government’s apparent expectation that it could use the law-enforcement privilege to shield the records without proper justification or reason.

On the Records: Texas and ICE are Coordinating Immigration Detention Spaces in the State

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s office has been coordinating with federal immigration authorities to prop up detention spaces in the state, emails show — another indication of states’ willingness to bend to President Trump’s extreme goals of mass arresting, detaining, and deporting immigrants.

Texas could become the most recent state to announce it will prop up new detention facilities in support of Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda, following similar moves by Florida, Tennessee, Louisiana, and others.

Emails show that Abbott’s Chief of Staff Robert Black asked top Trump administration officials working in immigration enforcement about possible detention spaces in Texas in February.

“Attached is the list of facilities we visited about,” Black wrote. “Workforce will be a challenge but that can be contracted. … “I would recommend we set up a conference call to see if we can hammer out an agreement if you want to proceed.” The suggested facilities were redacted in the version of the email we obtained.

Other emails include references to a meeting about detention space that was held that same month between Abbott’s Deputy Chief of Staff, Angela Colmenero, and officials at ICE, DHS, and the National Security Council.

“It was a pleasure speaking with you and Trevor this morning,” an NSC official wrote to Colmenero on February 13. (Colmenero noted that the director of the state’s prison system also joined the meeting.)

“We sincerely appreciate your support for the administration’s agenda of expanding our detention portfolio nationwide,” the official continued. “We need to iron out some significant details regarding terms of use, length, cost, and any other facility or structural requirements needed.”

ICE recently announced that it plans to convert a Texas military base, Fort Bliss, into a detention facility to hold thousands of detainees.

The $1.2 billion site — which is still under development — will begin detaining individuals on August 17. As planned, it will be the largest federal immigration detention space in U.S. history.

Legal battles over other recently-opened detention facilities are ongoing. Last week, a judge ordered a 14-day halt of construction at the Florida Everglades detention space, citing environmental concerns.

That order doesn’t include any restrictions on law enforcement or immigration enforcement activity, though, and detained individuals are still being held in the swampy space, where conditions include sweltering heat, abrupt air conditioning cut-offs, and bugs in the food.

We’ve been investigating abusive detention space conditions and the private prison industry’s ties to Trump’s mass detention and deportation goals. Read more here.

“We are grateful to Mexico’s National Security team for their collaboration in this matter.” The U.S. war on drugs, first declared by Richard Nixon in 1971, has been an abject failure.

Melding two failed American wars — the war on drugs and the war on terror — would “put people at risk of violence and destabilize hemispheric relations while hindering, not helping, efforts to protect communities from drug trafficking and other crime,” according to the organizations, which include the Alianza Americas, Center for Civilians in Conflict, Drug Policy Alliance, Public Citizen, and Win Without War.

President Donald Trump has secretly signed a directive to the Pentagon to begin using military force against select Latin American drug cartels that his administration has deemed terrorist organizations, according to an Intercept interview with a U.S. official who was not authorized to speak to the media. The authorization was first reported by the New York Times.

The decision to involve the American military in what has previously been considered a law enforcement effort comes as Trump has increasingly turned to U.S. troops for law enforcement purposes on American soil and taken over the D.C. police. These efforts are seen as dangerous escalations of the use of military force and violations of long-held norms.

The letter, sent to top congressional leaders on Friday, urges lawmakers “to use the full slate of its powers to prevent the administration from launching a new war in Latin America without democratic debate or public accountability” by “organiz[ing] hearings to assess the scope of the administration’s envisioned use-of-force policy and its likely diplomatic, economic, and human impacts” and “withhold[ing] funding for unauthorized, undebated, and unaccountable military action.”

In January, the State Department declared eight Mexican drug cartels — the Sinaloa cartel, CJNG, the Northeast cartel, the Michoacán family, the United Cartels, and the Gulf Cartel — to be foreign terrorist organizations. The Salvadoran MS-13 and the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang were also named. That designation activates U.S. sanctions, including restrictions on financial transactions and bans on U.S. citizens from providing support to the groups.

That same month, Trump mused that he might send U.S. commandos into Mexico to battle cartels. “Could happen,” he said. “Stranger things have happened.”

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also threatened military action on Mexican soil. And a Justice Department guidance document urged employees to work toward the “total elimination of cartels.”

The coalition of groups pointed to the potential blowback of expanding the forever wars to Mexico and beyond. “Unilateral and hastily conceived military action could contribute to the considerable human rights abuses, criminal violence, and forced displacement already harming communities in Latin America,” reads the letter. “Militarized approaches to countering narcotics trafficking have often backfired. They have inadvertently incentivized criminal groups to traffic smaller and more potent drugs to evade interdiction, acquire deadlier weapons, and expand their networks of corruption to protect their profits.”

Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum last week rejected the use of U.S. troops in her country. But earlier this week, Mexico extradited 26 alleged cartel members to the United States. Attorney General Pam Bondi hailed the cooperation. “These 26 men have all played a role in bringing violence and drugs to American shores — under this Department of Justice, they will face severe consequences for their crimes against this country,” she said. “We are grateful to Mexico’s National Security team for their collaboration in this matter.”

The U.S. war on drugs, first declared by Richard Nixon in 1971, has been an abject failure. It’s estimated that the United States has spent more than $1 trillion battling the drug trade and drug use with dismal results. Nearly 1 million arrests are made for drug law violations in the U.S. each year, according to FBI statistics, making it the leading cause of arrest in the United States. One in 3 people in the U.S. has lost someone they know to a drug overdose. In 2024, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk called the worldwide war on drugs a “clear failure” and called out “militarized law enforcement responses” around the world.

“Overseas military strikes certainly won’t solve drug overdose deaths in the U.S., which are far better addressed through public health measures,” said Stephanie Brewer, the director for Mexico at the Washington Office on Latin America or WOLA, another signatory of the letter. “What military action abroad would do is open the door to increased violence, forced migration, and incalculable damage to U.S. relations with neighboring countries.”

Trump has already sent thousands of National Guard and active-duty troops to the southern border to ostensibly halt the flow of drugs as well as immigrants. More than 10,000 troops are deploying or have deployed there, according to Northern Command. Under the direction of NORTHCOM, military personnel have deployed under the moniker Joint Task Force-Southern Border since March, bolstering approximately 2,500 service members who were already supporting U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s border security mission.

One-third of the U.S. border is now completely militarized due to the creation of four new national defense areas, or NDAs: sprawling extensions of U.S. military bases patrolled by troops who can detain immigrants until they can be handed over to Border Patrol agents.

“Launching military action in Latin America without congressional authorization would be illegal, reckless, and a betrayal of our democratic process — and Congress must intervene to stop it,” Sara Haghdoosti, the executive director of Win Without War, told The Intercept. “We’ve seen this ‘war on drugs’ playbook before in the region, and it has failed time and again — fueling violence, displacing communities, and doing nothing to address the root causes of drug trafficking.”

Haghdoosti added, “What makes this even more egregious is that the Trump administration is pushing for war while slashing the very public health programs that save lives. People need healthcare, treatment, and support — not military posturing and strikes.”",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP20175730870255-e1755272809958.jpeg?fit=6000%2C3000&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-08-15 16:57:57.403696

Dear Chairman Comer, Ranking Member Garcia, Chairman Paul, and Ranking Member

Peters:

On behalf of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and the 126 undersigned organizations, we write to express our profound concerns with the recent decision by President Trump to assert control over the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and to deploy the National Guard throughout the city. This unprecedented and needless takeover of a local government’s law enforcement mechanisms poses a dire threat to public safety as well as to civil and human rights, not only of the people who live in D.C., but ultimately throughout the entire country.

This administration has proven that it will push every boundary to test for exploitable weakness in Congress and the courts. Given the role of your respective committees in matters affecting our nation’s capital, we urge you to promptly call for hearings into this decision, and to engage in vigorous oversight moving forward.

While President Trump has pointed to several high-profile instances of crime in the District of Columbia, the fact remains that there simply is no “crime emergency.” Violent crime in D.C. fell by 35 percent in 2024 compared to the previous year, and it is now at a 30-year low. One of the key drivers of this decrease has been widespread investments in community-based violence intervention and crisis response, including through COVID recovery dollars and the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. Until recently, when Congress inexplicably forced D.C. to slash its budget by more than $1 billion, D.C. was also able to utilize its own local tax revenue to address the issue.

In the place of proven strategies aimed at reducing and preventing crime, President Trump’s decision to commandeer the police and fill the streets with National Guard servicemembers – who are not trained to act as police officers – is not simply a matter of political theater and distraction. It also poses a dire threat to longstanding efforts to foster trust between the police and the communities they serve, especially in light of President Trump’s claim that he would allow the police under his command to “do whatever the hell they want,” raising concerns that the civil rights of D.C. residents may be sacrificed in the process.

President Trump has once again declared a false emergency to access executive powers that were not meant to be used as political tools to amass power. It is a terrible precedent that could harm cities, communities, and people well beyond D.C. What he is able to achieve in D.C., he will try to do elsewhere. He has already threatened to do the same in other major cities around the country.

The simple fact is that President Trump is not seriously interested in reducing crime. He is interested in misleading about crime to justify abhorrent practices, including rapid expansion of criminalization, unprecedented abuses by federal law enforcement agents, and dangerous executive power grabs. Time and time again, he has shown that his real goal is to create a police state, as he has repeatedly weaponized law enforcement to quash dissent and to serve his own personal and political ends. For example, since taking office, his administration has:

• Defied court orders;

• Unlawfully punished law firms, private charities, and universities perceived as being hostile to him or his agenda;

• Locked up and tried to deport students simply because they criticized U.S. foreign policy;

• Filed criminal charges against a sitting U.S. representative for trying to engage in oversight of an immigrant detention center;

• Arrested and charged the president of a state chapter of a major labor union while peacefully engaging in protected First Amendment activity;

• Warned that protestors in D.C. were “going to be met with very big force”;

• Violently handcuffed a sitting U.S. senator for merely trying to ask a question at a press conference;

• Carried out senseless and unlawful immigration raids that have terrorized communities, instilled fear in families, and eroded trust in public institutions; and

• Threatened homeless populations in D.C. and elsewhere with arrest, exile, and involuntary commitment.

The federal government should respect the laws and policies of D.C. enacted via its democratically elected government. Instead, D.C. is an easy testing ground for President Trump, because while its residents pay federal taxes and comply with all the other duties of citizenship, they have no vote in Congress and limited control over their own local governance. Given his record to date, it would be naïve to think that President Trump will stop there. We urge you to ensure that our rights under the Constitution and under our federal laws are being fully protected and enforced.",https://www.lwv.org/themes/custom/primary_bootstrap/img/lwv-favicon-500.png,N,,2025-08-15 16:58:02.020942

This is unprecedented, unnecessary, undemocratic, and unjustifiable.

As an organization based in D.C., we reject President Trump’s offensive and baseless lies about the vibrant communities here that many of our staff love and belong to.

This moment is a reminder of the urgent need for statehood for the more than 700,000 district residents who have been denied representation for too long.

This move is also part of a broader, disturbing pattern of authoritarianism and militarism that we have seen from this administration.

Here at home, we’ve seen tanks in our streets and masked ICE agents carrying out war-like raids on our communities. When people in Los Angeles protested these raids, President Trump deployed troops to suppress them.

Now, as D.C. is placed under military occupation, the administration is threatening to do the same in Chicago, San Francisco, and New York.

“To our dismay, this is America 2025,” FCNL’s Bridget Moix wrote in RNS in last month. “Due process, rule of law and core principles of our democracy are all being swept aside in a systematic shift toward authoritarianism and rule by fear and force.”

We have also seen this disturbing shift toward militarism in our foreign policy. The administration and Congress have turned ploughshares into swords, dismantling diplomacy, international aid, and peacebuilding programs while bloating annual military spending to more than $1 trillion.

The administration has continued to arm the Israeli government’s genocidal assault on Gaza. It has bombed Yemen, surged U.S. strikes in Somalia, and waged war on Iran.

Now, President Trump has also approved plans to illegally use U.S. military force against cartels in Latin America without Congressional authorization.

As we have long said, war is not the answer. We must continue to oppose it – both at home and abroad –and advocate for real solutions that foster peace, prosperity, and dignity for all.

Palestinians are facing famine and people are starving to death as hundreds of civilians are shot and killed by the Israeli military trying to access food aid. Civil society is speaking up and international condemnation is growing. Germany halted arms deliveries to Israel, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund has divested, and leaders from France, Australia, and China are speaking out forcefully against the mass starvation of civilians.

Pressure is also growing inside Israel. Hundreds of retired Israeli security officials urged President Trump to pressure the Israeli government into ending the war in Gaza. Retired Israeli pilots protested the war outside of the Israeli military’s headquarters. A group of high-profile Israeli public figures have called for “crippling sanctions” to be imposed by the international community on Israel.

Trump-Putin Summit Must Address Nukes

President Trump and President Vladimir Putin of Russia are meeting in Alaska today. Although the meeting is focused on the Russia-Ukraine war, it also provides a crucial opportunity to address nuclear arms control. Since the New START Treaty is set to expire in February, the safety of the world demands immediate action.

Senator Condemns Sending Immigrants to be Tortured

For months, the Trump administration has been forcibly sending immigrants to countries they are not from. Once there, their human rights have been violated, and they have been tortured. This happened in El Salvador and may be continuing as people are sent to South Sudan and other countries. Senator Tim Kaine (VA) introduced legislation to condemn this practice and demand that the United States not support torture.

Trump fights challenges to his power aggressively in court, and in many cases, federal judges have given him big wins.","D.C. is fighting back.

On Friday, D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb filed a federal lawsuit challenging President Trump’s most recent push to take day-to-day control over the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), calling it “brazenly unlawful” and the “gravest threat to Home Rule that the District has ever faced.”

The lawsuit follows hot on the heels of an order issued by Attorney General Pam Bondi on Thursday that sought to put the Trump administration in full daily control of MPD, sidelining current leadership and enabling it to dictate not just what police should do – but also the way they should do it.

The move shocked D.C. officials who were carefully trying to balance working with Trump – who on Monday used his legal powers to expand federal presence in law enforcement in the city – with protecting what limited local control they already have. That balance has now been thrown off; it’s more clear that Trump is aggressively testing the bounds of the law, and that what he’s trying now could be just the start of a broader push to control D.C.

What this is all about

As you probably know, on Monday, Trump invoked a provision of the Home Rule Charter that lets him take over MPD for 30 days. That provision is carefully worded, though: it gives the president the right to “direct the Mayor to provide him, and the Mayor shall provide, such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the President may deem necessary and appropriate.”

On Thursday night, Bondi seemed to take this a step further. She declared that DEA administrator Terry Cole was taking daily control of the police department, largely pushing aside current Chief Pamela Smith. Bondi also repealed a number of police orders – documents detailing how cops should operate – related to the city’s sanctuary law, which limits cooperation on federal immigration enforcement.

What D.C. is arguing

D.C. officials were quick to respond to Bondi, and their response was clear: Not so fast.

Citing a legal opinion from Attorney General Brian Schwalb, Mayor Muriel Bowser tweeted: “There is no statute that conveys the District’s personnel authority to a federal official.” Put more plainly, she said that while Trump can ask MPD to do certain things, he can’t order officers to do them in a certain way, much less can he take over the daily operations of the department wholesale.

Now, Schwalb and Bowser aren’t challenging Trump’s ability to “request services” from MPD, services that MPD has to provide. Rather, they are more narrowly pushing back on exactly how much control Trump has over MPD. The president seems to think it’s essentially absolute; Bowser and Schwalb say it’s actually pretty limited.

“[Bondi’s order] installs a handpicked federal official as chief of police, grants him sweeping power to issue commands directly to MPD, and bars MPD senior leadership from acting without his approval. It also purports to suspend MPD policies that Defendant Bondi dislikes, impose enforcement policies she favors, and rescind any existing orders that stand in the way. In short, it attempts to divest the District and its residents of any control of their local police force and place it, for all purposes, under the control of the federal government,” reads the lawsuit. “[The Home Rule Charter] does not authorize this brazen usurpation of the District’s authority over its own government.”

Additionally, the lawsuit targets two other issues: for what purposes Trump can actually request services from MPD, and whether he’s even allowed to request them right now.

The Home Rule Charter says the president can request MPD’s services when “special conditions of an emergency nature exist.” According to the Trump administration, crime in D.C. is that emergency. But the charter also says the president would need MPD for “federal purposes.” In the lawsuit, Schwalb says there’s no actual crime emergency in D.C., and that even if there was, Bondi’s order is pushing way beyond just “federal purposes” and directly into local policing.

Why D.C. is fighting back now

As we’ve reported plenty, ever since Trump took office, Bowser has largely tried to stay out of his way and occasionally throw him a symbolic or real bone to keep him thinking he’s getting his way. It’s been a tenuous and uncomfortable balance she’s tried to strike, and it started falling apart this week when Trump claimed control of MPD and deployed federal law enforcement officers and the National Guard in D.C.

Even then, Bowser tried to play the role of cooperator-in-chief, saying MPD would work with the federal government and even throwing Trump a big bone by saying police would now help – a bit – on immigration enforcement.

But Bondi’s Thursday order completely shattered the illusion that Bowser could cooperate on friendly terms with Trump. Instead, it made clear that this is about power – and that Bowser shouldn’t actually think she has any. (Sources tell The 51st that Bowser was skeptical of the value of litigation until Bondi's order, which changed her thinking.) And just as Trump has pushed aggressively to claim the broadest powers possible in many other areas, so too would he do so when it comes to D.C.’s already limited ability to govern itself.

In essence, this lawsuit is the first attempt to head off what could be future legal fights over MPD and D.C.’s self-governance as a whole. Trump has already foreshadowed what those fights might be – and the main one is just how long he can claim to control MPD. The charter says 30 days, unless Congress agrees to an extension. Trump said this week he wants those extensions, and he will get them whether or not Congress agrees.

But this legal fight is also more broadly about how best MPD can fight crime. While Trump has clearly said he wants police to play rougher and be more aggressive, Bowser and Smith have highlighted the importance of MPD being trusted by the communities they police. Should Bondi’s order hold, that trust could take a huge hit. That’s because her order specifically gives her the authority to change the rules and regulations governing how police operate — rules and regulations that are nominally crafted in response to local expectations and lived experiences.

Take body cameras. D.C. officers have been using them for almost a decade; when they were first rolled out, city officials said they were a means to increase transparency and accountability. Now, there are remaining questions as to how much they have done that, but there is no question that they have changed local policing. (Every time a D.C. police officer shoots someone, there is video evidence of it – and it is often made public.) Under Bondi’s expansive order, Trump could just declare that MPD officers no longer need them, or they can more freely stop anyone on the street for any reason – or no reason at all — or that they’re more free to use deadly force. The list goes on.

In a declaration that accompanies the lawsuit, Smith warned that the Bondi order “would upend the command structure of MPD, endangering the safety of the public and law enforcement officers alike. In my nearly three decades in law enforcement, I have never seen a single government action that would cause a greater threat to law and order than this dangerous directive.”

Finally, this does come back to D.C.’s ability to govern itself. Bondi said her order repealed the police orders on how they should and should not deal with immigration enforcement. (MPD officers have not traditionally asked about immigration status when someone is arrested, and won’t hold someone longer than legally allowed because ICE wants to pick them up – unless there is a warrant out for them.) But those orders are based on a law passed by the D.C. Council. Bondi is in effect telling police to ignore an existing law passed by the city’s elected representatives.

If she and Trump can do that with immigration enforcement, what else?

What’s next

Schwalb is asking for an immediate temporary restraining order — for a federal judge to temporarily stop Bondi from enforcing her new order. But he’s also asking for a judge to do the same with Trump’s broader executive order issued earlier this week. A hearing is set for 2 p.m. Friday.

Should those be granted, D.C. and MPD would enter something of a holding pattern where things mostly return to normal, minus all the federal enforcement officers and National Guardsmen everywhere.

But it wouldn’t be the end of the story, obviously. Trump fights challenges to his power aggressively in court, and in many cases, federal judges have given him big wins.

Catholic advocates push Trump administration to address religious worker visa backlog

By KATE SCANLON, OSV News | Published August 15, 2025

WASHINGTON (OSV News)–Some immigrant religious workers are facing legal limbo, and Catholic advocates are pushing the Trump administration to address the backlog in their visa category.

Many immigrant religious workers–such as Catholic priests and nuns–legally enter the country on R-1 non-immigrant religious worker visas. These are initially granted for a 30-month period, with one possible renewal allowing for a total of 5 years, so they can be in the U.S. to carry out ministry work. While within that window, they can apply for employment-based EB-4 status so they can legally remain in the U.S. without interruption.

“One of the challenges is that because the number of green cards that are issued every year is not representative of the number of people that are eligible, you’ve got huge backlogs,” Erin Corcoran, an associate teaching professor and executive director of the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame, told OSV News.

“And this affects these religious workers,” she said.

That backlog could have a grave impact on the church in the U.S. The National Study of Catholic Priests–released in 2022 by The Catholic University of America’s Catholic Project–indicated 24% of priests serving in the U.S. are foreign-born, with many of them also subject to visa renewals.

In April, bipartisan legislation, titled the Religious Workforce Protection Act, was introduced in the Senate by Sens. Tim Kaine, D-Va., Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Jim Risch, R-Idaho, and in the House by Reps. Mike Carey, R-Ohio, and Richard Neal, D-Mass. In statements at the time, Kaine and Collins both cited priest shortages in their states. All five of those members are Catholic.

If signed into law, the bill would permit religious workers already in the U.S. on temporary R-1 status with pending EB-4 applications to stay in the U.S. while waiting for permanent residency, Collins’ office said at the time.

Catholic organizations, including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Jesuit Refugee Service/USA and the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, also known as CLINIC, have backed the legislation.

A spokesperson for the USCCB told OSV News on Aug. 6, “We’re continuing our education efforts about the pressing need for the RWPA, and together with our interfaith partners, we’re encouraging grassroots supporters to raise this issue with their members of Congress while they are back in their states/districts during the August recess.”

“We remain hopeful that Congress will have an opportunity to move the bill forward before the end of the year,” the spokesperson said.

Corcoran said the legislation would allow, for example, a Catholic priest with temporary R-1 status, to move from one parish to another in accordance with diocesan needs without jeopardizing that status.

“For many religious workers, as part of your job or part of your vocation, you’re going to be moving parishes right?” she said. “And under the current framework, you can’t do that without jeopardizing your status.”

The bill, however, would not increase the limit on how many visas are granted.

“It’s a very modest fix,” she said. “One of the things we’ve seen historically is that there are a lot of small, little fixes that could happen through legislation for these exact kinds of immigration dilemmas. But historically, Congress has always wanted to pass everything at once, so this provision has been put in comprehensive immigration reform bills in the past, but the problem is that there are other provisions in (broader immigration packages) that there can’t be consensus on.”

Despite bipartisan support, it was not immediately clear what the prospects might be for the bill once lawmakers return from their August recess, or whether President Donald Trump would be willing to sign it.

The White House did not return a request for comment from OSV News by publication time on whether the Trump administration would support the bill.

But several proponents of the legislation who spoke with OSV News pointed to the bipartisan nature of the bill as cause for optimism.

Dylan Corbett, executive director of the Hope Border Institute, a group that works to apply the perspective of Catholic social teaching in policy and practice to the U.S.-Mexico border region, told OSV News, “Congress and the Trump administration have a good opportunity to make an urgent targeted fix to ensure clergy and religious from abroad serving our communities throughout the country don’t become casualties of an increasingly broken immigration system.”

“Here the Biden administration really fumbled the ball. If we can get this done, the broader lesson can be that it really is possible to come together and find common ground to build an immigration system that is workable, efficient and meets our national needs,” Corbett said.

Corcoran said, “We’ve seen so little bipartisan solutions to problems, and to me, this is the kind of thing that this administration should be embracing, because it can show that they can be compassionate, that there are bipartisan solutions that are available for certain sub-populations within the immigration backlog, and that we all benefit, right, from these people being in our parishes.”

Advocacy for the bill comes as the Trump administration seeks to implement hardline immigration policies, including its pursuit of what it has called “the largest deportation in U.S. history.”

However, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an interview that aired Aug. 7 with Raymond Arroyo on EWTN’s “The World Over,” that the administration is trying to “create its own standalone process” for religious workers, instead of having them conflated with other immigration categories.

“And I’ve been in touch, for example, with a number of our cardinals here in the United States and bishops about that as well,” Rubio said. “And it’s not only the Catholic Church. I mean, our other places are being impacted by it but we’re trying to streamline that process.”

“We clearly view that entry point as very different than some of these others,” Rubio said, adding, “We don’t want to read headlines that some Catholic Church had to close because it couldn’t get their priests here … some order closed because some nun couldn’t get here. So we’re not interested in that. That’s really not the aim here. It’s more caught up in the structure of it. We’ll have a plan to fix it. We’re working on it. We know it’s an issue, and we’re committed to fixing it.”

Simmons for the Western District of Texas announced today, that federal prosecutors in the district filed 232 new immigration and immigration-related criminal cases from Aug. 8 through 14.

Two Mexican nationals were arrested in Seguin on Aug. 8, when they were caught allegedly transporting 137 kgs of methamphetamine and 7.5 kgs of heroin. A Guadalupe County Sheriff’s Office K9 deputy conducted a traffic stop on Roberto Moreno-Rangel and Martin Gomez-Cisneros near the intersection of Highway 90 and Interstate Highway 10. After the two individuals allegedly provided conflicting stories to the deputy, the K9 conducted an open-air sniff inspection of the vehicle and allegedly alerted to the presence of illegal narcotics on the rear driver side fender well area of the vehicle. Further investigation of the vehicle allegedly revealed 48 bundles concealed in an aftermarket compartment. 47 of the bundles were allegedly found to contain methamphetamine, while the remaining bundle allegedly contained heroin. Charged with possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance, Moreno-Rangel and Gomez-Cisneros each face 10 years to life in prison, if convicted.

Among the new cases, Mexican national Heriberto Monsivais Lopez aka Erik Lopez, was arrested in San Antonio as part of an investigation into firearms trafficking to Mexico. On Wednesday, Homeland Security Investigations agents, along with officers from the Texas Department of Public Safety (TX DPS) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection Air and Marine Operations, allegedly observed Monsivais Lopez sell two 9mm pistols and 28.93 g of suspected cocaine. He was previously removed from the U.S. to Mexico on March 14, 2019. Monsivais Lopez is charged with one count of being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm. If convicted, he faces up to 15 years imprisonment.

Salvadoran national Samuel Chulo-Aguilar was charged with illegal re-entry in Del Rio, having been previously deported in 2012 through Phoenix, Arizona. In 2007, Chulo-Aguilar was sentenced to six years in prison following a conviction in Los Angeles, California, for lewd acts with a child under 14.

In Austin, Honduran national Jose Carcamo-Santos was taken into Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody after he was arrested during a traffic stop by TX DPS on Aug. 9. Carcamo-Santos is charged with illegal re-entry and has been removed from the U.S. seven times between 2004 and 2022. He’s been thrice convicted for illegal re-entry and has three other convictions for controlled substance charges.

Rosell Bladimir Ortiz-Garcia, also a Honduran national, was arrested and charged with illegal re-entry in Eagle Pass. Ortiz-Garcia has been deported seven times, the last one being on Feb. 26, after being convicted for assault causing bodily injury.

Victor Aaron Vargas-Leon, a Mexican national, was arrested near El Indio on Aug. 10 and charged with transporting illegal aliens. A criminal complaint alleges that Border Patrol agents found three illegal aliens and another deceased individual in the brush. Vargas-Leon was allegedly determined to be a foot guide for the group.

In El Paso, Mexican national Victor Hugo Lopez-Murillo was allegedly found in a storm drain just over a mile west of the Bridge of the Americas Port of Entry. He is charged with illegal re-entry, having been previously removed from the U.S. four times, the last time being in February following a felony conviction for trespassing in a habitation.

Mexican national Jorge Santillan-De La Cruz was arrested in El Paso and charged with illegal re-entry after he allegedly applied for admission into the U.S., presenting himself as a U.S. citizen who had lost his documents in Mexico. Customs and Border Protection officers found that Santillan-De La Cruz had previously been removed from the U.S. for the fourth time in March. Additionally, he has been convicted five times for theft and burglary offenses and twice for illegal re-entry.

Raul Robledo, a U.S. citizen, was charged with conspiracy to transport illegal aliens after allegedly being observed acting as a look-out during a failed alien smuggling scheme in El Paso on Aug. 4. A criminal complaint alleges that, during the scheme, Border Patrol agents responded to subjects exiting a storm drain and observed multiple vehicles suspected of being involved in the smuggling operation. One subject was allegedly observed lifting the storm drain grate, then dropping it, injuring a female subject who was later transported to a hospital with finger amputations and a head injury. Border Patrol agents located four additional illegal aliens inside the storm drain. Further investigation revealed that Robledo had allegedly fled the scene and had served as a look-out on three other occasions.

Mexican national Luis Heriberto Baca-Baca was arrested while crossing the Rio Grande River with nine other individuals determined to be in the U.S. illegally. Baca-Baca allegedly served as the foot guide for the group and had been observed entering the U.S. illegally with a group of 14 individuals the day prior.

These cases were referred or supported by federal law enforcement partners, including Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Enforcement and Removal Operations (ICE ERO), U.S. Border Patrol, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS), and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), with additional assistance from state and local law enforcement partners.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Texas comprises 68 counties located in the central and western areas of Texas, encompasses nearly 93,000 square miles and an estimated population of 7.6 million people. The district includes three of the five largest cities in Texas—San Antonio, Austin and El Paso—and shares 660 miles of common border with the Republic of Mexico.

These cases are part of Operation Take Back America, a nationwide initiative that marshals the full resources of the Department of Justice to repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations (TCOs), and protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime. Operation Take Back America streamlines efforts and resources from the Department’s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETFs) and Project Safe Neighborhood (PSN).

The resolutions, which have little chance of advancing in the Republican-controlled Congress, would terminate the state of emergency that Mr. Trump declared in his executive order on Monday that federalized the Metropolitan Police Department. Under the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, a president can order D.C.’s mayor to give him temporary control of the police, but Congress can terminate the authority.

The resolutions were introduced the same day that D.C.’s local government filed a lawsuit challenging Mr. Trump’s efforts. It argued that he and Attorney General Pam Bondi had exceeded the scope of their authority under the Home Rule Act, which in 1973 granted D.C. a limited degree of self-government. The city of about 700,000 people has no voting power in Congress.

Representative Jamie Raskin, whose Maryland district includes the Washington suburbs, accused Mr. Trump in a statement of a “hostile takeover of D.C.’s police force” that was part of larger pattern of abusing presidential power.

Mr. Raskin, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, introduced the resolution in the House, with Representatives Eleanor Holmes Norton, the nonvoting delegate from the District of Columbia, and Robert Garcia of California, the leading Democrat on the Oversight Committee, which oversees Washington. Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland brought the resolution in the Senate.

Their legislation faces long odds given Republicans’ lock on power on Capitol Hill and their unwillingness to break from Mr. Trump. G.O.P. leaders in both chambers have voiced support for the president’s actions in Washington. Democrats would need support from Republicans to ever allow the matter to proceed to the floor.

But the effort offers a hint at how Democrats may try to fight Mr. Trump’s actions in Washington and use them to make larger political arguments to the American public.

In their resolutions, the Democrats cite statistics showing that violent crime is at a 30-year low in D.C. as evidence that there is no emergency to justify Mr. Trump’s actions.

The resolutions, which have little chance of advancing in the Republican-controlled Congress, would terminate the state of emergency that Mr. Trump declared in his executive order on Monday that federalized the Metropolitan Police Department. Under the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, a president can order D.C.’s mayor to give him temporary control of the police, but Congress can terminate the authority.

The resolutions were introduced the same day that D.C.’s local government filed a lawsuit challenging Mr. Trump’s efforts. It argued that he and Attorney General Pam Bondi had exceeded the scope of their authority under the Home Rule Act, which in 1973 granted D.C. a limited degree of self-government. The city of about 700,000 people has no voting power in Congress.

Representative Jamie Raskin, whose Maryland district includes the Washington suburbs, accused Mr. Trump in a statement of a “hostile takeover of D.C.’s police force” that was part of larger pattern of abusing presidential power.

Mr. Raskin, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, introduced the resolution in the House, with Representatives Eleanor Holmes Norton, the nonvoting delegate from the District of Columbia, and Robert Garcia of California, the leading Democrat on the Oversight Committee, which oversees Washington. Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland brought the resolution in the Senate.

Their legislation faces long odds given Republicans’ lock on power on Capitol Hill and their unwillingness to break from Mr. Trump. G.O.P. leaders in both chambers have voiced support for the president’s actions in Washington. Democrats would need support from Republicans to ever allow the matter to proceed to the floor.

But the effort offers a hint at how Democrats may try to fight Mr. Trump’s actions in Washington and use them to make larger political arguments to the American public.

In their resolutions, the Democrats cite statistics showing that violent crime is at a 30-year low in D.C. as evidence that there is no emergency to justify Mr. Trump’s actions.

Washington’s police department chief said Trump's move would threaten law and order by upending the command structure.

Washington’s police department chief said Trump's move would threaten law and order by upending the command structure. “In my nearly three decades in law enforcement, I have never seen a single government action that would cause a greater threat to law and order than this dangerous directive,” Police Chief Pamela Smith said in a court filing.

It's part of a push from Washington’s top legal official to reverse the order putting the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration in charge of police in the nation's capital.

District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb argues the police takeover is illegal and threatens to “wreak operational havoc."" Conflicting commands and confusion about who is in charge are a serious problem for effective policing, Smith said.

The lawsuit comes after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said Thursday night that DEA boss Terry Cole will assume the police chief's duties and approval authority for any orders issued to officers. It was unclear where the move left the city’s current police chief, Smith, who works for the mayor.

Schwalb argues the new order goes beyond Trump's authority and implementing it would “sow chaos” in the Metropolitan Police Department. “The administration’s unlawful actions are an affront to the dignity and autonomy of the 700,000 Americans who call D.C. home,” Schwalb said.

The Justice Department declined to comment on the district's lawsuit, and a White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday morning.

The police takeover is the latest move by Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the United States illegally.

It also marks one of the most sweeping assertions of federal authority over a local government in modern times. While Washington has grappled with spikes in violence and visible homelessness, the city’s homicide rate ranks below those of several other major U.S. cities, and the capital is not in the throes of the public safety collapse the Trump administration has portrayed.

Chief had agreed to share immigration information

Schwalb had said late Thursday that Bondi’s directive was “unlawful,” arguing it could not be followed by the city’s police force. He wrote in a memo to Smith that “members of MPD must continue to follow your orders and not the orders of any official not appointed by the Mayor,” setting up the legal clash between the heavily Democratic district and the Republican administration.

The district’s attorney general is an elected position and the city’s top legal officer. It’s separate from federal U.S. attorney appointed by the president to serve in Washington, a role now filled by former Fox News Channel host and judge Jeanine Pirro. Trump also appointed Bondi as U.S. attorney general, the nation’s top law enforcement official.

Bondi’s directive came even after Smith had told MPD officers hours earlier to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody, such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief’s directive because it allowed for continued enforcement of “sanctuary policies,” which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.

Bondi said she was rescinding that order as well as other MPD policies limiting inquires into immigration status and preventing arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants. All new directives must now receive approval from Cole, the attorney general said.

Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser pushed back Thursday, writing on social media that “there is no statute that conveys the District’s personnel authority to a federal official.”

The president has more power over the nation’s capital than other cities, but D.C. has elected its own mayor and city council since the Home Rule Act was signed in 1973.

Trump is the first president to exert control over the city's police force since it was passed. The law limits that control to 30 days without congressional approval, though Trump has suggested he’d seek to extend it. Schwalb argues the president's role is narrow under the law, limited to requiring the mayor to provide police services for federal purposes.

Residents are seeing a significant show of force

A population already tense from days of ramp-up has begun seeing more significant shows of force across the city. National Guard troops watched over some of the world’s most renowned landmarks and Humvees took position in front of the busy main train station. Volunteers helped homeless people leave long-standing encampments — to where was often unclear.

Department of Homeland Security police stood outside Nationals Park during a game Thursday between the Washington Nationals and the Philadelphia Phillies. DEA agents patrolled The Wharf, a popular nightlife area, while Secret Service officers were seen in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood.

Bowser, walking a tightrope between the Republican White House and the constituency of her largely Democratic city, was out of town Thursday for a family commitment in Martha’s Vineyard but would be back Friday, her office said.

The uptick in visibility of federal forces around the city, including in many high-traffic areas, has been striking to residents going about their lives. Trump has the power to take over federal law enforcement for 30 days before his actions must be reviewed by Congress, though he has said he’ll re-evaluate as that deadline approaches.

Officers set up a checkpoint in one of D.C.’s popular nightlife areas, drawing protests. Troops were stationed outside the Union Station transportation hub as the 800 Guard members who have been activated by Trump started in on missions that include monument security, community safety patrols and beautification efforts, the Pentagon said.

Many immigrant religious workers — such as Catholic priests and nuns — legally enter the country on R-1 non-immigrant religious worker visas.
“And this affects these religious workers,” she said.

The White House did not return a request for comment from OSV News by publication time on whether the Trump administration would support the bill.","WASHINGTON (OSV News) — Some immigrant religious workers are facing legal limbo, and Catholic advocates are pushing the Trump administration to address the backlog in their visa category.

Many immigrant religious workers — such as Catholic priests and nuns — legally enter the country on R-1 non-immigrant religious worker visas. These are initially granted for a 30-month period, with one possible renewal allowing for a total of 5 years, so they can be in the U.S. to carry out ministry work. While within that window, they can apply for employment-based EB-4 status so they can legally remain in the U.S. without interruption.

“One of the challenges is that because the number of green cards that are issued every year is not representative of the number of people that are eligible, you’ve got huge backlogs,” Erin Corcoran, an associate teaching professor and executive director of the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame, told OSV News.

“And this affects these religious workers,” she said.

Impact of backlog

That backlog could have a grave impact on the church in the U.S. The National Study of Catholic Priests — released in 2022 by The Catholic University of America’s Catholic Project — indicated 24% of priests serving in the U.S. are foreign-born, with many of them also subject to visa renewals.

In April, bipartisan legislation, titled the Religious Workforce Protection Act, was introduced in the Senate by Sens. Tim Kaine, D-Va., Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Jim Risch, R-Idaho, and in the House by Reps. Mike Carey, R-Ohio, and Richard Neal, D-Mass. In statements at the time, Kaine and Collins both cited priest shortages in their states. All five of those members are Catholic.

If signed into law, the bill would permit religious workers already in the U.S. on temporary R-1 status with pending EB-4 applications to stay in the U.S. while waiting for permanent residency, Collins’ office said at the time.

Catholic organizations, including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Jesuit Refugee Service/USA and the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, also known as CLINIC, have backed the legislation.

A spokesperson for the USCCB told OSV News on Aug. 6, “We’re continuing our education efforts about the pressing need for the RWPA, and together with our interfaith partners, we’re encouraging grassroots supporters to raise this issue with their members of Congress while they are back in their states/districts during the August recess.”

“We remain hopeful that Congress will have an opportunity to move the bill forward before the end of the year,” the spokesperson said.

Corcoran said the legislation would allow, for example, a Catholic priest with temporary R-1 status, to move from one parish to another in accordance with diocesan needs without jeopardizing that status.

“For many religious workers, as part of your job or part of your vocation, you’re going to be moving parishes right?” she said. “And under the current framework, you can’t do that without jeopardizing your status.”

The bill, however, would not increase the limit on how many visas are granted.

“It’s a very modest fix,” she said. “One of the things we’ve seen historically is that there are a lot of small, little fixes that could happen through legislation for these exact kinds of immigration dilemmas. But historically, Congress has always wanted to pass everything at once, so this provision has been put in comprehensive immigration reform bills in the past, but the problem is that there are other provisions in (broader immigration packages) that there can’t be consensus on.”

Bill’s outlook

Despite bipartisan support, it was not immediately clear what the prospects might be for the bill once lawmakers return from their August recess, or whether President Donald Trump would be willing to sign it.

The White House did not return a request for comment from OSV News by publication time on whether the Trump administration would support the bill.

But several proponents of the legislation who spoke with OSV News pointed to the bipartisan nature of the bill as cause for optimism.

Dylan Corbett, executive director of the Hope Border Institute, a group that works to apply the perspective of Catholic social teaching in policy and practice to the U.S.-Mexico border region, told OSV News, “Congress and the Trump administration have a good opportunity to make an urgent targeted fix to ensure clergy and religious from abroad serving our communities throughout the country don’t become casualties of an increasingly broken immigration system.”

“Here the Biden administration really fumbled the ball. If we can get this done, the broader lesson can be that it really is possible to come together and find common ground to build an immigration system that is workable, efficient and meets our national needs,” Corbett said.

Corcoran said, “We’ve seen so little bipartisan solutions to problems, and to me, this is the kind of thing that this administration should be embracing, because it can show that they can be compassionate, that there are bipartisan solutions that are available for certain sub-populations within the immigration backlog, and that we all benefit, right, from these people being in our parishes.”

Advocacy for the bill comes as the Trump administration seeks to implement hardline immigration policies, including its pursuit of what it has called “the largest deportation in U.S. history.”

Process for religious workers

However, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an interview that aired Aug. 7 with Raymond Arroyo on EWTN’s “The World Over,” that the administration is trying to “create its own standalone process” for religious workers, instead of having them conflated with other immigration categories.

“And I’ve been in touch, for example, with a number of our cardinals here in the United States and bishops about that as well,” Rubio said. “And it’s not only the Catholic Church. I mean, our other places are being impacted by it but we’re trying to streamline that process.”

“We clearly view that entry point as very different than some of these others,” Rubio said, adding, “We don’t want to read headlines that some Catholic Church had to close because it couldn’t get their priests here … some order closed because some nun couldn’t get here. So we’re not interested in that. That’s really not the aim here. It’s more caught up in the structure of it. We’ll have a plan to fix it. We’re working on it. We know it’s an issue, and we’re committed to fixing it.”

Congress is scheduled to return from its August recess in early September.

Homan’s comments come after Attorney General Pam Bondi sought to roll back the District’s “sanctuary” policies around migrants, including lifting the block on local police cooperating with immigration enforcement.

“Law enforcement needs to work with law enforcement,” Homan told NewsNation, The Hill’s sister network. “We’re not asking Metro PD to be immigration officers, but when you’re enforcing criminal law and when you find an illegal alien not only in violation of immigration law here illegally but involved with criminal activity, they absolutely should call us.”

He added that he hopes the administration’s crackdown on crime in the nation’s capital could be an example for the rest of the country.

FBI Director Kash Patel said Friday that authorities have made more than 120 arrests since Trump announced the federal takeover, writing on the social platform X, “the good cops are getting the job done.”

Democrats have warned that Trump’s move to take over the District’s police department and deploy hundreds of federal police and National Guard troops to the streets could be a test case for crackdowns on blue cities in the future — especially given the president’s insistence that the level of crime in D.C. is far higher than recorded statistics indicate.

Homan told NewsNation he believed the increased police and military presence in the nation’s capital has deterred crime in the city.

“It’s not just the people that are arresting that are making D.C. safer, it’s the message we’re sending that we’re out here in force,” he said. “I think there are a lot of criminals staying off the street because they know the city is overwhelmed with law enforcement.”

The Trump administration’s federalization of the city’s law enforcement has already triggered at least one legal battle and many protests. D.C.’s Democratic attorney general sued the federal government Friday morning over its move to install Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) chief Terry Cole as the city’s “emergency police commissioner.”

Angela Garcia was on her way to work with her older son when she was ambushed by federal officials on July 6. The intense moment was caught on camera as masked officers surrounded the family and smashed through Garcia’s car window to make an arrest.

“They had no patience with her,” Alexander Fabian Garcia, the younger son, described the federal agents, adding that his mom had never had any legal problems. NBC Los Angeles also found no criminal history with Garcia.

The single mother has been in the country for over 25 years after moving from Mexico. She’d made a life for herself and her two boys by opening a beauty salon, which remains closed since her arrest.

“It’s been a big shock and more stress for us,” Alexander said. “It’s hard figuring out what we are going to do.”

Garcia, 41, was being held at the Adelanto Detention Center, according to her sons, as she is finding ways to help others while being detained.

“We just recently found out that she’s volunteering at the center, helping people get a haircut,” Sofia Spencer, her niece, said.

Alexander and his 18-year-old brother said they are trying to stay strong while trying to make sense of what happened to their beloved mother.

“I love her, and I don’t want her to be sad,” the teenager said, hoping to reassure their mom that he and his brother are safe. “I will keep pursuing my dreams and goals. I wish she could see me accomplish them.”

Garcia’s sons do not know what will happen to her beauty salon, which has been shuttered for a month.

Many immigrant religious workers -- such as Catholic priests and nuns -- legally enter the country on R-1 non-immigrant religious worker visas.
""And this affects these religious workers,"" she said.

The White House did not return a request for comment from OSV News by publication time on whether the Trump administration would support the bill.","Some immigrant religious workers are facing legal limbo, and Catholic advocates are pushing the Trump administration to address the backlog in their visa category.

Many immigrant religious workers -- such as Catholic priests and nuns -- legally enter the country on R-1 non-immigrant religious worker visas. These are initially granted for a 30-month period, with one possible renewal allowing for a total of 5 years, so they can be in the U.S. to carry out ministry work. While within that window, they can apply for employment-based EB-4 status so they can legally remain in the U.S. without interruption.

""One of the challenges is that because the number of green cards that are issued every year is not representative of the number of people that are eligible, you've got huge backlogs,"" Erin Corcoran, an associate teaching professor and executive director of the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame, told OSV News.

""And this affects these religious workers,"" she said.

That backlog could have a grave impact on the church in the U.S. The National Study of Catholic Priests -- released in 2022 by The Catholic University of America's Catholic Project -- indicated 24% of priests serving in the U.S. are foreign-born, with many of them also subject to visa renewals.

In April, bipartisan legislation, titled the Religious Workforce Protection Act, was introduced in the Senate by Sens. Tim Kaine, D-Va., Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Jim Risch, R-Idaho, and in the House by Reps. Mike Carey, R-Ohio, and Richard Neal, D-Mass. In statements at the time, Kaine and Collins both cited priest shortages in their states. All five of those members are Catholic.

If signed into law, the bill would permit religious workers already in the U.S. on temporary R-1 status with pending EB-4 applications to stay in the U.S. while waiting for permanent residency, Collins' office said at the time.

Catholic organizations, including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Jesuit Refugee Service/USA and the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, also known as CLINIC, have backed the legislation.

A spokesperson for the USCCB told OSV News on Aug. 6, ""We're continuing our education efforts about the pressing need for the RWPA, and together with our interfaith partners, we're encouraging grassroots supporters to raise this issue with their members of Congress while they are back in their states/districts during the August recess.""

""We remain hopeful that Congress will have an opportunity to move the bill forward before the end of the year,"" the spokesperson said.

Corcoran said the legislation would allow, for example, a Catholic priest with temporary R-1 status, to move from one parish to another in accordance with diocesan needs without jeopardizing that status.

""For many religious workers, as part of your job or part of your vocation, you're going to be moving parishes right?"" she said. ""And under the current framework, you can't do that without jeopardizing your status.""

The bill, however, would not increase the limit on how many visas are granted.

""It's a very modest fix,"" she said. ""One of the things we've seen historically is that there are a lot of small, little fixes that could happen through legislation for these exact kinds of immigration dilemmas. But historically, Congress has always wanted to pass everything at once, so this provision has been put in comprehensive immigration reform bills in the past, but the problem is that there are other provisions in (broader immigration packages) that there can't be consensus on.""

Despite bipartisan support, it was not immediately clear what the prospects might be for the bill once lawmakers return from their August recess, or whether President Donald Trump would be willing to sign it.

The White House did not return a request for comment from OSV News by publication time on whether the Trump administration would support the bill.

But several proponents of the legislation who spoke with OSV News pointed to the bipartisan nature of the bill as cause for optimism.

Dylan Corbett, executive director of the Hope Border Institute, a group that works to apply the perspective of Catholic social teaching in policy and practice to the U.S.-Mexico border region, told OSV News, ""Congress and the Trump administration have a good opportunity to make an urgent targeted fix to ensure clergy and religious from abroad serving our communities throughout the country don't become casualties of an increasingly broken immigration system.""

""Here the Biden administration really fumbled the ball. If we can get this done, the broader lesson can be that it really is possible to come together and find common ground to build an immigration system that is workable, efficient and meets our national needs,"" Corbett said.

Corcoran said, ""We've seen so little bipartisan solutions to problems, and to me, this is the kind of thing that this administration should be embracing, because it can show that they can be compassionate, that there are bipartisan solutions that are available for certain sub-populations within the immigration backlog, and that we all benefit, right, from these people being in our parishes.""

Advocacy for the bill comes as the Trump administration seeks to implement hardline immigration policies, including its pursuit of what it has called ""the largest deportation in U.S. history.""

However, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an interview that aired Aug. 7 with Raymond Arroyo on EWTN's ""The World Over,"" that the administration is trying to ""create its own standalone process"" for religious workers, instead of having them conflated with other immigration categories.

""And I've been in touch, for example, with a number of our cardinals here in the United States and bishops about that as well,"" Rubio said. ""And it's not only the Catholic Church. I mean, our other places are being impacted by it but we're trying to streamline that process.""

""We clearly view that entry point as very different than some of these others,"" Rubio said, adding, ""We don't want to read headlines that some Catholic Church had to close because it couldn't get their priests here ... some order closed because some nun couldn't get here. So we're not interested in that. That's really not the aim here. It's more caught up in the structure of it. We'll have a plan to fix it. We're working on it. We know it's an issue, and we're committed to fixing it.""

Section 3582(c)(1)(A)’s history confirms the broad discretion it grants to sentencing judges.
The First Step Act does not provide grounds for courts to write a prohibition on considering disparities in § 924(c) sentences into § 3582(c)(1)(a).
The court below was wrong to prohibit the sentencing judges from considering major changes in the law that result in sentencing disparities solely based on when a person was sentenced, and the Supreme Court should reverse.","Drawing on a centuries-long tradition of granting wide discretion to judges when imposing sentences, the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 allows federal judges to reduce a previously imposed sentence when they conclude that there are “extraordinary and compelling reasons” to do so. Petitioners in these cases moved for reductions in their sentences under the Sentencing Reform Act because of significant difference between the sentences they are serving and the sentences that they would have received if they were sentenced for those same offenses today.

The petitioners are serving federal sentences under § 924(c), which criminalizes the use of a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking or a crime of violence. When they were initially sentenced under § 924(c), the law required judges to impose a 25-year minimum sentence for each § 924(c) violation after the first, even if the defendant was convicted for both violations at the same time. Because this interpretation led to sentences that many judges felt were unjust, Congress enacted the First Step Act to clarify that judges are not required to impose these sorts of stacked sentences when sentencing first-time offenders. If the petitioners had been sentenced after the First Step Act’s enactment, their sentences would have been significantly shorter.

According to the court below, the sentencing judges in the petitioners’ cases could not consider the decades-long disparity between the petitioners’ sentences and those of individuals who commit similar crimes today when assessing whether “extraordinary and compelling reasons” exist for a sentence reduction. In August 2025, CAC filed an amicus brief explaining that this position is at odds with both the text and history of the compassionate release statute.

The text of § 3582(c)(1)(A) of the Sentencing Reform Act gives judges broad discretion to determine the existence of “extraordinary and compelling reasons” for a sentence reduction. The statute contains only one instruction about the scope of judges’ authority to assess the “extraordinary and compelling reasons” for compassionate release: courts must abide by the Sentencing Commission’s policy statements. And in tasking the Sentencing Commission with providing guidance on what should be considered “extraordinary and compelling reasons,” it provides only one stipulation: “[r]ehabilitation of the defendant alone shall not be considered an extraordinary and compelling reason.” The clear inference is that other reasons are permissible within a judge’s discretion.

Congress’s use of the phrase “extraordinary and compelling” bears this out. In 1984, the phrase “extraordinary and compelling reasons” connoted determinations that were broad, individualized, and fact-dependent. The plain language of the statute indicates that the sentencing judge should make an individualized assessment of the case, considering all relevant factors, to decide whether there were “extraordinary and compelling reasons” to reduce the individual’s sentence, and no factors other than rehabilitation alone should be categorically excluded. Legal dictionaries and case law at the time reinforce this definition.

Section 3582(c)(1)(A)’s history confirms the broad discretion it grants to sentencing judges. Before the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, courts imposed the sentence, but parole officers exercised absolute discretion over the actual duration of imprisonment. Congress felt that the system of indeterminate sentencing had unjustified consequences, like creating uncertainty as to the time an offender would actually spend in prison, producing serious disparities between sentences imposed for similar offenses, and letting parole boards usurp the function of the judiciary. In response to these concerns, the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 revolutionized the federal sentencing scheme, creating a more structured system with a compassionate release provision acting as a “safety valve” in unusual cases. Lawmakers described this safety valve authority as a response to judges’ requests for the power to deal with what one congressman described as “the very exceptional situation where someone obviously slips through the cracks and gets a much longer sentence.” In granting judges this “safety valve” authority, Congress ensured that they would have the same broad discretion to consider a wide variety of different factors that parole officials had enjoyed under the previous regime.

The First Step Act does not provide grounds for courts to write a prohibition on considering disparities in § 924(c) sentences into § 3582(c)(1)(a). In 2018, Congress enacted the First Step Act, which “clarif[ied]” that district court judges are not required to impose stacked 25-year sentences when sentencing first-time offenders under § 924(c) and provided that these amendments “shall apply to any offense that was committed before” the First Step Act’s enactment. According to the court below, courts cannot consider the fact of the First Step Act’s change to § 924(c) in the compassionate release eligibility context because doing so would “sow conflict within the statute.” This is wrong. Though the First Step Act provided that “the changes to the § 924(c) mandatory minimums would not apply to people who had already been sentenced,” considering the fact of an amended penalty when assessing whether “extraordinary and compelling reasons” exist for a sentence reduction is not the same as applying the amended penalty. A sentence reduction is not an application of the First Step Act at all—if that were the case, the court would not need to find “extraordinary and compelling reasons” for the reduction. The history of parole and other “safety valve” mechanisms also makes clear that disparities between the penalty a defendant received and those applied to people who committed similar offenses can be considered under § 3582(C)(1)(A). Indeed, this history illustrates that parole decisionmakers were responsive to changes in how society perceived an offense over time, meaning that disparities produced by Congress’s decision to reduce a penalty would be especially relevant to their decisions.

Trump also appointed Bondi as U.S. attorney general, the nation’s top law enforcement official.
Bondi said she was rescinding that order and other MPD policies limiting inquiries into immigration status and preventing arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants.
Troops will assist law enforcement in a variety of roles, including traffic control posts and crowd control, National Guard Major Micah Maxwell said.","Washington’s police department chief said Trump’s move would threaten law and order by upending the command structure. “In my nearly three decades in law enforcement, I have never seen a single government action that would cause a greater threat to law and order than this dangerous directive,” Police Chief Pamela Smith said in a court filing.

The legal battle playing out Friday showed the escalating tensions in a mostly Democratic city that now has its police department under the control of the Republican presidential administration that exists in its midst. Trump’s takeover of the police department is historic yet had played out with a slow ramp-up in federal law enforcement officials and National Guard troops to start the week.

As the weekend approached, though, signs across the city — from the streets to the legal system — suggested a deepening crisis over who controls the city’s immigration and policing policies, the district’s right to govern itself and daily life for the millions of people who live and work in the metro area.

Washington’s top legal official was pushing in court Friday to reverse the order putting the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration in charge of police in the nation’s capital.

District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb argues the police takeover is illegal and threatens to “wreak operational havoc.” Conflicting commands and confusion about who’s in charge are a serious problem for effective policing, Smith said.

The lawsuit comes after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said Thursday night DEA boss Terry Cole will assume the police chief’s duties and approval authority for any orders issued to officers. It was unclear where the move left the city’s current police chief, Smith, who works for the mayor.

Schwalb argues the new order goes beyond Trump’s authority and implementing it would “sow chaos” in the Metropolitan Police Department. “The administration’s unlawful actions are an affront to the dignity and autonomy of the 700,000 Americans who call D.C. home,” Schwalb said.

The Justice Department declined to comment on the district’s lawsuit, and a White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.

The police takeover is the latest move by Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the United States illegally.

It also marks one of the most sweeping assertions of federal authority over a local government in modern times. While Washington has grappled with spikes in violence and visible homelessness, the city’s homicide rate ranks below those of several other major U.S. cities, and the capital is not in the throes of the public safety collapse the Trump administration has portrayed.

Chief had agreed to share immigration information

Schwalb had said late Thursday that Bondi’s directive was “unlawful,” arguing it could not be followed by the city’s police force. He wrote in a memo to Smith that “members of MPD must continue to follow your orders and not the orders of any official not appointed by the Mayor,” setting up the legal clash between the heavily Democratic district and the Republican administration.

The district’s attorney general is an elected position and the city’s top legal officer. It’s separate from the federal U.S. attorney appointed by the president to serve in Washington, a role now filled by former Fox News Channel host and judge Jeanine Pirro. Trump also appointed Bondi as U.S. attorney general, the nation’s top law enforcement official.

Bondi’s directive came even after Smith had told MPD officers hours earlier to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody, such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief’s directive because it allowed for continued enforcement of “sanctuary policies,” which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.

Bondi said she was rescinding that order and other MPD policies limiting inquiries into immigration status and preventing arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants. All new directives must now receive approval from Cole, Bondi said.

Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser pushed back Thursday, writing on social media “there is no statute that conveys the District’s personnel authority to a federal official.”

The president has more power over the nation’s capital than other cities, but D.C. has elected its own mayor and city council since the Home Rule Act was signed in 1973.

Trump is the first president to exert control over the city’s police force since it was passed. The law limits that control to 30 days without congressional approval, though Trump has suggested he’d seek to extend it. Schwalb argues the president’s role is narrow under the law, limited to requiring the mayor to provide police services for federal purposes.

Residents are seeing a significant show of force

A population already tense from days of ramp-up has begun seeing more significant shows of force across the city. National Guard troops watched over some of the world’s most renowned landmarks, and Humvees took position in front of the busy main train station. Volunteers helped homeless people leave long-standing encampments — to where was often unclear.

Twenty federal law enforcement teams had fanned out across the city Thursday night with more than 1,750 people joining the operation, said a White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the operation. They made 33 arrests, including 15 migrants who did not have permanent legal status, the official said. Others were arrested on warrants for murder, rape and driving under the influence.

Department of Homeland Security police stood outside Nationals Park during a game Thursday between the Washington Nationals and the Philadelphia Phillies. DEA agents patrolled The Wharf, a popular nightlife area, while Secret Service officers were seen in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood.

Bowser, walking a tightrope between the Republican White House and the constituency of her largely Democratic city, was out of town Thursday for a family commitment in Martha’s Vineyard but would be back Friday, her office said.

The uptick in visibility of federal forces around the city, including in many high-traffic areas, has been striking to residents going about their lives.

Officers set up a checkpoint in one of D.C.’s popular nightlife areas, drawing protests. Troops were stationed outside the Union Station transportation hub as the 800 Guard members who have been activated by Trump started in on missions that include monument security, community safety patrols and beautification efforts, the Pentagon said.

Troops will assist law enforcement in a variety of roles, including traffic control posts and crowd control, National Guard Major Micah Maxwell said. The Guard members have been trained in de-escalation tactics and crowd control equipment, Maxwell said.

National Guard troops are a semi-regular presence in D.C., typically being used during mass public events like the annual July 4 celebration. They have regularly been used in the past for crowd control in and around Metro stations.

Trump’s takeover of the police department is historic yet had played out with a slow ramp-up in federal law enforcement officials and National Guard troops to start the week.

As the weekend approached, though, signs across the city — from the streets to the legal system — suggested a deepening crisis over who controls the city’s immigration and policing policies, the district’s right to govern itself and daily life for the millions of people who live and work in the metro area.

At a Friday afternoon hearing for the District’s request for a temporary restraining order against sidelining Smith, U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes indicated the law likely doesn’t allow the Trump administration power to fully take over city police, but it probably does give the president more power than the city might like.

“The way I read the statute, the president can ask, the mayor must provide, but the president can’t control,” said Reyes, nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden.

An attorney for the Trump administration, Yaakov Roth, said in court that the move to sideline Smith came after an immigration order that still held back some aid to federal authorities. He argued that the president has broad authority to determine what kind of help police in Washington must provide.

Washington’s top legal official was pushing in court to reverse U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi’s order Thursday to put the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terry Cole, in charge of Washington police.

District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb argues the president’s role is narrow under the law, limited to requiring the mayor to provide police services for federal purposes. He wrote in court filings that the police takeover is illegal and threatens to “wreak operational havoc.”

The police takeover is the latest move by Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the United States illegally.

It also marks one of the most sweeping assertions of federal authority over a local government in modern times. While Washington has grappled with spikes in violence and visible homelessness, the city’s homicide rate ranks below those of several other major U.S. cities, and the capital is not in the throes of the public safety collapse the Trump administration has portrayed.

The president has more power over the nation’s capital than other cities, but D.C. has elected its own mayor and city council since the Home Rule Act was signed in 1973.

Trump is the first president to exert control over the city’s police force since it was passed. The law limits that control to 30 days without congressional approval, though Trump has suggested he’d seek to extend it.

Chief had agreed to share immigration information

Bondi’s directive came even after Smith had told MPD officers hours earlier to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody, such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief’s directive because it allowed for continued practice of “sanctuary policies,” which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.

Bondi said she was rescinding that order and other MPD policies limiting inquiries into immigration status and preventing arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants. All new directives must now receive approval from Cole, Bondi said.

Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser pushed back Thursday, writing on social media “there is no statute that conveys the District’s personnel authority to a federal official.”

Meanwhile, immigrant advocates in Washington were trying to advise immigrants on how to respond to the new policies. Anusce Sanai, associate legal director for the Washington-based immigrant nonprofit Ayuda, said they’re still parsing through the legal aspects of the policies.

“Even with the most anti-immigrant administration, we would always tell our clients that they must call the police, that they should call the police,” Sanai said. “But now we find ourselves that we have to be very careful on what we advise.”

Amy Fischer, an organizer with Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid, said that before the federal takeover most of what they had seen in the nation’s capital was Immigration and Customs Enforcement targeting a specific individual. But since last Friday night they’ve seen a “really significant change,” she said, with ICE and federal officers doing roving patrols around the city.

She said a hotline set up by immigration advocates to report ICE activity “is receiving calls almost off the hook.”

ICE said in a post on X that their teams had arrested “several” people in Washington Friday. A video posted on X showed two uniformed personnel putting handcuffs on someone while standing outside a white transport van.

Residents are seeing a significant show of force

A population already tense from days of ramp-up has begun seeing more significant shows of force across the city. National Guard troops watched over some of the world’s most renowned landmarks, and Humvees took position in front of the busy main train station. Volunteers helped homeless people leave long-standing encampments — to where was often unclear.

Twenty federal law enforcement teams had fanned out across the city Thursday night with more than 1,750 people joining the operation, said a White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the operation. They made 33 arrests, including 15 migrants who did not have permanent legal status, the official said. Others were arrested on warrants for murder, rape and driving under the influence.

Department of Homeland Security police stood outside Nationals Park during a game Thursday between the Washington Nationals and the Philadelphia Phillies. DEA agents patrolled The Wharf, a popular nightlife area, while Secret Service officers were seen in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood.

“I always feel safe in every quadrant and every ward of this city,” said Anthony Leak, a lifelong Washingtonian. He attended the Nationals game Thursday and said he didn’t think the presence of federal agents meaningfully changed the regularly rowdy scene of sports fans and lively bars.

As the District challenged the Trump administration in court Friday, more than 100 protesters gathered less than a block away in front of police headquarters for a rally, chanting “Protect home rule!” and waving signs saying “Resist!”

The order, handed down Tuesday, blocks HHS from sharing data on Medicaid enrollees in these states with Immigration and Customs Enforcement for the purpose of targeting migrants for deportation.

""Using CMS data for immigration enforcement threatens to significantly disrupt the operation of Medicaid—a program that Congress has deemed critical for the provision of health coverage to the nation’s most vulnerable residents,"" Chhabria wrote.

CALIFORNIA SUES TRUMP ADMIN AGAIN, THIS TIME OVER MEDICAID DATA TRANSFER TO DHS

The judge wrote that while there is nothing ""categorically unlawful"" about DHS collecting data from other agencies for immigration enforcement purposes, ICE has had a policy against using Medicaid data for that reason for 12 years.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has also long maintained a policy of using patients' personal information only to run its healthcare programs.

""Given these policies, and given that the various players in the Medicaid system have relied on them, it was incumbent upon the agencies to carry out a reasoned decision-making process before changing them,"" Chhabria wrote, adding: ""The record in this case strongly suggests that no such process occurred.""

Chhabria said the preliminary injunction will remain in effect until HHS provides ""reasoned decision-making"" for its new policy of sharing data with immigration officials or until litigation concludes.

The disclosure of Medicaid data is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to give DHS more data to help locate migrants and carry out the president's mass deportation plan. In May, a federal judge refused to block the Internal Revenue Service from sharing immigrants' tax data with ICE officials.

BIDEN-APPOINTED JUDGE HALTS TRUMP HHS OVERHAUL AFTER DEMOCRAT-LED LAWSUIT

""The Trump Administration’s move to use Medicaid data for immigration enforcement upended longstanding policy protections without notice or consideration for the consequences,"" California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement. ""As the President continues to overstep his authority in his inhumane anti-immigrant crusade, this is a clear reminder that he remains bound by the law.""

HHS first provided the personal information of millions of Medicaid enrollees in June, prompting a lawsuit from the 20 states to block the new policy.

In July, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services entered into a new agreement that allowed DHS to have daily access to the personal data of the country's 79 million Medicaid enrollees, including their Social Security numbers and home address.

Neither agreement was announced publicly. HHS has insisted that its agreement with DHS is legal.

Medicaid officials had attempted to block the data transfer, but they were overruled by top advisers to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

Immigrants – both legal and illegal – are not authorized to enroll in the Medicaid program, which offers nearly free coverage for health services. However, under federal law, all states must offer emergency Medicaid, a temporary coverage that only covers lifesaving services in emergency rooms to anyone, including people who are not U.S. citizens.

The National Day Laborer Organizing Network identified the man as Roberto Carlos Montoya Valdés, 52, of Guatemala. He ran from a Home Depot in Monrovia, about 20 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles, as Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents began the operation Thursday morning, Monrovia City Manager Dylan Feik said in a statement.

He was heading north across eastbound Interstate 210 when he stepped in front of an SUV going about 60 mph in the far-left lane, the California Highway Patrol said in a release, citing investigators. The vehicle’s right front end hit the man, who suffered major injuries and died at a hospital.

The person who ran onto the freeway was “not being pursued by any DHS law enforcement,” the Department of Homeland Security told CNN in a statement. “We do not know their legal status. We were not aware of this incident or notified by California Highway Patrol until hours after operations in the area had concluded.”

Home Depot locations increasingly have become targets for immigration raids as the Trump administration amps up deportation operations as part of a broader crackdown. The home improvement retailer traditionally has been a place documented and undocumented day laborers gather to pick up jobs as roofers, painters and construction workers.

Thursday’s death followed that of a farmworker fatally injured in a fall during a chaotic ICE raid in July at a California cannabis facility. It also came as the Trump administration asks the Supreme Court to halt an order barring immigration authorities from stopping or arresting people in and near Los Angeles based solely on factors like what language speak or where they work.

At least 10 people were detained in the ICE operation in Monrovia, said California Assemblymember John Harabedian, whose district includes the city. He called the incident “frightening and chaotic,” adding in a statement:

“Raids like this do not make our streets safer – they terrorize families, instill fear, and put lives at risk.”

CNN has reached out to ICE and the Department of Homeland Security.

Home Depot wasn’t “notified that ICE activities are going to happen and we aren’t involved in the operations,” the retailer told CNN on Thursday.

“The crash, including circumstances surrounding how and why the pedestrian was on the freeway, remains under investigation by the CHP’s Baldwin Park Area,” the highway patrol said.

The National Day Laborer Organizing Network said it has connected with Valdés’ family to provide support following his death.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/still-21869160-189059-359-still.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-08-15 15:56:34.104937

Moving forward.” If you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence, you can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233 or text START to 8788.","A woman who claims she was assaulted by her boyfriend is now in a detention center in Louisiana after he called the police to accuse her of assault and then contacted Immigration and Customs Enforcement and told them she didn’t have legal immigration status, the woman’s mother alleged to Noticias Telemundo.

In a separate case from April, a Salvadoran woman in Houston called 911 to report being a victim of domestic violence. Legal records reviewed by the Houston Chronicle indicate that police then called ICE.

The women’s stories are not unique, activists and experts tell Noticias Telemundo, explaining that in some cases abusers use immigration status to control or abuse their victims — who come from all socioeconomic backgrounds. Experts say victims are more fearful now amid the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown and recent immigration raids.

Isaret Jeffers, founder of the Tree Collective, which supports farmworkers in the Tampa, Florida, area, said several undocumented women farmworkers have told her they’re enduring abuse from their partners for fear that reporting them will lead to their deportation.

Isabel Martínez, manager of the social services program at the Tahirih Justice Center, focused on helping victims of gender-based violence, said women fear that “not only will nothing happen to the abuser, but now I will have to be deported, or be detained, or get into trouble if I call the police.”

Since January, Martínez said, women have told her organization that they’d decided they couldn’t call the police and were too afraid to call the group because they feared it would have to call the police and report the abuse.

“Since the deportations began and they’re targeting people more severely, that’s where we’ve seen people become more afraid,” Martínez said. “They’re thinking twice about reporting.”

Though women represent 84% of victims of spousal abuse and 86% of victims of intimate partner abuse, according to the Department of Justice’s Bureau of Statistics, anyone can be a victim of abuse, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation or national origin.

Fear of reporting — and deadly consequences

Immigrant victims’ fear of reporting crimes against them is not new. As early as 2019, the Tahirih Justice Center said its social workers had observed that women often refused to report gender-based violence for fear of deportation.

In a national survey released by the Alliance for Immigrant Survivors this June, 76% of immigrant advocates reported that victims of domestic violence were afraid to call the police for fear of ICE. It also found that half of immigration advocates had worked with immigrants who had dropped their criminal or civil cases for fear of deportation.

A similar study of two U.S. hospital emergency departments (one in San Francisco and one in Oakland, California) found almost 1 in 5 (19%) domestic violence victims avoided going to the police for fear that the police would report them to immigration authorities.

Francesco Duberli, CEO and founder of Survivors Pathway, a Miami-based center that offers counseling and legal help for survivors of domestic violence, sexual abuse and human trafficking, said that “what we’re seeing is an exaggerated, and also very sad, increase in the psychological aspect of being terrified of immigration authorities.”

ICE reopened the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE) office, created during Trump’s first administration. Its main focus is to provide help to victims of crimes perpetrated by immigrants and to “acknowledge and serve the needs of victims and families who have been affected by crimes committed by individuals with a nexus to immigration violations,” according to its website.

Under one of the “frequently asked questions,” it states that it “provides releasable information to all victims of crime with a nexus to immigration, regardless of the immigration status of the victim.” Noticias Telemundo contacted ICE and the Department of Homeland Security about the office, but didn’t receive a response. VOICE said it did not have a spokesperson available and referred any questions to its website.

A failure to report domestic abuse can have fatal consequences: More than 50% of homicides committed by intimate partners were preceded by violence, and in cases where the victim is a woman, the figure rises to 75%, according to studies by the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In Houston, an immigrant woman who is not being identified because she fears reprisals told Noticias Telemundo of a November 2024 incident in which she felt her life was in danger. She recalled clutching the steering wheel while driving as her partner was grabbing it and threatening to kill her. She said the man, who is her child’s father and had been drinking, poured a drink on her and then punched her in the stomach and later in the head, rendering her unconscious for a time.

She said she later drove to a friend’s house, called the police and reported the violence. The police arrested him, and upon his release from jail on that charge, he was detained by ICE and eventually deported. In November, following the violent episode, the woman, a Mexican immigrant, applied for a U visa for victims of crimes such as domestic violence, and is awaiting its approval.

Immigrant victims' challenges, risks

Certain factors make it hard for immigrant victims of domestic violence to leave or report their abusive situations, including being financially dependent on their abuser and having children who depend on them.

The Houston woman’s partner threatened to take away her son, and the stress affected both her and her baby. “That was the saddest part of this whole process,” the woman said. “He was a baby, he was a 1 1/2-year-old. If I didn’t eat, he didn’t want to eat either. He knew when I was sad. He knew when I was crying. And you say, ‘How could such a little person know I’m sick?’”

Leaving a partner and filing a complaint with the court system “requires reflection and asking, ‘What’s going to happen next? How do I pay the rent? How do I feed my children?’” said Duberli, of Survivors Pathway. If the children belong to the abuser, he can file for legal custody, which can cost thousands of dollars.

“It’s a conglomeration of socioeconomic and psychological factors, and when you put them all together, you realize they become an immense wall that prevents immigrants from seeking justice,” he said.

Low-income women have a higher incidence of domestic violence. Of the women who sought legal assistance after experiencing intimate partner violence, 85% lived at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, according to a 2024 study by the University of Cambridge.

Victims also fear that their partner will attack them further if they report it, or they feel ashamed and believe they’re to blame for their situation. A key factor, according to therapists, is victims’ self-esteem: As the Texas immigrant woman described it, “Feeling like you’re nobody” as psychological abuse escalates, with taunts like “What are you going to do without me?” and “How are you going to get ahead?” she said.

Some victims have suffered abuse in home countries where domestic violence is more normalized and they’re used to abusers having impunity, Duberli said.

Martínez, of the Tahirih Justice Center, said the first step to leaving an abusive relationship is to break the strong psychological control the perpetrator can have over the victim. “You don’t deserve abuse,” she said.

It’s also common for immigrant victims to lack a support network of family or friends in a country with a foreign culture and language.

Some immigrants face greater risk if they rely on an abusive spouse to obtain legal status, as the American Immigration Council (AIC) has stated on its website, since abusers can use immigration status as a “tool to silence their victims” and may delay, withdraw or fail to file petitions for their relatives or threaten to report them to authorities.

Emergency exits: The U visa and the VAWA petition

For victims of violent crimes such as domestic abuse who can demonstrate cooperation with authorities in the investigation or prosecution of the crime, there is the U visa. If approved, the applicant receives a work permit valid for four years, and after three years, they can apply for permanent residence (green card).

However, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services recently told Noticias Telemundo that “a good faith determination on a pending application for U nonimmigrant status does not protect a foreign national from immigration enforcement.”

Duberli said victims can also file a petition under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). Those who file a complaint, Duberli explains, can continue their immigration process without the abuser’s involvement or knowledge.

In the case of the Texas immigrant woman, she cooperated with authorities regarding the crime, a key step to getting her U visa status approved and regularized.

For now, the woman said, “I continue working on myself, on my self-esteem — I continue with everything. Moving forward.”

Magistrate Judge G. Michael Harvey revealed the denials to attorneys for Sydney Lori Reid and later granted their request to remove all bond conditions and release her on her own recognizance over prosecutors’ objections. He will resume a preliminary hearing on Friday afternoon to determine whether to dismiss the case entirely.

“Two presentations to the grand jury returned no bill both times,” Harvey said. “Suggesting the evidence is wanting, given the standard for indictment is probable cause. Suggesting the government may never get an indictment.”

Grand juries are tasked with deciding only whether there is a reasonable basis to support charging someone with a crime – a much lower burden for prosecutors than the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard of criminal juries – and typically make their decisions after hearing evidence only from the government. At the federal level, grand juries return indictments, or “true bills,” in the vast majority of cases.

Reid, 44, was charged last month with an enhanced felony version of an assault charge that requires inflicting bodily injury on a federal officer and carries a maximum sentence of up to eight years in prison. The charge is the same offense filed this week against a former DOJ employee accused of throwing a sandwich at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent.

In a press release last month, U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro’s office accused Reid of trying to impede the transfer of two alleged members of the 18th Street gang who were being arrested by ICE outside the D.C. Jail prior to transfer to the custody of the FBI.

Federal prosecutors declined to call the injured FBI agent or any of the ICE officers involved in the incident during Thursday’s hearing, however. Instead, they had an investigator with the U.S. Attorney’s Office testify about his review of video of the incident and brief conversations with the officers. The investigator, Special Agent Sean Ricardi, said he’d had no involvement in the case until he was asked to prepare for testimony Thursday morning.

Video played by prosecutors shows Reid approaching the ICE officers while holding up her phone, which she says is for her protection. She is then later seen being held by multiple officers against a wall while she asks, “How do you feel about stealing f***ing people?”

“Mind your own business!” an unidentified ICE agent can be heard responding.

Ricardi said while officers were attempting to control her, Reid’s “flailing arm movements made contact” with the FBI agent. No injury is shown on the videos played in court, although prosecutors submitted photographs of the agent with small abrasions on the back of her hand, which Ricardi said did not appear to be present prior to the incident.

Eugene Ohm, an assistant federal public defender representing Reid, said prosecutors were presenting the court with nothing but “hearsay” from an investigator who wasn’t present. He asked Harvey to review the grand jury testimony himself before ruling on probable cause, although Harvey declined.

“We should be able to get to the bottom of why all the citizens of the District of Columbia seem to think there’s no crime while the government continues to allege one against my client,” Ohm said.

Because Reid is charged with a felony, under federal law, prosecutors must secure an indictment within 30 days of her arrest. That clock was paused temporarily until Thursday’s hearing, but is now running. Following a rejection by a grand jury, prosecutors can attempt again to seek an indictment as many times as they want with Pirro’s permission. Alternatively, they could charge Reid with a lower-level misdemeanor offense that does not require indictment.

Harvey ordered the parties to return to court on Friday afternoon to resume the preliminary hearing. Reid’s attorneys have asked him to decline to find probable cause and dismiss the case against her entirely.",https://media.wusa9.com/assets/WUSA/images/cd6fa579-b53f-4738-9b1c-53130bb410e5/20250506T205125/cd6fa579-b53f-4738-9b1c-53130bb410e5_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 13:57:18.842299

Evacuated Afghans’ unease has been compounded by Trump’s aggressive approach to immigration enforcement, which has increasingly seen those without criminal histories targeted for deportations and permanent residents targeted for their political advocacy.
The Trump administration has paused asylum claims at the US southern border, citing a national emergency.
The Reuters news agency also reported in July that the UAE had notified Washington that it had begun returning evacuated Afghans.","Four years have passed since Hanifa Girowal fled Afghanistan on a US evacuation flight. But every August, her mind returns to the same place.

Like many Afghans evacuated amid the August 15 Taliban takeover of Kabul, Girowal, who worked in human rights under the former Afghan government, still remains stuck in “legal limbo” in the United States. She is steadfastly pursuing a more stable status in the US, even as the political landscape surrounding her, and thousands of other Afghans in similar situations, shifts.

“I somehow feel like I’m still stuck in August 2021 and all the other Augusts in between, I can’t remember anything about them,” Girowal told Al Jazeera.

She often recalls the mad dash amid a crush of bodies at the crowded Kabul International Airport: people shot in front of her, a week of hiding, a flight to Qatar, then Germany and then finally, the US state of Virginia.

Followed by the early days of trying to begin a new life from the fragments of the old.

“Everything just comes up again to the surface, and it’s like reliving that trauma we went through, and we have been trying to heal from since that day,” she said.

The struggle may have become familiar, but her disquiet has been heightened since US President Donald Trump took office on January 20. His hardline immigration policies have touched nearly every immigrant community in the US, underscoring vulnerabilities for anyone on a precarious legal status.

There is a feeling that anything could happen, from one day to the next.

“I have an approved asylum case, which gives a certain level of protection, but we still don’t know the future of certain policies on immigration,” Girowal said. “I am very much fearful that I can be subjected to deportation at any time.”

Four years after the US withdrawal, much remains unclear about how Trump’s policies will affect Afghans who are already in the US, estimated to total about 180,000.

They arrived through a tangle of different avenues, including 75,000 flown in on evacuation flights in the immediate aftermath of the withdrawal, as the administration of US President Joe Biden undertook what it dubbed “Operation Allies Welcome“. Thousands more have since sought asylum by making treacherous journeys across the world to traverse the US southern border.

Some have relocated via so-called Special Immigrant Visas (SIVs), reserved for individuals who worked directly with the US military in Afghanistan, under a notoriously backlogged programme.

Others have been resettled through a special State Department programme, known as Priority 1 (P1) and Priority 2 (P2), launched by the administration of President Biden, meant for Afghans who face persecution for having worked in various capacities on behalf of the US government or with a US-based organisation in Afghanistan.

Adam Bates, a supervisory policy counsel at the International Refugee Assistance Programme, explained that some of those pathways, most notably the SIV and refugee programmes, provide a clear course towards US residency and, eventually, citizenship.

But, he clarified, others do not – a fact that advocates have warned leaves members of the population subject to perpetual uncertainty and political whims.

“A lot of the advocacy to the Biden administration officials was about finding more permanent legal pathways for Afghans,” Bates told Al Jazeera. “That was with one eye towards the potential of giving the Trump administration this opportunity to really double down and target this community.”

Pressure on Afghans in the US

During Trump’s new term, his administration has taken several concrete – and at times contradictory – moves that affect Afghans living in the US.

It ended “temporary protected status” (TPS) for Afghans already in the country at the time of the Taliban takeover, arguing the country shows “an improved security situation” and “stabilising economy”, a claim contradicted by several human rights reports.

At the same time, the Trump administration added Afghanistan to a new travel ban list, restricting visas for Afghans, saying such admissions broadly run counter to US “foreign policy, national security, and counterterrorism”.

These actions underscore that “the situation in Afghanistan seems to be whatever it needs to be, from the Trump administration’s perspective,” according to Bates.

Trump has offered his contradictory messaging, criticising the Biden administration on the campaign trail for its handling of the withdrawal, and as recently as July, pledging to “save” evacuated Afghans subject to deportation from the United Arab Emirates.

Meanwhile, the administration terminated a special status for those who entered the US via the CBP One app in April, potentially affecting thousands of Afghans who entered via the southern border.

Advocates warn that many more Afghans may soon be facing another legal cliff. After being evacuated in 2021, tens of thousands of Afghans were granted humanitarian parole, a temporary status that allowed them to legally live and work in the US for two years, with an extension granted in 2023. That programme is soon set to end.

While many granted the status have since sought other legal avenues, most often applying for asylum or SIVs, an unknown number could be rendered undocumented and subject to deportation when the extension ends. Legislation creating a clearer pathway to citizenship has languished in Congress for years.

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has not publicly released how many evacuated Afghans remain in the US on humanitarian parole, and did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for the data.

Evacuated Afghans’ unease has been compounded by Trump’s aggressive approach to immigration enforcement, which has increasingly seen those without criminal histories targeted for deportations and permanent residents targeted for their political advocacy.

“It’s just an escalation across the board and a compounding of fear and instability in this community,” Bates said. “It’s hard to make life decisions if you aren’t sure what’s going to happen tomorrow or next week or in a year”.

‘Pulled the rug out’

Meanwhile, for the thousands of Afghans continuing to seek safety in the US from abroad, pathways have been severely constricted or have become completely blocked.

The Trump administration has paused asylum claims at the US southern border, citing a national emergency. It has almost completely suspended the US Refugee Program (USRAP), allowing only a trickle of new refugees in amid an ongoing legal challenge by rights groups.

Advocates say the special P1 and P2 programme created for Afghan refugees appears to have been completely halted under Trump. The administration has not published refugee admission numbers since taking office, and did not reply to Al Jazeera’s request for data.

“It feels as if we have pulled the rug out from many of our Afghan allies through these policy changes that strip legal protection for many Afghans in the US and limit pathways for Afghans who are still abroad to come to the US safely,” Kristyn Peck, the chief executive officer of the Lutheran Social Services of the National Capital Area, told Al Jazeera.

She noted that the SIV pipeline has continued to operate under Trump, although there have been some limitations, including requiring those approved for relocation to pay for their own travel.

Meanwhile, resettlement agencies like Lutheran have been forced to seriously curtail their operations following a stop-work order from the administration on January 24. As of March, Peck said, the organisation has been forced to let go of about 120 of its staff.

Susan Antolin, the executive director of Women for Afghan Women, a non-profit organisation that offers mental health, legal and social support to Afghans in the US, said organisations like hers are also bracing for sustained uncertainty.

“We are diversifying our funding and trying very hard, as so many other organisations are, to find other avenues to bring in that funding to continue to support our programmes,” she told Al Jazeera. “As organisations that deal with this kind of work, we have to step up. We have to do 10 times more, or 100 times more, of the work.”

‘No more a priority for the world’

The unstable situation in the US reflects a broader global trend.

The Taliban government, despite promising reforms in a push for international recognition, has continued to be accused of widespread human rights abuses and revenge killings. Still, it has upgraded diplomatic ties with several governments in recent years, and in July, Russia became the first country to formally recognise the group as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.

At the same time, the governments of Pakistan and Iran have accelerated expulsions of Afghans back to Afghanistan, with more than 1.4 million Afghans either being expelled or leaving Iran alone from January to July of 2025, according to UNHCR.

The Reuters news agency also reported in July that the UAE had notified Washington that it had begun returning evacuated Afghans.

Germany, too, has begun deporting Afghans back to Afghanistan, in July, it conducted its second deportation flight since the Taliban came to power, despite continuing not to recognise or maintain diplomatic ties with the group.

The collective moves send a clear message, evacuee Girowal said: “We know that Afghanistan is no more a priority for the world.”

Still, she said she has not abandoned hope that the US under Trump’s leadership will “not forget its allies”.

“I know the resilience of our own Afghan community. We are trained to be resilient wherever we are and fight back as much as we can,” she said.

“That’s one thing that gives me hope.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/AP21237791720218.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-08-15 11:58:33.996728

O'Loughlin has spent 60 years advocating for immigrant rights in South Florida, including legal battles and founding the Guatemala-Mayan Center.

The mass serves as a peaceful protest against conditions at the detention center and part of O'Loughlin's 60th Jubilee.

O'Loughlin has a history of activism, including suing the U.S. government and winning a lawsuit against Chiquita Brands International.

He criticizes the Trump and DeSantis administrations' immigration policies for separating families and harming communities.

LAKE WORTH BEACH — Frank O'Loughlin has never been a typical Catholic priest.

Instead of preaching from a pulpit, the 83-year-old Irish immigrant has devoted the past 60 years of his life to taking his fight for immigrants rights to the streets of South Florida and even the U.S. Supreme Court.

But on Saturday, Aug. 16, he'll celebrate the most prominent Mass of his career at a location that has drawn attention worldwide: the shadow of Alligator Alcatraz in the Everglades, where he will call attention to the plight of the immigrants held there as part of President Donald Trump's crackdown on undocumented residents.

It's part of O'Loughlin's 60th Jubilee, a time when priests reflect and recommit to their calling. The founder of the Guatemala-Mayan Center in Lake Worth Beach said the Mass will serve as a peaceful protest against to the reported conditions of the people detained in the center.

""This is the dismantling of the U.S.A. to which I came when I was 23 years old,” said O'Loughlin, who was arrested once in 1991 for sneaking into the barracks of injured sugarcane workers in Belle Glade to inform them of their rights and prevent them from getting deported.

""When you protest you are standing up for someone and the mass at the detention center is not simply a protest, it's an affirmation of faith.”

O'Loughlin — even non-Catholics call him Father Frank — found his place among the immigrant communities across South Florida, where he has become a symbol of hope. Some call him a hero, others tout him of being a saint but O'Loughlin sees himself as a peacemaker and an activist.

""I’d rather be a doer than a preacher,” O'Loughlin said.

It's 1965: A 23-year-old Irish priest arrives in South Florida

O'Loughlin was born and raised in a tight Catholic community in Ennistymon, Ireland. Growing up, he excelled in math and science and after high school graduation he was set to study accounting with a full ride scholarship.

The last weeks of exams, O'Loughlin told the headmaster and his family he wanted to enroll in the seminary. To his surprise, the headmaster said he already knew O'Loughlin would go into priesthood from an essay he had written as a student.

To his relief, his parents, who were Catholics but somewhat anti-clerical, also supported his decision. ""My dad just very quietly said, 'Be a good priest',"" O'Loughlin recalled.

From the beginning, O'Loughlin said he knew he didn't want to be like the traditional, serious and at times intimidating priests in his town. When he was offered the opportunity to move thousands of miles away to South Florida as a missionary, he took it.

In 1965, he arrived in Miami at age 23 during a time of unrest in America. He was assigned to Holy Name of Jesus, a church along Military Trial in suburban West Palm Beach that remains open 60 years later.

There was so much to get used to in the Sunshine State. Accustomed to cool summers, O'Loughlin felt hot and sweaty. The humidity made Bible pages stick together and caused mildew to grow on shoes he left in the closet. Two years after his arrival, air conditioning revolutionized South Florida, O'Loughlin said.

O'Loughlin said he learned the reality of living in Florida through the renowned Edward Murrow documentary ""Harvest of Shame."" The CBS special exposed the working and living conditions of farmworkers in Belle Glade.

O'Loughlin said he was horrified by the stories of the immigrant families in his congregation that recounted how they escaped violence in their home countries, their dangerous journeys to reach the U.S. and their tough, long days of picking in the fields, all to give their children a better life.

O'Loughlin learned Spanish and Creole to talk with farmworkers in Belle Glade, Indiantown and northern Palm Beach County. He became their advocate and took it upon himself to find them legal representation.

""There is no way migrant workers can progress unless they are organized,” O'Loughlin said. ""You need to have unity to counter the strength of their employers and strength among the workers.""

During the 1970s, O'Loughlin was sent to St. John the Apostle Catholic Parish in Hialeah. There, he organized his first boycott of supermarkets that bought produce from farms where workers had protested their labor conditions. He marched with Cesar Chavez to organize farmworkers and demand better working conditions and wages.

He returned to Palm Beach County as the priest at the Cathedral of St. Ignatius Loyola in Palm Beach Gardens, where he established the first Spanish-language Mass and Hispanic ministry. He said he duplicated that model at many of the other churches where he has served.

The Spanish masses quickly filled up, O'Loughlin said. And he saw how they created diverse communities of immigrants from Cuba, Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala who came together to pray and help each other.

""I remember from the very beginning hearing from Spanish-speaking people, 'There are two things you do in Spanish: You say your prayers and you make love,'"" O'Loughlin said with a laugh.

O'Loughlin launches education, housing programs for migrant workers

During his time in Palm Beach Gardens, O'Loughlin led the effort to launch multiple projects to improve access to jobs, education and housing opportunities to immigrant workers. His mission: Give farmworker families, who moved between work sites, a sense of stability.

He co-founded Indiantown's Hope Rural School, which serves immigrant children. He also helped organize a sewing co-op that employed female migrants who learned to sew from a group of nuns.

O'Loughlin said one of his biggest accomplishments came the day he welcomed families into the New Hope Community, a neighborhood in Indiantown for immigrant workers 25 miles northwest of Jupiter.

""I'm looking at this man, I put the keys in his hand and now for the first time he could give his daughters a safe home,"" O'Loughlin said. ""It was a glorious experience. I could see it like it was last night.""

Then in 1985, O'Loughlin had a heart attack. A year later, he suffered a second one, which robbed him of the deep voice he often used to sing at church.

Undeterred, O'Loughlin took the lead of the Migration and Refugee Service of the Archdiocese of Palm Beach.

""All my life I've been saying to Floridians, when you meet a farmworker and shake his hand, you are meeting a hero,"" O'Loughlin said.

How Father Frank started the Guatemalan-Mayan Center in Lake Worth

When the first Mayans arrived to Palm Beach County, O'Loughlin was the first to received a call. The families belonged to indigenous tribes in Central America, but nobody knew where they came from or what language they spoke.

O'Loughlin set out to find out their origins, studying their factions, language and handmade clothing. He learned the Mayans had fled civil war in Guatemala, the first groups spoke Kʼicheʼ. Then their problems rose to another level of seriousness.

In 1990, a doctor at St. Mary's Medical Center alerted O'Loughlin that the neonatal unit was overwhelmed with babies born with deficiencies and deformities stemming from the lack of prenatal care from mothers exposed to pesticides while working in the fields.

In 1992, O'Loughlin founded The Guatemalan-Mayan Center with volunteers who were tasked with going into farmworker communities to offer mothers free prenatal care. During the past 30 years, the nonprofit has become a crucial resource for Palm Beach County's growing immigrant population.

It helps families access social services, has a food pantry and operates the ""Escuelita Maya"" VPK, preschool and after-school programs. The center still provides medical services through its ""Clinica Maya,"" which offers free prenatal care, dental care and health screenings.

It also offers ParentChild+, pairing families with early learning specialists that make in-home visits. And it works with Legal Aid Services to provide representation for clients when needed.

Amid the COVID pandemic, O'Loughlin helped farmworkers get access to COVID-19 vaccines and said public prayers for them. The center, on Lake Worth Road, also hosted testing sites that served thousands in the county.

Maria De La Guardia, a counselor at the Guatemalan-Mayan Center, says the center has allowed immigrants to preserve and celebrate their culture while also receiving the tools they need to succeed in the U.S. A member of O'Loughlin's youth group in Hialeah, she calls it ""a river of abundance in the middle of a drought.""

""Father Frank doesn't preach the religion. He lives the religion,"" she said. ""That is why we are all here.""

In 1991, Father Frank took a case to the Supreme Court and won

In 1991, O'Loughlin sued the U.S. Department of Labor to extend a legal status for the undocumented workers that worked in South Florida's larger farms. The case went to the U.S. Supreme Court and the judges sided with O'Loughlin, granting legal status to all the workers represented in the lawsuit status as seasonal agricultural workers.

""It was beautiful. They had been vindicated,” O'Loughlin said. ""They had been legalized.”

That afternoon, O'Loughlin and Jean Juste, founder of the Miami-Based Haitian Refugee Center, walked down the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court in triumph. Then they stormed into pubs where law students discussed the case.

Years later, O'Loughlin sought to sue the U.S. Labor Department, again. This time, to win the same the protections but for sugarcane workers.

""When you walk in to a bishop and you say and 'I want to sue the federal government,' it's not exactly smooth,” O'Loughlin said with a chuckle.

""Let me tell you how it affects the people … ,"" O'Loughlin recalled making his case. ""He would always cave in when I said that.”

This time, state prosecutors argued O'Loughlin lacked standing to represent the workers because he had never sliced sugar canes stalks or worked in the field. A federal court ruled otherwise.

A federal judge in Washington D.C. found O'Loughlin was so closely associated with the workers and identified so much with their cause, he had enough standing to continue pursuing the case.

O'Loughlin's team however, lost the case. Judges determined sugar was not considered a foodstuff because it is not a perishable crop, a requirement to grant them status as seasonal agricultural workers.

""That was really a setback,"" O'Loughlin said. ""And the sugarcane workers never got any relief.”

In 2024, O'Loughin was part of the team that won a $38 million lawsuit against Chiquita Brands International for funding Colombian terrorists who killed men in the South American country. The 16-year case marked the first time an American jury has found a major U.S. corporation liable for human-rights abuses committed abroad.

""My memory of people that I did sign up, I often worried about them, felt guilty about the regret that I seemed to promise them something and never delivered,"" said O'Loughin, whose work has won human rights awards from organizations such as Americans for Immigrant Justice and the National Association of Social Workers.

""But now, we were delivering.""

Mass at Alligator Alcatraz to let people pray outside detention fence

O'Loughlin said the Mass outside Alligator Alcatraz, which begins at 10:30 a.m. will allow him to lead those who gather at the site, 35 miles from Naples and 70 from Miami along the Tamiami Trail, to pray for all those held there ""outside the detention fence."" Many are undocumented, and some are on the verge of deportation to their home nations.

He said the Trump and DeSantis crackdowns on undocumented workers, even those not suspected of crimes in the U.S., are undermining the years of work it took to create a support network for immigrants in South Florida.

He has seen the pain firsthand. A female farmworker he has helped for more than 18 years was deported in June. She attended a routine immigration appointment and was given 60 days to exit the country, leaving behind a U.S.-born son who lives with disabilities.

“How can you turn away that woman who has been a constant contributor to the community in which she lives?"" O'Loughlin asked. ""It's an incomprehensible hatred of people.”

The now 83-year-old priest has been outspoken against Trump's rhetoric describing immigrants as criminals. He hopes the Mass reminds people of all spiritual beliefs about the importance of being empathetic to one another.

""We have failed,"" he said, invoking the Book of Genesis, ""to persuade MAGA that they are talking about persons: moms, dads, children, bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh.""

The company has hired 130 employees, including 75 detention officers, and plans to hire more.

Legal battles between CoreCivic and the city of Leavenworth continue, with the company facing a temporary injunction.

The detention center's reopening has sparked protests and national media attention.

Seemingly undeterred by legal setbacks, private prison company CoreCivic is on a hiring spree to staff a Leavenworth, Kansas, detention center that currently has no detainees.

It’s been two months since a Kansas court temporarily blocked the company from reopening the former private prison. The city of Leavenworth sought the order because CoreCivic has not obtained a special use permit — a requirement the company rejects.

There is no clear end in sight for those legal proceedings. Yet CoreCivic shows every sign that it intends to fulfill its contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, to hold up to 1,000 federal detainees in Leavenworth.

Echoing the company’s rebrand from the Corrections Corporation of America in 2016, the sign in front of Leavenworth’s former maximum-security prison has been replaced. The complex of gray and beige blocks is now called the “Midwest Regional Reception Center,” or MRRC, which reflects its potential role as a central hub for President Donald Trump’s deportation efforts.

Besides the sign switch, CoreCivic has paid for roof repairs and run ads for jobs at the new facility. Job listings run the gamut from administrative clerk positions ($17.75 per hour) to a lead psychiatrist (up to $300,000 per year).

“I’m very confused by that,” said Leavenworth Mayor Holly Pittman after a court hearing related to the facility on Wednesday. “What are they paying them to do?”

Why is CoreCivic hiring?

In an email to the Kansas News Service, CoreCivic spokesperson Ryan Gustin said the company has hired 130 people so far, including 75 detention officers, at the MRRC.

That’s out of over 2,300 applicants, Gustin said. He expects the facility to employ 300 people once it’s fully operational.

Pay for correctional officers, which make up the lion’s share of the facility’s staff, starts at $28.25 per hour. The company is offering to pay a $3,000 signing bonus for those who are hired from August through October.

But until the legal battle between CoreCivic and the city of Leavenworth reaches a resolution, detention officers will not have any detainees to watch.

“Our hiring and training efforts continue at MRRC while we pursue all the avenues to find a successful conclusion to this matter,” Gustin said. “Doing so better prepares us to serve our government partners at ICE.”

Gustin said rank-and-file detention officers undergo 200 hours of training. He said CoreCivic will continue paying them post-training — even if there are no detainees at the MRRC.

Federal audits and former employees blamed understaffing and insufficient training for dire conditions at the facility in years past. Before, it housed pre-trial federal inmates for the U.S. Marshals Service, or USMS.

The former Leavenworth Detention Center shuttered at the end of 2021. An executive order by then-President Joe Biden caused many federal contracts with private prisons to expire.

For years, the facility had been mired in reports of mismanagement and abuse. Former staff and inmates said they saw preventable drug use, injury and death on a regular basis — problems exacerbated by chronic understaffing, according to a 2017 review by the U.S. Department of Justice.

Gustin said in a previous email to the Kansas News Service that most issues with safety and staffing were concentrated during an 18-month period coinciding with the pandemic.

Gustin said CoreCivic trains its employees at or above federal standards, though guidelines for ICE differ in some ways from those of the USMS.

The court of law

While activity flourishes at the facility, legal cases surrounding it slog through the courts.

The latest hearing was Aug. 6. CoreCivic’s attorneys asked Leavenworth County District Judge John Bryant to unblock the company from holding detainees in Leavenworth.

That would represent a reversal of a temporary injunction Bryant placed on the company less than a month prior. He did not make an immediate decision in the court hearing.

One possible sticking point: CoreCivic also plans to challenge Bryant’s block in the Kansas Court of Appeals. That could raise confusing questions of jurisdiction between the district and appellate courts.

Meanwhile, the company has filed a separate lawsuit against the city. It argues Leavenworth officials unlawfully revoked CoreCivic’s permission to use its facility as a prison. Bryant discussed combining the lawsuits for simplicity.

Joe Hatley, an attorney for the city of Leavenworth, said he expects the legal knot will take many months — and dollars — to untangle.

“Trials are expensive and lengthy and bothersome for everybody involved,” Hatley said in an interview.

CoreCivic revealed in legal filings that they miss out on $4.2 million every month that the courts keep them from fulfilling their contract with ICE. Hatley did not want to speculate as to why the company would continue setting up shop despite the legal uncertainty.“If they want to spend money hiring people and doing all that, that's their money,” he said.

The court of public opinion

Even without substantial changes in the legal fight, attention has continued to snowball in the conflict between the historic prison town and a multi-billion dollar private prison corporation.

National outlets have sent correspondents to northeast Kansas to cover what is, legally speaking, a mundane dispute over local development regulations. Protests against CoreCivic draw crowds of 40 or 50, greater than when the controversy began this spring.But some in the Leavenworth community have voiced support for CoreCivic reopening its steel doors. Republican state Rep. Pat Proctor, whose district overlaps with the city, said in an email that the MRRC would be part of a national immigration agenda he favors.

“CoreCivic’s new facility fulfills a critical need for detention space, as DHS struggles to manage a huge operation, deporting the millions of illegal immigrants that flooded our country through Joe Biden's open borders,” he said.

The company presents itself as an economic boon for Leavenworth. In addition to providing hundreds of jobs, the company said it will give the city a one-time impact payment of $1 million, $400,000 per year in recurring impact payments and over $1,000,000 in annual property taxes.

Proctor said his last hang-up was the possibility that the MRRC would poach staff from the nearby Lansing Correctional Facility. But in the latest state budget, the Kansas Legislature approved more than $4.1 million to cover a pay differential when the MRRC opens.

CoreCivic has also donated $10,000 each to local chapters of organizations like the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars and Salvation Army.

“Despite what politically extreme outsider groups are saying,” Warden Misty Mackey said in an April press release, “potential new employees and local business partners are excited to be part of what we’re creating in Leavenworth.”

While courts have momentarily foiled CoreCivic’s ambitions in Kansas, federal immigration authorities have been able to use a different facility down the road.

The lockup run by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, called FCI Leavenworth, has an agreement with ICE to detain immigrants. The American Civil Liberties Union said in May that those detainees are held in “crowded, unsanitary conditions” and that some have attempted suicide.

Since Trump took office in January, Leavenworth has landed in the middle of a national push for, and outcry against, the deportation of millions of people living in the country without full legal status.

Outside of the Leavenworth County District Court before an Aug. 6 hearing on the CoreCivic case, dozens of protesters heard speeches through tall black speakers.

A few passing cars honked in support. But during remarks by Anne Parelkar, a former immigration attorney who is now running as a Democrat for the U.S. Senate in Kansas, a goateed man stormed out of the courthouse.

“They’re here illegally,” he yelled.

A protester holding a sign that read “no human is illegal” tried to continue arguing with the man, but others dissuaded him.

“Not all of them,” Parelkar said to the man, and returned to her speech.

“There’s no public transportation where we’re at, no Uber or Lyft,” said his wife, Jacqueline Maravilla, about his choice to drive. “Everything's 45 minutes from everything. It's a calculated risk we have to take to support our family.”

That risk has grown even greater for thousands of immigrant families under the Trump administration, as officials expand efforts to deport people with little or no criminal history. The monthly number of people deported whose most serious conviction was a traffic violation — such as driving without a license — has more than tripled in the last six months, hitting almost 600 in May, according to new estimates by The Marshall Project. In total, over 1,800 people with traffic violations have been deported this year.

People with no criminal convictions at all make up two-thirds of the more than 120,000 people deported between January and May. For another 8%, the only offense on their record was illegal entry to the U.S. Only about 12% were convicted of a crime that was either violent or potentially violent. The numbers contradict officials' continued claims that immigration enforcement is focusing on the “worst of the worst” criminal offenders.

The numbers are estimates from a Marshall Project analysis of Immigration and Customs Enforcement data, provided to the Deportation Data Project in response to a FOIA request. The group noted the dataset may be incomplete and could undercount the true numbers of deportations.

ICE officials did not respond to a request for comment.

For many facing removal, the crimes on their records are years old. So far this year more than 600 people have been deported whose most serious convictions were marijuana-related offenses, and in three out of four cases, the offense occurred at least five years ago.

“It’s not at all about convictions anymore,” said Tim Warden-Hertz, a directing attorney of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, a Washington-based legal organization. “There is no discretion. It’s just trying to get as many people as they can, any way that they can.”

Historical data from the Deportation Data Project shows that previous administrations also deported people with no convictions or only minor offenses, but the numbers have increased under Trump. From President Biden’s inauguration through the end of fiscal year 2023, the last day with available data, over half of the people deported had no criminal conviction. During that period, an average of 80 people a month were deported with only traffic offenses, compared with an average of over 350 per month so far under Trump’s second term.

Some of Trump’s advisors have said publicly that the administration’s goal is for 3,000 ICE arrests each day. But in recent court filings, immigration officials have denied having a quota.

Some attorneys worry this pressure to deport more people is leading to an increase in racial profiling, and that more drivers of color are being pulled over for minor traffic violations as a way to check their legal status. Twenty states have recently passed laws that increase local police’s involvement in immigration enforcement. And a growing number of police departments are signing agreements with the Department of Homeland Security to enforce federal immigration laws during encounters like routine traffic stops.

“We hear people pulled over for minor reasons, like a broken blinker, crossing the yellow line, or the tint is too dark on windows,” said Paul R. Chavez, director of litigation and advocacy for Americans for Immigrant Justice, a Miami-based nonprofit. “People are arrested for those very minor things, brought to jail, fingerprinted, and then handed over to ICE.”

Chavez noted that many people are being charged solely with driving without a license, a crime police generally discover only after making a traffic stop. “If you’re pulled over and that's the only accusation, in my mind that's pretty clear evidence of racial profiling,” he said.

The number of people deported with only nonviolent offenses — like trespassing, failure to appear in court, marijuana offenses, shoplifting and traffic violations — has almost doubled since January.

After Madrid’s accident, he says he passed a breathalyzer test. But he admitted he had smoked weed the night before, 18 hours prior. The Georgia State Patrol officer arrested him on charges of driving without a license and driving under the influence.

Madrid’s only existing conviction was for driving without a license in 2019, he said. Back then, “He got arrested, I bailed him out, he had a court date, he paid the fine,” Maravilla said. “And that was the end of it.”

Things went differently this time. After Maravilla paid Madrid’s bond, ICE officers picked him up and ultimately took him to Stewart Detention Center, south of Columbus, Georgia. A judge denied his release from detention, citing the DUI charge for marijuana use the night before the accident. But the hearing in his criminal case wouldn’t happen until the following summer. Madrid had to decide between spending at least a year stuck inside a remote, overcrowded detention center — or leaving his wife and family behind.

In early July, Madrid opted to self-deport to Honduras. Maravilla, a U.S. citizen who has never been on a plane and doesn’t have a passport, is working to save enough money to visit him and bring him some of his belongings. The two were married just three weeks before his arrest.

“It’s a deep pain,” Madrid told The Marshall Project in Spanish. “I am not there with my wife, cannot see my mother and give her a hug, or help them with what I earn from my work. Listening to my wife cry on the phone has been something I do not wish for anyone.”",https://mirrorball.themarshallproject.org/EMbIID5gTXPpEsVMP_hWF124zRkMPmYSKD1hgZ-MxII/w:1200/aHR0cHM6Ly9kMm0x/OXBtdnRzNWJvYi5j/bG91ZGZyb250Lm5l/dC94MGd3dmVmZnFj/d2gyeWhxbDhnenFr/bmc1MmR5L3Byb21v/XzI1MDgxNS1JTU1J/R05BVElPTi1MT1ct/TEVWRUwtSGVjdG9y/LmpwZw,N,,2025-08-15 11:59:20.174974

Behind that number is an incipient human rights crisis.

While the Trump administration waited for massive new detention centers to open, it turned to federal prisons and jails, hastily constructed state facilities, and temporary holding cells that were never meant to house people for any extended amount of time.

The overcrowding, combined with negligence and malevolence, has led to inevitable abuses that are too large to ignore or deny.

On August 12, a federal judge ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to drastically improve conditions in migrant holding cells in its New York City offices, where detainees were kept in overcrowded, squalid cells for days and even weeks at a time.

U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan ordered officials to provide more spacious cells, bedding for each detainee, adequate hygiene supplies, three meals a day and water on request, and access to calls with lawyers. The order was in response to a lawsuit filed by an ICE detainee, who alleged he and other detainees were not given access to medical care or showers and were kept in cells so crowded that they didn't have space to lie down.

Another federal judge found similar deficiencies in a temporary ICE holding facility in Los Angeles, ruling in July that plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the government were likely to succeed on their claims that detainees there were being unconstitutionally denied legal access.

A report published July 30 by the office of Sen. Jon Ossoff (D–Ga.) identified 510 ""credible reports"" of human rights abuses against individuals held in the archipelago of federal lockups, county jails, and military bases that comprise the Trump administration's mass deportation program.

""Among these reports are 41 credible reports of physical and sexual abuse of individuals in U.S. immigration detention, 14 credible reports of mistreatment of pregnant women, and 18 credible reports of mistreatment of children,"" Ossoff's office wrote.

In one case reported to the senator's office, a woman in ICE custody ""was pregnant and bled for days before facility staff would take her to a hospital. Once she was there, she was reportedly left in a room, alone, to miscarry without water or medical assistance, for over 24 hours.""

The Ossoff report also mentions poor conditions at Federal Detention Center (FDC) Miami, a jail operated by the Bureau of Prisons that holds immigration detainees.

Investigations earlier this year by Reason and the Miami Herald uncovered overcrowding, lack of access to lawyers and phone calls, and major dysfunction inside the facility. A separate July report by several human rights and legal aid groups on abuses inside South Florida detention centers included an incident at a Miami center where officers allegedly made men wait hours for lunch and then forced them to eat with their hands shackled behind their backs.

""We had to bend over and eat off the chairs with our mouths, like dogs,"" Harpinder Chauhan, a British entrepreneur who was detained by ICE this spring, told the researchers.

These conditions prevail in detention facilities across Florida. A former detainee at the Krome Detention Center in Miami-Dade County, whose lawyer requested that he only be identified as ""A.S.,"" told Reason he spent four days in an overcrowded holding cell with 50 to 60 other people.

""There was a dude, he passed out. He was crying for his medicine for like two or three days,"" A.S. says. ""They didn't give him his medicine until he finally passed out, right before they were gonna put him on the plane.""

Likewise, stories of lack of legal access, horrid living conditions, medical neglect, and brutality have been flooding out of ""Alligator Alcatraz,"" the Everglades detention camp built by the State of Florida.

These sorts of abuses aren't exclusive to the Trump administration; they're a feature of mass detention. During the Biden administration, Reason obtained whistleblower audio recordings from a tent camp for migrant youths inside the Fort Bliss Army base in Texas. In the recordings, officials frankly discussed filthy conditions, lack of medical care, and inappropriate staff contact with minors.

The Trump administration's reaction, though, has not been to slow down its deportation efforts, but to supercharge them.

But that tone changed late Thursday after Ms. Bondi issued an order rescinding the city’s policing policies governing immigration enforcement.
The city’s lawsuit argues that this order was a violation of the Home Rule Act, which does not grant presidents “operational control” over the police.
A federal judge ruled that the deployment was unconstitutional, but an appeals court disagreed, arguing that the president had acted within his authority.
President Trump has said he will seek from Congress “long-term extensions” of his control over the D.C. police.","The District of Columbia government filed a lawsuit on Friday challenging the Trump administration’s “brazen usurpation” of the city’s authority by trying to take control of the D.C. Police Department, in a marked escalation of tensions between local and federal authorities in the nation’s capital.

The suit argues that both President Trump’s executive order on Monday federalizing the Police Department and a follow-up order by Pam Bondi, the U.S. attorney general, “far exceed” the president’s authority under the Home Rule Act of 1973, which granted D.C. its limited degree of self-government.

Such an attempt to “upend the command structure of the Police Department” risks “endangering the safety of the public and law enforcement officers alike,” the suit says, using the Trump administration’s argument for public safety against it.

The suit asks the court for an injunction against Ms. Bondi’s order and a declaration that the administration’s actions are unconstitutional and a violation of the Home Rule Act.

Mr. Schwalb, a Democrat who was elected in 2022, has been outspoken from the outset in criticizing the federal takeover of the D.C. police and the deployment of the National Guard, calling the moves “unnecessary and unlawful.”

In a statement on Friday morning, Mr. Schwalb said that the administration was “abusing its limited, temporary authority under the Home Rule Act, infringing on the district’s right to self-governance and putting the safety of D.C. residents and visitors at risk.”

“This is the gravest threat to Home Rule that the district has ever faced, and we are fighting to stop it,” he said.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Mayor Muriel Bowser had been, for the most part, diplomatic in her comments this week. But that tone changed late Thursday after Ms. Bondi issued an order rescinding the city’s policing policies governing immigration enforcement. That order also declared that Terry Cole, the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, was now the “emergency police commissioner,” with “all the powers and duties” invested in the city’s police chief, Pamela A. Smith.

Mr. Schwalb issued a legal opinion saying that Ms. Bondi’s order was “unlawful,” and that the mayor was “not legally obligated to follow it.” Ms. Bowser posted the letter on social media, saying that the city had followed the law but that “there is no statute that conveys the district’s personnel authority to a federal official.” The lawsuit, which lists Mr. Trump, Ms. Bondi and Mr. Cole as defendants, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice and the D.E.A., expands upon that opinion.

Mr. Trump’s executive order was based on a section of the Home Rule Act that explicitly gives presidents temporary authority to “direct the mayor to provide him” such services of deemed “necessary and appropriate” to address “special conditions of an emergency nature.”

That order declared a “crime emergency” in the city, and in announcing the order, Mr. Trump said that he was “placing the D.C. Metropolitan Police under direct federal control.” While Ms. Bowser later that day acknowledged that the president had the authority to order the services of the Metropolitan Police, she said that Chief Smith was still in command.

But on Thursday, Ms. Bondi issued her order installing Mr. Cole in command of the police.

The city’s lawsuit argues that this order was a violation of the Home Rule Act, which does not grant presidents “operational control” over the police. It also says that the law limits presidents to using the police for “federal purposes,” not the managing enforcement of local laws. The suit challenged that the emergency the president cited to justify his order was overly broad, saying it refers to crime in general, “and declining crime at that.”

The president’s executive order on Monday said that crime in D.C. had “a dire impact on the federal government’s ability to operate efficiently to address the nation’s broader interests.”

The suit is the latest attempt by local jurisdictions to push back legally at the administration’s broad assertion of federal power.

The state of California sued the Trump administration after the president deployed thousands of National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles this summer, after protests broke out against aggressive immigration enforcement. A federal judge ruled that the deployment was unconstitutional, but an appeals court disagreed, arguing that the president had acted within his authority. While most of the soldiers have returned home, that litigation is ongoing.

Washington is in a different position, given the many limitations on its autonomy under federal law.

The section of the Home Rule Act giving the president some authority over the local police says that this authority terminates after the end of the declared emergency, an act of Congress or a period of 30 days, whichever comes first. President Trump has said he will seek from Congress “long-term extensions” of his control over the D.C. police.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/15/multimedia/HFO-nat-dc-lawsuit-trump-kbct/HFO-nat-dc-lawsuit-trump-kbct-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 11:59:24.630444

""I am a very involved friend,"" Victoria Besancon said. Besancon said when she didn't hear anything from Shaw that evening, or the next morning, she knew something had gone wrong during Shaw's trip to Vancouver.

""We didn't know where she was; her lawyer figured she was in one of the two family facilities,"" Besancon said. ""I started Googling and calling the facilities until I got some kind of answer.""

Shaw and her six-year-old son, Isaac, were detained at the South Texas ICE Processing Center in Dilley, Texas. That facility is one of the few family detention centers in the country.

""Had Sarah been able to be detained here in Tacoma, her lawyer would have had a much easier time representing her; things would have moved a lot more quickly,"" Besancon said.

Shaw's lawyer said a simple clerical error is to blame for Shaw's visa issue. However, although her son Isaac's documents were in correct order, they were detained together anyway.

""Isaac has spent his entire summer locked in a detention facility despite having all of his paperwork done properly; it's been devastating,"" Besancon added. ""I would say, given the situation, he's doing the best as you can hope. Sarah honestly used all her commissary to get him ice cream, coloring pencils, anything to make him feel like he's at home. They have one play station in a community of about 60 children, so they all took turns ferociously trying to play with that.""

Besancon reiterated Shaw has no criminal history, and said she believes border officials could have helped Shaw correct the visa issue on the spot.

It’s unclear how quickly a judge will act, but the emergency nature of the filing could lead to proceedings as soon as Friday.

The suit is the biggest pushback from city officials since Trump invoked a provision of the Home Rule Act — the 1970s law that allows for limited self-governance by Washington’s government — that allows the president to direct the Metropolitan Police Department’s services to address “special conditions of an emergency nature.”

The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, a Biden appointee known for her take-no-prisoners approach from the bench. Reyes, most notably, blocked Trump’s transgender military ban before her injunction was paused by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Amid the litigation, the Justice Department filed a complaint against Reyes for her pointed comments to government attorneys — though she at times also praised their advocacy and made similarly pointed comments to lawyers for the transgender service members.

In a declaration accompanying the city’s bid for an immediate restraining order, D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith said the administration’s gambit is “endangering the safety of the public and law enforcement officers.”

“In my nearly three decades in law enforcement, I have never seen a single government action that would cause a greater threat to law and order than this dangerous directive.”

The suit underscores that no president in history has invoked the authority to manage the city’s police department. And the city’s lawyers say the president’s power to do so requires cooperation between city officials and the federal government, not a hostile takeover.

Bondi on Thursday issued an order that directed Drug Enforcement Administration head Terry Cole to assume “all the powers and duties” of the city’s police chief as the new “Emergency Police Commissioner,” “effective immediately.”

Bondi’s order also purported to rescind or suspend several Washington police orders — including one issued by Smith earlier on Thursday that allowed for limited cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser and Schwalb — both Democrats elected by Washington residents — insisted late Thursday that Bondi could not legally disrupt the typical chain of command for MPD officers by requiring them to report to Cole.

“Therefore, members of MPD must continue to follow your orders and not the orders of any official not appointed by the Mayor,” Schwalb wrote in a letter Thursday to Smith that was circulated by Bowser. “Regardless of the Bondi order, no official other than you may exercise all the powers and duties of the Chief of Police.”

A Department of Justice spokesperson declined to comment and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trump on Monday issued an executive order invoking the Home Rule Act, insisting that the District was overrun by violence. He also deployed the National Guard to the city.

But before Bondi’s order Thursday looking to replace the MPD chief, city officials have largely limited their criticism of the Trump administration, noting that Washington was in a fairly unique situation that gave the federal government broad powers and authorities.

“The feds have an outsize role in D.C., we all know that,” Bowser told POLITICO Wednesday morning. “Right now, having a surge of officers enhances our MPD forces on a temporary basis. We’re going to stay focused on hiring more MPD or, when this temporary surge is over, figuring out more permanent partnerships to tap into when we need a surge of officers.”

But Trump’s Monday press conference went far beyond what his executive order said, with the president saying his administration would “take our capital back.”

“Giving us additional resources is a good thing, but that’s also quite different than federalizing our police force,” D.C. Council Chair Phil Mendelson said Wednesday in an interview. “Donald Trump is not going to tell our police how to police.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Ffb%2Fca%2F779951fd452cbd8ba3b34c85ae99%2Fdistrict-of-columbia-97352.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 11:58:23.345717

THIS WEEK IN BRIEF:

CBP releases July data showing migration hitting new low at the border: Due to the unavailability of asylum and word of a growing crackdown throughout the U.S. interior, the number of migrants entering CBP custody at the border in July fell again, to a level not seen since the 1960s. Zero asylum seekers were released from custody at the border, while Border Patrol’s El Paso Sector saw the most migrant apprehensions. Fentanyl seizures continue to decline sharply, while cocaine seizures are rising.

Notes on “mass deportation”: DHS made striking, and hard-to-verify, claims about the number of undocumented migrants choosing to leave the United States voluntarily, and the number of people signing up for employment with ICE. Some of the agency’s online recruitment messaging evoked 20th-century White supremacist themes. Several controversies, including growing public health concerns, surrounded the Florida state migrant detention facility in the Everglades.

Notes from Mexico: The New York Times followed fentanyl smugglers and found evidence of corruption on both sides of the border. Groups that preyed on migrants in Ciudad Juárez are now preying on the local population and getting more involved in street drug sales. A migrant “caravan” in Chiapas does not seek to reach the United States but intends only to gain the right to live and work elsewhere in Mexico.

THE FULL UPDATE:

CBP releases July data showing migration hitting new low at the border

Migration

Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reported another decrease from June to July in the number of migrants its agents and officers encountered at the U.S.-Mexico border. With a near-total ban on asylum access still in place and a growing climate of fear among migrants living in the U.S. interior, numbers are at 60-year lows.

Border Patrol apprehended 4,601 migrants between ports of entry (official border crossings) at the U.S.-Mexico border in July, or 148 per day, down from 6,070 (202 per day) in June and 8,723 (291 per day) in May, and down sharply from 56,400 (1,880 per day) in July 2024.

Data table

Sixty-seven percent of Border Patrol’s apprehended migrants in July were citizens of Mexico, similar to June (68 percent). That is far higher than the 35 percent share of the apprehended migrant population that has come from Mexico since fiscal 2020. Eighty-seven percent of Border Patrol’s July apprehensions were of citizens of Mexico or northern Central America (Guatemala, Honduras, or El Salvador), much more than those nations’ 61 percent share since fiscal 2020.

CBP’s statement noted that Border Patrol did not release a single asylum seeker or other migrant into the U.S. interior with parole or a notice to appear in July. There have been no such releases since April. All apprehended migrants were detained, deported, or, in the case of unaccompanied minors, sent to the Health and Human Services Department’s Office of Refugee Resettlement.

Border Patrol’s apprehensions of family unit members and unaccompanied minors fell 16 percent from June to July, from 917 to 770 (17 percent of all apprehensions), and by 48 percent from May (1,468). Eighty percent of parents and children (both accompanied and unaccompanied) entering Border Patrol custody in July were from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, or El Salvador, up from 58 percent since fiscal 2020.

Data table

Overall, CBP—which combines Border Patrol agents operating between ports of entry and Field Operations officers operating at the ports of entry—took 7,842 people into custody in July, down from 9,304 in June and 12,449 in May, and down sharply from 104,100 in July 2024. The July 2024 figure had included 45,210 people with CBP One appointments at ports of entry—a program that no longer exists.

Data table

Migrants encountered at the ports of entry remained few in July, as the Trump administration stopped using the CBP One smartphone app to help asylum seekers make appointments. CBP’s port of entry encounters totaled 3,231 people or 104 per day in May, down from a nearly identical 3,234 in June, 3,726 in May, and 47,700 in July 2024.

Data table

Ninety-four percent of migrants encountered at ports of entry in July were citizens of Mexico, similar to 92 percent in June and 93 percent in May. Only 191 in July and 245 in June were from elsewhere.

Of the nine geographic sectors into which Border Patrol divides the border, El Paso, which includes far west Texas and all of New Mexico, was the number one sector for migrant apprehensions for the sixth straight month. The El Paso sector’s 1,099 apprehensions were 24 percent of the July total, similar to 27 percent in June. The Rio Grande Valley Sector (Texas, 951) was second, followed by the Tucson Sector (Arizona, 671), and the San Diego Sector (California, 555).

Data table

Drug seizures

CBP’s July releases also included data about illegal drugs seized at the border. It showed a continued slide in the agency’s seizures of fentanyl. Ten months into fiscal year 2025, fentanyl seizures are on pace to end the year 45 percent below 2024 levels and 56 percent below 2023.

Data table

Seizures of cocaine, however, are up significantly, on pace to rise 36 percent over 2024 levels and 50 percent over 2023.

Data table

Seizures of methamphetamine have been less volatile. They are on pace to drop 9 percent from 2024 levels, which would be 18 percent above 2023.

Notes on “Mass Deportation”

ICE recruitment

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced on August 12 that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) received 100,000 job applications in the previous two weeks. “New hires will be eligible for a one-time bonus of up to $50,000” and “up to $60,000 in student loan repayment,” the Washington Examiner recalled. There is no way to independently verify that claim, or to predict how many applicants would clear background checks and other recruitment criteria.

DHS also announced on August 6 that ICE is doing away with age restrictions for recruits. Until now, recruits had to be at least 21 years old and no older than 37 or 40, depending on the role. Now they can be as young as 18, and there is no upper age limit. In coverage at the Bulwark, Adrian Carrasquillo raised the specter of “gun-toting, masked teenagers with minimal training and experience… swarming restaurants, shops, factories, churches, and homes looking for immigrants.”

On August 11 DHS posted an ICE recruitment message to Twitter with an image of Uncle Sam and the text “Which way, American man?” This closely parallels the 1978 book Which Way Western Man? by William Gayley Simpson, a white nationalist writer. That book includes virulently antisemitic prose, some of which is cited in Simpson’s Wikipedia entry.

That further moves the boundaries of DHS’s growing use of right-wing meme imagery on social media. Wired reported on the DHS communications team’s often cruel and mocking online messaging using pop-culture references to tout its crackdown on undocumented immigrants. “Along with normalizing mass deportation, they also tap into Christian nationalist narratives and reach young men via callous jokes that have been recycled through the far-right online ecosystem.”

CBP Home and voluntary deportations

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said on August 8 that more than 1 million undocumented migrants have departed the United States of their own volition since President Trump’s term began. This number, too, is impossible to verify. “We’ve seen a complete lack of transparency when it comes to immigration from this administration,” Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Arizona) told the Washington Examiner when questioned about Noem’s claim.

A DHS spokesperson told the Examiner that “So far, tens of thousands” of undocumented people have used the “CBP Home” smartphone app to “self-deport,” a method that purports to help fund airfare along with a $1,000 payment. “Last time I looked, it was about 7,000” people who had used the app, White House “Border Czar” Tom Homan told reporters, the Examiner noted. “That was weeks ago.”

Meanwhile, the Census Bureau’s monthly Current Population Survey claims that the population of foreign-born people in the United States dropped by 2.2 million during the first six months of this year. Experts interviewed by USA Today cast doubt on this estimate, noting this survey’s small sample size and the likelihood that many immigrants are refusing to participate out of fear.

Deported Venezuelans in Venezuela

Since January, the United States has deported more than 10,000 Venezuelan citizens back to Caracas, EFE reported. There, according to the Associated Press, most migrants are struggling, often saddled with debt and not earning enough to pull them out of poverty despite working two or more jobs. “Some migrants enrolled in beauty and pastry schools or became food delivery drivers after being deported. Others already immigrated to Spain. Many sought loan sharks.”

Venezuelans deported to third countries

The Trump administration has sent another 2,900 citizens of Venezuela to third countries so far this year, according to a Miami Herald analysis of data obtained by the University of California, Berkeley’s Deportation Data Project. Venezuelan citizens make up two out of every five migrants who have been sent to third countries, often Mexico.

Once in Mexico, “They’re put on buses and told they’re going to an office to apply for asylum in Mexico, but that never happens,” South Florida-based immigration attorney Elizabeth Amaran told the Herald. “When they arrive, Mexican officials tell them there’s no such process and just give them a 10-day pass to leave. They can’t go north, they can’t stay. They’re trapped.”

Retroactive credible fear interviews

NPR reported that “dozens of immigrants across the U.S. have received letters in the mail notifying them that their asylum cases have been dismissed” and that they must apply all over again. The stated reason is that when they entered the United States at the border during the pandemic or at times of high migration, they did not receive initial screening through credible fear interviews. As they reapply for such interviews or await further instructions, these asylum seekers no longer have work authorizations and are stuck in limbo.

Judge rules on New York holding facility

Responding to a lawsuit from the ACLU and Make the Road New York, a federal judge ruled on August 12 that ICE had to improve conditions and place limits on detention in a holding facility inside the 26 Federal Plaza building in downtown Manhattan, which has been the subject of many reports of migrants forced to endure extended stays in inhumane, crowded, inadequate circumstances. The Justice Department’s lawyer’s statement conceded that those circumstances have included, as CBS News reported, detainees given only blankets with which to sleep on floors, only two meals per day, toilets amid sleeping areas, no in-person visitations even by attorneys, and no access to needed medications.

The City relayed reports of far worse: “A 20-year-old high school student forced to wear blood-soaked clothing for days when Immigration and Customs Enforcement failed to provide her a maxi pad. Dozens of people crammed in a room so tightly they had to try to sleep sitting up. A man who watched another prisoner have a seizure for a half an hour before medical help came.”

Long detention times even after cases end

At Beyond the Border, Kate Morrissey reported that ICE detention centers have a growing population of people who have already agreed to be deported, but have remained confined for months with no clear end in sight. Many are from nations, like Ecuador or Mexico, whose governments place few limits on the number of deported people they accept.

Flores settlement agreement challenged

Judge Dolly Gee, who oversees the 28-year-old Flores settlement agreement governing CBP’s treatment of children in custody, heard arguments on August 8 about the Trump administration’s ongoing legal effort to dissolve the agreement. Gee sounded skeptical, asking the government’s attorney to explain why, at a time of historically low CBP migrant apprehensions, the agency has been holding children for more than 72 hours—something that the Flores agreement only allows under exigent circumstances.

Detained population

Data published by ICE on August 14 revealed that the agency’s detained population is now a record 59,380. Of that total, 30 percent have prior criminal convictions, 25 percent face charges, and 45 percent have no criminal record.

Florida detention center

That total still does not include those being held in the facility that Florida’s state government has established in the Everglades swamp west of Miami.

On August 7, a federal judge ordered a two-week freeze to new construction at that facility as she considers whether its existence in the ecologically fragile Everglades violates environmental laws. A scientist testified that recent construction has added at least 20 acres of asphalt to the site.

The New York Times and Miami New Times reported on the case of Luis Manuel Rivas Velásquez, a 38-year-old Venezuelan man detained in the Florida facility. According to accounts from detainees, after Mr. Rivas fainted in his cell, guards “left him lying on the floor” and did not seem to know even how to check his pulse. Mr. Rivas eventually recovered—perhaps due to CPR administered by a detainee who had been a nurse in Cuba. This case mainly came to light because, as Rivas has 250,000 followers on Instagram, his sister appealed on the platform to Florida authorities to produce his body after she hadn’t heard from him for two days.

The New Times reported that Mr. Rivas suffered from a respiratory infection, and raised concerns about a possible COVID outbreak in the Florida facility. While “cases across Miami-Dade and Broward counties have increased by more than 50 percent from June to July,” New Times reporter Alex DeLuca could not get Florida officials to confirm or deny whether the disease is prevalent in the facility, despite repeated attempts.

“We are all sick in this jail. Some are worse than others, it is an emergency,” Rivas said in a statement from his attorneys. “They are treating us like dogs, like animals.”

Last week, more than a month after the facility opened, Florida’s state government and ICE “signed an updated agreement spelling out how state corrections officials should handle federal immigration detainees at non-correctional facilities,” the Associated Press reported. A federal judge had demanded to see a document indicating, among other things, whether the state or the federal government had custody of the people detained in the facility.

Claudia Sheinbaum, the president of Mexico, told reporters on August 11 that 81 Mexican citizens were being held in the Florida facility. “Obviously, we are not in agreement with these detention sites, which are run by the states,” Sheinbaum added. Diplomatically, we are working so they stay there the least number of days.”

The state government of Tennessee plans to use a closed prison in the town of Mason as a detention center in coordination with ICE and private contractor CoreCivic, the Washington Examiner reported. “The redesigned facility will hire 240 employees, and pay starts at $26.50 per hour.” Indiana, too, plans to open a 1,000-person migrant detention facility.

Sen. Kelly’s tweet

Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Arizona) posted to Twitter about an August 7 visit to Arizona’s Eloy ICE detention facility, where he met a woman named María. “She’s been in the U.S. for twenty years. Has no criminal history. She was detained at the Marine Base in Yuma. Her son is a U.S. Marine stationed there. He’s married to another Marine. And they have a two-year-old kid, Maria’s grandson. Maria was in Yuma because her son was leaving for training, her daughter-in-law had a hip surgery, and so they needed help watching her grandson. When she came back to the base after a grocery run, she was detained and reported to CBP. Now, she’s being held in an ICE facility.”

POGO on congressional access

David Janovsky of the Project on Government Oversight’s Constitution Project detailed the steps that ICE has taken to avoid congressional oversight, including delaying and circumscribing congressional visits in defiance of written law. This, Janovsky concluded, “puts the situation in stark relief: The agency is hiding abuses from Congress and the public.”

Restaurant raid in Pennsylvania

Video appeared to show ICE agents raiding restaurants outside Pittsburgh, emptying an establishment’s walk-in refrigerator, and loading food into their vehicles. Emiliano’s Mexican Restaurant issued a statement denouncing that ICE “tore through our spaces… Our kitchens were flipped. Our walk-ins emptied. Food trashed. Doors broken. Lives shattered.”

Border Network’s abuse documentation campaign

Border Report profiled the work of the Border Network on Human Rights, an El Paso-based group that for 25 years has had volunteers survey residents about experiences of abuse and mistreatment at the hands of local law enforcement. For its latest abuse documentation campaign, BNHR “is setting up 30 tables near international ports of entry, in churches and businesses in neighborhoods with a high Hispanic or immigrant population from El Paso to Del Rio, Texas, and from Anthony, New Mexico, to Albuquerque.” They will report findings in October.

Meta smart glasses

404 Media reported that a CBP agent participating in a June 30 immigration raid outside a Los Angeles Home Depot was wearing AI-enabled “smart glasses” produced by Meta, the company that runs Facebook and Instagram. “Meta does not have a contract with CBP, and 404 Media was unable to confirm whether or not the agent recorded any video using the smart glasses at the raid.” The revelation still raises regulatory issues even if the agent wore the glasses, equipped with a camera and three microphones, for personal use.

Bakers found guilty of “harboring”

A federal jury in Brownsville, Texas found on August 13 that a couple who ran a beloved bakery in the nearby border town of Los Fresnos was guilty of “harboring undocumented workers,” a crime that could carry a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. “The case was one of the first brought against business owners as Immigration and Customs Enforcement was ramping up arrests of undocumented workers,” the New York Times reported. Critics noted that while large companies usually have to pay fines for hiring undocumented workers, this is an example of “mom and pop” business owners threatened with the greater penalty of imprisonment.

Essays and analyses

“This goes beyond simply getting ‘tough’ on immigration,” wrote Nayna Gupta of the American Immigration Council at MSNBC. “The administration is undertaking an unprecedented realignment of the federal government, turning it into a detention and deportation machine that threatens communities, upends legal norms and shakes the foundation of American democracy.”

Also at MSNBC, David Bier of the Cato Institute presented a recent data analysis finding a “shocking number of Latin American immigrants being arrested on the streets with no criminal convictions, no criminal charges and no deportation orders. Nothing that would have put them on the radar of DHS for removal. No reason to seek them out specifically.” Bier goes on to detail several disturbing recent episodes of DHS personnel roughing up U.S. citizens of Latino descent on U.S. streets.

Notes from Mexico

New York Times on fentanyl smuggling

Amid the decline in border fentanyl seizures discussed above, the August 10 New York Times published an in-depth investigation of how fentanyl smugglers are dealing with increased security. Despite obstacles like higher bribes, more checkpoints, more border security, and more seizures, “cartel operatives said the demand for fentanyl had not waned.” The article makes several mentions of corruption, including payments to Mexican security forces at checkpoints and the alleged role of a corrupt CBP officer at Arizona’s Mariposa port of entry in facilitating the arrival of a shipment in exchange for “tens of thousands of dollars.”

Ciudad Juárez

In Ciudad Juárez, across the border from El Paso, a local official interviewed by InsightCrime estimated that criminal groups, often employing young people, were taking in about $100 million per month from smuggling migrants—and frequently kidnapping them for ransom—during the 2022-2024 migration increase. With the 2025 drop in migration at the border, these criminal groups are now making less money and turning their sights on the local population: the city saw a spike in kidnappings during the first half of the year.

WOLA and the Women’s Refugee Commission noted the same phenomenon in a dispatch from a recent visit to Ciudad Juárez, posted on August 11. Many whom we interviewed “reported that the kidnappings have become increasingly violent, with sexual assault and amputations becoming common means of extorting ransom.”

InsightCrime concluded that the kidnappings have begun to ebb amid a security crackdown and low profitability, and that criminal groups are now resorting to increased street-level drug sales to partially make up for the lost income from migrant smuggling and kidnapping. Still, investigator Victoria Dittmar noted, “migrant smuggling has not disappeared entirely,” and those who still try to cross are paying higher prices to smugglers.

Drone use

Axios reported on the increasing use of drones by law enforcement agencies on the U.S. side of the border, and by criminal groups on the Mexican side. Drones used by the Cochise County, Arizona Sheriff’s Department “have thermal imaging for search-and-rescue and nighttime operations,” while organized crime-operated drones can allegedly “fly for more than 45 minutes, reach more than 100 mph and carry more than 100 pounds.”

Chiapas caravan

More than 300 migrants from at least 12 countries continued a so-called “caravan” along the road leading away from Tapachula, Chiapas, a city near the Mexico-Guatemala border. “This time,” Milenio reported, “the migrants have indicated that the United States is not their destination and that they will seek to remain in Mexico City or reach Monterrey,” where they hope for more economic opportunity and faster processing of asylum claims or work permits. President Sheinbaum said that her government “will present options to the foreigners, such as repatriation to their countries of origin and the possibility of employment.”

A longtime migrant rights activist who accompanied this and previous caravans was released from prison following his arrest several days earlier. A judge determined that there wasn’t enough evidence to hold Luis García Villagrán, whom the Mexican government is accusing of helping migrants obtain false documents for a fee. Mexico’s attorney-general’s office is appealing.

“Luis’ arrest is not an isolated incident, but part of a systematic strategy that seeks to delegitimize the work of those who demand respect for human rights in the context of migration,” read an August 7 statement from the Southern Border Monitoring Collective, a coalition of local civil society organizations.

Cuban citizens stranded along the migration route

Writing for the Columbia Journalism Review, David Adams profiled José Luis Tan Estrada, an independent journalist and professor who fled Camagüey, Cuba, only to find himself stranded in Mexico City by the Trump administration’s asylum shutdown, after traveling through 12 countries, including the Darién Gap.

CiberCuba reported that “the Cuban community in Nicaragua has been steadily increasing” as more are stranded in a country whose ruling regime does not require visas for arriving Cuban citizens. Cuban restaurants are opening all over Managua.

Remittances

The BBVA Foundation reported that remittances—money sent from people abroad to Mexico, mainly from the United States—have dropped 5.8 percent from the same period in 2024. Mexico could end the year with nearly $4 billion fewer total transfers. The drop “is due to a sum of factors led by a drastic change in migration policies in the United States,” Border Report reported.

Washington’s top legal official sought an emergency restraining order in federal court blocking a Trump administration move to put a federal official in charge of its police.
Schwalb argues the new order goes beyond Trump's authority and implementing it would “sow chaos” in the Metropolitan Police Department.
Trump also appointed Bondi as U.S. attorney general, the nation’s top law enforcement official.
Troops will assist law enforcement in a variety of roles, including traffic control posts and crowd control, National Guard Major Micah Maxwell said.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The nation's capital sued to block President Donald Trump's takeover of its police department in court on Friday, hours after his administration escalated its intervention into the city’s law enforcement by naming a federal official as the new emergency head of the department.

Washington’s police department chief said that a Trump administration order installing a federal official as its head would upend command structure and be a “dangerous” threat to law and order. Police Chief Pamela Smith’s statement came in a court filing as the city seeks to block the federal takeover of its police department in court.

Washington’s top legal official sought an emergency restraining order in federal court blocking a Trump administration move to put a federal official in charge of its police. District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb argues the police takeover is illegal and threatens to “wreak operational havoc.""

The lawsuit comes after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said Thursday night that Drug Enforcement Administration boss Terry Cole will assume the police chief's duties and approval authority for any orders issued to officers. It was unclear where the move left the city’s current police chief, Smith, who works for the mayor.

Schwalb argues the new order goes beyond Trump's authority and implementing it would “sow chaos” in the Metropolitan Police Department. “The administration’s unlawful actions are an affront to the dignity and autonomy of the 700,000 Americans who call D.C. home. This is the gravest threat to Home Rule that the District has ever faced, and we are fighting to stop it,” Schwalb said.

The Justice Department declined to comment on the district's lawsuit, and a White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday morning.

The police takeover is the latest move by Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the United States illegally.

It also marks one of the most sweeping assertions of federal authority over a local government in modern times. While Washington has grappled with spikes in violence and visible homelessness, the city’s homicide rate ranks below those of several other major U.S. cities, and the capital is not in the throes of the public safety collapse the Trump administration has portrayed.

Chief had agreed to share immigration information

Schwalb had said late Thursday that Bondi’s directive was “unlawful,” arguing it could not be followed by the city’s police force. He wrote in a memo to Smith that “members of MPD must continue to follow your orders and not the orders of any official not appointed by the Mayor,” setting up the legal clash between the heavily Democratic district and the Republican administration.

The 10 Oldest U.S. Presidents

The district’s attorney general is an elected position and the city’s top legal officer. It’s separate from federal U.S. attorney appointed by the president to serve in Washington, a role now filled by former Fox News Channel host and judge Jeanine Pirro. Trump also appointed Bondi as U.S. attorney general, the nation’s top law enforcement official.

Bondi’s directive came even after Smith had told MPD officers hours earlier to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody, such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief’s directive because it allowed for continued enforcement of “sanctuary policies,” which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.

Bondi said she was rescinding that order as well as other MPD policies limiting inquires into immigration status and preventing arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants. All new directives must now receive approval from Cole, the attorney general said.

Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser pushed back Thursday, writing on social media that “there is no statute that conveys the District’s personnel authority to a federal official.”

The president has more power over the nation’s capital than other cities, but D.C. has elected its own mayor and city council since the Home Rule Act was signed in 1973.

Trump is the first president to exert control over the city's police force since it was passed. The law limits that control to 30 days without congressional approval, though Trump has suggested he’d seek to extend it. Schwalb argues the president's role is narrow under the law, limited to requiring the mayor to provide police services for federal purposes.

Residents are seeing a significant show of force

A population already tense from days of ramp-up has begun seeing more significant shows of force across the city. National Guard troops watched over some of the world’s most renowned landmarks and Humvees took position in front of the busy main train station. Volunteers helped homeless people leave long-standing encampments — to where was often unclear.

Department of Homeland Security police stood outside Nationals Park during a game Thursday between the Washington Nationals and the Philadelphia Phillies. DEA agents patrolled The Wharf, a popular nightlife area, while Secret Service officers were seen in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood.

Bowser, walking a tightrope between the Republican White House and the constituency of her largely Democratic city, was out of town Thursday for a family commitment in Martha’s Vineyard but would be back Friday, her office said.

The uptick in visibility of federal forces around the city, including in many high-traffic areas, has been striking to residents going about their lives. Trump has the power to take over federal law enforcement for 30 days before his actions must be reviewed by Congress, though he has said he’ll re-evaluate as that deadline approaches.

Officers set up a checkpoint in one of D.C.’s popular nightlife areas, drawing protests. Troops were stationed outside the Union Station transportation hub as the 800 Guard members who have been activated by Trump started in on missions that include monument security, community safety patrols and beautification efforts, the Pentagon said.

Troops will assist law enforcement in a variety of roles, including traffic control posts and crowd control, National Guard Major Micah Maxwell said. The Guard members have been trained in de-escalation tactics and crowd control equipment, Maxwell said.

National Guard troops are a semi-regular presence in D.C., typically being used during mass public events like the annual July 4 celebration. They have regularly been used in the past for crowd control in and around Metro stations.

Their tour included the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center, located on the former England Air Force Base in Alexandria. It’s become a conduit for individuals apprehended around the country to the nine ICE detention centers in Louisiana, where immigration court watchers say judges are more likely to be aligned to the Trump administration’s enforcement policy.

State Department Human Rights Report Scaled Back, Omits Details on Abuses in Politically Allied Countries

The US State Department on Tuesday released a pared-down version of its annual report meant to catalogue human rights concerns in countries around the world. The report covers the 2024 calendar year – before the Trump administration took office – and sources told CNN it was largely completed before the US president began his second term. However, it underwent significant revisions in the subsequent months. For some countries like El Salvador whose leaders are political allies of the Trump administration, there was far less criticism and detail about reports of their human rights abuses.

His death at a hospital was confirmed Thursday afternoon by Monrovia City Manager Dylan Feik. The circumstances surrounding the fatal accident are under investigation by the California Highway Patrol.

Monrovia police received reports at 9:43 a.m. of immigration agents approaching the Home Depot, according to Feik, who said an officer observed possible Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at the site.

In a emailed statement to The Times, the Department of Homeland Security said that “the individual was not being pursued by any DHS law enforcement” and that the agency was not aware of the freeway incident until hours after operations in the area had concluded.

A day laborer who asked that his name not be used, citing safety concerns, said he goes to the Monrovia Home Depot every day around 8 a.m. in search of work.

This morning started like any other, he said, until he heard people start to yell, “La migra, corre.” (“Immigration, run!”)

That’s when he took out his phone and started to record.

Although he avoided detention, he said he “felt powerless” that he couldn’t help his friends. “It feels horrible — I couldn’t do anything for them other than record what was happening.”

As workers scrambled away from the agents, one person fled the hardware store on foot, jumped a concrete wall and entered the eastbound 210 Freeway.

Just a few minutes later, Monrovia Fire & Rescue responded to a call of a vehicle collision with a pedestrian.

A motorist, Vincent Enriquez, said he saw the man soon after he was struck and he was still alive.

“By the time I was passing by ... he must’ve been struck no more than a few minutes prior,” said the driver. “He was still moving.”

The person was transported by ambulance to a hospital but did not survive his injuries.

“It just breaks my heart, because it’s just so inhumane,” said Robert Chao Romero, a UCLA professor of Chicano studies and Monrovia resident. “These horrible, unjust ICE policies led to someone dying.”

Monrovia resident Karen Suarez said she rushed to the Home Depot as soon as she heard about the raid and met the daughter of the man who was hit by a car.

“She was visibly very upset, and she was going to go to the hospital and try to find out about her dad,” Suarez said. “I feel so bad for her. I feel so bad for the families. These are people trying to escape whatever horrible atrocities they came from for a better life.”

At 6 p.m., a crowd of about 50 people rallied in front of the Home Depot, waving Mexican flags, carrying signs that read “ICE out of L.A.” and chanting, “When Trump says get back, we say fight back.”

A bouquet of flowers and two prayer candles were placed opposite the 210 Freeway as a memorial for the man who was killed.

CHP officers were asking for surveillance camera video from local businesses as part of their investigation into the incident.

Feik said in a statement that the city had not received any communication or information from ICE.

Palmira Figueroa, director of communications for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said 13 people were detained in the raid.

Pablo Alvarado, co-executive director of the network, said another day laborer was struck by what he believed was an immigration agent in a vehicle.

“His leg is very swollen, and he doesn’t want to go to the doctor because he’s afraid of going to the hospital right now,” Alvarado said.

When asked whether any of the immigration agents identified themselves or presented warrants, Alvarado said it wasn’t clear.

“They think that .. [Home Depot] is a good place where they can come to arrest as many people as they can and comply with their quotas, the quotas that the president, [White House Deputy Chief of Staff] Stephen Miller are imposing on them.”

Romero, the UCLA professor, said the Home Depot operation appeared to be in violation of the federal court order barring the government from carrying out these types of raids. Last month, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order preventing federal agents from carrying out indiscriminate immigration arrests based on a person’s race, language, vocation or location.

Immigrant rights advocates voiced their anger after Thursday’s fatality.

“We hold the Trump administration, the Department of Homeland Security and the Home Depot responsible for his death, and they must be held accountable,” said Ron Gochez, a member of Unión del Barrio, an immigrant rights group that patrols neighborhoods to alert residents of immigration sweeps.

“This is a painful reminder for us that we must continue to boycott the Home Depot due to their complicity to the ICE raids at their stores,” he said. “The Home Depot and the agents that chased the man have blood on their hands.”

In July, Jaime Alanís Garcia, 57, was killed during an immigration raid at a farm in Ventura County. The circumstances of his death are still not fully clear, but it sparked concern among immigration advocates.

Alanís’ family said he was fleeing immigration agents at the Glass House Farms cannabis operation in Camarillo when he climbed atop a greenhouse and accidentally fell 30 feet, suffering catastrophic injury.

But the Department of Homeland Security said that Alanís was not among those being pursued and that federal agents called in a medevac for him.

The High Court held that the implicit withdrawal of the asylum claim was lawful and accepted the Home Secretary’s argument that changes made in 2023 were in fact “clarifications”. The case is R (Zoto) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2025] EWHC 2148 (Admin).

Background

The claimant came to the UK by boat on 29 June 2022 and was detained on entry. He claimed asylum the same day. He was referred to the National Referral Mechanism the following day for consideration of whether he was a victim of trafficking.

The claimant left his asylum accommodation on 2 July 2022. On 3 July 2022 his asylum claim was recorded as withdrawn by the Home Office, but no withdrawal decision was issued to his file.

On 5 July 2022 a positive reasonable grounds decision was made, the first in the two stage trafficking identification process. On 21 June 2023 a formal decision letter was issued to the claimant’s file stating that his asylum claim had been deemed implicitly withdrawn. The Home Office did not provide any evidence of attempts to contact the claimant, including by calling the mobile number they had for him.

On 1 November 2024 the claimant was encountered during a stop and search and was arrested. The claimant was subsequently convicted of possession with intent to supply a class A drug. He was sentenced to two years and nine months’ imprisonment and served with a stage one deportation notice letter.

On 16 October 2024 a negative conclusive grounds decision was made on his trafficking claim. A month later he was served with a deportation decision and on 27 November 2024 was served with a notice of intent to remove. Removal was scheduled for 12 December 2024.

The judicial review

A judicial review was issued on 3 December 2024. Interim relief was refused on 11 December 2024. The claimant sought permission to appeal from the Court of Appeal. Removal directions were cancelled at 9.14pm on 11 December 2024 and the appeal to the Court of Appeal was withdrawn by consent.

On 13 February 2025 permission was granted for the judicial review which was challenging the deportation decision and detention as being unlawful on the grounds that the claimant had an outstanding claim for asylum. The judge said that while it was not possible to have any sympathy for the claimant given his conduct, he was entitled to due process and:

Everything depends on whether the claimant had an outstanding asylum application at the date of the decisions to detain and remove him, and, because there is no doubt that the claimant did make an asylum claim, that in turn depends on whether the defendant’s decision to treat the asylum claim as implicitly withdrawn was lawful….

The court’s decision centred on the interpretation of paragraph 333C of the immigration rules at the time:

333C. If an application for asylum is withdrawn either explicitly or implicitly, consideration of it may be discontinued. An application will be treated as explicitly withdrawn if the applicant signs the relevant form provided by the Secretary of State. An application may be treated as impliedly withdrawn if an applicant leaves the United Kingdom without authorisation at any time prior to the conclusion of their asylum claim, or fails to complete an asylum questionnaire as requested by the Secretary of State, or fails to attend the personal interview as provided in paragraph 339NA of these Rules unless the applicant demonstrates within a reasonable time that that failure was due to circumstances beyond their control. The Secretary of State will indicate on the applicant’s asylum file that the application for asylum has been withdrawn and consideration of it has been discontinued.

The rules were amended effective from 7 August 2023 to widen the circumstances in which a claim could be treated as withdrawn. The claimant’s circumstances would have fallen within new paragraph 333C(b)(i) which says that a claim may be treated as withdrawn when the applicant “fails to maintain contact with the Home Office or provide up to date contact details as required by paragraph 358B of these Rules”. The disagreement between the parties in this case was whether the previous wording implicitly included this situation.

The new reasons for withdrawing claims had first been introduced in version 7 of the Home Office guidance “Withdrawing asylum claims” dated 5 May 2023.

The High Court got around the Alvi point by stating:

In the case of R (Alvi) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] UKSC 33, the Supreme Court made clear that as there is a statutory requirement in section 3(2) of the Immigration Act 1971 that immigration rules must be laid before Parliament, it was not permissible for the Defendant to rely on any conditions (in that case a list of skilled occupations) which only appeared in an a supplementary Code of Practice which had not been laid before Parliament.

In the context of this case, the effect of the decision in Alvi is that the Defendant cannot rely on any additional criteria in the Guidance to supplement the scope of paragraph 333C. This does not mean however that the Defendant’s Guidance cannot throw some light on the intended meaning of the words in the Rules and the policy context and purpose which they were intended to address.

The court concluded that version 7.0 of the guidance “properly reflected the intended scope of paragraph 333C”. The judicial review was dismissed.

Conclusion

I raised concerns about these new reasons being added to the guidance but not to the rules in August 2023 and was of the view that it would not be lawful to rely on the new reasons prior to the rules change. I remain of that view and am still quite unconvinced by the High Court’s reasoning on this point, which included taking into account the fact that the Home Office had said that the changes to the immigration rules were made to “improve clarity”. To me, the use of those words seemed like an attempt by the Home Office to disguise the fact that significant changes were being made to the guidance before the rules, in breach of Alvi.

I don’t think it is too controversial to say that these are certainly not the facts I would have liked to see this argument first run on, as there will be many out there with far better merits. The need for due process regardless of personal circumstances is obviously an important one, and the court was careful to emphasise this, but the facts of these cases do still often have an impact.

It is easy to consider, for example, that the apparent failure on the part of the Home Office to attempt any contact before withdrawing the asylum claim may have been considered more significant in a different case. Knowing the litigation practices of the Home Office as I do, I wonder to what extent similar challenges with better facts have been settled to avoid them getting to this stage.",https://freemovement.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/royal-courts-of-justice-1-600x450.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 04:57:16.449361

Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent Alberto Carvalho has urged immigration authorities not to conduct enforcement activity within a two-block radius around schools starting an hour before the school day begins and until one hour after it classes let out.

“Hungry children, children in fear, cannot learn well,” Carvalho said in a news conference.

He also announced a number of measures intended to protect students and families, including adding or altering bus routes to accommodate more students. The district is to distribute a family preparedness packet that includes know-your-rights information, emergency contact updates and tips on designating a backup caregiver in case a parent is detained.

The sprawling district, which covers more than two dozen cities, is the nation's second largest with more than 500,000 students. According to the teachers' union, 30,000 students are immigrants, and an estimated quarter of them are without legal status.

While immigration agents have not detained anyone inside a school, a 15-year-old boy was pulled from a car and handcuffed outside Arleta High School in northern Los Angeles on Monday, Carvalho said.

He had significant disabilities and was released after a bystander intervened in the case of “mistaken identity,” the superintendent said.

“This is the exact type of incident that traumatizes our communities; it cannot repeat itself,” he added.

Administrators at two elementary schools previously denied entry to officials from the Department of Homeland Security in April, and immigration agents have been seen in vehicles outside schools.

DHS did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

Carvalho said that while staffers and district police officers cannot interfere with immigration enforcement and do not have jurisdiction beyond school property, they have had conversations with federal agents parked in front of schools that resulted in them leaving.

The district is partnering with local law enforcement in some cities and forming a “rapid response” network to disseminate information about the presence of federal agents, he said.

Teachers say they are concerned some students might not show up the first day.

Lupe Carrasco Cardona, a high school social studies and English teacher at the Roybal Learning Center, said attendance saw a small dip in January when President Donald Trump took office.

The raids ramped up in June right before graduations, putting a damper on ceremonies. One raid at a Home Depot near MacArthur Park, an area with many immigrant families from Central America, took place the same morning as an 8th grade graduation at a nearby middle school.

“People were crying, for the actual graduation ceremony there were hardly any parents there,” Cardona said.

The next week, at her high school graduation, the school rented two buses to transport parents to the ceremony downtown. Ultimately many of the seats were empty, unlike other graduations.

One 11th grader, who spoke on the condition that her last name not be published because she is in the country without legal permission and fears being targeted, said she is afraid to return to school.

“Instead of feeling excited, really what I’m feeling is concern,” said Madelyn, a 17-year-old from Central America. “I am very, very scared, and there is a lot of pressure.”

She added that she takes public transportation to school but fears being targeted on the bus by immigration agents because of her skin color.

“We are simply young people with dreams who want to study, move forward and contribute to this country as well,” she said.

Madelyn joined a club that provides support and community for immigrant students and said she intends to persevere in that work.

“I plan to continue supporting other students who need it very much, even if I feel scared,” she said. “But I have to be brave.”

Some families who decide that the risk is too great to show up in-person have opted for online learning instead, according to Carvalho, with virtual enrollment up 7% this year.

The district has also contacted at least 10,000 parents and visited more than 800 families over the summer to provide information about resources like transportation, legal and financial support and are deploying 1,000 workers from the district's central office on the first day of classes to “critical areas” that have seen immigration raids.

“We want no one to stay home as a result of fears,” Carvalho said.

“Our leaders have to support our law enforcement.” Bondi’s letter asks the recipients to provide a response by 19 August that “confirms your commitment with complying with federal law and identifies the immediate initiatives you are taking to eliminate laws, policies and practices that impede federal immigration enforcement”.

Bondi’s letter asks the recipients to provide a response by 19 August that “confirms your commitment with complying with federal law and identifies the immediate initiatives you are taking to eliminate laws, policies and practices that impede federal immigration enforcement”.

Bondi cites an executive order issued by Donald Trump on 28 April which called for the attorney general to identify jurisdictions that “obstruct the enforcement of Federal immigration laws” then to “notify each sanctuary jurisdiction regarding its defiance of Federal immigration law enforcement and any potential violations of Federal criminal law” as a precursor to prosecution or withholding grants.

Each of the recipients appears to have received a near-identical letter, none of which specify what local laws or practices fail to comply with Bondi’s assertions.

Initial responses from state and local governments receiving the letters include a mix of incredulity and defiance.

“Nothing in Attorney General Bondi’s letter is new and none of it has legal merit,” said Barbara Pierce, director of communications for the city of Rochester, New York. “The letter reiterates many of the frivolous arguments that the federal government has already made in its pending suit against the city of Rochester. These same arguments were levied against the city of Chicago and were dismissed by the federal district court for the eastern district of Illinois nearly a month ago.

“We look forward to the opportunity to respond to attorney General Bondi’s letter, and continue to underscore the inaccuracies of the federal government’s position.”

Bruce Harrell, the Seattle mayor, said the letter’s portrayal of his city and its laws was untruthful.

“Immigration enforcement is the exclusive responsibility of the federal government. The city neither interferes with nor carries out those federal duties,” he said. “We have received and are reviewing the latest letter from Attorney General Bondi and strongly disagree with its assertions. Our laws and policies protect the safety, privacy and constitutional rights of all Seattle residents while remaining compliant with applicable law.

“We remain committed to our local values, including being a welcoming city for all. We will continue to defend our residents and our rights – and we will not hesitate to do so in court.”

The office of Eric Adams, the New York City mayor, a Trump ally and embattled re-election candidate, offered a less strident immediate response.

“The job of a mayor is to protect the safety of every single person in their city – and that’s exactly what Mayor Adams has worked to do every day for nearly four years,” said Kayla Altus, Adams’ press secretary. “Keeping New Yorkers safe also means making sure they feel safe, and Mayor Adams has been clear: no one should be afraid to dial 911, send their kids to school, or go to the hospital, and no New Yorker should feel forced to hide in the shadows.

“That’s why the mayor supports the essence of the local laws put in place by the city council, but he has also urged the council to reexamine them to ensure we can effectively work with the federal government to keep violent criminals off our streets.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ee23711d07648798bd098b5f3b2f8a1bc4ad55e/1104_0_8333_6667/master/8333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=73977b10d584f94131e8432c6f7c7d23",N,,2025-08-15 03:56:47.397333

Advocates expect law enforcement officers to fan out across D.C. in the coming days to forcibly take down any remaining homeless encampments.","WASHINGTON — The Trump administration, stepping up its crackdown on policing in the nation's capital, on Thursday named the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration to be Washington's ""emergency police commissioner"" with all the powers of the police chief — a significant move that increases national control over the city as part of the federal government's law-enforcement takeover.

Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a directive issued Thursday evening that DEA boss Terry Cole will assume ""powers and duties vested in the District of Columbia Chief of Police."" The Metropolitan Police Department ""must receive approval from Commissioner Cole"" before issuing any orders, Bondi said. It was not immediately clear where the move left Pamela Smith, the city's current police chief, who works for the mayor.

D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb responded late Thursday that Bondi's directive was ""unlawful,"" arguing that it could not be followed by the city's police force.

He said local officers must continue to follow Smith's orders under Schwalb's interpretation of the law, setting up a potential legal clash between the heavily Democratic district and the Republican administration.

Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser wrote on social media that ""there is no statute that conveys the District's personnel authority to a federal official.""

Bondi's directive came hours after Smith directed MPD officers to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody — such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief's directive because it allowed for continued enforcement of ""sanctuary policies.""

Bondi said she was rescinding that order as well as other MPD policies limiting inquires into immigration status and preventing arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants. All new directives must now receive approval from Cole, the attorney general said.

The police takeover is the latest move by President Donald Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the U.S. illegally.

It also marks one of the most sweeping assertions of federal authority over a local government in modern times. While Washington has grappled with spikes in violence and visible homelessness, the city's homicide rate ranks below those of several other major U.S. cities and the capital is not in the throes of the public safety collapse the administration has portrayed.

The late-night announcement came after an eventful day in the ongoing federal operation. Smith's earlier directive effectively brought together Trump's moves on city law enforcement and his nationwide efforts to curb immigration, and Trump had praised it in the hours before Bondi's announcement.

""That's a very positive thing, I have heard that just happened,"" Trump said of Smith's order. ""That's a great step. That's a great step if they're doing that.""

A population already tense from days of ramp-up began seeing more significant shows of force across the city Thursday. National Guard troops watched over some of the world's most renowned landmarks and Humvees took position in front of the busy main train station. Volunteers helped homeless people leave long-standing encampments — to where, exactly, was often unclear.

Department of Homeland Security police stood outside Nationals Park before and after a game Thursday between the Washington Nationals and the Philadelphia Phillies. Drug Enforcement Administration agents patrolled The Wharf, a popular nightlife area, while Secret Service officers patrolled the Foggy Bottom neighborhood.

Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, walking a tightrope between the Republican White House and the constituency of her largely Democratic city, was out of town Thursday for a family commitment in Martha's Vineyard but would be back Friday, her office said.

A boost in police activity, federal and otherwise

For an already wary Washington, Thursday marked a notable — and highly visible — uptick in presence from the previous two days. The visibility of federal forces around the city, including in many high-traffic areas, was striking to residents going about their lives. Trump has the power to take over federal law enforcement for 30 days before his actions must be reviewed by Congress, though he has said he'll re-evaluate as that deadline approaches.

The response before Thursday had been gradual and, by all appearances, low key. But on Wednesday night, officers set up a checkpoint in one of D.C.'s popular nightlife areas, drawing protests. The White House said 45 arrests were made Wednesday night, with 29 people arrested for living in the country illegally; other arrests included for distribution or possession of drugs, carrying a concealed weapon and assaulting a federal officer.

Troops were stationed outside the Union Station transportation hub as the 800 Guard members who have been activated by Trump start in on missions that include monument security, community safety patrols and beautification efforts, the Pentagon said.

""They will remain until law and order has been restored in the District as determined by the president, standing as the gatekeepers of our great nation's capital,"" Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said. ""The National Guard is uniquely qualified for this mission as a community-based force with strong local ties and disciplined training.""

Wilson said the troops won't be armed and declined to give more details on what the safety patrols or beautification efforts would entail or how many Guard members have already been sent out on the streets.

National Guard Major Micah Maxwell said troops will assist law enforcement in a variety of roles, including traffic control posts and crowd control. The Guard members have been trained in de-escalation tactics and crowd control equipment, Maxwell said.

The White House said Thursday that Guard members aren't making arrests but are ""protecting federal assets, providing a safe environment for law enforcement officers to make arrests, and deterring violent crime with a visible law enforcement presence.""

Although the current deployment is taking place under unprecedented circumstances, National Guard troops are a semi-regular presence in D.C., typically being used during mass public events like the annual July 4 celebration. They have regularly been used in the past for crowd control in and around Metro stations.

Trump on Thursday denied that the federal law enforcement officials he sent into Washington's streets to fight crime have been diverted from priority assignments like counterterrorism. Asked if he was concerned about that, Trump said he's using a ""very small force"" of soldiers and that city police are now allowed to do their job properly amidst his security lockdown.

For homeless residents, an uncertain time is at hand

Meanwhile, about a dozen homeless residents in Washington packed up their belongings with help from volunteers from charitable groups and staffers from some city agencies. Items largely were not forcibly thrown out by law enforcement, but a garbage truck idled nearby.

Several protesters held signs close by, some critical of the Trump administration. Once the residents had left, a construction vehicle from a city agency cleared through the remains of the tents.

The departures were voluntary, but they came in response to a clear threat from the Trump administration. Advocates expect law enforcement officers to fan out across D.C. in the coming days to forcibly take down any remaining homeless encampments.

He amended to clarify he was a Louisiana citizen but was employed in Mississippi in 1968-69 in multiple towns including Sandersville (Jones County).

Parra died in 2011, at which point his wife, Peggy Parra, was substituted into the lawsuit as representative of his estate. She filed a motion for leave to amend the complaint to add wrongful death claims, but the motion was never pursued and never ruled upon.

Since then, the underlying case has remained on the Jones County docket without any forward progress. The plaintiff propounded discovery in 2009, and some discovery was exchanged in 2011, at which time it went completely cold in the trial court.

PARALLEL LITIGATION

One company Parra sued was Marsh USA Inc. Marsh was not a manufacturer or user of asbestos; rather, Marsh was the “primary insurance broker” for the Johns Manville Corp., which “[f]rom the 1920s to the 1970s … was, by most accounts, the largest supplier of raw asbestos and manufacturer of asbestos-containing products in the United States[.]” Travelers Indem. Co. v. Bailey, 557 U.S. 137, 140 (2009). In 1982, due to the volume of asbestos claims against Johns Manville, it filed for bankruptcy in the Southern District of New York. Consequently, its insurers contributed $770 million into a bankruptcy trust to pay off all asbestos claims against Johns Manville. Marsh, as insurance broker, contributed $29.75 million, and in 1986, it “received a release of, and injunction against,” relevant claims related to its service to Johns Manville. Id. at 108-09. The bankruptcy court of the Southern District of New York ruled that these “1986 Orders,” as they subsequently became known, generally enjoined state court lawsuits against Marsh and other insurers, and enforcement of such enjoinment became routine over the following decades.

In 2016, Marsh filed a motion in the bankruptcy court for the Southern District of New York to enforce the 1986 orders. Notably, Marsh argued beyond enjoinment of the case, but wanted Parra’s claims against Marsh in state court to be completely barred. Parra argued that she was not enjoined by the 1986 orders because she was suing Marsh based on its own conduct, not Marsh’s actions on behalf of Johns Manville.

The bankruptcy court ruled in favor of Marsh, and Parra, sought review to the district court, which agreed in part and remanded in part on the question of whether Parra had received due process stemming from the bankruptcy. The bankruptcy court ruled in favor of Marsh again. Parra again sought review from the district court, which ruled in favor of Parra. Marsh appealed to the Second Circuit, which reversed, ruling that a party could only sue Marsh in the bankruptcy court, not in a state court, and that the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction over whether certain claims arise from Marsh’s own conduct, as a matter of res judicata.

Marsh requested the bankruptcy court find Parra and her counsel in civil contempt for violating the 1986 orders and subsequent case-specific enforcement orders. The bankruptcy court sanctioned Parra and her counsel for $65,481.60 in Marsh’s attorney’s fees.

LACK OF PROSECUTION

In January 2021, defendants Shell Oil and Bechtel filed separate motions to dismiss for lack of prosecution under Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b), based on Parra’s failure to take action for over nine years. On February 12, 2021, Parra responded in opposition that she had been enjoined in the parallel litigation in the federal courts of New York. The trial court of Jones County ruled against Parra, stating that Parra had not taken any substantive action for nine years, and that although Parra was enjoined against Marsh, there were many other defendants in the state court suit to proceed against. The lengthy delay in the case, the trial court ruled, indeed did prejudice the defendants in the state court case, and the appropriate sanction is to dismiss the case with prejudice against all defendants, whether they had joined the motions to dismiss (as Marsh did not). Parra then filed a motion to reconsider the ruling, and over the following 26 months, scheduled and cancelled a hearing on said motion to reconsider eight times. In 2023, the trial court denied the request to reconsider, and Parra appealed.

APPELLATE RULING

On August 12, 2025, the Mississippi appellate court upheld the dismissal. Marsh and several other defendants were voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff pursuant to settlement on August 7, 2025. As such, in ruling, the Mississippi appellate court found it unnecessary to address the plaintiff’s contentions with regard to Marsh.

The relevant standard it applied was abuse of discretion. Pursuant to Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b), “For failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with these rules or any order of court, a defendant may move for dismissal of an action or of any claim against him.” Rule 41 allows courts to dismiss actions involuntarily for want of prosecution as a penalty for dilatoriness. The test is whether there is a clear record of delay or contumacious conduct by the plaintiff. Delay alone may suffice. Here, given the clear record of extreme and egregious delay by the plaintiff, there was no abuse of discretion for the trial court to dismiss the suit with prejudice.

Rather than explore potential abuse of discretion issues, Parra argued the enjoinment against Marsh in federal court should be construed as “good cause” for the years of inactivity. However, Parra never filed a motion to stay the action with the trial court or take any other relevant action. Furthermore, Parra was never enjoined against the other defendants in the case, nor did the parallel federal action actually delay Parra from maintaining the instant action in state court. Rather, the Second Circuit comprehensively held Parra could not maintain the state court action, and Parra was held in civil contempt for continuing to maintain it.

Given the circumstances, the harshness of the dismissal with prejudice sanction was appropriate.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16177_1251.png,N,,2025-08-15 12:58:25.290502

August 14, 2025 1:14 pm

OKLAHOMA CITY – In a win for freedom of speech, a suit filed against the Freedom from Religion Foundation (FFRF) was dismissed by a federal judge this week. The suit, filed by the Oklahoma State Department of Education (OSDE), sought to punish FFRF for sending advocacy letters to the department objecting to religious activity in public schools. FFRF filed a motion to dismiss in May, arguing that the suit was a frivolous attempt to silence their protected speech.

“This decision affirms a fundamental freedom: the right to petition the government for change,” said Vera Eidelman, senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. “The government has no business suing advocacy organizations for exercising their First Amendment rights, and we are grateful that the court recognized that government actors responding to the public doesn’t qualify as an injury.”

In the decision, the judge agreed that no harm had come to OSDE because of the letters, asking, “In what way are Plaintiffs precluded from administering Oklahoma’s public schools because of Defendant’s letters?” The case was dismissed without prejudice.

“As we enter a new school year, this judgement reaffirms our right to speak out against school policies and advocate for change,” said Megan Lambert, legal director at the ACLU of Oklahoma. “The right to dissent is now more important than ever, and we remain committed to ensuring that people can continue to advocate for better governance and equity in Oklahoma public schools. The Oklahoma State Department of Education is without the power to silence dissent.”

“We are pleased that this frivolous lawsuit by Walters was promptly dismissed,” says FFRF Co-President Annie Laurie Gaylor. “FFRF will continue to work to protect the constitutional rights of students and families in Oklahoma.”

FFRF is represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Oklahoma. They argued that the lawsuit is a “Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation” (SLAPP), an abusive legal tactic that seeks to chill expression by saddling defendants with potentially lengthy and expensive litigation in retaliation for protected speech. The motion to dismiss was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma in May.

Colorado's most competitive congressional district is home to a significant Latino population - about 40% of residents. The seat is held by a freshman, Republican Gabe Evans, who finds himself walking a fine line on immigration as he seeks reelection. Colorado Public Radio's Bente Birkeland has more.

BENTE BIRKELAND, BYLINE: It's a 100-degree weekday afternoon in Greeley, an agricultural city in the northern part of the district. Javi Gonzalez is a 32-year-old truck driver. He and his family are getting groceries at a local Walmart. He leans conservative and voted for President Trump. He says he's not against the federal immigration crackdown, but...

JAVI GONZALEZ: I mean, I guess it's been a little extra lately. But yeah, I don't mind it on the level of, like, criminals.

BIRKELAND: His wife, Anjelyka Flores, did not vote for Trump and doesn't like how his administration is handling immigration.

ANJELYKA FLORES: Obviously, like, crack down on the criminals. But it doesn't seem like they're focusing on what they said they would focus on.

BIRKELAND: Congressman Gabe Evans, like many living here, is Latino. He talks frequently about being the grandson of a Mexican immigrant. His grandfather crossed the border illegally as a young child, served in World War II and later gained citizenship. The first bill Evans introduced earlier this year in Congress focused on rolling back state laws, including ones meant to protect undocumented immigrants from deportation. In an interview with Colorado Public Radio right before his election, he explained why he thinks illegal immigration has become a top concern.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

GABE EVANS: It has to do with the crime and the drain on public resources that come from tens of thousands of illegal immigrants coming to the area and the crime that's oftentimes associated with, you know, the cartels and the transnational criminal organizations that are taking advantage of the southern border being open.

BIRKELAND: But recently, he's also offered a more moderate vision and signed on to the Dignity Act, a bipartisan-backed bill. It would create a pathway for some undocumented immigrants to get legal status to work in the country, but not citizenship. It faces significant pushback from parts of the MAGA base. Here's Evans again speaking to CPR last month.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

EVANS: You have critical, critical industries, like agriculture, where 42% of the ag labor force doesn't have legal documentation. We have to have some sort of way to protect American farmers, to be able to protect folks in my district.

BIRKELAND: Many voters at the shopping area in Greeley say they want those who aren't causing trouble treated differently.

MERVIN MILLER: I've worked with Mexicans. I was a roofer.

BIRKELAND: Twenty-two-year-old Trump voter Mervin Miller says he thinks it should be easier for workers to get citizenship. He's now a truck driver who hopes to move to this district soon.

MILLER: You won't meet a lot of people that are as nice as the Mexicans in general around here, right? Of course, there's the cartel and all that, but I don't think that's a reason to just say, oh, we're just going to not let anybody in.

BIRKELAND: Also buying groceries nearby is Julia Spruk, an independent who voted for Trump last November. When it comes to immigration, she considers her faith.

JULIA SPRUK: I do believe in Jesus. I do believe in God. And in the Bible, it says, owe no man anything except to love one another. And I think we're forgetting that. I think we're forgetting the love and the compassion part of the equation.

BIRKELAND: As he seeks reelection, Evans will have to contend with voters' complex views. After an afternoon spent talking with some of these voters, it's clear their opinions are more nuanced than political talking points often capture. What's not yet clear - how their views may influence their decisions at the ballot box.

“The Trump Administration’s move to use Medicaid data for immigration enforcement upended longstanding policy protections without notice or consideration for the consequences,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta (D) said in a statement.","A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from sharing the personal data of Medicaid enrollees with immigration officials.

District Judge Vince Chhabria in the Northern District of California granted a preliminary injunction on Aug. 12 blocking the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from using Medicaid data obtained from 20 states for immigration enforcement purposes.

It also blocks HHS from sharing Medicaid data obtained from this coalition of states with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for immigration enforcement purposes.

The preliminary injunction will remain in place either until 14 days after HHS and DHS complete a “reasoned decisionmaking process” that complies with the Administrative Procedure Act, or until litigation concludes.

Chhabria wrote that while there is nothing “categorically unlawful” about DHS obtaining data from agencies like HHS for immigration enforcement purposes, ICE has had a well-publicized policy against using Medicaid data for that explicit purpose since 2013.

Similarly, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has long maintained a policy of only using patients’ personal information to run its health care programs, and has publicized that on its website.

“Given these policies, and given that the various players in the Medicaid system have relied on them, it was incumbent upon the agencies to carry out a reasoned decisionmaking process before changing them,” Chhabria wrote.

“The record in this case strongly suggests that no such process occurred.”

In July, California led a multistate coalition in filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration arguing that the mass transfer of Medicaid data violated the law, and it asked the court to block any new transfer or use of the data for immigration enforcement purposes.

The data transfer, first reported by The Associated Press in June, showed that Medicaid officials unsuccessfully sought to block the data transfer, but were overruled by top advisers to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

The dataset includes the information of people living in California, Illinois, Washington state and Washington, D.C., all of which allow non-U.S. citizens to enroll in Medicaid programs that pay for their expenses using only state taxpayer dollars.

“The Trump Administration’s move to use Medicaid data for immigration enforcement upended longstanding policy protections without notice or consideration for the consequences,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta (D) said in a statement. “As the President continues to overstep his authority in his inhumane anti-immigrant crusade, this is a clear reminder that he remains bound by the law.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/immigration_ice_12062025_AP25157540699407.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-15 04:57:21.939401

The latest: D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb told the city's police chief on Thursday night that Bondi's directive that also saw DEA head Terry Cole appointed ""emergency police commissioner"" and enabling him to have the powers of the police chief was ""unlawful.""

When asked whether Schwalb's guidance in the letter to Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith applied to Bondi's sanctuary policies order as well, a spokesperson for the D.C. mayor's office said the attorney general's legal findings speak to those issues as well.""

The big picture: The announcement comes amid a Trump administration crackdown of D.C. that's seen the president deploy hundreds of National Guard troops and federal law enforcement and Bondi take control of the city's police force.

Driving the news: The announcement was made in a wider directive Bondi issued that saw Drug Enforcement Administrator Terry Cole appointed ""emergency police commissioner,"" enabling him to have the powers of the police chief.

The action rescinds an Aug. 14 executive order signed by Smith that enabled officers to assist federal immigration authorities, but which Bondi spokesperson Chad Gilmartin said on X had ""enforced sanctuary policies"" and ""prevented arrests solely for federal immigration warrants,"" among other restrictions.

Bondi also rescinded an October 2023 general order for MPD that Gilmartin said prevented arrests solely for federal immigration warrants.

The attorney general also directed the MPD to ""FULLY ENFORCE"" a section of the D.C. Code that ""makes it unlawful to crowd or obstruct streets, public or private building entrances, passage through parks, and engage in or continue demonstrations where it is unlawful or after being told to cease engaging,"" according to Gilmartin.

What they're saying: Christina Henderson, an at-large member of the Council of the District of Columbia, said on X Thursday night: ""Respectfully, the Attorney General does not have the authority to revoke laws.""

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser shared Schwalb's letter on X that assesses that under the Home Rule Act that enabled President Trump's federal crackdown, the president is permitted to request police services from the mayor, but they're not empowered to unilaterally change district laws.

What we're watching: Immigration advocates worry that the lifting of the D.C. sanctuary policies could hurt efforts to fight crime in immigrant communities since now they may be reluctant to call police.

Context: Newly released FBI data analyzed by Axios showed that D.C. had a violent crime rate of 925.9 per 100,000 residents last year.

That's more than double the national average of 359.1 per 100,000 in 2024.

However, the U.S. Department of Justice said earlier this year that the total number of violent crimes in D.C. in 2024 fell to a 30-year low.

Between the lines: Allowing immigration authorities to work with D.C. police and the cancellation of millions of dollars of anti-crime programs could reverse recent downward trends in crime, advocates warn.

Deon Lewis, 43, has been a legal permanent resident since 1993. He was born with a condition that affects blood flow, can cause severe pain, and may lead to organ damage or stroke.

“It’s only a matter of time before something really bad happens to me,” he told the Houston Chronicle. “Why haven’t I been deported yet? I’ve been begging these people to deport me.”

A member of his legal team has even pointed to his criminal record to push for faster deportation so he can get treatment.

President Donald Trump has ordered his administration to remove millions of undocumented migrants as part of his pledge for mass deportations.

Along with people without legal status, some immigrants with valid documents, including green cards and visas, have also been detained. Immigration authorities have faced more scrutiny amid misconduct claims, with ICE at the center of the immigration debate.

Lewis has had lung surgery and previously had medication that helped him function, the outlet reported.

He has been held in Houston since June 30 after being detained earlier in Louisiana, according to the Chronicle. His lawyers say he has been denied medication in Texas and has fainted from pain. In mid-July, he agreed to a stipulated removal order, waiving his right to appeal or seek judicial review, saying his main goal is to be released.

Deon Lewis was arrested in 2002 and 2020

Lewis has a criminal record going back to 2002, when he was arrested for cocaine possession, pleaded guilty, and was put on probation. In 2020, he was arrested again on marijuana and cocaine possession charges and for carrying a firearm.

“I’ve been in this country since I was 11 years old. Yeah, I did something wrong,” he said. “Since then, I went on to start my own business. I’ve got five children that I take care of. I’ve never been on child support for any of them,” he told the outlet.

An ICE spokesperson said, “He is the definition of a threat to public safety and will remain in ICE custody until his removal can be carried out.”

Lewis said he and his wife, Roxanne Lewis, have offered to pay his travel costs themselves to speed up his release.

“And that’s without me even knowing what I’m going into. I just want to get out of here so I can get medical attention,” Lewis said.

Newsweek reached out to the State Department via email for comment.

Why It Matters

President Donald Trump in June announced a travel ban restricting individuals from the following 12 nations: Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.

He said the move, part of his administration's broader hardline immigration policies, was done to ""protect the nation from foreign terrorist and other national security and public safety threats"" citing an attack in Boulder, Colorado by an Egyptian national that targeted a group advocating for the release of Israeli hostages being held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

Plaintiffs challenged the travel ban under a nondelegation theory, as well as challenging the State Department's policy of treating an entry ban as a visa issuance ban—which lawyers for the plaintiffs claim is beyond the scope of the president's authority.

What To Know

The legal case Thein v. Trump on the Trump administration's travel ban affecting hundreds of foreign nationals, diversity visa applicants from multiple countries was recently reassigned from Judge Tonya Chutkan to Judge Sparkle Sooknanan, who set a hearing on the motion for preliminary injunction for this Friday at 11 a.m. ET.

Lawyers for the plaintiffs expressed concern in early August that Chutkan, who already is overseeing two other lawsuits and has a past history with Trump due to her previously overseeing the president's federal election interference case, would be removed from their case.

Curtis Morrison, a lawyer on behalf of the plaintiffs in Thein v. Trump, subsequently filed motions for both expedited discovery and preliminary injunction.

As of Wednesday already 38,260 of the 50,000 allotted visas have been used, Morrison said, including 37,675 by the State Department and 591 by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).

He told Newsweek via phone on Thursday that he and his fellow counsel filed a motion to compel the administrative record related to Trump's travel ban and its implementation, which he said is important ""because basically we'll be able to look behind the curtain and get a better view of the Trump administration's true rationales behind issuing the ban.""

If successful, it could also lead to more background on the guidance on the ban's implementation—which should include a cable sent by U.S. Secretary Marco Rubio to all U.S. embassies around June 4-9, according to Morrison.

""And what that means is all the records that show how the government made its decisions,"" Morrison told Newsweek via phone on Thursday prior to flying to Washington D.C. for the proceedings. ""So, there's a couple of decisions here: there's the travel ban itself, and there's the implementation of the travel ban.

""And the implementation of the travel ban is going to have a cable from Secretary Rubio to all the embassies, 'Hey, this is how we implement the ban.' So, it'll be very interesting to see that cable, to see...how the State Department decided to interpret the ban.""

Morrison added that he was ""shocked"" the federal government did not object to his motion on Wednesday for administrative record, as he was already waiting for them to file an appeal.

On Tuesday, the government did filed its opposition to Morrison's motion for preliminary injunction—which included using the word ""alien"" 94 times in their brief.

He said the government even proposed requesting immigrant plaintiffs to pay a bond if the judge issues a preliminary injunction, which he called ""just nuts.""

""If that happens, we'll probably need to a GoFundMe or something,"" he said.

What People Are Saying

President Donald Trump in his June 4 proclamation: ""As President, I must act to protect the national security and national interest of the United States and its people. I remain committed to engaging with those countries willing to cooperate to improve information-sharing and identity-management procedures, and to address both terrorism-related and public-safety risks. Nationals of some countries also pose significant risks of overstaying their visas in the United States, which increases burdens on immigration and law enforcement components of the United States, and often exacerbates other risks related to national security and public safety.""

The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services wrote on X (formerly Twitter) on May 5: ""Green cards and visas will be revoked if an alien breaks the law.""

It said in a later post: ""USCIS works alongside our @DHSgov and @StateDept partners each day to keep America, and Americans, safe. From designating foreign terrorist organizations to imposing sanctions, we're taking action to protect and secure our nation for your families, friends, and future.""

Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, previously told Newsweek: ""The Trump administration's decision to turn its back on our Afghan allies who risked their lives and the lives of their families to support American troops in Afghanistan is unconscionable.""

What Happens Next

Friday will be important in the future of the green card holders awaiting their fates, Morrison said, with the judge potentially issuing an order that could have broader ramifications for all foreign nationals in the months ahead.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2702642/travel-ban.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 22:56:46.843600

Advocates are calling local and state leaders to step up, speak out and do more to protect those being detained.

A press conference was held outside Stamford Superior Court following a reported incident inside the courthouse where immigration officials allegedly detained someone. The circumstances of that detainment have not been released by ICE.

But other incidents caught on camera city-wide as recently as Wednesday have also sparked concern.

“Excuse me, can I ask what’s happening? These are families, can I ask what’s happening, officer, officer…” said one individual recording an apparent ICE detainment in Stamford’s south end.

The person filming said they are family friends of the individuals that appear to have been detained.

Six were taken to ICE centers

The six people include four adults, a 21-year-old man with Down syndrome, and a 17-year-old boy. They are from Central America, though their exact countries of origin were not made public.

The first five were taken to Tacoma, and the teen was taken across the country to an ICE detention center in New York, according to Abby Sullivan Engen, an attorney at Centro Legal de la Raza in Oakland. All six are not relatives, she said; at least some are roommates and friends.

DEA initiated operation

Centro Legal lawyers were also made aware that the initial entry on Tuesday at a home near 79th Avenue and Hillside Street was initiated by the Drug Enforcement Agency.

But details about whom the DEA agents were looking for and what the charges are have not been made public.

Questions to a DEA spokeswoman were not returned on Thursday.

It's not clear whether agents were arresting one of the people in the home, all the people in the home, or some combination of the two. KTVU also reached out to ICE but has not heard back.

At some point during the operation, ICE agents entered the home, Sullivan Engen said.

Immigration status unknown

How and why they entered has not been explained, and it's also not clear if the federal immigration agents had warrants for anyone in the house, or if the DEA invited them along on the operation. It's also not clear what the immigration status is of anyone in the house, Sullivan Engen said.

Her colleague, Nikolas de Bremaeker, tried unsuccessfully on Wednesday to convince ICE officers on Sansome Street in San Francisco to release the 17-year-old and the man with Down syndrome.

ICE had moved the teen to a hotel, then back to San Francisco, and then finally to New York, Sullivan Engen said.

""ICE was unwilling to release them,"" she said, ""despite the fact that we have no evidence and have seen no allegation that they have any criminal records.""

Moved out of state

There are no ICE detention centers in the Bay Area, and the ones in California appear to already be full, which is why the six people were taken out of state, Sullivan Engen said.

""There's no more space in ICE facilities in California because of the ramping up of arrests in recent weeks and months,"" she said.

Little information

Sullivan Engen said it's very hard to help the six people now in federal custody because ""ICE has given us very little information. ICE's practice is to operate in the shadows.""

Sullivan Engen said that even if one of the roommates was being sought by DEA, ""that does not mean that ICE should be called to sweep up anybody in the vicinity, right?""

She said her office is investigating avenues to secure the release of the man with Down syndrome from ICE custody, but that any legal action would have to be filed in Washington state. She said a coalition of rapid response deportation defense attorneys is coordinating to secure legal representation for the teen, who is in New York.

As a lawyer, Sullivan Engen wanted to remind people, even those without proper documentation, of their rights. ICE agents need a proper warrant to enter someone's home.

""People are made to feel like they don't have the option of saying no,"" she said.

But in fact, she pointed out, unless an officer has a valid warrant signed by a judge and describing in detail what they are searching for, immigrants always have the option of saying no to a law enforcement officer when they ask to enter a home.

It's unclear when the six people will be seen before an immigration judge in either Tacoma, Wash., or New York.",https://images.foxtv.com/c107833-mcdn.mp.lura.live/expiretime=2082787200/0a89662e4acbc669a22b992442c7f7db86242177a7e242e6fb283139e16e7b48/iupl/744/34F/1280/720/74434FE6294E56F93592537370A3C3AF.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-08-15 00:57:06.841616

The protest organized by the group Stamford Norwalk United with Immigrants (SNUI), will unfold outside of the Stamford Superior Courthouse, where two immigrant workers were arrested by ICE officers Monday morning. The workers, who were the victims of an armed robbery, were at the courthouse for a follow up appointment.

That’s when witnesses say ICE officers arrested the men without presenting warrants or announcing a reason for their arrests.

Mike Tejpal, a witness, told CT Public he was outside when he saw a Dodge Charger, Nissan Maxima and Ford Explorer pull up to the entrance of the courthouse. Tejpal said men dressed in military-style vests got out of the vehicles and moved quickly into the building. He said most of the men were wearing masks and dark baseball caps.

“It was like a storming of the courthouse,” Tejpal said.

Tejpal is a member of a local group that documents immigration arrests in the vicinity of the building. He said one of the men under arrest was crying and spitting after being handcuffed.

Video provided to CT Public shows the men being escorted out of the courthouse and into vehicles outside.

Protest organizers say Thursday’s rally is being held to address what they called a horrific event that represents an escalation of months of operations by ICE and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) at the Stamford courthouse.

CT Public’s request for comment from ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security went unanswered.

In a statement released to CT Public, organizers with SNUI said they are calling for policy changes following “ICE’s increasingly violent and inhumane actions.”

The group said some of those actions include stalking, destroying state property, breaking car windows and the use of pepper spray which they say has affected other people visiting the court.

SNUI said the “ violent and inhumane actions have transformed community fear into urgent action. “",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/80f41e1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1008+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3b%2F6e%2F874ea4f04830964c0dbc8560687e%2Fd604ca70f4a35897470ff2130bdf89c8255c9940-14b-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 20:56:40.847440

The notice was filed on Aug. 12 in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by a pair of Justice Department officials. It mentioned the deal forged earlier this year between the IRS and the Department of Homeland Security establishing the basis for tax data to be used in deportation efforts.

A Treasury spokesperson said the data-sharing arrangement between IRS and DHS has been ""litigated and determined to be a lawful application of Section 6103, which provides for information sharing by the IRS in precise circumstances associated with law enforcement requests.""

Then a senior DHS official said in a statement that the redacted agreement ""outlines a process to ensure that sensitive taxpayer information is protected, while allowing law enforcement to effectively pursue criminal violations.""

Experts, though, say the ongoing data sharing between IRS and immigration authorities reverses longstanding taxpayer protections originally established by Congress. ""This is a blow in decades of precedent that the IRS is not going to disclose taxpayer information except in extremely limited circumstances,"" said Tom Bowman, policy counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology.

Many undocumented immigrants pay taxes, he said, and argued it would cause many of them to think twice before filing tax returns with personal information that puts them at risk of deportation. Bowman added the tax data-sharing could lead to ""a total erosion of trust with immigrant communities.""

The notice was filed four days after Billy Long was ousted as IRS commissioner. The Washington Post reported on Saturday that White House and IRS officials had clashed over employing taxpayer data to detain and deport suspected undocumented immigrants in the hours leading up to Long's removal.

Federal law strongly shields sensitive taxpayer information such as a person's annual earnings and imposes strict guardrails on sharing it with other government agencies. Yet in April, the Treasury Department — which oversees the IRS — and DHS forged the opaque tax-data sharing agreement with the aim of accelerating the Trump administration's mass deportations.

It raised alarms among tax advocates and Democratic lawmakers. A group of 47 House Democrats have demanded an unredacted copy of the data-sharing deal to no success so far. ""We are concerned that this [deal] will result in grave consequences for taxpayers whose information is shared,"" the Democratic lawmakers wrote.","https://qz.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=85,format=auto/https://assets.qz.com/media/IRS%20HQ.jpg",N,,2025-08-14 19:56:35.923414

Calls to Iranian authorities were not immediately returned on Thursday, a public holiday in the country.

But relatives and Human Rights Watch said some political prisoners were beaten with batons and “electric shock weapons” for resisting wearing handcuffs and protesting prison guards separating death-row inmates.","BEIRUT (AP) — Human Rights Watch alleged Thursday that an Israeli airstrike on a notorious Iranian prison was “an apparent war crime”, while also accusing Tehran of harming and disappearing prisoners after the attack.

Israel struck Evin Prison in Tehran, one of Iran’s most notorious detention facilities for political activists and dissidents, on June 23, during its 12-day war with the Islamic Republic.

The strikes during visiting hours hit Evin Prison’s main southern entrance, another northern entrance and other areas of the complex, destroying buildings that had medical facilities and prison wards.

The Iranian authorities initially said at least 71 people were killed during the airstrike, among them civilians including inmates, visiting relatives, and prison staff. Iranian media later raised that number to 80. It was unclear why Israel targeted the prison.

Human Rights Watch said the attack was “unlawfully indiscriminate” and that there was no evidence of an advance warning or a military target before striking the prison complex, which it estimates holds over 1,500 prisoners.

“To make matters worse, Israeli forces put at grave risk prisoners who were already victims of Iranian authorities’ brutal repression,” said Michael Page, the rights group’s deputy Middle East director.

Human Rights Watch says prisoners were subject to “ill-treatment and violence” both as they were being taken out of the prison following the attack and as they were returned.

Calls to Iranian authorities were not immediately returned on Thursday, a public holiday in the country. The Israeli military also did not respond to an immediate request for comment on the Human Rights Watch reports.

After the attack, Iranian authorities evacuated and transferred the prisoners to two other facilities in Tehran province and said on August 8 that they were gradually returned. Iranian state media said the prisoners were transferred peacefully and without any conflict.

But relatives and Human Rights Watch said some political prisoners were beaten with batons and “electric shock weapons” for resisting wearing handcuffs and protesting prison guards separating death-row inmates.

The group said some of the prisoners have disappeared, including Swedish-Iranian doctor, Ahmadreza Djalali, who is at risk of execution. The rights group says Iran had refused to give them any information about his whereabouts.

“Iranian authorities should not use Israel’s strikes on Evin prison as another opportunity to subject prisoners, including those who should never have been in prison in the first place, to ill-treatment,” said Page.

The war in June, which killed about 1,100 people in Iran and 28 in Israel, started after Israeli jets struck key nuclear and military facilities. Iran then launched a barrage of missiles over Israel.

But ELLIS students were often among the few immigrants in their classes.
Trump issued an executive order seeking to curtail undocumented students’ access to in-state tuition at public colleges, a key benefit that allows some ELLIS students to pursue higher education.
Vega had always believed that a college education was the “great equalizer” for ELLIS students.
“For that reason, it might be the most intense attack on immigrant students to date.” At ELLIS, Vega has been raising money from outside donors for years to help subsidize undocumented students’ college costs.","This is part two of a two-part series. Read the first story here.

Fifty students stood in front of the White House, with its manicured lawn and billowing American flag. They hailed from countries like Ecuador, Nicaragua, Senegal, and Mali. They spoke Spanish, French, Pulaar, and English. Some wore hijabs.

Like other tourists on that April day, the students on a field trip with their Bronx high school posed for a group photo.

Several asked if President Donald Trump was inside. One had told an English teacher before the trip that he wanted to ask Trump why he was so anti-immigrant. Others joked, “Trump is gonna get you,” not knowing the president’s mass deportation campaign would soon sweep up one of their classmates.

In the months since Trump took office, Norma Vega, the principal of ELLIS Preparatory Academy, had vowed to stick to the same practices that for years had helped her school lift immigrant students into college and out of poverty — even as fears grew. That meant forging ahead with the trip to Washington, D.C., an ELLIS tradition that strengthened first-year students’ connection to the school and exposed them to U.S. history outside the classroom.

“We can’t function out of fear,” Vega said before the trip. “We just can’t.”

The trip was particularly meaningful for 18-year-old Bridget, an undocumented first-year ELLIS student from Ecuador who almost stayed behind because her mom, Marta, was scared of spending two days apart. She marveled at the size and beauty of the White House and the clean streets and white limestone architecture of the city. The free night in a Holiday Inn Express and hotel breakfast the next day felt like an escape from the hardship and fear that marked her life in New York City.

“It’s very beautiful. It’s like a vacation,” she said in Spanish.

But for both students and staff, the glow of the trip was short-lived. Three weeks after they returned, their classmate, Dylan Lopez Contreras, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.

Dylan’s arrest marked an aggressive new phase of immigration enforcement and a turning point for ELLIS. Federal policy reached into the school as never before, threatening ELLIS’ ability to recruit new students, retain its current ones, and send its graduates to college. Even as Vega and other ELLIS staffers clung to the approach that had long made the school successful, they began to fear their model of education may not survive the Trump administration.

Nowhere was the challenge facing ELLIS more apparent than in the school’s attempts to keep Bridget on track.

Bridget had several key ingredients for success at ELLIS: a deep relationship with staffers like counselor Hedin Bernard, a firm grasp on math and English, and a yearning to make it to college.

But despite her strong foundation, Bridget was drifting from school. As her fears grew and her mental health deteriorated in the wake of the Washington trip, Bridget’s grades slipped and her attendance faltered. She began seriously considering the prospect of going back to Ecuador. Even her eldest sister in their home city of Guayaquil — the one who initially encouraged her to come to the U.S. — had seen the news about Dylan. She urged Bridget and Marta to return.

ELLIS stepped up its support in response. Bernard connected Bridget with a therapist, helped her apply for housing, referred her to a lawyer to help with a court hearing coming up in late June and an ICE check-in a month later, and enrolled her in July classes to keep her engaged after the school year ended. But as a pivotal summer approached, he wasn’t sure it would be enough.

His work with Bridget felt like being caught in a riptide. “You can see the shore,” he said. But “you can’t move anywhere.”

Bridget and ELLIS Prep wrestle with doubts after Dylan’s arrest

When Bridget learned about Dylan’s arrest, she couldn’t stop picturing him in an orange jumpsuit with cuffs around his hands and feet. That was the uniform Bridget’s eldest sister had worn when she was detained by U.S. border agents a year earlier.

Bridget decided not to tell Marta that the lanky, purple-haired Venezuelan who’d made a point to shake her hand on a visit to ELLIS earlier that year was now in ICE detention.

“She would be very scared that they could deport us at any moment,” said Bridget, who, like her mother, asked to use a pseudonym, fearing immigration enforcement.

Bridget had tried for months to keep her own growing deportation fears at bay and stay strong for her mom. But after Dylan’s arrest, that grew harder. She started watching more TikTok videos about immigration raids and didn’t leave her midtown Manhattan shelter except for her trips to school and back.

ICE agents, facing pressure to meet stringent arrest quotas, had begun detaining immigrants after routine court dates and ICE check-ins, leading to a surge in arrests. Federal agents arrested roughly seven times as many immigrants in New York City during the first part of June compared to the same period last year. Nearly three-quarters of those arrests were of people who, like Dylan, had no criminal convictions or charges.

Bridget wasn’t the only one struggling to process the news about Dylan and the surge in immigration enforcement.

Students filled Bernard’s office to talk through questions about their immigration cases, and the stress crept into his home life. His own middle-school-aged children knew the details of Dylan’s case, and he often had to excuse himself from time with his family to take phone calls.

But the stakes felt too high to dial back his work. Normally, in the final month of school, students were worried about moving to the next grade or graduating. This year, he said they wondered: “Is a masked person going to grab me off the street?”

Vega mapped out the school’s response to Dylan’s arrest from her cavernous office adorned with student artwork and overlooking the school’s football field and the Harlem River.

As ICE shuttled Dylan from New Jersey, to Texas, to Louisiana, making it impossible for his lawyers to contact him, Vega grew angry.

“This situation makes it really, really real,” she told a room full of mostly quiet staffers during a meeting in a science classroom. “One of our kids was taken.”

The school helped launch a fundraiser that collected $43,000 for Dylan’s family, organized a schoolwide letter-writing campaign, and redoubled its efforts to connect students with lawyers.

As Dylan’s arrest sparked national headlines and local protests, even Mayor Eric Adams voiced his support, despite initially refraining from weighing in. The city’s Law Department filed a friend of the court brief in Dylan’s legal case, arguing ICE’s tactics would prevent undocumented New Yorkers from using city services.

In the days after Dylan’s arrest, Vega never wavered from the refrain she’d repeated since Trump took office in January.

“There’s nothing — nothing — that we are to say, or behave, that’s going to send a message other than: ‘You are going to college. You are going to graduate and have a future,’” she said at the staff meeting. “Our kids need to have a hope.”

In the weeks to come, though, Vega wrestled privately with her own doubts about whether the playbook she’d long relied on still worked. Many of her students went to private colleges in upstate New York because those schools had a relationship with ELLIS and offered significant scholarships. But ELLIS students were often among the few immigrants in their classes. Would that make them bigger targets for immigration enforcement?

And the Trump administration was trying to make it harder for undocumented students to access college at all. Trump issued an executive order seeking to curtail undocumented students’ access to in-state tuition at public colleges, a key benefit that allows some ELLIS students to pursue higher education.

Vega had always believed that a college education was the “great equalizer” for ELLIS students. “I feel like that comes into question right now,” Vega said in June. “Is it?”

Housing uncertainty and hardship lead to tough choices for an undocumented teen

On a Friday morning in late May, a week after Dylan’s arrest, Bernard got a call he’d been waiting weeks for. With Bridget and Marta’s permission, he had applied on Bridget’s behalf to a shelter for unaccompanied youth that could provide long-term housing along with extra support.

He knew stability was critical for Bridget. She had stayed in family and friends’ spare rooms in recent months and was tired of not having a place to call her own. Some nights, she curled up on the floor while her mom shared a bed with other relatives, sleeping only a few fitful hours.

Shortly after Bernard applied, Bridget and Marta were offered spots in a city-run homeless shelter in midtown Manhattan. It provided free food and privacy, but it was farther from ELLIS.

On the phone, Bernard learned the youth shelter had an open room and needed to hear back by noon that day. But Bridget would have to live apart from Marta.

For Bridget, the youth shelter’s offer was another reminder that her best chance at building a future in this country might require leaving her mom behind. Bridget had also applied, with the help of a lawyer recommended by Bernard, for Special Immigrant Juvenile status, a type of legal protection for youth abandoned or neglected by at least one parent. Bridget knew it was her best chance at legal protection, but it wouldn’t cover Marta.

Sitting in class that morning, Bridget could barely focus. She turned Bernard’s offer over in her head. In her English class, she stared at the pages of an autobiography she’d been working on for weeks.

On a page entitled “important people,” Bridget had written: “First my mom.” Marta had worked hard to make Bridget a “good person” and give her “a good future,” she wrote in neat handwriting.

Bridget turned down the spot in the youth shelter.

“Mama was alone. All she has is me,” she later said.

Whether they stayed in the U.S. or left, Marta and Bridget were going to do it together. Increasingly, they thought about returning to Ecuador.

Bridget missed her eldest sister, the smell of Ecuadorian street food, like caramelized apples, and sitting outside her house with her family, sipping on soda or juice as children played nearby.

On a warm morning in mid-June, as Bernard prepared for a meeting with parents to share legal resources, he got a WhatsApp message from Bridget that stopped him in his tracks.

“Mr Hedin good morning my mom is very frightened with everything and so am I,” she began. “To tell the truth I don’t feel good about all of this and we haven’t left the shelter at all, I know things are going to get worse and I think it would be best to go back to Ecuador.”

She asked if he knew how “voluntary removal” worked. For months, the Trump administration had been offering to pay for the flights of immigrants who agreed to “self-deport.” But few ELLIS families knew the details of the offer, or trusted the Trump administration enough to take them up on it, Bernard said.

Bernard quickly sent Bridget a voice memo asking her not to “make any decisions before talking to me.”

When they met in person the next day, Bernard urged her to stay in school while her legal case played out. Her court hearing was in a few weeks, on June 25, and the ICE check-in was about a month later.

He encouraged her to come to July classes to keep up her connection with ELLIS and prepare for the English Language Arts Regents exam next year. The school had placed her in an advanced English course starting in the fall.

Bridget reluctantly agreed. She still wanted to leave, but it was logistically complicated. She and Marta didn’t have the money for plane tickets, which would cost upwards of $1,000. It would also take time to arrange travel.

And anyway, Bridget had started helping Marta collect bottles and occasionally clean apartments. Even though their daily earnings were meager, it was far more than they could make in Ecuador.

Bernard had bought some time, but he wasn’t sure how much.

ELLIS’ mission put to the test under Trump’s policies

As ELLIS’ staffers entered the summer, they faced two challenges: keeping up a connection with current students and figuring out how the school would need to adapt over the year ahead.

ELLIS expanded its summer school last year to keep students engaged and on track to graduate. But the accelerating mass deportation campaign had made that more difficult, and it showed no signs of abating.

At the start of the summer, Congress approved a spending bill that set aside an unprecedented $170 billion for immigration enforcement. When an undocumented migrant shot a border agent in a Manhattan park just across the river from ELLIS, Border Czar Tom Homan promised to “flood the zone” with ICE agents, and Attorney General Pam Bondi sued the city over its “sanctuary” policies limiting local law enforcement’s cooperation with ICE.

On the last day of the school year, Bernard got a call from another first-year student and friend of Bridget’s: Her mom had been detained by ICE. The girl was devastated. With the arrest, she’d also lost the primary source of child care for her own toddler and the household’s main wage earner. She told the school she wouldn’t be able to make it to summer school.

Vega offered to take care of the student’s son in the principal’s office while she attended class. But the student never took her up on it, opting to work instead.

ELLIS has always had students balancing work and school. But some staffers saw the pressure to work growing — and starting earlier than usual — as deportation fears mounted.

“They feel the urgency to make money now,” said Maciel Lantigua, an ELLIS alumna and social worker for the Mission Society, a nonprofit that operates out of ELLIS, providing students with extra resources and support. “They don’t have the luxury of that time.”

Vega worried about hanging on to existing students. She was also stressed about recruiting new ones.

As a result of Trump’s policies, the number of immigrants unlawfully crossing the U.S.-Mexico border sank to the lowest point in decades in July. The rate of new migrants entering New York City shelters, meanwhile, had dropped to fewer than 100 per week from a high of more than 4,000 weekly two years earlier.

ELLIS staffers noticed only a handful of new students registering through the end of July, compared with 20-30 over the same period last year.

The slowdown forced Vega to consider whether the 275-student school would need to adjust its policy of only enrolling students over 16 who have been in the country less than a year.

At the same time, the Trump administration ramped up its efforts to cut off undocumented students’ access to public education.

In July, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that undocumented preschoolers would no longer qualify for Head Start, a federally funded free child care program. Older undocumented students lost access to federally funded dual-enrollment, career and technical education, and adult education programs. Later that month, the Department of Education launched a civil rights investigation into universities providing financial aid to undocumented students who arrived as young children in the U.S. and have temporary legal protection, commonly known as Dreamers.

“The way this second Trump administration is targeting every aspect of life for immigrants makes students’ ability to access education that much harder,” said Alejandra Vázquez Baur, a fellow at the left-leaning Century Foundation and founder of the National Newcomer Network. “For that reason, it might be the most intense attack on immigrant students to date.”

At ELLIS, Vega has been raising money from outside donors for years to help subsidize undocumented students’ college costs. The school raised a record, over $40,000, this year.

And while Vega is committed to keeping students at ELLIS for four years, she knows the school will have to be nimble about developing flexible schedules for students feeling pressure to earn money right away.

She’s hopeful that the tides will eventually turn.

As Americans have started to see the effects of the administration’s aggressive enforcement campaign, the anti-immigrant sentiment that helped propel Trump into office has begun to reverse. The percentage of Americans who support curbing immigration dropped from 55% in July 2024 to just 30% a year later, according to a poll from Gallup.

That’s why Vega is confident that if she can make it through a few years of lean enrollment, the school’s situation will improve.

“The goal is to survive,” she said. “To still be here post-Trump.”

Can Bridget hold on to her education dreams?

Bridget and Marta, who were still terrified of being detained by federal immigration agents, had one stroke of good luck: Their June 25 court hearing was virtual.

In the weeks leading up to the proceeding, the pair found a pro bono lawyer to help them submit applications for asylum and for Bridget’s special juvenile status. The judge scheduled another hearing for 2027 while their claims wound their way through the slow-moving courts.

But they still had their in-person ICE check-in on July 21. Bridget, who had been watching videos about immigration enforcement, knew ICE agents were increasingly using the check-ins to detain migrants.

The night before the appointment, Marta and Bridget barely slept. At the subway station, Marta didn’t have enough money to buy her own one-trip pass and slipped through the turnstile with Bridget when she tapped her student OMNY card — knowing full well that getting caught could have devastating consequences.

On the train, Bridget, wearing a matching set of pink pants and shirt with the logo from the Nickelodeon kids show “Rugrats,” carried the immigration papers in crisp folders and stared ahead.

Dressed in a white and blue floral dress, Marta thumbed the small brown stuffed mouse named Mickey, who had traveled with her from Ecuador, attached by keychain to her fanny pack.

She played the possibilities and questions over in her head. Should she have brought a suitcase with her in case she was deported? Would she be separated from Bridget if they were detained? Would they send her back to Ecuador, or to a country she’d never set foot in?

A couple of weeks earlier, she’d found a stuffed pink rabbit on the street, and she clipped it next to Mickey on her keychain.

“If we get out of this, I’ll give it a name,” she said.

A snaking line wound its way inside to the first checkpoint at 26 Federal Plaza, an imposing steel and glass federal immigration building. On the courthouse wall, looking down on them, was a stern-faced portrait of Trump. Marta leaned her head on Bridget’s shoulder, and Bridget wrapped her arm around her mom.

Bridget and Marta — who still had a shared immigration case because Bridget entered the country as a minor — were referred to a room on the fifth floor for family cases. Five floors above them, dozens of recently detained migrants were being held in a makeshift detention center, forced to use the toilet in public and sleep on the floor with only thin blankets.

Two hours later, Marta and Bridget emerged, wearing faint smiles and clutching paperwork that listed the date of their next ICE check-in: exactly a year later.

Outside the building, with the sun shining, Bridget and Marta made a video call to Bridget’s eldest sister in Ecuador, who had been waiting for news. Marta christened the stuffed rabbit on her fanny pack “Pinky.”

The women were relieved, but they didn’t feel like celebrating. Marta wanted a coffee, but had no money to buy one.

Bridget’s dream of becoming the first person in her family to attend college for the moment felt a little more within reach — at least until her next court date. She still thought often about her friend Dylan, who remains in detention in Western Pennsylvania.

ELLIS staffers also hadn’t given up trying to reel Bridget in.

One morning in late July, Lantigua, the social worker, spotted Bridget and Marta near the school with a shopping cart full of cans and bottles. Bridget had for weeks been helping Marta collect them in the punishing heat. Lantigua invited Bridget to go see “Superman,” one of a series of activities she’d organized for students to keep them connected to ELLIS over the summer.

Bridget didn’t go. But Lantigua tried again with a trip on Wednesday to the New York Botanical Garden. She attempted a move that had worked in the past: inviting Bridget and Marta, too.

The presence of the agents on Thursday came as Democratic leaders in California, including Mr. Newsom and Ms. Bass, have sparred with the federal government over widespread immigration raids in recent weeks.

Mr. Newsom has repeatedly criticized the Trump administration, and he sued the federal government for deploying National Guard troops to Los Angeles to quell protests this summer. The City of Los Angeles also joined a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security over how the raids have been conducted. In June, dozens of federal agents marched through MacArthur Park, in a neighborhood that is home to many immigrants, an action that drew criticism from local officials.

It was not immediately clear whether the agents who arrived on Thursday were patrolling the neighborhood or were part of a targeted operation.

A video shared on social media by Mr. Newsom’s press office shows the agents gathering outside the museum. In the video, Gregory Bovino, a Border Patrol chief who is leading the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Southern California, says, “We’re here making Los Angeles a safer place, since we don’t have politicians who can do that. We do that ourselves.”

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

When Mr. Newsom was asked by reporters about Border Patrol’s appearance outside his event, the governor said, “It’s pretty sick and pathetic.” He added that it said everything people need to know “about Donald Trump’s America.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/14/multimedia/14nat-border-patrol-newsom-jwvz/14nat-border-patrol-newsom-jwvz-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 18:57:37.831452

A trial is underway this week challenging Trump’s move to federalize California National Guard members, in a suit filed by Democratic Gov.","WASHINGTON — Local leaders and advocates Thursday said that President Donald Trump’s decision to seize the District of Columbia’s 3,400-member police force and deploy 800 National Guard members is a continuation of his administration’s immigration crackdown.

Since the president’s decision Monday to invoke the district’s Home Rule Act, checkpoints are being set up in busy neighborhoods, bulldozers are clearing out tents of people experiencing homelessness and Republican governors are volunteering their own National Guard members to bolster the president’s federalization of the district’s 68 square miles.

Videos of masked law enforcement officers making Washingtonians step out of their cars and conducting arrests have been posted on social media by journalists, drawing concern over civil liberties.

While Trump’s control of the district’s police force ends in 28 days, he’s signaled he wants Congress to extend his authority to deter the “crime emergency.”

Advocates questioned the situation. “There does appear to be evidence that non (Metropolitan Police Department) federal authorities may have exceeded the lawful bounds at some of those traffic stops … and there will be accountability if the law is violated,” said Norm Eisen, the executive chair of Democracy Defenders Fund, a litigation organization that has challenged many of the Trump administration’s actions, in a call with reporters.

Trump predicts enforcement ‘all over the country’

The checkpoints have drawn backlash from district residents and local elected leaders.

In a statement, district Councilmember Brianne Nadeau criticized the immigration enforcement at checkpoints.

“Last night what would have been a routine MPD traffic safety operation was co-opted by federal law enforcement agents,” she said. “Agents who are not trained in D.C. law. Agents who do not know our community. Agents who were not seeking to address traffic safety but rather were interrogating drivers on their immigration status.”

Trump Thursday said that law enforcement using the checkpoints as immigration enforcement was “a great step.”

“I think that's going to happen all over the country,” the president told reporters at the White House after signing a proclamation celebrating Social Security‘s 90th birthday. “We want to stop crime.”

Violent crime in the district is at a historic 30-year low, according to the Department of Justice.

Eisen called the checkpoints unlawful.

“They're using it as an immigration control checkpoint,” he said. “That is illegal.”

Bulldozing camps for homeless people

Homeless camps across the district are also being cleared as part of the president’s directive.

Trump Wednesday signaled that he plans to send a request to Congress for “a relatively small amount of money” to make improvements to the district.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that if those people experiencing homelessness don’t agree to go to a shelter, they could face fines or jail.

“The homeless problem has ravaged the city,” Leavitt said. “Homeless individuals will be given the option to leave their encampment, to be taken to a homeless shelter, to be offered addiction or mental health services, and if they refuse, they will be susceptible to fines or to jail time.”

The district has faced a backlog in getting vouchers to those experiencing homelessness, according to Street Sense Media, a news outlet that focuses on reporting on homelessness in the district.

Local police to aid feds on immigration actions

The district's police chief Thursday issued a new executive order allowing local police to aid federal officials in immigration enforcement for immigrants not in police custody.

The new order does not change the district's law that prohibits local police from sharing information with federal immigration officials about people in police custody. It’s a policy for which Trump has criticized the city, calling it a “sanctuary city,” but the policy does not bar immigration enforcement.

Trump called Thursday’s executive order “a very positive thing,” especially at checkpoints in the district.

“When they stop people, they find they're illegal, they report them, they give them to us,” he said.

Since taking office for a second term, the president has intertwined military involvement in immigration enforcement, such as sending thousands of troops to the southern border and deploying thousands of National Guard members to Los Angeles after protests sparked by the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

More National Guard movements possible

Additionally, the Trump administration is evaluating plans to establish a “Domestic Civil Disturbance Quick Reaction Force” composed of 600 National Guard members to remain on stand-by in order to be quickly deployed to any U.S. city undergoing a protest or other civil unrest within an hour, according to documents obtained by The Washington Post.

On Wednesday, in another new twist, Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said he’s prepared to send his National Guard members to the district. Lee added that U.S. Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll told him that the military might request states send troops to the district for law enforcement.

The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 generally bars the use of the military for domestic law enforcement purposes.

While the president has stated he also wants to send in National Guard members to other cities – Baltimore, Chicago, New York City and Oakland – all heavily Democratic cities led by Black mayors, like he has done with the district, it can’t be replicated, said Abbe Lowell, a high-profile defense attorney.

“One thing that people need to remember about his assault on the District of Columbia, it is a very unique legal framework because of the Home Rule Act that gives him some ability to do something which he does not have in other states and cities where the governors still have some or the primary control over things like the National Guard,” said Lowell, who was with Eisen on the call with reporters.

A trial is underway this week challenging Trump’s move to federalize California National Guard members, in a suit filed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, after an appeals court temporarily upheld Trump’s move.

‘Racial undertones’ cited by Baltimore mayor

Baltimore Mayor Brandon M. Scott said Trump’s singling out of those cities, including the district, can’t be ignored.

“Every city that he called out had a Black mayor, and we're talking about Black-led cities,” he said on the call with Eisen and Lowell. “We cannot overstate the racial undertones here.”

Scott also criticized the Trump administration for pulling federal law enforcement officers – Drug Enforcement Agency, Homeland Security Investigations, FBI, Customs and Border Patrol – from their duties. Instead they are “patrolling neighbors of Washington DC, stopping residents and checking cars instead of doing their actual jobs,” Scott said.

“If the president really wants to help these cities continue to lower violence and crime, he could go back to sending agents to their actual agencies and having them help us work on gun trafficking, work on violent drug organizations, and not taking these agents off to work on this immigration brigade that he's had them on,” Scott said.

He added that he’s working closely with Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore and “we’ll be prepared to take any legal and any other action that we need to take.”

Moore, who served in the U.S. Army, has criticized the president for calling in the National Guard to the district and raised concerns that service members do not have the same training as police officers.

Trump brushed those concerns off on Thursday.

“They're trained in common sense,” the president said of National Guard members.

Emergencies

Eisen said Trump’s actions in the district are part of the president’s pattern of invoking “non-emergencies.”

On Inauguration Day, Trump declared a national emergency at the border, despite low levels of immigration.

In March, he invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a wartime law only used three times previously.

Trump’s decision to declare a “crime emergency” in the district earlier this week came after a former U.S. Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, official was injured in an attempted carjacking incident around 3 a.m. Eastern near the Logan Circle neighborhood. Two Maryland teenagers were arrested on charges of unarmed carjacking in connection with the incident.

“Well, what he's doing in the District of Columbia, including illegal traffic stops, what he's doing is of a piece with that dictatorial approach,” Eisen said of the president.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/2025-08/dccrackdown.jpg?h=af3b6faf&itok=T7oG3nyl,N,,2025-08-14 18:57:42.222772

After groups of grant recipients sued to challenge that order, U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ordered the administration to release the full amount of foreign assistance that Congress had appropriated for the 2024 budget year.

The appeal court’s majority partially vacated Ali’s order.

Judges Karen LeCraft Henderson and Gregory Katsas concluded that the plaintiffs did not have a valid legal basis for the court to hear their claims. The ruling was not on the merits of whether the government unconstitutionally infringed on Congress’ spending powers.

“The parties also dispute the scope of the district court’s remedy but we need not resolve it ... because the grantees have failed to satisfy the requirements for a preliminary injunction in any event,” Henderson wrote.

Judge Florence Pan, who dissented, said the Supreme Court has held “in no uncertain terms” that the president does not have the authority to disobey laws for policy reasons.

“Yet that is what the majority enables today,” Pan wrote. “The majority opinion thus misconstrues the separation-of-powers claim brought by the grantees, misapplies precedent, and allows Executive Branch officials to evade judicial review of constitutionally impermissible actions.”

The money at issue includes nearly $4 billion for USAID to spend on global health programs and more than $6 billion for HIV and AIDS programs. Trump has portrayed the foreign aid as wasteful spending that does not align with his foreign policy goals.

The teenager, Benjamin Marcelo Guerrero Cruz, had just turned 18 and was about to start his senior year when officers kidnapped him off the street.

“He is more than just a student — he is a devoted son, a caring brother, a loyal friend, and a valued member of our community,” states a post on the GoFundMe started to help his family with legal costs and other essentials. “He carries a tremendous amount of responsibility at home, helping care for his five-month-old twin brothers and his six-year-old brother. He is a good student, with a kind heart, who has always stepped up for his family.”

Days after his abduction, he was “cramped in a holding cell with about 50 others, without access to basic hygiene, warmth, or adequate food,” according to an update on GoFundMe, as per local news outlet KTLA. There were only two toilets for everyone to share.

Guerrero Cruz, the update said, “is cold, scared, and one of the youngest there.”

There are currently more than 60,000 people detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), up from 39,000 in January. People in ICE custody have reported inhumane conditions and being denied access to their attorneys and families.

In a statement to Truthout, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said:

“Benjamin Guerrero-Cruz, an illegal alien from Chile, overstayed his visa by more than two years, abusing the Visa Waiver Program under which he entered the United States, which required him to depart the United States on March 15, 2023. He will remain in ICE custody pending removal.”

DHS recently made similar claims about Yeonsoo Go, a 20-year-old Purdue University student who was abducted as she left her visa hearing in Manhattan. Although her visa is valid until December, DHS claimed she had overstayed her visa by two years. Community members rallied in support of Go and, ultimately, local elected officials helped secure her release from custody.

Several people have left messages about Guerrero Cruz on the family’s GoFundMe, which has already raised more than $20,000.

One player on Guerrero Cruz’s soccer team described him as “kind, respectful, and someone who lifted up the people around him.”

“On the field, he was rock-solid — always showed up, worked hard, and could be counted on week after week,” his teammate wrote.

Another person, identified as a “soccer friend,” wrote, “Benjamin is not only a good soccer player but also known for his humility, sportsmanship, and team spirit.”

“He plays selflessly, stays calm under pressure, always respects others,” he continued. “His attitude lifts the whole team.”

Sanctuary jurisdictions have been illegal in Georgia since 2009.
“Georgia has been ahead of the curve on that for most states on having a state law on sanctuary policies,” said Rusi Patel, general counsel for the Georgia Municipal Association.

In May, the DOJ released a list of more than 500 places across the country that it considered a sanctuary jurisdiction. Georgia had six locations on the list: the cities of Atlanta and Athens, and the Fulton, DeKalb, Douglas and Athens-Clarke counties. DOJ took the list down days later.

The new list was published at the beginning of the month, with no cities or counties in the state appearing on it.

Sanctuary jurisdictions have been illegal in Georgia since 2009.

“Georgia has been ahead of the curve on that for most states on having a state law on sanctuary policies,” said Rusi Patel, general counsel for the Georgia Municipal Association. “The law itself is pretty broad, at least in the definition of sanctuary policy.”

The law prohibits any policy or practice where local officials are restricted from cooperating with federal law enforcement on immigration matters. Every year, municipalities have to certify to the state that they do not have any sanctuary practices and that they follow the state’s laws on status verification. State funding depends on following the law, and government employees can face criminal charges for not obeying the law.

“Georgia is a little more detailed as to what they mean by sanctuary policy, because we have a written definition for it, and the legislature here in Georgia was very deliberate,” Patel said. “That first list from the federal government was a little confusing as to what the federal government was identifying as a sanctuary policy.”

Last year’s report criticized Israel for alleged human rights abuses following the October 2023 attack and abductions at a music festival.","WASHINGTON — The U.S. State Department released its annual report on international human rights this week but with glaring differences from the past.

This year, the definition of human rights is limited in a way that appears to reflect President Donald Trump’s “America First” ideology.

The report makes lesser efforts to track previously identified abuses, such as imprisonments without trials, unnecessary government surveillance and LGBTQ hate crimes.

The State Department’s annual report has traditionally been the gold standard on monitoring international human rights since it was established in 1977. It lists human rights practices in nearly 200 countries.

This year’s report appears to reflect Trump administration policy of making foreign concerns a lower priority.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has shut down State Department divisions that dealt with human rights and labor issues and fired many of their employees. The Trump administration also closed the U.S. Agency for International Development.

The 2025 report goes easier on countries that are perceived as friendly toward Trump, such as El Salvador, Hungary, Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

“There were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses,” the report said about El Salvador.

A year earlier, the Biden administration report discussed “significant human rights issues” in El Salvador based on allegations of unlawful or arbitrary killings, torture and harsh prison conditions.

Since Trump took office, hundreds of illegal immigrants with criminal records have been deported to El Salvador. The U.S. government paid the Salvadoran government $6 million to keep them in a high-security prison.

The report was delayed by months from its usual release date. The final report is shorter than previous years.

“This year’s reports were streamlined for better utility and accessibility in the field and by partners, and to be more responsive to the underlying legislative mandate and aligned to the administration’s executive order,” a State Department summary says.

Last year’s report criticized Israel for alleged human rights abuses following the October 2023 attack and abductions at a music festival. They have included lack of food aid in Gaza and bombings that have killed thousands of civilians.

The report said Israel’s war in Gaza “displaced the vast majority of Palestinians in Gaza, and resulted in a severe humanitarian crisis.”

This year’s State Department report largely omits any criticisms of Israel.

Some of the condemnations in the 2025 report are directed at opponents of conservative government leaders.

One example is Brazil, where its liberal president encouraged a criminal trial of his opponent, former President Jair Bolsonaro, on charges of trying to overturn the last election. Trump is a supporter of Bolsonaro.

The State Department report says Brazil’s current leaders are “disproportionately suppressing the speech of supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro, as well as journalists and elected politicians, often in secret proceedings that lacked due process guarantees.”

Trump has imposed a 50% tariff on Brazil’s imports into the United States.

The South Africa section of the report says the country enacted “substantially worrying” legislation that allows “land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.” The country’s main minority refers to White people.

Trump agreed shortly after he was inaugurated this year to give refugee status to white South African farmers who want to emigrate to the United States.

Critics of the report say it was influenced this year by Trump’s political preferences.

“The outcome is a much-abbreviated product that is more reflective of a Soviet propaganda release than of a democratic system,” said Josh Paul, a former State Department official.",https://www.thewellnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/state-department-2.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 18:57:45.807721

Kelly joined 22 states and the District of Columbia in the lawsuit last month. Kobach, a Republican, said the Democratic governor doesn’t have the authority under Kansas law to represent the state in federal litigation.

“The governor is purporting to represent the state of Kansas and claiming that Kansas demands and wants the federal government to continue spending this money that these federal agencies have deemed to be unnecessary and wasteful,” Kobach told legislative leaders at a meeting Thursday at the Statehouse.

The states sued the Office of Management and Budget over decisions by President Donald Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, to terminate billions of dollars in federal funding that had been allocated by Congress. The lawsuit argues those cuts have had a devastating impact on state efforts to combat violent crime, educate students, safeguard public health, protect clean drinking water, conduct medical and scientific research, provide meals for students in school, and ensure access to unemployment benefits.

When the governor joined the lawsuit, her office said the Trump administration had terminated “millions of dollars used to purchase goods from Kansas farmers, to mitigate natural disasters and to enhance childhood education.” Her office didn’t immediately respond to a Kansas Reflector inquiry on Thursday.

Kobach appeared before the Legislative Coordinating Council, which consists of five Republicans and two Democrats, to ask for a statement of support in dropping Kansas from the litigation. He said he filed an amicus brief Thursday to inform the Massachusetts federal court of his assertion that state law allows only the attorney general to represent the state in federal litigation.

“Otherwise the court might assume that a governor walking into a federal court might have the authority to represent the state in court, but under Kansas law, that is not the case,” Kobach said.

The council on a party-line vote approved a motion made by House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican who is running for state insurance commissioner, that declares the governor is violating Kansas law and should be dropped from the case.

“Even if the attorney general were representing Kansas, doing so would not be in the state’s interest,” Hawkins said.

Kobach also said Kelly had asked him to join the lawsuit and that he refused because he believes it is destined to fail. He pointed to the Trump administration’s insistence that a federal regulation allows agencies to terminate a grant if it no longer effectuates agency priorities.

“We don’t believe that any state has the ability to compel the federal agency to spend the money, and so, purely on legal grounds, we rejected the governor’s request,” Kobach said.

He said the states could get a favorable ruling at the district court level in Massachusetts, where the case was filed, but that their legal claims “are not winners.”

“We’ve all heard in the news there are district judges on every position on the political spectrum, and judicial, ideological, jurisprudential spectrum,” Kobach said. “When this case goes up on appeal, the states seeking the grants are going to lose.”

In the lawsuit, the states argue that the Trump administration is attempting to redefine a regulation that has never before been used to justify an agency withholding grant money “when the agency simply changes its mind.”

The regulation “provides no support for a broad power to terminate grants on a whim based on newly identified agency priorities,” the lawsuit said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-84/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/p6170150-1024x5761755205733.jpg?h=c12e0b96&itok=T9Ujb4kO,N,,2025-08-14 19:57:07.630474

National Guard troops watched over some of the world’s most renowned landmarks and Humvees took up position in front of the busy main train station.

In a city tense from days of ramp-up toward federal law enforcement intervention, volunteers helped homeless people leave long-standing encampments — to where, exactly, was often unclear. The mayor, meanwhile, left town for a family commitment. And the president told reporters that he was pleased at how the operation — and, now, its direct link with his immigration-control efforts — was unfolding.

“That’s a very positive thing, I have heard that just happened,” Trump said of Police Chief Pamela Smith’s order. “That’s a great step. That’s a great step if they’re doing that.”

The police chief’s order establishes that Metropolitan Police Department officers may now share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody — such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. MPD officers may also provide “transportation for federal immigration employees and detained subject,” the order states.

The changes, which raise collaboration between the two forces in notable ways, are effective immediately. Mayor Muriel Bowser, walking a tightrope between the Republican White House and the constituency of her largely Democratic city, was out of town Thursday for a family commitment in Martha’s Vineyard but would be back Friday, her office said.

A boost in police activity, federal and otherwise

For an already wary Washington, Thursday marked a notable — and highly visible — uptick in presence from the previous two days. The visibility of federal forces around the city, including in many high-traffic areas, was striking to residents going about their lives. Trump has the power to take over federal law enforcement for 30 days before his actions must be reviewed by Congress, though he has said he’ll re-evaluate as that deadline approaches.

The response before Thursday had been gradual and, by all appearances, low key. But on Wednesday night, officers set up a checkpoint in one of D.C.’s popular nightlife areas, drawing protests. The White House said 45 arrests were made Wednesday night, including 29 arrests of people living in the country illegally, including for distribution or possession of drugs, carrying a concealed weapon and assaulting a federal officer.

Troops were stationed outside the Union Station transportation hub as the 800 Guard members who have been activated by Trump start in on missions that include monument security, community safety patrols and beautification efforts, the Pentagon said.

“They will remain until law and order has been restored in the District as determined by the president, standing as the gatekeepers of our great nation’s capital,” Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said. “The National Guard is uniquely qualified for this mission as a community-based force with strong local ties and disciplined training.”

Wilson said the troops won’t be armed and declined to give more details on what the safety patrols or beautification efforts would entail or how many Guard members have already been sent out on the streets.

National Guard Major Micah Maxwell said troops will assist law enforcement in a variety of roles, including traffic control posts and crowd control. The Guard members have been trained in de-escalation tactics and crowd control equipment, Maxwell said.

The White House said Thursday that Guard members aren’t making arrests but are “protecting federal assets, providing a safe environment for law enforcement officers to make arrests, and deterring violent crime with a visible law enforcement presence.”

For homeless residents, an uncertain time is at hand

Meanwhile, about a dozen homeless residents in Washington packed up their belongings with help from volunteers from some city agencies. Items largely were not forcibly thrown out by law enforcement, but a garbage truck idled nearby.

Several protesters held signs close by, some critical of the Trump administration. Once the residents had left, a construction vehicle from a city agency cleared through the remains of the tents.

Advocates expected law enforcement officers to fan out across D.C. later Thursday to take down — or supervise the takedown of — any remaining homeless encampments.

For two days, small groups of federal officers have been visible in scattered parts of the city. But more were present in high-profile locations Wednesday night, and troops were expected to start doing more missions Thursday.

Agents from Homeland Security Investigations have patrolled the popular U Street corridor, while Drug Enforcement Administration officers were seen on the National Mall, with Guard members parked nearby. DEA agents also joined MPD officers on patrol in the Navy Yard neighborhood, while FBI agents stood along the heavily trafficked Massachusetts Avenue.

The ACLU filed a lawsuit alleging mistreatment against an immigrant in ICE custody at a Baker County facility in 2023.","The state will “soon” open another immigrant detention facility, this one at Baker Correctional Institution, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Thursday.

The governor made the announcement during a news conference outside the facility, which is listed as temporarily closed on the Florida Department of Corrections website.

The facility will be the second in the state, after the Everglades facility that opened in July.

Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie said the unit will accommodate 1,310 beds and hold up to 2,000 people in a temporary capacity.

“This is definitely the right decision to do. We are going to be able to fulfill, utilize these resources. The demand is there and our guys are ready, willing, and able to help our federal partners in this really, really important mission,” DeSantis said.

The correctional institute is situated about 50 miles north of Gainesville and 50 miles west of Jacksonville.

Guthrie said the facility will provide the same services offered at the Everglades detention facility, including three meals per day, pharmacy, access to recreation yards, legal and clergy services, laundry, and “everything that is required under federal or state law.”

The facility is 15 minutes away from the Lake City airport, which DeSantis said “is good, something that will make a difference.”

“This will be operational soon. It’s not going to take forever but we’re also not rushing to do it right this day. They’re doing what they need to do to get it done in all deliberate speed,” DeSantis said.

DeSantis said the projects, this one and the Everglades detention facility combined, will come under budget of what the federal government will reimburse.

The project will cost $6 million to build out, DeSantis said, and would have cost “a lot more” if done at Camp Blanding, the Florida National Guard base in Starke previously proposed as the next immigrant deportation facility in the state.

The Baker site was “very appealing” because it requires “a lot less in standing up than we would at Blanding and far less than we had to do at Alligator Alcatraz,” he said

The DeSantis administration has dubbed it “Deportation Depot,” taking on another alliterative name like the Everglades detention facility dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.”

The National Guard said it will activate 200 additional guardsmen this month at 10 Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities across Florida.

Guardsmen will “support emerging requirements here in Baker County and other locations across the state as directed by the governor,” Major General John D. Haas said.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida commented on the new project.

“DeSantis is pushing to open yet another inhumane immigration detention center — this one with capacity for 1,300 people — just miles from Baker County Detention Center, a facility infamous for human rights violations, sexual abuse, and repeated lawsuits,” the organization said in an email to the Florida Phoenix.

The ACLU filed a lawsuit alleging mistreatment against an immigrant in ICE custody at a Baker County facility in 2023.

“Floridians’ taxpayer dollars shouldn’t fund Trump’s overreaching and inhumane mass deportation agenda,” the ACLU said.

Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried reacted to the facility, and the financial implications of such facilities, Thursday in a news release.

“These inhumane facilities reward massive, taxpayer-funded no-bid contracts to politically connected businesses and corporate elite donors. DeSantis is funneling millions of tax dollars from the working and middle class to fill the pockets of the wealthy at the expense of immigrants who have come to our State seeking a better life for their families,” Fried said.

“Floridians want their tax dollars going toward real solutions like fixing the insurance crisis, expanding Medicaid, funding public schools, and building affordable housing, not lining the pockets of corporate donors getting rich off of detention camps.”

Democratic State Rep. Anna Eskamani suggested via social media that the second facility “is very likely motivated by the risk of the Everglades Immigration Detention Camp closing via court order.”

That facility has been subject of legal disputes for environmental impacts.

Go deeper: Trump wants to use traffic stops to target undocumented immigrants","D.C. police officers making traffic stops can now notify U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents about encounters with undocumented immigrants, per an order the police chief issued Thursday.

Why it matters: Days after President Trump took control of the city's police force, sanctuary protections are being rolled back in D.C.

The big picture: Trump praised the move Thursday, saying that a next step for nationwide immigration enforcement would be identifying undocumented immigrants during traffic stops.

""I think that's going to happen all over the country. We want to stop crime,"" Trump said during remarks in the Oval Office.

When asked by reporters, Trump did not say whether his administration pressured Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith to change D.C.'s policy.

State of play: Smith's order, first reported by NBC4, allows officers to share information with federal immigration agents about people ""not in custody (e.g., during traffic stops).""

MPD can also provide transportation for immigration agents or detainees.

Context: D.C.'s sanctuary city law — which has been under threat — prohibits local police from cooperating with ICE to detain undocumented immigrants.

Mayor Muriel Bowser moved to quietly repeal the law in May under a provision in the 2026 budget proposal.

The D.C. Council rejected the repeal in budget negotiations, and the law remains in effect.

Smith's order notes several sanctuary protections, emphasizing that MPD cannot:

Conduct immigration-status checks unless they're tied to a criminal investigation.

Arrest people solely on federal immigration warrants without a criminal charge.

Share personal, medical or criminal case data of those in MPD custody.

Permit federal questioning of people in MPD custody.

Hold someone past their release deadline at the request of immigration authorities.

What they're saying: Trump's border czar Tom Homan challenged D.C.'s status Wednesday on Fox News, saying that under federal control, D.C. will not be a sanctuary city.

""We're working with the police hand in hand, and when we encounter criminal illegal aliens, they'll be turned over to ICE,"" Homan said.

Bowser's office declined Axios' request for comment.

By the numbers: Dozens of immigration-related arrests have been made under Trump's emergency crackdown in the District, including 29 on Wednesday night, a White House official tells Axios.

Homeland Security and ICE agents set up a traffic stop on 14th Street near Columbia Heights on Wednesday evening, the Washington Post reports, which included more than 20 law enforcement officers.

An officer at the scene told onlookers that agents were screening for ""driving eligibility"" and ""status,"" according to the Post. Two people were detained.

Meanwhile, D.C. immigrant and civil rights advocates are sounding alarms over the checkpoints and traffic stops, which they say encourage racial profiling.

""One of the things we know from other parts of the country, especially the South, is that checkpoints and driving tickets are one of the main mechanisms by which people are detained,"" Amy Fischer of DC Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid Network tells Axios.

Fischer says they're also alarmed by reports of immigrant food delivery drivers being stopped and arrested on the job.

There's also growing concern that immigrants won't report crimes for fear of exposing themselves to ICE.

Fischer's organization, which provides legal and aid services to immigrants and operates an ICE hotline, is overwhelmed. ""The phone has been literally ringing off the hook,"" Fischer tells Axios.

They're tracking activity in Columbia Heights and Petworth — home to many immigrant communities — as well as checkpoints on New York Avenue and Benning Road Southeast.

But Fischer says hotline calls are coming in from every corner of the city. ""People are very scared.""

The annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, also known simply as the Human Rights Reports, were created by legislation passed in the 1970s. Since the first reports were published in 1977, they have anchored the United States’ efforts—imperfect yet enduring—to integrate human rights into its foreign policy. By methodically assessing countries around the world according to the standards set forth in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international agreements, and by improving gradually to capture emerging threats and incorporate more civil society perspectives, the reports came to be one of the world’s most widely trusted resources on human rights issues.

The Human Rights Reports are used in a variety of ways by a range of different consumers. They have shaped foreign and security assistance decisions by Congress, informed immigration cases and asylum adjudications, guided US diplomacy, and set global standards for the protection of human rights. They are said to be the most downloaded items on the State Department website.

What is different about the 2025 reports?

The latest reports, covering the 2024 calendar year, risk dramatically curtailing the credibility and legacy of this highly regarded endeavor. Critical sections are omitted, including but not limited to those on freedom of peaceful assembly and association, election abuses and irregularities, corruption in government, and protections for y and other vulnerable groups. This year’s reports also exclude sections related to prison conditions, the right to a fair trial, and retribution against human rights defenders—all at a time when the State Department estimates that there are more than one million political prisoners worldwide.

The country reports themselves are effectively cut by more than half in length, offering only isolated examples of human rights violations in each section, rather than the traditionally robust documentation of the year’s developments. This obscures trends and patterns of repeated abuses, making it easier for authoritarian regimes to evade accountability by claiming that the few cited violations are rare in practice or taken out of context.

The topical sections that remain have other problems. While reporting on transnational repression, for instance, is statutorily required by Congress and has therefore been nominally retained, some reports include unrelated information in this section, many lack specificity, and others omit notable incidents or phenomena from the year, such as physical attacks on Nicaraguan and Venezuelan exiles living in Costa Rica and Chile

Similarly, while the reports still cover freedom of expression online, the deletion of the sections on freedoms of peaceful assembly and association mean the loss of important information on other dimensions of internet freedom and human rights: Political dissidents, protest leaders, and civic activists often use digital tools to collaborate and organize, and repressive regimes consequently restrict and punish their online engagement. dynamics and their implications may now be less visible.

Negative consequences of diminished reporting

Many of the rights and freedoms that have been dropped from the new reports are explicitly recognized in the US constitution and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which the United States has ratified. Reducing the scope of these reports will damage the United States’ global and leadership on human rights, weaken a proven instrument for advancing freedom and democracy, and deprive policymakers, business leaders, advocates, historians, and the global public of essential context.

f the United States stops holding all countries to an established international standard through consistent, comprehensive documentation, it undermines the legitimacy of the international human rights framework and suggests that rights can be customized and deployed by each global power according to its own specific interests. It would become more difficult to argue that universal human rights are actually universal.

Suggesting that some rights are less important than others would certainly play into the hands of the United States’ authoritarian adversaries. The regime in Beijing, for example, routinely works to erode the legal and normative framework that protects fundamental freedoms around the world, particularly at the United Nations and other multilateral organizations, by promoting the primacy of economic development and social stability over civil liberties and political rights—most importantly the right to choose one’s own leaders through competitive elections.

Indeed, the State Department’s decision to eliminate coverage of electoral violations comes at an incredibly inopportune time. Voters in more than 60 countries went to the polls last year in what was hailed as a “global year of elections.” In 2025, there will be more than 100 elections in countries and territories around the world.

The many institutional consumers of the State Department’s reports will also suffer from their diminishment. US and international businesses have often used information contained in the reports to develop their risk assessments and related strategic decisions. Similarly, US and international government officials regularly relied on them to help inform policy decisions. In the last Congress, for example, senators and representatives cited the State Department reports in legislation 76 times. ly cited the Human Rights Reports during his time in the Senate, calling them a “crucial instrument in exposing human rights violations around the world.”

Such consumers will still be able to turn to an array of civil society analysis and documentation, but few nongovernmental organizations can match the steady congressional funding, the embassy resources, and the overall staffing that stood behind the State Department’s product. One of the reports’ great benefits was their compilation of evidence from a variety of civil society sources. Consumers will now have to do this work on their own, and there may be fewer sources available to them: Many of the organizations cited in the Human Rights Reports covering 2024 have dramatically scaled back their operations due to disruptions in their federal funding this year.

Remedies and resilience

We strongly urge Congress and the State Department to restore their tradition of robust and comprehensive human rights reports without delay. Consistent US leadership in this domain is simply irreplaceable. At the same time, the recent changes have underscored the urgent need for other democratic governments and private donors to step forward and reinforce the broader global infrastructure of human rights reporting, reducing its reliance on any single product or funder.

Continued access to accurate reporting will remain critical for years to come, not just for government officials, businesses, and academic researchers, but also for activists and dissidents seeking to exercise their fundamental rights and hold their governments accountable for violations when necessary.

will strive to maintain their own well-established records of human rights reporting. But when one is confronted with the threats, lies, propaganda, and censorship of brutal regimes like those in China, Russia, and Iran, there is no substitute for the power and authority of a major democracy that is willing to studiously document the facts on the ground and hold them up against widely recognized international standards. The United States, through its State Department reports, has long played this role.

WASHINGTON (AP) | The Trump administration on Aug. 14 released human rights reports for countries worldwide, which eliminate mentions of discrimination faced by LGBTQ people, reduce a previous focus on reproductive rights and criticize restrictions on political speech by U.S. allies in Europe that American officials believe target right-wing politicians.

The reports, which cover 2024 before President Donald Trump took office, reflect his administration’s focus on free speech and protecting the lives of the unborn. However, the reports also offer a glimpse into the administration’s view of dire human rights conditions in some countries that have agreed to accept migrants deported from the United States under Trump’s immigration crackdown.

“This year’s reports were streamlined for better utility and accessibility in the field and by partners,” the State Department said.

The congressionally mandated reports in the past have been frequently used for reference and cited by lawmakers, policymakers, academic researchers and others investigating potential asylum claims or looking into conditions in specific countries.

The reports were delayed by the Trump administration’s changes

The reports had been due to be released in March. The State Department said in an overview that the delay occurred because the Trump administration decided in March to “adjust” the reports, which had been compiled during the Biden administration. Among other deletions, the reports do not include accounts from individual abuse survivors or witnesses.

“Frequently, eyewitnesses are intimidated or prevented from reporting what they know,” the overview said. “On the other hand, individuals and groups opposed to a government may have incentive to exaggerate or fabricate abuses. In similar fashion, some governments may distort or exaggerate abuses attributed to opposition groups.”

Human rights groups decried the changes in focus and omissions of certain categories of discrimination and potential abuse.

“With the release of the U.S. State Department’s human rights report, it is clear that the Trump Administration has engaged in a very selective documentation of human rights abuses in certain countries,” Amnesty International said in a statement.

“In addition to eliminating entire sections for certain countries – for example discrimination against LGBTQ+ people – there are also arbitrary omissions within existing sections of the report based on the country,” it said.

The reports do follow previous practices in criticizing widespread human rights abuses in China, Iran, North Korea and Russia.

Laying out the poor human rights records of countries accepting migrant deportees

Although such deportations did not begin until after Trump took office, the reports, with one notable exception, detail general poor human rights conditions in many of the countries that have agreed to accept migrants, even if they are not citizens of that nation.

The exception is El Salvador, which was the first of several countries in Latin America and Africa to agree to accept non-citizen migrant deportees from the U.S. Despite claims from rights advocates to the contrary, the report about the country says “there were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses” in El Salvador in 2024 and that “the government took credible steps to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses.”

Human rights groups have accused authorities of abuses, including at a notorious prison where many migrants are sent.

However, for Eswatini — a small country in Africa formerly known as Swaziland — South Sudan and Rwanda, the reports paint a grimmer picture. All have agreed to accept third-country deportees from the United States.

In all three countries, the reports noted “significant human rights issues included credible reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings, torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment … serious restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom, prohibiting independent trade unions or significant or systematic restrictions on workers’ freedom of association.”

Those governments “did not take credible steps or action to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses,” the reports said.

Singling out the treatment of white South Africans

South Africa was also singled out for its human rights situation “significantly worsening.” The report pointed to unfair treatment of white Afrikaners following the signing of major land reforms that the Trump administration has said discriminate against that minority, which ran the country’s apartheid government.

That system brutally enforced racial segregation, which oppressed the Black majority, for 50 years before ending in 1994.

With the signing of that law in December, the report said that “South Africa took a substantially worrying step towards land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.”

It also said the government “did not take credible steps to investigate, prosecute and punish officials who committed human rights abuses, including inflammatory racial rhetoric against Afrikaners and other racial minorities, or violence against racial minorities.”

This year, the administration admitted as refugees some groups of white Afrikaners.

Accusations of European allies restricting right-wing speech

The reports take issue with what the Trump administration believes are restrictions on free speech imposed against generally right-wing voices in the United Kingdom, France and Germany. The reports use identical language to say that human rights conditions in each of the three NATO allies “worsened during the year.”

The executive summaries for each of the three reports say “significant human rights issues included credible reports of serious restrictions on freedom of expression, including enforcement of or threat of criminal or civil laws in order to limit expression; and crimes, violence, or threats of violence motivated by antisemitism.”

These governments have rejected such assertions that have been made by senior U.S. officials, including Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

Targeting Brazil over allegations of restricting Bolsonaro’s speech

Similar freedom-of-speech issues were raised in Brazil, which has more recently provoked Trump’s ire by prosecuting his ally — former right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro — and led to the imposition of massive U.S. tariffs and sanctions against Brazil’s Supreme Court chief justice.

Noem in a press conference in Los Angeles earlier this year claimed that the Trump administration was attempting to “liberate” the city from Newsom’s and Mayor Karen Bass’s leadership.","Masked and armed federal agents made arrests outside of a Los Angeles museum in which Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) Thursday was announcing plans to redraw the state’s congressional map to offset the GOP’s redistricting efforts in Texas.

The aggressive police operation directly outside the press conference appeared to be an attempt at intimidation, the governor’s office said.

“Where are we? At the Democracy Center,” Newsom said, referring to the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles. “And right outside, at this exact moment, are dozens and dozens of ICE agents.”

“You think it’s coincidental?” Newsom asked. “Donald Trump and his minions decided, coincidentally or not, that this was a location to advance ICE arrests.”

“Wake up, America,” the governor said. “This is a serious moment.”

Video of the raid showed dozens of Border Patrol agents wearing body armor and masks outside the museum. Some were armed with long rifles and handguns.

Gregory Bovino, U.S. Border Patrol El Centro sector chief, claimed the agents were conducting the operation because unnamed “politicians” failed to make the city safe.

“We’re here making Los Angeles a safer place. Since we don’t have politicians that will do that, we’ll do that ourselves,” Bovino said.

Bovino has a history of criticizing California’s elected officials despite being a law enforcement agent.

In a trial over President Donald Trump’s use of the military in Los Angeles, an Army major general revealed earlier this week that Bovino questioned his loyalty to the country after the commander objected to a request for military assistance for an immigration raid on a public park.

On Fox News Thursday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem claimed that the operation was planned in advance and that federal law enforcement agencies had information that “illegal criminals” would be in the area.

Noem in a press conference in Los Angeles earlier this year claimed that the Trump administration was attempting to “liberate” the city from Newsom’s and Mayor Karen Bass’s leadership.

“We are not going away,” Noem said. “We are staying here to liberate the city from socialist and the burdensome leadership that this governor and that this mayor have placed on this country and what they have tried to insert into the city.”

During that same press conference, federal agents arrested Sen. Alex Padilla, one of the state’s Democratic U.S. senators, after he attempted to ask Noem a question.

In a follow-up press conference Thursday, Newsom said the immigration operation was “pretty sick and pathetic” and was indicative of “the authoritarian tendencies of the president.”

“As I said a moment ago, wake up, America. You will not have a country if he rigs this election,” Newsom said, referring to the 2026 midterms.

American Oversight’s FOIA requests seek records detailing the number of people detained at these facilities, policies and practices governing detention conditions, and inspection reports.
“ICE detention facilities are notorious for secrecy, but when people’s rights, safety, and freedom are at stake, the public deserves timely transparency,” said Chioma Chukwu, Executive Director of American Oversight.
Those records, as well as others responsive to American Oversight’s request, could be highly relevant to pending motions for preliminary relief in both Barco Mercado and Neguse v. ICE.
American Oversight’s appeal argues that expedited processing is necessary both because there is an urgency to inform the public, and because the government’s own actions have affected the public’s confidence about its treatment of detainees at ICE detention facilities.","Today, American Oversight filed an administrative appeal challenging the Department of Homeland Security’s refusal to expedite the release of records sought under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) concerning Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) detention facilities in New York City, including the field office at 26 Federal Plaza.

The appeal follows a federal judge’s order on Tuesday blocking the Trump administration from using 26 Federal Plaza to hold immigrants facing deportation, after a lawyer for the administration conceded in a separate lawsuit that those detained by ICE at the facility lacked basic services — including sleeping mats, in-person legal visits, medication, and more than two meals per day.

American Oversight’s FOIA requests seek records detailing the number of people detained at these facilities, policies and practices governing detention conditions, and inspection reports. The requested records are of urgent public concern: there has been significant national media and congressional interest about this issue, and the records could help answer questions that have arisen in multiple ongoing federal lawsuits, including a suit brought by twelve members of Congress blocked from conducting lawful oversight of federal immigration detention facilities.

“ICE detention facilities are notorious for secrecy, but when people’s rights, safety, and freedom are at stake, the public deserves timely transparency,” said Chioma Chukwu, Executive Director of American Oversight. “Despite the Trump administration’s own admission that conditions in these facilities are deplorable, ICE has flat-out refused to acknowledge the public’s pressing need to know — a choice that speaks volumes about their willful disregard for transparency. This isn’t an inability to recognize the human cost of their policies; it’s a deliberate rejection of it, paired with a calculated effort to obscure the truth. By slow-walking the release of these records, the government is not only keeping the public in the dark — it’s depriving courts and Congress of information that could shape urgent decisions.”

In Barco Mercado v. Noem, a federal district court in New York City directly asked government counsel about the existence of records that American Oversight’s FOIA request seeks — records that the government admitted exist, and that it has custody of. Those records, as well as others responsive to American Oversight’s request, could be highly relevant to pending motions for preliminary relief in both Barco Mercado and Neguse v. ICE.

Under the government’s standard FOIA timelines, the public may not see these records until long after the courts rule in these high-profile cases. American Oversight’s appeal argues that expedited processing is necessary both because there is an urgency to inform the public, and because the government’s own actions have affected the public’s confidence about its treatment of detainees at ICE detention facilities. Should expedited processing be granted, it will allow the public, Congress, and the courts to evaluate ICE’s actions — and not be forced to rely on the agency’s public statements.",https://americanoversight.org/wp-content/uploads/Untitled-design-3-3.png,N,,2025-08-14 17:57:01.470194

Access to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities is restricted, internal oversight agencies have been hollowed out, and credible information about conditions inside is scarce. Yet reports that have emerged, some from those who have recently been deported, tell a troubling story echoing the darkest moments of recent U.S. immigration history.

In late July and early August, researchers from WOLA and the Women’s Refugee Commission (WRC) set out to pierce this “black box” by visiting cities in Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico that are key deportation hubs. There, they interviewed deported migrants, service providers, advocates, experts, and government officials to learn what they are hearing about conditions in U.S. detention.

The findings are disturbing. They point to a resurgence of family separations, cruel treatment, miserable, unhealthy conditions, and deportation processes that violate migrants’ rights and dignity. With transparency mechanisms dismantled, these abuses are happening out of public view.

In this episode, host Adam Isacson talks with two colleagues from WRC with whom he traveled:

Zain Lakhani, WRC’s director of Migrant Rights and Justice.

Diana Flórez, a consultant to WRC, an attorney and expert on gender, transitional justice, development, and peacebuilding.

During their travels, Isacson, Lakhani, and Flórez shared photos and initial findings in four “dispatches” published to our organizations’ websites, from Honduras, Guatemala, Tapachula, and Ciudad Juárez.

We heard consistent accounts of:

Family separations: A larger number than expected of parents deported without U.S. citizen children, often without being given the choice of being removed with them. The crisis is approaching the scale of the “zero tolerance” family separations that shocked the nation in 2018.

Inhumane conditions: Overcrowded cells, lack of medical care, and verbal and physical abuse by guards.

Threats to the health of pregnant and lactating women and their children: Insufficient and poor-quality food, difficulty in obtaining medical attention, and even being forced to sleep on floors. (The podcast refers to a July 30 report on abuse in detention, especially of pregnant women and children, by the office of Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Georgia).)

Targeting of vulnerable populations: Harassment of LGBTQ+ individuals, especially trans individuals who are now detained with the gender to which they were assigned at birth.

As Lakhani notes, “Historically… we were able to enter detention centers and visit them and speak with migrants,” but “now we’re seeing the deliberate creation of a black box.”

We hope that the WOLA–WRC delegation’s findings will guide future, more intensive on-the-ground research enabling advocates to refer egregious abuses requiring legal action, build a rigorous archive of known cases, and inform public opinion and policymakers.",https://www.wola.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_6831.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 15:57:16.014591

Ciaramella, Joe Lancaster, Emma Camp, Jack Nicastro, Veronique de Rugy, Robby Soave",,,,,https://reason.com/2025/08/13/cbp-is-deporting-cruise-ship-crew-over-child-pornography-allegations-without-evidence/,"While CBP has arrested and charged several cruise ship employees for child pornography in targeted operations earlier this year and last year, advocates say these cases in recent months have been different.
For Maria, being a room attendant on a cruise ship was a perfect job.
Marcelo Morales, one of those former crew members, told the Business Mirror that CBP agents boarded the Sunshine on May 30.
Morales was one of nine crew members arrested, held in detention, and then put on a flight back to Manila.
Victory Cruise Lines did not respond to a request for comment.","When Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents marched the housekeeper down the gangplank of the Victory I cruise ship in the Port of Detroit on the morning of July 11, she didn't know what was wrong, but she was confident it would get sorted out.

The crew member, originally from South America, had worked for 20 years on smaller cruise ships plying the Great Lakes. She split her time between her home country, where her family still lives, and the Great Lakes region, where she had a job she loved and a partner. She says that over the years, her respect for America and its dedication to the rule of law had grown.

It wasn't until a CBP agent told her to put her hands behind her back and she felt the cuffs click around her wrists that a horrible feeling washed over her, and she realized she may have been mistaken about something very, very important.

""When I was handcuffed, all that respect that had been building up for 20 years disappeared,"" says the former crew member, who requested anonymity.

Why the woman—whom Reason is calling ""Maria"" to protect her privacy—was being arrested would shock her even more when she eventually found out.

Maria is one of more than an estimated 100 cruise ship crew members who have been summarily deported and had their work visas revoked in recent months based on unsubstantiated allegations by CBP agents of possessing or viewing child pornography.

According to interviews, advocacy groups, and other news reports, CBP agents are boarding cruise ships with a list of targets and seizing their cell phones, laptops, and electronics. The crew members are handcuffed and detained. CBP agents then accuse them of having viewed or posted child pornography and pressure them to sign an admission, which includes a voluntary revocation of their C1/D visa (a joint crewmember and transit visa). The detainees are not shown the evidence against them or allowed legal representation.

The removals—which have occurred at ports in the Great Lakes region, Norfolk, Virginia, and Florida—have attracted limited outside attention, but they have caused fear and confusion in the cruise ship industry, which heavily relies on international crews.

One of the countries that supplies the most sailors to the cruise industry is the Philippines. It's unknown how many seafarers have been deported off cruise ships in recent months, but two Filipino advocacy groups, the National Federation of Filipino American Associations (NaFFAA) and the Pilipino Workers Center (PWC), say more than 100 Filipino sailors have been arrested, deported, and had their work visas revoked since June.

While CBP has arrested and charged several cruise ship employees for child pornography in targeted operations earlier this year and last year, advocates say these cases in recent months have been different.

""There's no evidence. There's no charges being filed. There's no convictions,"" says PWC executive director Aquilina Soriano Versoza. ""And then they're just having their visas revoked.""

NaFFAA National President Ryan Namata said in a press release that the organization is ""concerned by recent reports of Filipino seafarers being deported without clear explanation.""

""While we recognize the importance of upholding immigration laws, it is equally important to ensure that every individual is treated with dignity and in accordance with due process,"" Namata continued.

The NaFAA and PWC have demanded clarification and transparency from federal authorities, and the office of Rep. Bobby Scott (D–Va.) also launched an investigation. However, the CBP has refused to release any more details.

""CBP is involved in an ongoing operation,"" a CBP spokesperson said in response to a request for comment. ""Due to the nature of this operation, we are unable to provide further details at this time.""

A summary arrest, detention, and deportation under an accusation of possessing or viewing child pornography carries significant due process concerns, and also a devastating financial and reputational impact. A person whose C1/D crewmember visa is revoked cannot reapply for another one for 10 years.

""For these people who have worked as crew, and see that as their livelihood and their way of supporting their families, that's the kiss of death in that profession,"" says one individual in the cruise industry.

For Maria, being a room attendant on a cruise ship was a perfect job. ""I love that job,"" she says. ""My passion is to help others, to serve."" She says she turned down opportunities to move to a supervisor position because she liked it so much.

On the morning of July 11, she says she was bringing two carafes to a guest room when she was approached by CBP officers. Once they confirmed her identity, the officers took her phone and other electronics and put them in plastic evidence bags.

After she was marched off the ship and handcuffed, Maria was taken to a temporary detention area with seven other Victory I crew members, all of the rest of them Filipino. She says none of them had been told why they had been arrested.

Then, one by one, they were called into a room where a CBP officer interrogated them. Maria says the officer accused her of posting a photo on her Facebook page in 2018 of an 11-year-old boy with his penis exposed.

""How come I would post something like that when I have two daughters?"" Maria says she asked the CBP agent.

And if she had posted such a photo, she wondered, why had she been repeatedly allowed in and out of the country in the years since? She also says she demanded to see the post in question, but the officer refused.

""He said, 'You don't have rights, and I don't need to explain it to you,'"" Maria recalls.

Soriano Versoza says the details are ""very consistent"" across the cases of Filipino sailors that the PWC has talked to.

""They're all individually being interrogated, and they're being accused of having watched or possessed child pornography. They will open up their phones, and CBP will go through all of their phones and not find anything. [CBP] might tell them, 'Oh, well we have evidence here that back in 2008 there was something,'"" she says.

That evidence is never shown to the accused, but CBP officers then attempt to get detainees to sign admissions and other documents.

The Business Mirror, a news outlet in the Philippines, reported in July on the removal and deportation of Filipino seafarers from the Carnival Sunshine cruise ship at the Port of Norfolk, Virginia.

Marcelo Morales, one of those former crew members, told the Business Mirror that CBP agents boarded the Sunshine on May 30.

""They confiscated my cellphone and checked everything thoroughly,"" Morales said. ""After the official search, they asked if I had viewed child pornography. I denied the accusation, and after they found nothing, I was cleared and allowed to return to the vessel—no charges, no citation, not even a warning.""

But CBP officers boarded the ship again in Norfolk on June 28, accused Morales of watching child sexual abuse material, and placed him under arrest.

""No new evidence was shown. They didn't search my phone again—they just placed it in a small transparent envelope and took me,"" he said.

Morales was one of nine crew members arrested, held in detention, and then put on a flight back to Manila. The Business Mirror reported that 18 Filipino seafarers were deported from the Carnival Sunshine between February and the end of July.

""We were treated like criminals. We were not fed, we had no water. We are crying. We want justice for what was done to us,"" Morales said.

Back in detention at the Port of Detroit, Maria refused to sign anything. She was returned to the main holding area, where she says agents took her fingerprints and collected a mouth swab from her, likely for a DNA sample.

In the middle of the night, she says the seven other Filipino crew members who'd been detained with her were handcuffed and driven to the airport to be flown out of the country.

""I cry. I cry,"" Maria says. ""My colleagues tell me, 'Momma, be strong. We love you.' When I saw them be moved out of the detention place, it was the hardest thing. Just like I was innocent, they were innocent. We came with valid visas, medical, everything valid.""

The next morning, Maria was driven to the Detroit airport and marched in handcuffs through a terminal of passengers to a flight back to her home country.

""When I was going to this security place with the handcuffs and chain on my belly, it was the worst thing,"" Maria says.

Maria and the other deported seafarers represented more than 10 percent of the Victory I's overall crew. It seems statistically unlikely that so many of the Victory I's crew, all of whom were vetted by their respective governments and the U.S. government before being issued crewmember visas, were consumers of child pornography.

In addition to the 18 crew members of the Carnival Sunshine, the PWC and NaFFAA say as many as 80 Filipino crewmembers from Carnival's Mardi Gras and Vista cruise liners were deported in April and May.

In the Great Lakes, media outlets reported that 13 crew members were removed and deported from the Victory I and Victory II in July, along with 16 crew members from the Viking Octantis and Viking Polaris, and an unknown number from Pearl Seas Cruises.

Soriano Versoza notes that, even though international crew members don't live in the U.S.—and usually remain aboard the ship in U.S. ports—their removals will still count toward CBP's overall number of deportations.

""We really think that this is a part of the current administration trying to boost up its numbers of deportations as it's already claimed that it's trying to reach these 3,000-a-day quotas,"" she says.

While it may be an easy way to juice the agency's deportation numbers, the removals and visa revocations are destroying the livelihoods of former crew members.

Soriano Versoza says that once seafarers arrive back in the Philippines, they're finding out that, in addition to being banned from desirable U.S. cruise routes, they're blacklisted altogether by the agencies that hire sailors for major cruise companies.

""There are a few where they're being placed, having some options of just Asia routes,"" Soriano Versoza says. ""But overwhelmingly, the workers that we've been talking to, the majority of the cruise ships like Royal Caribbean and Carnival are just not rehiring them at all.""

To add insult to injury, Maria says that when she received her final paycheck, it was docked $450 for the cost of her repatriation flight.

""I always have a big respect for the U.S., but I'm hurt,"" she says. ""I'm hurt from the way things are going on, for innocent people, working, giving their life, apart from their family.""

Maria says she's been overwhelmed with how to begin rebuilding her life with such an awful accusation hanging over her head.

""I don't sit with my kids and explain, because I can't look in their faces, and I feel ashamed,"" she says. ""Mentally, I feel destroyed. I don't want to do nothing. I passed into the worst time in my life.""

She credits her faith in God for giving her the strength to carry on. ""I'm holding onto Him,"" she says. ""That's why I'm still alive.""

Ricci Levy, the president and CEO of the Woodhull Freedom Foundation, a group that advocates for sexual freedom, says that what's happening to Maria and other crew members is ""a fundamental violation of due process and human rights.""

""They are being accused of one of the most stigmatizing crimes imaginable without being shown evidence, given legal counsel, or afforded a fair hearing,"" Levy says. ""These summary deportations and visa revocations not only destroy livelihoods—they weaponize accusation as punishment.""

Victory Cruise Lines did not respond to a request for comment. However, in a statement to other media outlets reporting on the raids, John Waggoner, the founder and chairman of Victory, said: ""We are actively cooperating with federal authorities to clarify the circumstances, and my priority is always our crew and the experience for our guests. We wish to thank federal, state and local representatives across the Great Lakes for their prompt and continued attention to this matter.""

Carnival, Viking, and Celebrity cruise lines did not respond to requests for comment.

In a press release, Scott said his office is investigating. ""Our nation was founded on the fundamental principles of due process,"" Scott said. ""Under our Constitution, everyone is entitled to due process regardless of citizenship or immigration status.""

The removals have also caught the attention of members of Congress in the Great Lakes.",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/08/cbp-cruise-ships.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 16:56:33.406215

Javier Diaz Santana, a deaf and mute DACA recipient, was detained during a raid at his work site.
Right now, we don’t have clarity on why certain DACA recipients are being targeted for detention.
We cannot keep treating DACA recipients like a temporary problem to be managed every few years.
And DACA recipients deserve to wake up without wondering if today is the day it all disappears.","Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin recently told NBC News that “DACA does not confer any form of legal status in this country.” Then she went further: any DACA recipient may be detained and deported, and urged them to self-deport.

DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, is a U.S. immigration policy designed to provide work authorization and temporary protection from deportation for undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children. DACA is not a permanent legal status but rather an exercise of prosecutorial discretion that the US government — across both political parties — has supported for decades to protect many young immigrants from detention and deportation.

Every day, there is a new immigration headline. A new rumor to chase down. A new rule to memorize before it changes again. It’s relentless. It’s exhausting. And the instability is by design. For some, these headlines are just noise. For DACA recipients, they’re a nightmare realized. On the ground, words echoed by administration officials are already affecting communities — showing up in arrests at airports, workplaces, and outside corner stores.

DACA recipient Catalina “Xochitl” Santiago was detained while boarding a flight for a work trip out of El Paso, Texas. Her arrest came without a warrant, and Santiago has now been transferred to a federal immigration processing center, where her status in the country remains uncertain.

Javier Diaz Santana, a deaf and mute DACA recipient, was detained during a raid at his work site. When he tried to identify himself, officers confiscated the tools he relied on to communicate. Javier spent nearly a month in an immigration detention center in El Paso, cut off from his attorney and family. To add insult to injury, Javier was given paperwork in Spanish— a language he cannot read.

Jose Valdovinos was detained outside a Circle K, while in the passenger seat of a vehicle driven by his wife. When his wife asked why Jose was being detained, officers told her, “DACA is no longer considered a legal status in the U.S.” She reminded them that he had a work permit and was employed. “It doesn’t matter,” the agents said, before opening the car door and taking him away.

Right now, we don’t have clarity on why certain DACA recipients are being targeted for detention. We don’t know if these detentions are isolated, the start of a broader shift, or simply the result of mixed messages filtering down to local enforcement. What we do know is that the gap between what’s on paper and what’s happening in real life is widening — and DACA recipients are the ones paying the price.

It’s terrifying. And even though I am no longer a DACA recipient, the fear still hits me like a punch to the chest. There’s no way to rewire my brain away from those fears. If I’m scared, I can’t imagine how my friends, my family, and my community who are still part of the policy feel.

I know the quiet dread that seeps into every milestone. The way you learn to celebrate with one eye on the clock, waiting for it to run out. The fear doesn’t start with the policy memo — it starts the moment someone in power says something reckless into a microphone, knowing the ripple will reach long before the law ever does.

When I was a kid in my immigrant household, I was the one expected to have the answers. Multilingualism became my bridge — first for my parents, then my extended family, then my friends, and eventually my community. I was the one who knew how to fill out the forms, call the offices, and explain the rules. Even now, my inbox is full of messages from people asking, “What’s going to happen to us?” And for the first time in years, around the current news on DACA, I can’t give them an honest answer.

For Xochitl, Javier, and Jose, the promises made to them were never built to last; DACA was never meant to be permanent, but it allowed people temporary protections until a more permanent pathway could be created. It gave people enough stability to plant roots, raise families, and contribute openly without looking over their shoulders every second. When you’ve built your life from table scraps, you learn how to stretch them into meals; now, even those scraps feel like they’re slipping away.

I survived that uncertainty. I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. And right now — as the courts stall, Congress hides behind gridlock, and the Trump administration sends mixed signals — people’s lives are hanging in the balance. In a country where free speech can be weaponized against entire communities, no one should be surprised that enforcement is expanding to those with “protections.”

Permanent protections aren’t optional anymore. They are the only way to end this cycle of fear and uncertainty. Every day without them is another day where someone risks losing their job, their home, or their freedom. We cannot keep treating DACA recipients like a temporary problem to be managed every few years. That’s not just bad policy; it’s cruel.

People deserve more than this fog. Immigrants deserve clarity. And DACA recipients deserve to wake up without wondering if today is the day it all disappears.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/immigration-impact-daca-anxiety.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 13:57:19.134448

The claim, the Department of Homeland Security said, is based on a report from the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), which describes itself as a “low immigration” advocate.
“If this is the case, then our estimate of illegal immigrants based on the survey may be overstating the decline in their actual numbers.
Further, our estimate of legal immigrants based on administrative data through July of 2025 is incomplete, further increasing uncertainty of our estimate of illegal immigrants.
The 1.6 million estimate from CIS would also represent a sharp jump from the Department of Homeland Security’s previously released figures, as it has touted both deportations and voluntary departures.","Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said Thursday that the U.S. now has 1.6 million fewer illegal immigrants since the start of the Trump administration – a claim based on information from a restrictionist immigration group that said their own estimate may be overstated.

“In less than 200 days, 1.6 MILLION illegal immigrants have left the United States population. This is massive. This means safer streets, taxpayer savings, pressure off of schools and hospital services and better job opportunities for Americans,” Noem wrote in a social media post thanking President Trump.

The claim, the Department of Homeland Security said, is based on a report from the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), which describes itself as a “low immigration” advocate.

CIS identified several “caveats” to its estimate, which it said is based on immigrants’ willingness to respond to the Current Population Survey (CPS) crafted by the Census Bureau and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which CIS said “does not specifically identify illegal immigrants.”

“Given the recent stepped-up enforcement efforts, it is possible that immigrants have become more reluctant to respond to the CPS,” the report states.

“If this is the case, then our estimate of illegal immigrants based on the survey may be overstating the decline in their actual numbers. Further, our estimate of legal immigrants based on administrative data through July of 2025 is incomplete, further increasing uncertainty of our estimate of illegal immigrants. All this should be kept in mind when interpreting the figures presented here.”

Estimates of the number of people unlawfully living in the U.S. typically hover around 13 million.

The 1.6 million estimate from CIS would also represent a sharp jump from the Department of Homeland Security’s previously released figures, as it has touted both deportations and voluntary departures.

The Trump administration said in April that it had deported 135,000 people, but that figure has also come under scrutiny, with the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) saying the figures were “gross exaggerations” and that deportation figures at the time were actually around 72,000.

TRAC also said immigration judges this year have ordered just more than 360,000 people to be deported, though it’s unclear when those removals will be carried out.

The Trump administration has also started new programs encouraging immigrants to leave the country, offering a $1,000 stipend to those who register to leave through the CBP Home App, a redesign of an app started under former President Biden allowing migrants to request an appointment to seek asylum.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/nomekristi_043025gn02_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-14 13:57:25.973938

But even if you are caught up at an ICE checkpoint or questioned by federal agents—or if you’re a bystander—you have rights.
Once you do, staying silent means you don’t need to discuss your immigration status.
Like the pedestrians who held up signs warning drivers of the upcoming ICE checkpoint, you’re allowed to alert people nearby about the presence of law enforcement, Hopkins says.","ICE agents were pulling over cars on 14th Street, Northwest, just north of the U Street corridor on Wednesday night, asking about immigration status and detaining at least two drivers. DC police officers on the scene said the checkpoint was focused on traffic safety and “status,” but ICE and Homeland Security Investigations agents wouldn’t say a word. Many covered their faces with neck gaiters.

The scene was shocking. Pedestrians at the busy intersection staged an impromptu protest, taunting agents, shouting “Go home fascists!” and making signs to warn drivers away. But amid the Trump administration’s ramping up of federal law enforcement presence in DC to fight a supposed crime crisis, this could become a regular occurrence for at least the next month.

Local police are subject to more accountability than federal forces if they violate the constitution. But even if you are caught up at an ICE checkpoint or questioned by federal agents—or if you’re a bystander—you have rights.

“We’re in this moment where it’s like uncharted waters,” says Monica Hopkins, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of DC. “But your rights are your rights regardless of your citizenship status.”

Whether you’re a citizen or not, you have the right to remain silent if you’re stopped by federal agents— but you must verbally invoke it. Once you do, staying silent means you don’t need to discuss your immigration status. You can ask “Am I free to leave?” and do so calmly if the answer is yes.

Anyone detained by DC police has the right to an attorney. With ICE, the government doesn’t need to provide you with a lawyer, but you do have the right to consult with one. If you’re pulled over, you may be required to show your license, registration, and proof of insurance. If you’re not a citizen, you must show your immigration papers to an agent on request if you have them. However, you can refuse a search of yourself or your vehicle if there is no judicial warrant.

For non-citizens already on ICE’s radar, options are slim. Genevieve Augustin, legal director at the DC immigrant resource center CARECEN, says people should cooperate by giving their names and IDs, but not passports. But she says ICE has access to biometric information and can establish probable cause for arrest in a number of ways, so what’s most important for undocumented people is to have a plan in case of detainment.

“We have to be realistic about this,” Augustin says. “Although they have rights, at the end of the day, if they’re on ICE’s radar, there’s a good chance it’ll end up in an arrest, especially outside of their home. Once that happens, fighting their cases from scratch from custody is going to be very difficult.”

If you’re a bystander and want to video an ICE interaction or voice your opposition, you have the right to do both— as long as you don’t interfere. Like the pedestrians who held up signs warning drivers of the upcoming ICE checkpoint, you’re allowed to alert people nearby about the presence of law enforcement, Hopkins says.

But active civil disobedience, like yelling at or standing in front of officers, can have consequences. The Justice Department employee who threw a Subway sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection officer this week was fired after he was charged with felony assault.

“You should invoke your rights, but with any sort of interaction, make sure to not escalate by getting into an argument,” Hopkins says. “The priority is: people should keep themselves safe, and complain later.”",https://www.washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ICE-agent-Evy-Mages.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 16:56:38.592543

It’s a great day to reaffirm the strong ties and bonds of cooperation, partnership, and alliance between the United States and the Government of Paraguay – the nation of Paraguay – that I visited as a Senator just a couple of months ago —

FOREIGN MINISTER RAMÍREZ: Yes, exactly.

SECRETARY RUBIO: — and we talked quite a bit and interact. And this is just another example of cooperation and the ability to work together to prevent something that we – both countries are very concerned about, and that is illegal and irregular migration, which poses a national security threat. And so the ability to work together on this in partnership is extraordinary. And I want to thank the foreign minister for being here today. I want to thank my friend, the President – (in Spanish) – I was going to say President Peña, who’s a great, strong partner and ally of the United States. And we’re very happy to be signing this here today along with our partners from the Department of Homeland Security.

(In Spanish.) Thank you for being here.

FOREIGN MINISTER RAMÍREZ: Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary Rubio. You are a very close friend of our government, of our country. You have been the only one after 50 years of Senator visiting Paraguay and that represents a very important alliance that we are developing.

Today this agreement represent our deep engagement with our government to work not only on migration program but also in security. We are working in trade. We are working on – as well as on investment. We are working in security cooperation, and that represent the (inaudible) agenda, the bilateral agenda. It means the diversify of the alliance that we have as Paraguay Government with the United States Government and personally with you, Secretary, is amazing to work and cooperate with all your staff here as well. Really is a pleasure to me. Thank you for hosting us for this meeting.

And the homeland security secretary, really, we appreciate very much this agreement that represent the opportunity to work in several issues. We were discussing about the visa waiver. We are discussing about our common and shared values and principles – democracy, freedom, human rights, the rule of law, that represent our principles and values shared. Thank you. Thank you so much.

SECRETARY RUBIO: Thank you.

DEPUTY SECRETARY EDGAR: Yeah. First of all, Minister Ramírez and Secretary Rubio, thank you so much for the diplomacy, being able to help us. The Secretary and myself have been very focused on establishing safe third country agreements within Latin America, South America, and even in Africa. So this has been a big step for us. We’re very appreciative of the opportunity to be able to work with you.

Like you said, we did talk a little bit kind of behind the scenes about the Visa Waiver Program and some of the different programs that are out there, where we work together. And we are very much appreciative of everything that Paraguay is doing. We look at Paraguay as a law enforcement and border security partner. You guys have been a great partner, and this is a great step.

The American asylum system is one that has been significantly abused in the previous administration. And being able to sign an agreement like this really starts to loosen the burden within Homeland Security and our ability to be able to process and provide the asylum process to people that are actually deserving of it and go through the process. So we just want to thank you for what you’re doing. We want to thank you for your partnership.

Secretary, we just think everything that you do and with your team – we’re always appreciative. Thank you.

QUESTION: (In Spanish.)

SECRETARY RUBIO: (In Spanish.)

QUESTION: (In Spanish.)

SECRETARY RUBIO: (In Spanish.)

The question, if I may in English, is just asking about whether U.S. forces will be involved in the Western Hemisphere and going after drug traffickers and drug trafficking networks. There are designated narco-terrorist groups operating in the region. Some of them utilizing international airspace, international waters to transit poison into the United States. And those groups will be confronted. The President has made that clear from the time he has operated.

In specific, the question was about the Cartel of the Suns, the Cartel de los Soles, which is a criminal organization that happens to masquerade as a government. The Maduro regime is not a government. It’s not a legitimate government. We’ve never recognized them as such. They are a criminal enterprise that basically has taken control of a national territory, of a country, and who by the way are also threatening U.S. oil companies that are operating lawfully in Guyana.

So the President has been very firm. Anything that’s a threat to the national security threat to the United States he’s going to confront. And – but obviously I have nothing further to add to that at this point. Thank you.

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, if I may.

SECRETARY RUBIO: Yes. One more.

QUESTION: How are the preparations for the Putin-Trump meeting going in Alaska?

SECRETARY RUBIO: They’re going very fast because this was put together very quickly and it’s in Alaska. So we’ve got to get there. We’ll see how tomorrow plays out. As the President said, his hope is to interact with Putin tomorrow and sort of get a sense very quickly and early whether a peace is possible or not.

The President has spoken to him, I believe, four times to him by phone and felt it was important to now speak to him in person and look him eye – in the eye and figure out what was possible and what isn’t. This is the President at peace. He wants that war to end. He’s going to do everything he possibly can. If he sees an opportunity to talk about achieving peace, he’s going to pursue it. And we’ll know tomorrow at some point – as the President said, probably very early in that meeting – whether something is possible or not. We hope it is.

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary —

QUESTION: (In Spanish.)

SECRETARY RUBIO: (In Spanish.)

QUESTION: (In Spanish.)

SECRETARY RUBIO: (In Spanish.) I’m sorry.

QUESTION: Secretary, do you think that the Ukrainians are prepared to cede any land (inaudible) control, or are we looking at more a return of potentially Russian forces from the current front line of the war?

SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, to achieve a peace, I think we all recognize that there’ll have to be some conversation about security guarantees. They’ll have to be some conversation about territorial disputes and claims and what they’re fighting over. All of these things will be part of a comprehensive thing. But I think the President’s hope is to achieve some stoppage of fighting so that those conversations can happen. These are highly technical things that take some time to work out.

So what – to have a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia, you will need agreement from both Ukraine and Russia. And this war has been going on for three and a half years now. It was a war that started under the previous administration. The President has inherited that, and he’s trying to do now what he can to bring it to an end. But obviously the longer these wars go on, the harder they are to end.

And even as I speak, even as we talk here now, there are changes happening in the battlefield which have an impact on what one sides views as leverage or the other. So that’s the reality of ongoing fighting, which is why a ceasefire is so critical. That’s been our proposal from Jeddah when we left in Saudi Arabia.

But we’ll see what’s possible tomorrow. Let’s see how the talks go. And we’re hopeful. We’re – we want there to be a peace. We’re going to do everything we can to achieve one, but ultimately it’ll be up to Ukraine and Russia to agree to one. Okay. Thank you, guys.",https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Seal_only-1.png,N,,2025-08-14 15:57:27.552326

They quoted James Madison — the fourth U.S. president and an author of the Federalist Papers — to make their point.
The brief was just the latest in a flurry of filings since the tug-of-war over the U.S. attorney position began earlier this summer.
President Donald Trump named Habba, his former personal attorney, to the job on March 24, but she wasn’t sworn in until March 28.
Under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, the first assistant can serve as acting U.S. attorney for 210 days.","A bipartisan group of Congress members has waded into the fight over whether Alina Habba should keep her job as New Jersey’s U.S. attorney, arguing that the Trump administration’s “machinations” to keep her in office violate a federal law meant to reinforce the separation of powers required by the Constitution.

The brief filed Wednesday by Democrat Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, four other House Democrats, and a former Republican congressman comes one day before a federal judge in Pennsylvania will hear arguments in a criminal defendant’s challenge of Habba’s authority.

Lawyers are expected to square off Friday in Williamsport before U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann over Irvington man Julien Giraud Jr.’s effort to disqualify Habba. Federal judges tried to end Habba’s turbulent tenure last month by appointing her top deputy as her successor, but the Trump administration fired that replacement and reinstalled Habba, setting the stage for Friday’s showdown in Pennsylvania.

In Wednesday’s brief, the Congress members said they aimed to inform Brann of Congress’s intent and authority in creating the statutory framework that governs the appointment of U.S. attorneys. Besides Pallone, the other politicians on the brief are Reps. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), Stephen Lynch (D-Massachusetts), Bennie Thompson (D-Mississippi), and Nydia Velázquez (D-New York), plus former Rep. Wayne Gilchrest, a Republican who represented Maryland for nine terms until 2009.

The six voted in favor of the Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act, a 2007 law that gives the Senate 120 days to approve a U.S. attorney appointed by the president or attorney general and allows federal judges to appoint someone if the clock runs out with no Senate action.

The law was meant to codify the checks and balances between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches that the Constitution’s appointments clause requires, the Congress members noted in the brief. They urged Brann “not to ratify the Administration’s attempt to sidestep the Appointments Clause with respect to Ms. Habba.”

Splitting the responsibility for appointments between the executive and legislative branches acts as a check on favoritism, prevents unfit people from being appointed, and ensures one branch doesn’t wield more power than another, they wrote. They quoted James Madison — the fourth U.S. president and an author of the Federalist Papers — to make their point.

“The founders believed that ‘the accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands … may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny,’” the brief reads.

The brief was just the latest in a flurry of filings since the tug-of-war over the U.S. attorney position began earlier this summer.

Brann, an Obama nominee, two weeks ago rejected Giraud’s motion to dismiss his case, even as he agreed to hear his arguments that Habba has no authority to prosecute him because her appointment was unconstitutional. Giraud was indicted in November 2024 for various drug and firearm offenses. A second man, Cesar Pina of Franklin Lakes, who is facing federal money laundering and bribery charges, is also challenging Habba’s appointment.

The Justice Department argued in a brief this week that Habba’s appointment is valid because her post was “indisputably vacant,” referring to the Trump administration’s hasty maneuvering to oust Desiree Leigh Grace — the first assistant U.S. attorney the judges picked — and restore Habba.

That maneuvering relied on widely disputed math.

President Donald Trump named Habba, his former personal attorney, to the job on March 24, but she wasn’t sworn in until March 28. That led to disagreement over when her 120 days in office were up.

The timing matters, because the judges named Grace to the post on July 22 — 120 days after March 24. But the Trump administration insists Habba’s 120 days weren’t up until July 26, and during those extra four days, administration officials fired Grace, Habba resigned, and Attorney General Pamela Bondi named Habba first assistant U.S. attorney. Under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, the first assistant can serve as acting U.S. attorney for 210 days. That maneuvering essentially restarted the clock for Habba’s time in the job.

Administration officials have denied critics’ complaints that such maneuvering was an unconstitutional “workaround.”

Habba has drawn widespread criticism during her stint in the job, most rooted in her prosecutions of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver, both Democrats whose arrests stemmed from their May visit to an immigrant jail in Newark. Her office has reportedly subpoenaed Gov. Phil Murphy, also a Democrat, over comments he made in February that suggested he might hide an undocumented immigrant in his home.

New Jersey’s senators, Cory Booker and Andy Kim, both Democrats, had objected to Habba taking the job permanently, accusing her of using the office to pursue “frivolous and politically motivated prosecutions.”",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/54346957863_f55aa9fa66_c.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 12:57:28.727180

During most of the first Trump administration, immigration to the U.S., both documented and undocumented, remained steady despite the visible increase in Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity.
Now, according to the courts, the Trump administration can define who it will deport, regardless of citizenship status.
Now the great question of the current Trump administration is the future of all immigration.
The more the Trump administration continues to slouch toward authoritarianism and disregard the Constitution, the less its citizens will have faith in its principles.","In 1876, France gifted the Statue of Liberty to the United States as a monument to republican liberty. Conceived by French abolitionist Édouard de Laboulaye and built by artist Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, the statue commemorated both America’s centennial and a century of Franco-American friendship.

Equally important to bringing the statue to the U.S. was building its pedestal. When Congress failed to pass appropriations to construct it, the newspaper publisher Joseph Pulitzer—himself a Hungarian-born immigrant—announced an auction to help raise funds for the $100,000 needed. Emma Lazarus, a poet and supporter of Jewish refugees, penned a sonnet for the fundraiser that included these now-familiar lines: “Give me your tired, your poor / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.”

Lazarus’s poem helped reconfigure the symbolism of the Statue of Liberty into a beacon for immigrants. Since it was erected in New York Harbor in 1886, the statue has been recognized as an icon of our country’s status as a haven for refugees.

But what it means to be an immigrant in the United States is changing rapidly. For a century and a half, America offered a “golden door” to refugees who sought to escape poverty, war, famine, and political unrest; a promised haven to find a peaceful life. When historian Oscar Handlin wrote the 1951 book The Uprooted, which redefined immigration history, he began it by telling readers, “Once I thought to write a history of the immigrants in America. Then I discovered that the immigrants were American history.”

Today, it seems the term immigrant is now more a pejorative than a compliment. To be a noncitizen at any point means facing the risk of detention and deportation. To be among those tired, poor, huddled masses today means being the first target in a new deportation regime engineered by the Trump administration to strike fear.

Seven months into the second Trump administration, we have observed a new deportation regime that is designed to expel as many noncitizens as possible and erode civil liberties. While it still lags behind the average number of deportations of the Obama administration, the use of fear by Trump, along with a total disregard for the rule of law, has resulted in a new immigration policy centered on expulsion.

The question that Americans need to ask themselves is what immigration will look like after the Trump administration. If Handlin once described the immigrant as the cornerstone of “American history,” what will be immigrants’ future in a xenophobic America?

To read Handlin’s study is to engage with a work that was far from perfect; much of The Uprooting concentrated on European immigrants and promoted an assimilationist view of immigrants erasing their roots in favor of adapting to American culture. But it sparked a rethinking of the relationship between the United States and its immigrant past. Handlin also represented a generation of scholars who informed federal policy; he lobbied extensively for the passage of the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965, which ended the outdated national quota system and eliminated all geographic immigration bans. In the context of the Civil Rights Movement, the act represented to policymakers a new era of immigration that welcomed all.

Since The Uprooting, scores of historians have filled the gaps in the literature of immigration from other parts of the world. Ronald Takaki’s 1989 book, Strangers From a Different Shore, reminded readers that another ocean—the Pacific—was a major conduit for immigrants from Asia. George Sánchez’s 1993 tome Becoming Mexican American offered one of the most comprehensive studies on Latin American history and inspired a generation of scholarship.

But the story of immigration came coupled with a long history of immigration control. Alongside the hundreds of ethnographies on immigrant communities, there are hundreds of studies on how the federal government decided who to welcome into the United States. Until 1882, the concept of federal immigration exclusion was absent. Mae Ngai was among the first to provide a long study of the federal government’s expansion of immigration control and the criminalization of immigrants, in her 2004 book Impossible Subjects. Beth Lew-Williams’s The Chinese Must Go captured the early history of the anti-Chinese movement in the West, which led to the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 that established the idea of immigration control. Kelly Lytle Hernandez’s comprehensive study on the history of the Border Patrol, Migra!, offered an authoritative report for the origins of the exclusion system we live with today. Even though the methods of immigration control have changed, the causes remain largely the same—xenophobia driven by economic strife and corporate greed.

Immigration control, although over a century old, has grown dramatically in recent years. Under the current Trump administration, however, the unprecedented expansion of policing and use of fear to enforce deportations have split the country in dramatic ways.

Americans today are more concerned about immigration than in recent years. The 2024 election put xenophobia as a central topic of the campaign. A Gallup poll from July 2024 found that 55 percent of Americans wanted less immigration to the U.S.—the highest it has been since 2001, when xenophobia swept the nation in the wake of 9/11.

But how much has immigration actually changed? During most of the first Trump administration, immigration to the U.S., both documented and undocumented, remained steady despite the visible increase in Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity. The Migration Policy Institute found that, despite the increase in ICE raids, legal migration to the United States only dipped slightly during that time. During the Covid-19 pandemic, world migration, including that to the United States, dropped drastically.

The recent rise in xenophobia can be traced to rhetoric around increasing immigration during the Biden administration. Although Biden retained several Trump-era immigration policies, such as keeping Title 42 until 2023, and issued 605 executive orders related to immigration—more than the 472 during Trump’s first term—conservatives regularly slammed the Biden administration as ineffective. Even though studies showed that undocumented immigration declined throughout 2024—long before the election—Trump’s use of misinformation during the campaign portrayed the Biden administration as ineffective in dealing with immigration.

Although experts regularly note that immigrants have a positive effect on the overall economy, immigration again emerged as the scapegoat for the inflation that occurred during the Biden administration. Indeed, the Migration Policy Institute found in their study of immigration and the 2024 election that Trump’s statements on immigration mimicked the anti-immigrant backlash of the 1920s that led to the passage of the 1924 Immigration Act.

The anti-immigrant sentiment of today, just as in the 1920s, specifically targets immigrants of color. Historically, the demonization of immigrants—notably Chinese, Japanese, and Mexican Americans—has been used as a tactic to strike fear into white voters.

Yet it is also thanks to these immigrants, such as Wong Kim Ark, the plaintiff in the 1898 Supreme Court case United States v. Wong Kim Ark, that the definition of birthright citizenship is enshrined in our legal system to benefit all Americans.

Anti-immigrant rhetoric promoted by Trump and Stephen Miller is not only appearing in political discourse but is also embedded in today’s culture. To offer a comparison from history, we can see F. Scott Fitzgerald’s classic novel The Great Gatsby, published the year after the landmark 1924 Immigration Act. You can find the xenophobia of the period represented in the character of Tom Buchanan, who regularly repeats lines from the work of Lothrop Stoddard (he misremembers his name as “Goddard”), and who quotes Stoddard’s most infamous text, the 1920 volume The Rising Tide of Color. In it, Stoddard prophesized the end of white supremacy because of the rise of nations of color and called upon the U.S. to ban immigrants and maintain racial segregation.

The text influenced the 1924 Immigration Act, which banned immigration from outside of Europe and placed harsh limits on non-Nordic European immigrants, and became a staple of white supremacist literature. Trump’s past remarks on the negative genes of immigrants echo Stoddard’s own arguments for eugenics—that European genes should define the United States. Evidence of such remarks are emboldening white supremacist groups such as Return to the Land, an Arkansas-based white Christian group whose proclaimed goal is to establish white communities in Arkansas and Missouri.

Not only have the immigration policies of the current Trump administration brought into question the historic identity of the United States as a nation of immigrants, but the wholesale raids on immigrants have jeopardized the rule of law.

As the Supreme Court showed in its ruling in United States v. CASA, the court has given the president unchecked power over federal judges to enforce his order against birthright citizenship. Now, according to the courts, the Trump administration can define who it will deport, regardless of citizenship status. As Justice Sotomayor put it so clearly in her dissent: “No right is safe in the new legal regime the Court creates.”

Under the current Trump administration, immigration has been redefined broadly as a question of national security to justify the expansion of ICE sweeps and deportations. The shoehorning of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to justify mass detentions and deportations, and the Supreme Court’s lackadaisical response to its use, has also called into question the fragility of checks and balances to protect constitutional rights.

When the legal system fails to defend one minority group, such as immigrants, it threatens the freedoms of other citizens. When the U.S. government detained 120,000 Japanese Americans in concentration camps during World War II, the government failed to protect the rights of its citizens by caving to the demands of special interest groups: white farm owners seeking to remove Japanese American farmers as competition, newspaper moguls who profited off of the hate speech and rumormongering, and politicians wanting to score political points among their wealthy constituents. In fact, the nativist group the Sons of the Golden West, citing the incarceration, sued the County of San Francisco to eliminate Japanese Americans from San Francisco’s voter rolls in a failed attempt to overturn Wong Kim Ark and strip confined Japanese Americans of their U.S. citizenship.

When the Supreme Court agreed with the government in the cases of Hirabayashi and Korematsu v. United States, it not only failed to provide justice for Japanese Americans but also created a framework for mass detention of any particular group during a state of emergency.

And, unlike previous administrations, the current administration has deployed new tactics, such as inhumane detention facilities and deportation to third-party countries like South Sudan, to deter future immigration. Whether the rhetoric is about the economic security of the United States or the supposed criminality of immigrants, the status of immigrants in the U.S. is now more tenuous than ever. As Justice Robert Jackson presciently warned in his Korematsu dissent, once established, the precedent lies around “like a loaded weapon” for an unscrupulous future administration to use with a plausible claim of need.

Now the great question of the current Trump administration is the future of all immigration. As recent policy changes, such as Congress’s approval of the tripling of ICE’s budget, have demonstrated, the Trump administration hopes to curtail all immigration—illegal or legal.

First, ICE’s arbitrary detention of undocumented citizens and green card holders—those who went through the legal process of acquiring residency—represents a new moment in American history. Criminality, as the rhetoric indicated, was the basis for excluding immigrants. But as we have seen in the past seven months, the targets of ICE sweeps have been largely immigrants without criminal records. Examples range from ICE’s detaining of Jon Evans, an immigrant from Jamaica who purchased a firearm for his job as a reserve police officer for the town of Old Orchard Beach, Maine, to Caroline Dias Goncalves, a University of Utah nursing student detained following a traffic stop in Colorado. Recent data has shown that 70 percent of detainees are immigrants, documented or otherwise, with no criminal record.

The use of mass, indiscriminate deportations is designed to strike fear among immigrants and citizens alike. For those with ties to, or who are supportive of, immigrant communities, criticism of the Trump administration or attempts to document ICE arrests have led to assaults and unjust detentions. Courtrooms—trusted sites for justice—are now traps designed by ICE. The recent assault on Senator Alex Padilla at a Department of Homeland Security press conference by an ICE agent represented a new low for the Trump administration’s attempt to silence criticism.

Cory Booker, who co-sponsored legislation with Padilla to unmask (literally and bureaucratically) ICE agents with the VISIBLE Act, told his colleagues: “For weeks, Americans have watched federal agents with no visible identification detain people off the streets and instill fear in communities across the country. Reports of individuals impersonating ICE officers have only increased the risk to public and officer safety. The lack of visible identification and uniform standards for immigration enforcement officers has created confusion, stoked fear, and undermined public trust in law enforcement.”

Along with increased policing, the Trump administration has implemented economic barriers to keep new immigrants and refugees from entering the country. As part of Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” refugees will be asked to pay $1,000 just to apply for asylum—with no guarantee of approval.

Even tourists aspiring to the visit the United States are being taxed to enter the country. On August 4, the Trump administration announced a new policy requiring some foreign visitors to pay up to $15,000 in bonds before entering the U.S. As part of a pilot program, the bond policy would require individuals from countries with high overstay rates to pay at least $5,000 upon entry—with a promise for the money to be returned if the individual does not overstay their visa.

The sure consequence of these policies will be a decline in net migration to the U.S. across the board. Such a result will have a negative impact on the economic growth of the country. The U.S. Census Bureau in 2023 developed several net projections for the available immigration workforce up to 2040. Based on 2023 projections, the immigrant working-age population in the U.S. would grow from 36 million in 2025 to 37.3 million. Future anti-immigration policies projected the workforce to decline drastically, ranging from a fall to 31 million in a limited immigration scenario to 18.5 million in the event of no immigration after 2025. For the U.S. population, which continues to age as the baby boomer generation enters retirement, the need for workers will remain as more individuals enter retirement.

But more than just economically, the United States will face an identity crisis. The more the Trump administration continues to slouch toward authoritarianism and disregard the Constitution, the less its citizens will have faith in its principles.

We need to remember that the freedoms outlined by the Constitution are only as good as the protection they offer to those most marginalized in society—particularly noncitizens. The freedoms of all Americans become ever so fragile when the powerful strip them away from the powerless in the name of national security.

It’s hard to predict what will happen after the end of this administration. But if the past seven months are an indicator of the future, the United States will progressively lose its status as a “nation of immigrants.” From there, we could lose much, much more—our economic health, our international standing, and the promise of a constitutional order that once aspired to endow us all with the inalienable rights we have enjoyed for generations.",https://images.newrepublic.com/f3851263e4e4327e9b43f2d02130071047a45d67.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg,N,,2025-08-14 12:58:07.250850

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued the 2-1 decision lifting a lower court injunction that had required the Trump administration to restore foreign assistance payments previously approved by Congress.

Why it Matters

Trump has been a vocal critic of foreign aid, which he has called ""wasteful"" and not in line with his America First policies. On his first day back in office, on January 20, he immediately imposed a 90-day pause on all foreign aid, and he has since made sweeping cuts and attempts to dismantle most of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).

Today's decision will not only allow Trump to continue to wind down foreign aid grants, but it will also make it easier for the government to refuse to spend money already in the budget.

Trump Foreign Aid Appeal: What We Know

Two non-profit groups that received federal funding, AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and Journalism Development Network, had sued the Trump administration for $10 billion in funds that Congress had allocated to the State Department and USAID for global health and HIV/AIDS programs. The grant recipients argued that Trump's funding freeze violated federal law.

A lower U.S. district court had sided with the grant recipients and ordered the administration to pay nearly $2 billion in outstanding aid to humanitarian partners.

But on Wednesday, the federal appeals court vacated that injunction.

Judge Karen Henderson, a Reagan appointee, wrote in her opinion that only the Comptroller General, which falls under the legislative branch's Government Accountability Office, has the ability to sue over alleged impoundment.

The Impoundment Control Act ""created a complex scheme of notification of the Congress, congressional action on a proposed rescission or deferral and suit by a specified legislative branch official if the executive branch violates its statutory expenditure obligations,"" Henderson wrote.

""It does not make sense that the Congress would craft a complex scheme of interbranch dialogue but sub silentio also provide a backdoor for citizen suits at any time and without notice to the Congress of the alleged violation.""

The Court of Appeals ruling means that only the legislative branch will be able to sue a presidential administration if it makes changes to congressionally approved budgets.

The court also emphasized that obligations to satisfy existing contracts were largely distinct from the question of future disbursements and that challenges rooted in existing, executed contracts remained available through other legal avenues.

The panel majority said the record about grantees' future survival without these funds was ""simply less developed.""

What is the Impoundment Control Act?

The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (ICA) limits a president's ability to withhold or cancel spending that Congress has already approved, preserving Congress's constitutional ""power of the purse."" Passed after President Nixon refused to release funds for programs he opposed, the law requires the president to notify Congress of any delays and get congressional approval within 45 days for permanent cancellations or else the money must be spent.

Enforced by the Government Accountability Office, the ICA has been central to disputes such as the 2019 Ukraine aid delay, which the GAO ruled violated the law.

What People Are Saying

Attorney General Pamela Bondi wrote on X, ""Another Justice Dept victory in court for President Trump's agenda! In a 2-1 ruling, the DC Circuit lifted an injunction ordering President Trump to spend hard-earned taxpayer dollars on wasteful foreign aid projects. We will continue to successfully protect core Presidential authorities from judicial overreach.""

Judge Florence Pan, a Biden appointee, wrote in her dissent, ""It is our responsibility to check the President when he violates the law and exceeds his constitutional authority. We fail to do that here.""

Lauren Bateman of Public Citizen Litigation Group, lead attorney for some of the grantees, told reporters after the decision she would""seek further review from the court. In the meantime, countless people will suffer disease, starvation, and death from the administration's unconscionable decision to withhold life-saving aid from the world's most vulnerable people.""

To what extent, however, does this litmus test extend to the irregular migrants among us – namely, those who live and/or work in host communities without the legal right to reside? What does it take to be a “member” of society to whom protection is owed?

These are key questions facing all major migrant-receiving countries. Moreover, the choices our national governments make in relation to regulating the rights of irregular migrants matter for all of us. These choices affect our schools, our workplaces, our healthcare and eldercare settings, and our streets. Everyone is implicated, for this is what it means to live in society.

The first step in problem-solving around the issues related to irregular migration is to better understand the conditions of irregular migrants and the current responses of national governments. To this end, we at the European University Institute, Uppsala University and the University of Zagreb developed IRMIGRIGHT – Europe’s first database of the social and labour rights of irregular migrants. Unrestricted public access to the database will be available in the second half of 2026.

Using the data we compiled, we constructed a novel set of indicators that allow us to measure and compare the nature of irregular migrants’ rights in 16 different social and labour fields across the 27 EU member states and the UK. Our recently published results of this analysis reveal important differences in the types of rights that irregular migrants can claim by law in European countries, and they show significant variation in the quality of those rights cross-nationally.

Our research shows that European governments typically legislate to provide irregular migrants with a small set of basic rights. On the social side, these rights include access to emergency healthcare, maternity care and compulsory education for children. In labour terms, irregular migrants most commonly enjoy the right to recover a portion of unpaid wages (the UK and Bulgaria are the only countries in which they do not) and to be assured basic health and safety standards in the workplace. The range of services or benefits included in these rights is, in most cases, equal to those of citizens.

By contrast, it is only in a small minority of European countries that irregular migrants can exercise rights to emergency subsistence-level income support and temporary shelter – even in cases of extreme need. Routine income support payments and access to long-term social housing are virtually non-existent for irregular migrants under national laws.

The more established EU member states (the “EU 15”) typically offer better protections than the newer, post-enlargement member states. However, Denmark, Greece, Ireland and the UK break with this trend by providing weaker rights protections for irregular migrants.

Obstacles to meaningful rights

Amid the patchwork of protection and exclusion of irregular migrants in the rights frameworks of European countries, perhaps the bigger story is the widespread presence of obstacles to meaningful rights enjoyment. What our research shows is that it is one thing for an irregular migrant to have a right by law in a host country, but quite another to have a right that is provided in terms that enable the migrant to freely exercise that right.

Our findings show that even among the “best-performing” European countries such as Spain, France, Finland, Belgium and Sweden, irregular migrants face multiple “cost” barriers to enjoying their rights. Some of these costs are financial. Irregular migrants might have access to a variety of healthcare and education rights, but where the user costs of services associated with these rights exceed costs charged to citizens, irregular migrants might be priced out of services altogether.

User costs for irregular migrants vary cross-nationally: for instance, the UK charges 150% of National Health Service costs for certain maternity and specialised treatments, whereas the Netherlands treats irregular migrants on the same basis as citizens in regard to all healthcare for which these migrants are eligible. Costs may be waived, but the very presence of high costs can be enough to stop individuals from seeking even emergency or medically necessary care.

Prohibitive financial costs can also deter irregular migrants from exercising rights that they ought to be able to enjoy by law. There is no right without a remedy, yet our research finds that only around 50% of legal “rights” for irregular migrants are accompanied by some form of legal aid for them to exercise those rights.

Arguably, the cost that weighs most heavily on irregular migrants in exercising their legal rights is that of becoming visible to law enforcement authorities and facing potential immigration detention and deportation.

This rights obstacle can be reduced by “firewalls” – laws or policies that prevent service providers and state officials from reporting to immigration enforcement authorities those irregular migrants who, for example, use hospitals, schools and social services, or seek labour justice. It is striking, however, that only a handful of European countries offer such firewalls in regard to social rights (mostly healthcare), and that no country provides a firewall for irregular migrants to pursue their labour rights following workplace exploitation, abuse or injury.

Defining our societies

All in all, the picture of irregular migrants’ rights across Europe suggests that we have some way to go in guaranteeing fundamental and realisable rights that apply to all persons regardless of immigration status. The comparative country data we have compiled provide a new opportunity for European societies to hold up a mirror to themselves and ask if they are satisfied with the reflection. Do the rights that irregular migrants enjoy under the law speak to the values, norms and aspirations of host societies, or is it time for a health check?

Irregular migrants will inevitably remain of our societies, however well national governments succeed in limiting immigration and however we choose to set the boundaries of societal membership. By promoting and protecting irregular migrants’ core rights to necessary healthcare, emergency subsistence-level income and shelter, freedom from labour exploitation, and compulsory education for children, countries can realise their shared European ideals while simultaneously building healthier communities for all.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/685565/original/file-20250814-56-getkef.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C527%2C5477%2C2738&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-08-14 12:58:11.269176

Junior found himself facing an impossible decision. One morning soon after Christmas in 2022, his wife, Soledad, had woken up feeling dizzy and nauseous; Junior hurried her to an emergency room in Allentown, Pennsylvania, where doctors determined that the 45-year-old had suffered a cerebral aneurysm and quickly ordered her to be transported to nearby Lehigh Valley Hospital, where she underwent a series of surgeries. The operations were successful, but there were complications. Soledad was left in a medically induced coma.

Eight weeks later, administrators at Lehigh Valley presented Junior with three options, none of them good: He could pay $500 a day to rent medical equipment so Soledad could continue treatment at home; he could find another facility to admit her; or he could agree to have her flown to a hospital in their home country, the Dominican Republic.

“My wife is still in a coma, and you’re telling me she’s ready for discharge?” Junior said he asked the hospital officials. (Because of their immigration status, both Junior and Soledad have been given pseudonyms in this article in order to protect their identities.) Before migrating to the United States in 2022, Soledad had worked as a psychologist and led a Bible study group. Junior described her as positive, easygoing, and determined. “She liked to work a lot,” he said. In Allentown, Junior found a job as an industrial mechanic. Together they had raised two sons, now adults, who had traveled with them to the United States.

Junior is active and strong-willed, but he didn’t have the money or the medical skills to care for Soledad himself. And he feared what would happen if she were transferred out of the United States. “If my wife boarded a plane,” Junior said, “that’s how she’ll die.”

As Soledad hovered near death, she had entered a hidden medical netherworld, one where the failures of our healthcare system meet the cruelties of our immigration system. Even before President Donald Trump made hospitals a locus of his mass deportation agenda, lifting the federal restrictions that had discouraged government agents from arresting undocumented immigrants in “sensitive areas” like schools, churches, and medical facilities, hospitals had become risky spaces for undocumented immigrants like Soledad—places where a serious illness, a slow recovery, or the need for long-term care could put them on a path to deportation.

The problem begins, as it so often does in the United States when healthcare is concerned, with money. Federal law requires hospitals to provide lifesaving care to anyone who enters an emergency room, regardless of their immigration status or whether they have health insurance. But hospitals have long sought to limit their costs by discharging patients as soon as they’re in stable condition—particularly when a patient doesn’t have health insurance, as was the case with Soledad. In their rush to send patients on their way, hospitals have been known to pressure undocumented patients and their families to consent to transfers back to their home countries. Lawyers and immigrant rights advocates call this practice “medical deportation.”

Now, as the Trump administration steps up its immigration enforcement measures, the number of people facing medical deportation is likely to grow.

“We have noticed that under the Trump administration, hospitals are getting more comfortable with threatening medical deportation,” said Adrianna Torres-García, the deputy director of Free Migration Project, a Philadelphia-based nonprofit that provides legal assistance to immigrant communities and works to stop deportations. “Hospitals are taking this opportunity—this anti-immigrant climate—to become a little more bold about not wanting to work with immigrants who don’t have health insurance.”

The scale of the problem is not easy to track. Hospitals and the companies they hire to facilitate such removals are not required to report international transfers to state or federal regulators. However, interviews with patients, immigrant rights advocates, lawyers, and other experts, along with an analysis of news articles and academic studies, suggest that medical deportation is a frighteningly common occurrence that has likely affected thousands of patients. And given the current political realities, transfers that might once have been surreptitious affairs may now happen more openly.

“We know that it’s a real problem,” said Torres-García. “We’ve had people from Wisconsin, Indiana, and DC reach out to us for help.”

Under Trump’s presidency, undocumented immigrants have become more concerned about their safety in hospital settings. A recent survey by KFF, a health policy research nonprofit, found that many undocumented immigrants said they would avoid seeking healthcare out of fear of being detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

Yet even before Trump’s return to the White House, the threat was significant. For Junior, the hospital’s efforts to transfer Soledad left him terrified for her health and scrambling for a solution. “They gave me an ultimatum,” Junior said. “They said, ‘We send her to the Dominican Republic, or you take her home.’”

Even without the prospect of deportation, the treatment for Soledad’s aneurysm was traumatic. Junior recalls surgery after surgery, during which doctors shaved her head, removed a piece of her skull, and placed her on a respirator so she could breathe. “She had so many devices connected to her,” he said.

For three weeks, doctors kept her on a sedative in the hopes that it would allow her body to heal. At the end of January 2023, they gradually took her off the medication, but instead of waking up, Soledad remained unresponsive.

It was during this time, Junior said, that his meetings with hospital staff became increasingly fraught as they began to inquire about her immigration status. Then, during a meeting with Lehigh Valley administrators and staff from the medical transport company Med­Escort in early February, Junior said they raised the possibility of transferring Soledad to the Dominican Republic.

For Junior, the idea was a nonstarter. He felt that hospitals in the Dominican Republic wouldn’t be able to provide the level of care that Soledad needed. Indeed, the lack of adequate healthcare was one of the reasons they had sought a new life in the United States.

“I wasn’t going to sign any kind of document to authorize it,” Junior said of the transfer.

Medical records obtained by The Nation and Type Investigations suggest that Lehigh Valley continued to make plans for Soledad’s transfer, however, despite Junior’s repeated objections. According to these records, the hospital first documented its plan to send Soledad to the Dominican Republic on February 8, 2023, after meeting with MedEscort two days earlier. Over the next three weeks, doctors regularly evaluated whether Soledad’s condition made her stable enough for discharge, while MedEscort worked to coordinate the transfer and connect with a hospital in the Dominican Republic that could accept her.

Lehigh Valley Hospital did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Soledad’s case.

Under the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, passed in 1986, hospitals are required to ensure that medical transfers meet certain conditions designed to safeguard patients. Such transfers—whether to a domestic facility or an international one—must involve minimal health risks and be carried out via an appropriate mode of transportation, such as an ambulance or a private plane outfitted with medical equipment. The receiving facility must have both the space for the necessary treatment and personnel who are qualified to provide it.

Beyond these immediate requirements, discharge plans must be consistent with a patient’s health goals and treatment preferences as well as designed to reduce factors that could lead to a preventable hospital readmission. In Pennsylvania, hospitals must also ensure that patients are informed about follow-up care and are given guidance on accessing financial assistance for their hospital bills.

Finally, the US Department of Health and Human Services’ regulations dictate that patients, or their representatives, have a right to participate in “planning for care after discharge.” And hospitals are required to provide information in a patient’s native language. The idea is that hospitals must engage in a process that allows for “informed consent.” In Soledad’s case, however, as in many cases of medical deportation, the question of consent soon gave way to pressure.

“That’s the crux of the issue and what differentiates medical deportation from medical repatriation,” Torres-García said. Patients may consent to medical repatriation for any number of reasons: An executive who falls ill while traveling abroad for business, for example, or a tourist on vacation who has an accident might prefer to receive medical care in their home country. These patients elect to be treated outside of the country where they were injured. But in cases of medical deportation, Torres-García said, “people are not given that choice.”

Toward the end of February 2023, doctors determined that Soledad was medically stable, but they were not ready to sign off on sending her to another hospital in the Dominican Republic, according to her records. Then, at the beginning of March 2023, Lehigh Valley Hospital declared that Soledad’s time was up and that MedEscort was moving forward to facilitate the transfer.

Founded in 1986 and based in Allentown, MedEscort says it has repatriated over 6,000 patients to more than 100 countries. And it expects the demand to increase. “As immigration policies and healthcare priorities evolve, American hospitals are likely to experience a higher volume of cases requiring tailored care discharge plans for uninsured and/or undocumented patients,” Med­Escort’s website states. A 2022 version of the site put it more bluntly: MedEscort’s services, it said, are designed to help hospital CEOs and CFOs who are “looking to solve the problem of unfunded Foreign Patients in American Hospitals.” Top destinations for the company have included Mexico, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic.

“Hospitals have scarce resources. When a patient is stable or only needs custodial care, the hospital has an obligation to consider lower-­cost settings,” said Mark Weller, an attorney and spokesperson for MedEscort. “Perhaps that could be having a patient go back to their home country.”

Weller said the company follows the American Medical Association’s guidelines on safe discharges, including requiring that a patient is stable, that a discharge plan is in place, and that the receiving facility has the resources to meet the patient’s needs. “We do not support or engage in involuntary discharges,” Weller said. He said MedEscort relies on hospitals to obtain the necessary consent from patients.

Weller declined to discuss Soledad’s case but said that MedEscort exists “to help hospitals do this the right way”—something, he acknowledged, that might not be true of other companies. “Unfortunately, some vendors remove patients from US facilities without any assurance of continued care, putting both patients and hospitals at risk,” he said.

When Lehigh Valley Hospital decided it was time for Soledad to move on, it informed Junior, despite his repeated objections, that her transfer to the Dominican Republic would happen in less than a week. The date was set for March 8.

Alexandra Santos, an attorney with Free Migration Project, attended several meetings between Junior and hospital staff. She said that, despite state and federal regulations requiring informed consent from patients, hospital administrators told Junior, “We don’t need your consent.”

There is no official data on medical deportations, but researchers and immigrant rights advocates say the practice is surprisingly common. In 2012, researchers at Seton Hall University School of Law and New York Lawyers for the Public Interest released a report documenting more than 800 cases of successful or attempted medical deportation in the United States between 2006 and 2012. It remains one of the most significant reports on the practice to date.

The report is filled with horror stories: a 19-year-old girl who died shortly after being transferred from Arizona to Mexico; a victim of a car accident in Las Vegas who died after being left on the tarmac at a Guatemala airport; a baby, born with Down syndrome and a heart condition, whose transfer from an Arizona hospital to Mexico was halted at the 11th hour.

In one case from 2008, a hospital in New Jersey, seeking to transfer a stroke victim to Guatemala, contacted the man’s sister there. When she refused to give her consent, the hospital falsely led her to believe that her brother was near death in order to convince her to agree to his transfer. The following year, a man who suffered a stroke and brain hemorrhage in North Carolina was also transferred to Guatemala, where no arrangements for his continued care had been made. He spent one night in a hospital

before he was taken to his family’s home, where he died about two weeks later.

The report is scathing in its assessment of hospital practices in the United States. “There is enough information to establish that the US is in systematic violation of its human rights obligations under a variety of treaties that the US has signed and/or ratified,” the authors wrote.

John Sullivan, a former Fulbright scholar in Mexico, said he tracked nearly three dozen cases of medical deportation during a research project on the issue in 2013 and 2014. In one case, a 28-year-old man who had been left in a vegetative state after a physical assault was sent from Chicago to Mexico City, where medical personnel left him on a makeshift bed in his sister’s apartment. Sullivan said he did not know what ultimately happened to the man, but the fact that he was not transferred to a healthcare facility shows how medical deportation can leave patients in dire straits. “Medical repatriation shifts the burden of care onto families with few resources,” Sullivan said. “Patients and their families struggle to find adequate and affordable treatment.”

Sullivan also noted that, in the cases he studied, elderly parents typically, and unexpectedly, were the ones who took on the role of caretaker for their ill adult child, who had often been the family breadwinner. These children had traveled to the United States not only to secure their own livelihoods but also, in many cases, to support their families back home.

There have been more recent stories as well. In 2020, the case of an undocumented patient at Philadelphia’s Jefferson Torresdale Hospital sparked a local outcry. The man, known as A.V., was walking from his apartment to a nearby grocery store when he was struck by a motorcycle, leaving him with multiple fractures and severe brain injuries. A few weeks later, A.V.’s niece, Claudia Martinez, received a call from a social worker at the hospital inquiring about his immigration status. When the worker learned that A.V. was undocumented, she informed Martinez that her uncle would be transferred to Guatemala later that month.

“How is that possible?” Martinez recalls asking.

She said the hospital told her it had obtained the consent of A.V.’s wife, Juanita, an assertion that both women dispute. Juanita said she never received a call in 2020 regarding her husband’s transfer.

“It’s like they took advantage of the situation,” Martinez said. “They could say they received authorization from his wife…but that was a lie.” Martinez said that a hospital official continued to pressure her into agreeing to the transfer, threatening to simply drop her uncle off at her home. “He told me, ‘If you don’t sign for us to remove him, we’re going to leave him on your doorstep. You’ll wake up one morning and just see him outside your house,’” she recalled. “I didn’t know what to do. It drove me crazy.”

A.V.’s story might have ended there, like those of so many other seriously ill undocumented immigrants. But in June 2020, medical students at Jefferson Torresdale Hospital circulated a public petition highlighting the health risks that A.V. could face if he were transferred to Guatemala. “As healthcare professionals, we are taught to ‘First, do no harm.’ This much is egregiously clear—when you deport a medically at-risk, disabled individual to a country which may not have the means to care for them, you are doing harm,” the petition said.

Free Migration Project also organized a protest to keep A.V. in the country. Dozens of people gathered outside the hospital to raise awareness of the case, linking arms and vowing to block any ambulance that attempted to take A.V. to the airport. Soon, local media arrived, putting Jefferson Torresdale in the spotlight.

Finally, in the face of this growing opposition, the hospital canceled the transfer and kept A.V. in its care until alternate plans could be made. He was eventually discharged to a nursing home.

Jefferson Torresdale Hospital did not respond to requests for comment about A.V.’s case.

At the nursing home, A.V.’s condition improved dramatically, but he still required help to perform daily functions. He remained at the nursing home for four years before ultimately consenting to an international discharge back to Guatemala last year. His care in the United States had allowed his health to improve to the point that he could manage the transfer, and in Guatemala he was able to reunite with his wife and continue his recovery.

A.V.’s story, and the advocacy around it, shattered the silence that had long surrounded medical deportations—and soon shook free other instances of families trying to keep their loved ones from being deported. Maripat Pileggi is a supervising attorney at Community Legal Services who worked on A.V.’s case. She said she’s worked on about 10 similar cases since then. “Most of them have occurred since A.V.’s case was publicized so widely in 2020, which tells me that this likely happens a lot more often than anyone knows,” Pileggi said. “People often don’t realize they have any right or power to fight against it.”

One of the people who’d heard about A.V.’s case was Junior. As his discussions with Lehigh Valley Hospital grew increasingly acrimonious, he connected with Free Migration Project and organized a local media campaign denouncing the attempted transfer. On March 2, 2023, dozens of protesters gathered outside the hospital’s main entrance. A second demonstration was held less than a week later.

In response to the outcry, the hospital backed down and allowed Soledad to remain in its care.

“I wouldn’t have thought another family was going to go through this again,” said Claudia Martinez, who began working with Free Migration Project as a volunteer after connecting with the organization through a social worker. “Especially not so close to home.”

To help make sure families are spared their own medical deportation horrors, Free Migration Project and other immigrant rights advocates came together to end the practice in Philadelphia. They drafted legislation to prevent hospitals from deporting patients without their consent, and the City Council passed it in December 2023.

The legislation, which is the first of its kind in the country, forbids hospitals to “engage in medical deportation, either directly or through a designated agent.” To that end, it designates oversight of medical repatriation practices to the Philadelphia Department of Public Health and the City Committee on Public Health and Human Resources, and it requires hospitals to report patient data, enabling city officials and others to track the prevalence of international transfers. The law also gives the city the power to fine hospitals that engage in the practice, and patients have the right to sue hospitals for damages.

“I am very happy that this bill was passed, and I am hopeful that it will help many families,” Martinez said.

Still, even as activists and lawmakers in Pennsylvania have succeeded in increasing protections for undocumented immigrants, the situation in other parts of the country is becoming more precarious. Trump has threatened to penalize states like California, New York, and Ore­­gon, which offer health insurance to undocumented immigrants, by reducing the federal Medicaid match dollars that help hospitals and medical facilities offset their care costs. Without these matching funds, states will be forced to shoulder the entire cost of care for undocumented patients—a situation that could strain their budgets and lead some states to cut health coverage for undocumented patients. And in July, the Associated Press reported that ICE officials will be given access to the personal data of 79 million Medicaid enrollees—to help agents track down undocumented immigrants.

“You will see more medical repatriations and more attempted medical deportations,” warned Charles Blatteis, a lawyer based in Tennessee who specializes in medical repatriation.

Some states are even proposing changes of their own to try to appease the president and head off his punishment. In May, California Governor Gavin Newsom proposed freezing enrollment for undocumented immigrants, ages 19 and older, in Medi-Cal, the state’s Medicaid program. All undocumented residents in the state would still be covered for emergency medical care—as is required under federal law—but adults who haven’t enrolled by January 2026 would not have access to basic health coverage. Without this coverage, immigrant rights advocates suspect, medical deportations will continue to increase.

Back in Philadelphia, with the battle against Lehigh Valley Hospital behind him, Junior is optimistic about Soledad’s recovery. At the end of May 2023, Soledad was moved into a nursing home, and she emerged from her coma shortly afterward. She is undergoing physical therapy to try to improve her condition and help her regain cognitive function and bodily autonomy.

“She’s still there, slowly getting better,” Junior said. “They’ve removed the endotracheal tube, and she’s able to articulate more words.”

Still, the danger for Soledad—as well as for Junior himself—has not disappeared: The Trump administration’s anti-immigrant agenda has trickled down to the Lehigh Valley. An administrator at the nursing home “asked me about my immigration status and noted my situation and the new administration,” Junior said. “I told them I wouldn’t answer any of their questions—this isn’t an immigration office. They told me my wife wasn’t good for their business.”",https://www.typeinvestigations.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP20048077676130-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 12:58:15.931952

“To all of our families — please know that our schools are safe, welcoming places, and we remain committed to supporting every student,” Aviles-Ramos said. “We encourage you to continue sending your children to school this fall.”

City Council Member Lincoln Restler said Diallo was detained last week following a court appearance. Diallo, a 20-year-old Brooklyn student, was at a routine appointment at Federal Plaza, according to representatives of the City Council.

“This is a scary and unacceptable escalation in ICE’s ongoing attempts to target asylum seekers and students,” Restler said in a post on X.

Elected officials, including Restler and Comptroller Brad Lander, are expected to hold a rally Thursday morning demanding the student’s release.

A spokesperson from NYC City Hall said:

At the Fort Worth Report, news decisions are made independently of our board members and financial supporters.","As federal government officials ramp up immigration enforcement and deportations across the country, Fort Worth city officials appear to have no plans to actively target, identify or detain undocumented residents.

Five City Council members — Alan Blaylock, Carlos Flores, Mia Hall, Jeanette Martinez and Chris Nettles — told the Fort Worth Report that the council has not had formal discussions on how to approach immigration enforcement locally. Mayor Mattie Parker and the other five council members did not return requests for comment.

Flores and Martinez, the council’s two Latino members, said they would not support a partnership with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, citing concern about the impact it could have on Fort Worth’s Hispanic communities and their trust in law enforcement.

“I know that if it came down to a vote, I would vote no,” Martinez said.

Debates over local immigration enforcement come amid a recently passed state law mandating Texas’ county sheriff departments join formal agreements with ICE if approached by the agency. While the law doesn’t force cities to enter such agreements, a few Texas municipalities have opted into them — including Keller.

Since returning to the White House in January, President Donald Trump has made increasing daily arrests and deportations a priority. On the first day of his second term, Trump issued 10 executive orders and proclamations related to immigration and promised to carry out the largest mass deportation in U.S. history.

Some Fort Worth council members said the city’s police officers have enough duties without acting as immigration officers. Nettles said he wants police focused on keeping Fort Worth safe rather than officers spending resources “trying to hunt down those who may not be fully documented.”

As the only Black man on the council — and as a pastor and activist — Nettles said he feels a moral obligation to stand with Black and brown residents across the city in staunch opposition to collaboration with ICE, unless federally mandated.

“My legacy and my stance on this council will always be to empower the people, the everyday residents who are trying to make a living for them and their families,” Nettles said. “I’m going to fight with the majority of our community and what their stance is.”

Keller partners with ICE. Will Fort Worth follow?

Last week, Keller City Council members voted unanimously to formalize the city’s participation in the 287(g) program, a partnership with ICE that enables local officers to screen the immigration statuses of people they arrest and book into jail. Under the agreement, Keller police will flag undocumented inmates for ICE.

Flores said he’s concerned about the negative impact a similar partnership with ICE would have on public trust with local law enforcement in Fort Worth. If the Hispanic community sees the city as actively helping ICE, it could contribute to a fear of police.

Blaylock did not share whether he would support a 287(g) partnership in Fort Worth. Hall declined to comment on the program, saying she needed more information on it.

During a July ceremony in Fort Worth with Trump-appointed U.S. border czar Tom Homan, Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law the measure requiring all county sheriff offices that operate a jail to join 287(g). If ICE offers the agreement, sheriff departments must participate, according to the law.

The Tarrant County Sheriff’s Office has had the formal partnership with ICE since Sheriff Bill Waybourn took office in 2017. In 2020, Tarrant County commissioners voted 3-2 to renew the partnership indefinitely.

The program broadly deputizes local law enforcement officers to enforce federal immigration law.

This includes expanding departments’ authority to identify and process undocumented residents with pending or active criminal charges, enforce “limited immigration authorities with ICE oversight during routine duties,” and serve and execute administrative warrants on “removable aliens” in a jail, according to ICE’s website.

All Tarrant County jail inmates are subject to having their immigration statuses screened.

Rosa Maria Berdeja, an immigration attorney in Fort Worth, said via email that undocumented persons booked into jails have the same rights as anyone else — including the rights to remain silent and to due process.

In Texas, law enforcement officers may require individuals to provide identifying information such as their name, address and date of birth during a lawful detention or arrest.

“Beyond that, they are not required to provide additional information and they may choose to remain silent,” Berdeja wrote. “However, individuals should never give false information regarding their immigration status or present fraudulent documents.”

Fort Worth and other Tarrant cities that don’t have their own jails use the county’s — meaning that although city police aren’t checking for immigration statuses themselves, those arrested and booked into Tarrant jail are subject to a screening.

The Keller agreement, championed by Mayor Armin Mizani as he campaigns for a seat in the Texas House, formalized the city’s long-standing practice of partnering with ICE, Mizani said.

As of Aug. 13, two other municipal police departments in Texas are partnering with ICE through 287(g): the Splendora Police Department just north of Houston and the Nixon Police Department east of San Antonio.

Keller’s population is about 47,000 residents, according to the city’s estimates. That’s less than 5% of Fort Worth’s current population of more than 1 million residents, according to recent census estimates.

Nettles said he would not support Fort Worth opting into the 287(g) program but worries municipal departments may be forced to take a more active role in immigration enforcement.

He believes Fort Worth has already conceded local control to the federal government by suspending the city’s diversity, equity and inclusion programs with a split council vote after the Trump administration threatened to withhold federal grants from government entities that continue DEI programming.

In April, Trump signed an order directing federal agencies to identify “sanctuary jurisdictions” — localities that have policies or regulations that impede federal immigration enforcement. While federal officials cannot force cities to formally partner with ICE, it can withhold federal dollars and contracts from cities that refuse to.

A 2017 state law effectively banned sanctuary-like policies. When the law was passed, Fort Worth was the only major Texas city to not join a lawsuit challenging it. A federal appeals court upheld that law in 2018.

Flores, newly elected at the time, wanted the city to join the lawsuit, describing the state law as “neither just nor fair.” He was one of four council members in 2017 who voted unsuccessfully to join the suit.

Leaders want fairness, compassion from new top cop

As the city looks to hire its next police chief, Nestor Martinez, president of Fort Worth’s chapter of the National Latino Law Enforcement Organization, said he’s looking for a chief who will prioritize educating Hispanic communities about what immigration policies are in place and what police officers are legally allowed or required to do.

In a July interview with the Report, he noted Tarrant County’s yearslong participation in 287(g), saying residents may need to be reeducated on the program.

“You see all those postings on Facebook that ‘ICE is over here’ and ‘Police are out here enforcing immigration issues.’ A lot of times, that’s just not the case. It’s just officers that are doing things that we’ve done for a long time,” he said, adding that officers aren’t arresting anyone randomly.

The Fort Worth Police Department’s communications team did not return a request for comment.

Council member Martinez wants the next police chief to carefully consider the city’s large Hispanic population. In the 2020 census, the demographic represented 35% of Fort Worth’s population.

In 2020, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that 18.6% of Fort Worth’s residents, or about 170,918 people, were foreign-born. Of that amount, about 62%, or nearly 106,000 people, were not U.S. citizens.

Flores wants the new chief to continue the police department’s focus on “building community trust, transparency, inspiring department excellence, and safety for all residents.”

“As a Latino city leader, my vision for a police chief is someone who will prioritize fighting crime without compromising the trust and cooperation of our diverse community,” Flores said in a statement. “The best way to do that is through clear communication, empathy, fair practices and a demonstrated commitment to equitable policing.”

Some officials said they want local law enforcement to focus on educating Fort Worth’s Hispanic communities and building trust rather than enforcing immigration policies or assisting ICE.

Council member Martinez said undocumented residents shouldn’t call attention to themselves from law enforcement by risking crimes such as speeding or drinking and driving.

Martinez said her office takes calls from residents citywide to help them through any immigration concerns. She is planning a listening session with the police department in October and working on creating a nationalization clinic.

As a Hispanic leader, she said she wants to use her position of power to empower and educate residents, rather than navigating a partnership with ICE.

“I would be very concerned for our Latino community if (an ICE partnership) was a direction we were taking,” Martinez said. “We, at least in Fort Worth, I feel, support our Latino community.”

Ryan Harvey, an organizer based in Baltimore, say Avelo’s role in deportation flights gives Democratic leaders a chance to lead.
In April, however, Avelo announced that it was adding ICE flights to a roster that had previously consisted mostly of cheap flights between mid-sized cities and vacation destinations.
Matt Meyer said in April that he would not fly on Avelo flights personally.
“We expected more leadership from the Democratic Party to take on Avelo.” In Maryland, activists have not found evidence that the state aviation administration subsidizes Avelo.","Thousands of people around the country have joined a boycott of a passenger airline profiting off President Donald Trump’s mass deportation machine.

Now, activists are calling on Democratic elected officials to put pressure on Avelo Airlines, the Houston-based low-cost carrier at the center of the controversy, by ending subsidies and airport leases until it cuts off U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

They are making headway in places like New Haven, Connecticut, which has forbidden its employees from using city funds on Avelo. Elsewhere, however, activists have received the silent treatment from officials like Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, whom they have asked to cancel Avelo’s contract to fly out of the Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport.

“There is such a deep need right now for anybody in power to stand up to Trump in a meaningful way.”

Since mid-May when it began flying for ICE Air, Avelo operated 10 percent of the agency’s deportation flights, according to aviation researcher Tom Cartwright, and 20 percent of ICE flights overall. (Avelo did not respond to a request for comment.)

It’s an effort that draws direct inspiration from the Tesla Takedown movement, which belatedly received support from Democratic elected officials after weeks of grassroots anger. Ryan Harvey, an organizer based in Baltimore, say Avelo’s role in deportation flights gives Democratic leaders a chance to lead.

“There is such a deep need right now for anybody in power to stand up to Trump in a meaningful way and do something real, do something with a little bit of guts behind it,” said Harvey. “And this is an easy one, because they can just do it.”

ICE Air

Long before Trump began his second term, Immigration and Customs Enforcement relied on contract carriers for deportation charter flights.

Until recently, those carriers did not offer regular passenger service. In April, however, Avelo announced that it was adding ICE flights to a roster that had previously consisted mostly of cheap flights between mid-sized cities and vacation destinations.

The move was born out of necessity, Avelo claimed. With its passenger business failing to turn a profit, it had to turn to ICE to stay afloat.

What happened next may have caught Avelo off-guard. While the airline acknowledged that its move would be controversial, its decision has been received by a full-fledged protest movement involving dozens of protests at airports nationwide, along with calls for consumers to boycott the airline.

“They’re a financially strapped company to begin with,” said Matthew Boulay, an organizer with the national Coalition to Stop Avelo. “They take the ICE contract out of, essentially, desperation. It’s blood money. And now they are finding, I think, unexpected resistance and protest.”

The concerns center on the conditions on ICE’s deportation flights, the rushed process for deportations under Trump, and the final destinations in places like El Salvador.

Despite the burgeoning movement, it remains unclear whether the boycott has affected Avelo’s bottom line.

Seth Miller, an aviation industry analyst and New Hampshire state representative who has been critical of Avelo’s work for ICE, said it is hard to piece out the effect of the boycott from the generally dismal economic conditions for low-cost carriers.

“Boycotts are hard to make work and win,” Miller said. “Even the best of them take time. It remains to be seen how much time Avelo has. There has been relatively public news about their financials being pretty dire, but they haven’t collapsed yet.”

Subsidies Make “Huge Difference”

Activists have now launched a second front in their pressure campaign.

They are asking politicians to eliminate the subsidies that cities and states dole out to airlines like Avelo to serve smaller markets — unless and until the airline reverses course on its ICE contract.

“It can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not a million, in value.”

Avelo appears to rely more than most on those subsidies, its critics say. By scouring public records, they have discovered a network of direct or indirect subsidies that have included jet fuel tax exemptions in Connecticut, New York, and Delaware; minimum revenue guarantees in places like Daytona Beach, Florida; and money spent on marketing Avelo flights in cities like Wilmington, North Carolina.

“It can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not a million, in value,” Miller said. “When you’re running on a shoestring, it can make a huge difference.”

In places like Delaware, the subsidies have helped return passenger service to airports that lacked it for years. Yet activists say that the moral pitfalls of partnering with Avelo have grown too glaring to ignore.

In Connecticut, advocates drew the support of officials such as Attorney General William Tong and have succeeded in blocking an extension of the airline’s jet fuel tax exemption. New Haven has also barred public employees from using city funds to fly with Avelo Airlines.

Advocates targeting Avelo have found mixed success elsewhere.

Delaware Gov. Matt Meyer said in April that he would not fly on Avelo flights personally. Yet the Delaware River and Bay Authority, which operates the Wilmington Airport in Delaware, is in the middle of a $9.8 million expansion meant to attract further flights from Avelo, according to a report last month in the Philadelphia Business Journal. (Meyer and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, Democrats who each appoint half of the authority’s board members, did not respond to requests for comment.)

The authority “neither supports nor opposes Avelo’s operations,” its communications director said in a statement.

“The DRBA’s role is to administer its public use facility in a lawful, equitable and non-discriminatory manner. More specifically, the DRBA is required to permit operations by any commercial carrier that meets applicable regulatory requirements,” said James Salmon.

Salmon said no tax dollars are involved in the authority’s spending, which relies on user fees like bridge tolls.

Girding for a Fight

The protesters have also faced muted responses in places like North Carolina.

“Most of the electeds have stayed quiet,” said John Herrmann, who’s been involved in the Wilmington campaign against the airline as part of the local chapter of the liberal activist group Indivisible. “We expected more leadership from the Democratic Party to take on Avelo.”

Faced with such indifference, the activists and elected officials joining forces to put pressure on Avelo say they are girding for what could be a long battle.

“We expected more leadership from the Democratic Party to take on Avelo.”

In Maryland, activists have not found evidence that the state aviation administration subsidizes Avelo. Using a public records request, however, they have unearthed a contract which they say shows that the state can terminate Avelo’s right to use BWI for any reason with a 30-day notice.

More than 2,000 people have signed a petition asking Moore, the governor who is considered a rising star in the Democratic Party, to do just that. So far, they have not heard back, according to Harvey.

A Maryland Aviation Administration spokesperson referred a request for comment to Avelo, while adding that the airline flies “a handful of weekly commercial flights to two domestic destinations.”

In New York, Democratic state Sen. Patricia Fahy introduced legislation that could cut off the fuel tax exemption for Avelo, but it did not receive a vote before the state Legislature adjourned for the year. Unless the Legislature returns for a special session, it could be until January until lawmakers take up consideration of her bill and others again.

While it does not appear that Avelo has conducted deportations from Albany or the other airports in the state where it offers passenger flights, Fahy said she will fight to keep her bill on the legislative agenda.

“I go to sleep at night and wake up in the morning thinking what more can I do to call out what really is a travesty on our constitutional rights and the rule of law,” she said. “Democrats need to do more. I feel that we are slowly getting more support. Or maybe, rapidly getting more support.”",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2210464217-e1755125502469.jpg?fit=3200%2C1600&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-08-14 12:58:26.257737

Newsweek has contacted the family via GoFundMe and Immigration and Customs Enforcement for comment via email.

Why It Matters

President Donald Trump has ordered his administration to remove millions of undocumented migrants as he looks to fulfill his campaign pledge of widespread mass deportations.

In addition to people living in the country without legal status, immigrants with valid documentation, including green cards and visas, have been detained.

Immigration authorities have been under increased scrutiny amid allegations of misconduct, with the agency at the center of the national debate over immigration policy. Concerns have been raised over the legality and human impact of ICE's enforcement practices.

What To Know

Lewis has undergone lung surgery and previously had access to medication that supported his daily functioning, the Houston Chronicle reported.

Lewis has been held in Houston since June 30, following a prior detention in Louisiana, according to the outlet. His attorneys told the outlet he has been denied medication in Texas and has fainted due to the pain caused by his condition.

In mid-July, he agreed to a stipulated removal order, waiving his right to appeal or seek judicial review, as his main goal is simply to be released, according to the Houston Chronicle.

Lewis has a criminal history dating back to 2002, when he was arrested for cocaine possession, pleaded guilty, and received probation, according to the Houston Chronicle. In 2020, he was arrested again on charges of possessing marijuana and cocaine, as well as carrying a firearm.

""I've been in this country since I was 11 years old. Yeah, I did something wrong,"" he said. ""Since then, I went on to start my own business. I've got five children that I take care of. I've never been on child support for any of them,"" he told the outlet.

A spokesperson for ICE said in a statement: ""He is the definition of a threat to public safety and will remain in ICE custody until his removal can be carried out.""

Lewis said that he and his wife, Roxanne Lewis, had offered to cover his travel costs themselves to help get him out of the country.

""And that's without me even knowing what I'm going into. I just want to get out of here so I can get medical attention,"" Lewis said.

What People Are Saying

Roxanne wrote in a post on GoFundMe: ""Deon is an asset to his community and has been for over 30 years in the United States. He is a business owner. Providing jobs and transportation to the public. Please help Deon to be released and free from this horrible situation which has affected, devastated, destroying all of us so much.""

Rina Gandhi, an attorney on Lewis' team, told the Houston Chronicle: ""He's not fighting or disputing removal — he's trying to leave due to his severe health concerns and everyone agrees to his removal. So why is he still here? His rap sheet shouldn't matter. If anything, it should speed things up.""

Chris Van Hollen and other lawmakers visited the Baltimore U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility Wednesday after allegations of inhumane conditions.

The group was denied entry when they showed up two weeks ago.

“What we saw here was clearly a detention center,” Van Hollen said after the tour. “If you look at the people in these rooms, they’re clearly being detained.”

The tour was of the George H. Fallon federal building in Baltimore, and is the result of a federal class-action lawsuit that questioned the conditions of the center.

“There’s nothing in Maryland law that prohibits a member of Congress from talking to a detainee. Clearly, they don’t want us talking to the people who are detained here today and in the future,” Van Hollen said.

He said that the people in the facility are supposed to be “held,” according to ICE. But he claimed that they are being detained for longer than is legally appropriate.

“They want to just call it a holding facility, as you probably know, holding facilities were designed to keep people for 12 hours,” Van Hollen said. “Here, the average is now 72 hours, and we’ve had reports of people being held here for at least eight days.”

Van Hollen toured the building with U.S. Reps. Kwesi Mfume and Sarah Elfreth, both representing parts of Maryland.

They were not allowed to take any pictures of the facility while inside.

Van Hollen said that this was a crucial step in examining the conditions that detainees are staying in when taken in by ICE officers.

ICE has publicly stated there are medical services on site at the Baltimore facility. WTOP has reached out to ICE for comments on the conditions of the Baltimore location.

“We left them with a long list of questions to provide us answers for because what we’re asking for is transparency and accountability in our system,” Van Hollen said.

""When it comes to sentencing non-citizens, Canada has essentially adopted a form of two-tier justice,"" Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner said Wednesday in Ottawa.

""This offends all principles of fairness that should be foundational to our justice system.""

Deportations are automatically scheduled to allow time for appeal, but certain criminal sentences remove the right of the offender to challenge their removal.

""Removing non-citizens convicted of serious crimes is a no-brainer,"" Rempel Garner said. ""Becoming a Canadian is a privilege, not a right.""

But immigration experts say the Conservatives' characterization of Canada's justice system as being biased in favour of non-citizens is simply false. They say the law is designed to ensure the sentence fits the crime, regardless of the offender's status.

Rempel Garner said her party will introduce a private member's bill when the House of Commons returns in September, promising the change will ""restore the value of Canadian citizenship.""

The bill ""will expressly outline that any potential impact of a sentence on the immigration status of a convicted non-citizen offender, or that of their family members, should not be taken into consideration,"" the Conservative Party says in a statement.

Rempel Garner's suggestion that Canada has ""two-tier"" sentencing provisions is, she said, the direct result of a 2013 Supreme Court of Canada ruling that clarified sentencing guidelines.

One of several factors to consider

In the ruling, Canada's top court said that when sentencing a non-citizen, a judge can use an offender's immigration status as one of several factors when considering what sentence to impose.

""That's what judges do in sentencing. They take into account factors that are individual that are relevant; this is just one more of them,"" said Audrey Macklin, a law professor at the University of Toronto.

Macklin said other factors commonly considered during sentencing are whether the offender has a substance abuse issue; whether they are a single parent and what will happen to their child; or the prospects that they can be rehabilitated.

""Sentencing always takes into account factors unique or specific to that individual,"" she said. ""It's a misrepresentation to suggest that this is two-tier justice.""

Macklin said the 2013 ruling also clarified that while immigration status can be considered, it could not be used to reduce the sentence below the standard minimum.

Losing the right to appeal deportation

Under the law in Canada, a person who has been ordered to be removed from the country cannot appeal their deportation order from the Immigration Appeal Division, IAD, if:

They were convicted of a crime in Canada and given a sentence of six months or more.

They were convicted of a crime outside Canada punishable in Canada by a sentence of 10​ years or more.

They were involved in organized crime.

They violated human or international rights law, by, for example, committing war crimes.

Non-citizens who have been given a deportation order and are ineligible to appeal their removal through the IAD can apply for a judicial review with the Federal Court. The judicial review, however, does not re-examine the case, but instead looks at whether an error of law was made in issuing the IAD.

Toronto immigration lawyer Pantea Jafari says that because the deportation order is automatic when a non-citizen meets the conditions of ineligibility for an IAD appeal, there is no error in law and the judicial review will ""100 per cent"" support the person's removal from Canada.

Finding comparable sentences

Jafari says she has argued similar cases. She told CBC News that the 2013 ruling was crafted to ensure the consequences of a sentence are proportional to what the judge intends.

In a case where a judge may think someone has committed a minor offence and only deserves a slap on the wrist, Jafari said the judge may decide to give them a six-month sentence.

For a Canadian citizen, the punishment would be six months in jail. But for a non-citizen, it could result in deportation without the ability to appeal to the IAD.

Jafari said the 2013 ruling simply gives the judge in her example the authority to lower the sentence to six months less a day so they can still appeal their deportation. She said this would ensure a citizen and non-citizen receive comparable sentences.

""When [a judge] is considering a sentence, they can't be blind to the fact that this person is not a naturalized Canadian, is still an immigrant and therefore will have additional consequences as a result of the sentence,"" Jafari said.

""To have [this provision] scrapped is really problematic and something that I would vigorously defend against.""",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7608077.1755112197!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/conservatives-rempel-garner-20250221.JPG?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-08-14 12:58:30.810069

New York lawmakers say it’s now up to states to, in their words, protect residents while promoting transparency from law enforcement officials.
“It’s shameful that Democrats would attempt to undermine law enforcement officers by attacking them with absolutely no basis or knowledge of their character instead of calling on their supporters to stop assaulting law enforcement agents,” Jackson wrote in a statement.
She said the bills cover all levels of law enforcement in a way that doesn’t discriminate against federal agents, in particular.","The sight of masked federal agents exiting unmarked vehicles to carry out immigration arrests has become, for some, a disturbing norm across the country — including in New York.

Those arrests have been increasing as part of President Donald Trump’s vow to carry out the “largest deportation program of criminals in the history of America.”

New York state Democratic leaders have criticized the crackdown, but have little authority to stop the arrests. They say they do have the power, however, to ban all levels of law enforcement from wearing face masks and coverings, which they say further creates a culture of fear and intimidation.

“It’s shocked my conscience. I think it should shock everybody,” state Sen. Pat Fahy, D-Albany, said of federal agents wearing masks.

“The idea that somebody can pull up, jump out of an unmarked vehicle in all-black gear with a hidden face that only shows your eyes — I'm sorry, it’s right out of the Banana Republic-type era.”

She and Assemblymember Tony Simone, D-Manhattan, are proposing a bill that would prohibit federal, state and local law enforcement from wearing masks or face coverings while interacting with the public.

The bill, known as the Mandating End of Lawless Tactics Act, also would require law enforcement to wear name badges or badge numbers, and clothing that identifies what agency they are with. There would be exceptions for certain cases, including if it's medically required or for a tactical purpose.

“When police wear masks,"" Simone said, “democracy loses its face.”

The push to ban face coverings has set off a debate about transparency, accountability, and public as well as officer safety.

‘Transparency and accountability’

In New York, Trump’s deportation directive has translated to a more than 40% year-over-year increase in ICE arrests through late June, according to the Deportation Data Project, a group of academics and lawyers that collects immigration data. Trump officials are said to have a quota of arresting, at “minimum,” 3,000 people each day.

Democrats in Congress have called for a federal ban, which New York Attorney General Letitia James and about 20 other state attorneys general supported. But no action is expected with Republicans in the majority of both chambers. New York lawmakers say it’s now up to states to, in their words, protect residents while promoting transparency from law enforcement officials.

California was the first state to consider banning face coverings and requiring more identification from law enforcement at all levels. Pennsylvania, Michigan and Massachusetts have since proposed similar legislation.

“Prior to this complete disruption,” Fahy said, “and upending of anything we’ve ever known for decades, if not a couple hundred years, law enforcement generally embraced transparency and accountability.”

Federal agents wearing masks, Fahy said, “runs completely counter (to that).”

There have been times when local law enforcement, too, has sought to conceal officers’ identities.

In Buffalo, the city’s Police Department decided in 2020 to not require officers to display their name tags due to doxxing — or publicly sharing personal information about an individual — that coincided with Black Lives Matter demonstrations and separate incidents that the Department described as riots. After civil rights advocates criticized the policy for not being transparent, the Police Department reversed that position in 2021.

Rochester’s Police Department implemented a policy during that same time that allows uniformed police officers to not show their name tags while handling protests. If approved by the police chief, they are instead given a number that they display during protests as an accountability measure.

But uniformed officers in Rochester are not allowed to wear face masks, unless it is for a medical or tactical reason.

‘Misplaced priorities’

Some state Republicans say a mask ban would leave federal agents and their families vulnerable to doxxing, and could hinder officers in doing their jobs as effectively.

“I don't really understand what the sponsors are getting at. Do they not think that ICE agents ought to use the tools to keep them safe?” said Assembly Minority Leader Will Barclay, R-Oswego.

The Trump administration also has defended the use of masks. Todd Lyons, who heads U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, said that while he is “not a proponent of the masks,” he will still allow it to protect agents. White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said assaults against ICE officers have increased significantly.

“It’s shameful that Democrats would attempt to undermine law enforcement officers by attacking them with absolutely no basis or knowledge of their character instead of calling on their supporters to stop assaulting law enforcement agents,” Jackson wrote in a statement.

Barclay said he’d be “open if there’s other ways to protect these officers.”

""I think ideally to have everybody, would be unmasked and safe, and would be able to do their jobs without consequences of doing their jobs.""

But he described state Democrats as having “misplaced priorities” by proposing a mask ban for law enforcement while many of them criticized Gov. Kathy Hochul for enhancing penalties for people who commit crimes while wearing masks earlier this year.

The bill, Barclay said, ""seems like this is sort of a reaction to something that hasn't really been an issue, other than (Democrats) don't generally like ICE agents and they don't like people getting deported,"" Barclay said.

He also maintained that agents wearing masks doesn’t necessarily reflect how they think about the work that they are conducting.

Can New York ban masks for officers?

When asked about the MELT Act, Hochul said she finds it “abhorrent” that federal agents have been wearing masks while conducting immigration arrests.

“I resent ICE intruding in our communities,” Hochul said in a separate news conference. “They’ve been overly aggressive. They're hurting our businesses and our families and people who’ve been hardworking members of our society, some for decades.”

Ella Weber has been a volunteer court watcher in New York City immigration courts since May, when she says the arrests began occurring more frequently. “Some days, you see a dozen (arrests),” Weber said. “Some days, it’s one or two. It very much depends.”

Her job is to inform immigrants of their rights, pass along information as needed and provide any other help as needed to immigrants as they are arrested. Initially, she said, agents didn’t conceal their faces. But that changed within days, she said, as onlookers started filming the arrests.

Jessica Bulman-Pozen, who is the co-director of the Center for Constitutional Governance at Columbia Law School, said the mask bill presents a fundamental question about what it means if federal agents feel compelled or are told to conceal their identities while doing their work.

Contrary to Barclay’s argument about officer safety, she said the bill “is responding to the fact that in a free nation, rather than a totalitarian regime, the people who are doing the work of the government shouldn’t have to conceal their identities.”

“There should be transparency about who government is and the work it is doing,” Bulman-Pozen added.

Bulman-Pozen said states that have proposed legislation banning face masks for law enforcement – with health-related and exceptions – have a sound legal argument for doing so. She said the bills cover all levels of law enforcement in a way that doesn’t discriminate against federal agents, in particular.

If it did, Bulman-Pozen argued, that would be in violation of a legal tradition rooted in the Constitution called intergovernmental immunity, which protects the federal government from interference from state laws.

“The fact that the state is trying to regulate – even-handedly – the state, local and federal to protect its residents, and not stopping the federal government from carrying out its responsibilities,” Bulman-Pozen said, “gives it very strong arguments.”

One concern, Bulman-Pozen and Fahy said, is that if law enforcement aren’t required to show their faces or wear badges, individuals can more easily impersonate law enforcement by similarly wearing plain clothing and face masks, and then later commit crimes.

“I think the strongest case for the law is that the states have both the constitutional power, and you could say even a constitutional obligation, to try to protect their residents,” she said.

If passed, a mask ban won’t necessarily stop ICE from continuing to carry out arrests, Fahy said. New funding allocated to ICE under Trump’s self-described “One Big Beautiful Bill” makes it the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the federal government – a move that federal officials say will help agents carry out more deportations.

But Fahy argued that a mask ban would speak to those concerned over the tactics federal agents are using during immigration arrests, and the arrests themselves.

“We think that some of this is also going to continue to play out in the court of public opinion,” she said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/14fd96c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/800x420+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb7%2Fef%2F00c3db234e8089d33264e581369a%2Fap25196821242342.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 10:57:28.450728

In 2023, the former president Alberto Fujimori was released from prison, where he was serving a 25-year term for human rights crimes, despite a request from the regional inter-American court of human rights to delay his release.
The UN Human Rights Commission expressed alarm about the amnesty bill in July, warning Peru that it had a “duty to investigate, prosecute, and punish serious human rights violations” and that “international standards prohibit amnesties or pardons for such serious crimes”.
Peruvian courts have secured more than 150 convictions, and an estimated 600 investigations are under way, according to the National Human Rights Coordinator, a coalition of Peruvian human rights organisations.
“This amnesty law is a law that consecrates impunity,” said Jo-Marie Burt, a Peru expert and senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America.","Human rights groups and families of victims of Peru’s two-decade internal armed conflict have expressed outrage after the country’s government granted a blanket amnesty for all military and police officers accused of human rights crimes from 1980 to 2000.

The Peruvian president, Dina Boluarte, signed the amnesty – which was approved by the country’s congress last month – into law on Wednesday, to the applause of military top brass and ministers at Lima’s government palace.

The legislation prevents the criminal prosecution and conviction of former soldiers, police officers and self-defence committee fighters accused of serious human rights violations in the country’s fight against leftist insurgents of the Mao-inspired Shining Path and other groups.

Gisela Ortiz, the sister of one of the victims of a 1992 death squad massacre, said on X: “A government that violates human rights enacts an amnesty law for those who support it: police and military personnel who murdered, disappeared and raped between 1980 and 2000.”

Juanita Goebertus, Americas director at Human Rights Watch, described the law as a betrayal of Peruvian victims. “It undermines decades of efforts to ensure accountability for atrocities and weakens the country’s rule of law even further,” she said.

The brutal and protracted conflict was marked by atrocities committed by both sides. Between 1980 and 2000, nearly 70,000 people were killed and 20,000 disappeared, according to the findings of Peru’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission; Shining Path fighters were responsible for about 54% of the deaths and the military for the rest.

Boluarte said: “With the enactment of this amnesty law, the Peruvian government and congress recognise the sacrifice of members of the armed forces, the police and self-defence groups in the fight against terrorism.”

She added: “We’re giving them back the dignity that should never have been questioned.”

There has been widespread concern about backsliding on human rights under Boluarte’s government. In 2023, the former president Alberto Fujimori was released from prison, where he was serving a 25-year term for human rights crimes, despite a request from the regional inter-American court of human rights to delay his release. Last year, Peru’s congress approved a bill establishing a statute of limitations for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed before 2003.

The UN Human Rights Commission expressed alarm about the amnesty bill in July, warning Peru that it had a “duty to investigate, prosecute, and punish serious human rights violations” and that “international standards prohibit amnesties or pardons for such serious crimes”.

Peruvian courts have secured more than 150 convictions, and an estimated 600 investigations are under way, according to the National Human Rights Coordinator, a coalition of Peruvian human rights organisations.

“This amnesty law is a law that consecrates impunity,” said Jo-Marie Burt, a Peru expert and senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America. “Peru is now a pariah state from the point of view of international law. It puts Peru on the same level as Venezuela and Nicaragua for their outright disregard for the rulings of the inter-American court and of international law more generally.”

She expressed disappointment at what she called a “cynical move”, especially as Peru “for many years did make meaningful efforts to bring perpetrators of serious human rights violations to justice”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e5f188a3f4697dbb73444a14125e68a157daddf/1242_883_3261_2608/master/3261.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3b379a3556798f8dcab8a7d5e288745d",N,,2025-08-14 09:56:27.401663

Through “Press in Peril,” our ongoing series, we’re highlighting the challenges facing the press in a democracy under pressure. For student press resources visit the Student Press Law Center.

Last year, during the Spring semester of my sophomore year at Barnard College, I was leaving class when I received a text from my colleague at the Columbia Daily Spectator, our university newspaper where I work as an editor. She wanted me to come see what was unfolding on the South lawn of Columbia’s Manhattan campus. NYPD officers had lined up, preparing to arrest more than 100 students who had set up an encampment on the lawn as then-Columbia President Minouche Shafik testified before Congress.

For the first time since 1968, Columbia administration had authorized NYPD presence on campus to arrest students. Swaths of students gathered around the lawns as the police entered the side gates to arrest protestors, carrying them off to buses one by one. This would not be anything like the protests we had seen the past school year. That finals season, I spent hours huddled with friends in dorm rooms and libraries. We listened closely to on-the-ground reporters from WKCR, Columbia’s student-run radio, and constantly refreshed the Columbia Daily Spectator’s website for updates on the protests and arrests happening outside our windows.

With threats to academic freedom on the rise and a spotlight on universities across the country, student journalists are essential to providing perspective and balanced coverage of campuses. In some cases, student publications also provide essential reporting to communities beyond campus. Since campuses erupted as students protested Israel's actions in Gaza, student reporters have shared essential information about the protests and kept the campus community updated on important news. For example, Columbia’s student-run radio station, WKCR, livestreamed for nearly 24 hours straight during the two weeks The Gaza Solidarity Encampment rested on our West South Lawn.

As Columbia University gained immense attention – nationally and internationally – our newspapers’ reporting and op-eds gained newfound attention from reporters, elected officials, and other stakeholders across the country grasping for an idea of what was going on behind Columbia’s closed gates. Columbia Daily Spectator is financially distinct from Columbia University, which ensures that student journalists can report independently. In the opinion section, we worked tirelessly throughout the spring of 2024 to edit and publish op-eds from various stakeholders, including diverse groups on campus, alumni, and even the university administration. The Editorial Board deliberated for hours while writing a series of staff editorials capturing students' feelings and frustrations on campus.

A year later, it was springtime on campus again. The stakes for the student press looked different. President Donald Trump took office in January 2025, and his administration began to launch investigations into Columbia University, soon cutting approximately $400 million in federal funding. With another national spotlight on the university, Columbia began to grapple with federal investigations and negotiations, continued student protests, and international media scrutiny. Columbia’s highest leadership refused to sit down with Spectator journalists throughout Spring 2025. With each protest that happened on campus, the university cracked down harder on media attention, turning away student journalists from protest areas. This made it harder for our student press to do our jobs.

For student journalists, our fears of censorship and retaliation compounded when ICE agents took Tufts University Ph.D. student, Rümeysa Öztürk in broad daylight and detained her in Louisiana because she co-wrote an op-ed in 2024 with three other students in The Tufts Daily. The op- ed criticized the school for dismissing the student senate's role in student governance and called on the Tufts administration to implement the resolutions it had passed, including disclosing investments and divesting from Israel. Her byline led to her arrest. We saw this as an attack on our rights as student press and on the ability for those who authored pieces on our opinion page to share their voices and viewpoints.

Since October 2023, the fall of my sophomore year, Spectator’s opinion page had housed at least a dozen articles that addressed the university’s suppression of student speech on the war in Gaza. We had to have conversations about staff editorials and op-eds written during Spring 2024 when both Barnard and Columbia had passed similar student council resolutions calling for divestment. Were writers for Spectator’s opinion section next to be arrested for writing an op-ed? We feared this new administration would not stop there. Perhaps Trump would come after international students on our editorial board for their participation in writing staff editorials on the president’s policies.

Our fears were realized when the school began to launch investigations into student protestors, using their participation in writing Spectator op-eds to justify the school’s charges. When I heard this was happening, it unlocked a new sense of paranoia for me and other staffers. I wondered if the Editorial Board’s criticism of Trump’s policies would place us under investigation next.

As a U.S. citizen, I had the ability to share my views on current events with less fear than other students I had worked alongside for so long. I had honest conversations in pitch meetings and on production nights with other editors and writers about how to frame an argument or whether to pursue a specific topic in their writing, as well as many conversations with international students who were hesitant to express their views on paper.

Part of this fear stemmed not only from the administration’s crackdown but also the campus environment. At Columbia and Barnard, during the height of the student-led protests, it was not uncommon to pass trucks or scroll through websites bearing the faces of fellow students with their personal information displayed because of the opinions they shared in op-eds or on social media. This reality led to requests of anonymity or off-the-record commentary from students afraid their words could lead to harassment, doxxing, or retaliation.

After a protest in Barnard College’s Milstein Library, two WKCR journalists received a “fact-finding” request from Barnard’s Community Accountability, Response, and Emergency Services office. They requested a meeting with the students to provide information refuting that they were involved in the protests. Barnard asked these student journalists to prove they were with the press and provide other information in a closed-door meeting or face punishment via the student code of conduct. The meeting was later cancelled by the school but not before stoking fear amongst student reporters that their reporting could implicate them in the campus disciplinary investigations.

Despite some barriers to campus press freedom during the tensest moments of the Spring 2024 protests, Barnard and Columbia did initially separate student reporters from protestors, allowing reporters to enter protests and cover the events without penalty. This is in sharp contrast to some schools, such as Stanford and Dartmouth, where student journalists have been arrested for similar reporting on student protests, with some facing felony charges and academic discipline.

This past Spring, however, my school broke from their previous behavior. For the first time, three student journalists were suspended and quickly unsuspended after covering the Butler Library protest. For less than 24 hours, these students were prohibited from taking final exams and told they must vacate their student housing. Rather than studying for finals, these students spent the day in anxious attempts to prove to the school that they were student journalists despite doing all the right things: identifying themselves on the scene, wearing press badges, and reporting in a professional manner.

During this same protest, student press outside the library were restrained and shoved by school public safety officers and denied access to the main area where protests were unfolding – despite having press badges. If not for the three journalists who faced suspension, crucial reporting from the field would not have existed, including a timeline of events, video footage, and photos inside of the library. Even though these suspensions were temporary, it certainly sent a chilling message throughout Columbia and Barnard’s student press community — reporting on protests could impact their academic status.

After months of trying to meet with the Acting Columbia President Claire Shipman, she finally agreed to an interview with Spectator student journalists in the wake of Columbia’s $200 settlement with the Trump administration. This is the first time Shipman has sat down with the student press – a significant turning point in the silence from administration toward the student press for the past six months.

Student journalists at Barnard and Columbia are not alone. Universities across the country continue to crack down on student press. I know that a free press is critical to our society. Columbia’s student journalists have worked tirelessly to follow protocol instituted by the university, while also learning how to function as the University’s Fourth Estate, keeping power accountable. As I start the new school year and my senior year, I hope student reporters, editors, and press broadly can continue to hold those in power on campus accountable for their actions and inform communities in the process. I hope to spend my last year on the opinion section working on new projects, continuing to cover unfolding situations on campus, and upholding the opinion section’s motto to “reflect and direct campus discourse.”",https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/08/s-j-social.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 13:57:41.251253

The debate will be opened by Ben Goldsborough MP.

Background

In May 2025, the government published a white paper called Restoring control over the immigration system. It proposed some changes to reduce net migration, including making it more difficult for migrants to qualify for permanent residence (also known as settlement, indefinite leave to remain or ILR). This status gives people broadly the same rights as British citizens, such as to work without restrictions and claim benefits if necessary.

At present, the standard qualifying period for indefinite leave to remain is five years. The white paper proposes changing this to ten years, but allowing some people to qualify more quickly. Under this “earned settlement” proposal, there will be a shorter pathway than ten years for people who have made “Points-Based contributions to the UK economy and society” (paragraph 266 of the white paper).

The white paper does not say how these points will be earned or how much of a reduction on the ten-year qualifying period will be available. No changes to the rules have been made yet.

Which visa categories will be affected by the longer qualifying period?

There are explicit exemptions for partners of British citizens, who will continue to qualify for settlement after five years, and for victims of domestic abuse (see paragraph 265). In addition, people with post-Brexit residence rights under the EU Settlement Scheme have the right to permanent residence after five years under Article 15 of the UK-EU Withdrawal Agreement.

The government has not confirmed whether other immigration routes with a five-year pathway to permanent residence will be exempt. Asked whether people with a Hong Kong British National (Overseas) visa would be affected, the Minister for Migration and Citizenship stated “we will be consulting on the earned settlement scheme later this year and will provide details of how the scheme will work after that, including which immigration routes it will apply to”. The consultation has not begun yet.

Will people already in the UK be affected by the longer qualifying period?

The government has not confirmed whether people already in the immigration routes affected will have to wait longer for settlement, as opposed to the change only applying to those arriving after the implementation date.

The white paper’s technical annex suggests that the Home Office does envisage that the change will affect those already here: “a number of those currently in the UK are likely to leave due to it taking longer to gain settled status” (PDF, paragraph 11). Similarly, the BBC and Financial Times have reported (citing unattributed government sources) that this is the government’s intention, possibly with mitigations for people who are already close to qualifying for settlement.

MPs have been asking questions on this issue but the responses so far have said that it will also be addressed as part of the consultation process: see for example HC Deb 12 May 2025 c68; HC Deb 2 June 2025 cc15-16; PQ 58441, answered on 17 June 2025.

The petitions

Exemption for people already in the UK on a Skilled Worker visa

The Keep the 5-Year ILR pathway for existing Skilled Worker visa holders petition that the proposed increase to the qualifying period should only apply to future arrivals and that existing Skilled Worker visa holders in the UK should be exempt. Skilled Worker is the main UK work visa. It includes the Health and Care Worker subcategory for NHS staff.

The petition is open until 23 November 2025 and had received 157,000 signatures at time of writing.

In its response to the petition, given on 17 June 2025, the government stated that “as with several other measures in the Immigration White Paper, the proposals on earned settlement will be subject to a formal consultation process, and we welcome this contribution to that process”.

Exemption for Hongkongers

The Keep 5-year ILR terms to Hong Kong British National (Overseas) visas petition urges the government to keep the permanent residence qualifying period for this visa at five years. The BNO visa was launched in January 2021 in response to concerns about an erosion of human rights in Hong Kong.

The petition is open until 25 December 2025 and had received 108,000 signatures by August 2025.

In its response to the petition, given on 11 July 2025, the government stated “we are firmly committed to the existing Hong Kong community in the UK and all those who will arrive in future. Further details of measures in the Immigration White Paper will be set out in due course”.

Commentary and further reading

The Migration Observatory, an immigration research project based at Oxford University, has said that a ten year route to settlement would “make the UK more restrictive than most other high income countries” and that “the impact on migration numbers is likely to be limited”.

It added that a longer route to settlement would come with a “trade-off between the financial benefits of higher immigration fees for the government, and the negative effects on the integration and wellbeing of migrants”.

The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) has urged the government to provide clarity for the estimated 1.7 million people in the UK awaiting permanent residence who are now “in limbo” as they “do not know what the new rules will be, how they will be affected, or how long they will have to wait to get settlement and citizenship”.

The IPPR has also argued that “lengthening the route to settlement risks holding up migrant integration and significantly expanding the group of people in the UK with insecure status.

In a letter to the Home Secretary, the charity Hong Kong Watch, stated that changing the eligibility criteria for ILR would be a “grave reneging on promises made by the UK government to the British Nationals of Hong Kong” and that the government should “ensure that the original commitment made to BNO Hong Kongers in 2020 is upheld.

Benedict Rogers, the co-founder of Hong Kong Watch, has warned of the challenges BNO Hong Kongers would face if the eligibility criteria for ILR is changed:

Now is not the time for the UK to back away from its promises to Hong Kongers. Extending the waiting time for ILR to ten years would pull the rug from under those who have sacrificed so much to build a new life here. It would leave them unprotected by British consulates when travelling abroad, unable to withdraw their retirement savings from Hong Kong, and ineligible for home fee status at UK universities, pricing many out of higher education.

The Social Market Foundation has argued that the government is partly motivated by the fiscal cost of “the access to welfare entitlements which ILR provides”. It points to reported observations by Angela Rayner, the Deputy Prime Minister, that “migrants who have spent 5-10 years in the UK generally receive access to a broad range of welfare entitlements” and “those who arrived in the UK during the period of very high immigration in the past few years will become eligible for indefinite leave to remain over the course of this Parliament”.

(WTVF) — Officials in Mason have approved two separate agreements to convert a former prison into an immigration detention facility, despite opposition from many residents during a town meeting.

The Mason Board of Aldermen voted to approve a contract with private prison company CoreCivic. In a separate vote, the town says despite initial confusion, it approved an agreement with ICE by a margin of 3-2, with two members abstaining.

""We had the facility for over 30 years, everybody is doing good, I'm not understand why people are against it... it's not human rights, we don't have nothing to do with it,"" said Mayor Eddie Noeman of Mason.

The 600-bed facility closed in 2021 after the Biden administration ended partnerships with private detention facilities. The Trump administration reversed that policy in January, increasing the focus on deportations.

CoreCivic says more than 2,000 people have applied for 240 job openings at the facility. Detention officers will start at $26.50 per hour, according to the company.

The West Tennessee Detention Facility is expected to generate approximately $325,000 in annual property taxes and provide an annual impact fee of over $200,000 to the city, according to CoreCivic.

However, many community members expressed concerns during the meeting about becoming complicit in what they view as mistreatment of immigrants.

""There's a way for you to stimulate the economy without sacrificing the boat. There's got to be better jobs than that. Are you telling me those are the jobs that you want for your kids?"" one Mason resident asked during the meeting.

Critics also pointed to CoreCivic's troubled history in Tennessee, where the company faces dozens of lawsuits for violations at its facilities.

""Yet again, we see the expansion of the dangerous network of private prisons, a system that continuously puts profits over people and disproportionately targets communities of color for mass incarceration,"" said TIRRC's Government Relations Manager Luis Mata.

In a statement, CoreCivic emphasized that it ""does not enforce immigration laws, arrest anyone who may be in violation of immigration laws, or have any say whatsoever in an individual's deportation or release.""

Tennessee Governor Bill Lee said his administration has not been involved because no state funding is required.

""I will say that Americans have been very clear about the fact that there is a desire to remove dangerous criminals from our streets and communities all across America, including criminals that have come here illegally, and that is the intent of what the President is doing in this country,"" Lee said.

If allowed to proceed, he could also grant the government's request for a preliminary injunction that would block the Maryland federal bench from following the conditions of the chief judge's order.
The administration later brought Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. and charged him with human smuggling in Tennessee.","BALTIMORE — A judge on Wednesday questioned why it was necessary for the Trump administration to sue Maryland's entire federal bench over an order that paused the immediate deportation of migrants challenging their removals.

U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen didn't issue a ruling following a hearing in federal court in Baltimore, but he expressed skepticism about the administration's extraordinary legal maneuver, which attorneys for the Maryland judges called completely unprecedented.

Cullen serves in the Western District of Virginia, but he was tapped to oversee the Baltimore case because all of Maryland's 15 federal judges are named as defendants, a highly unusual circumstance that reflects the Republican administration's aggressive response to courts that slow or stop its policies.

At issue in the lawsuit is an order signed by Chief Maryland District Judge George L. Russell III that prevents the administration from immediately deporting any immigrants seeking review of their detention in a Maryland federal court. The order blocks their removal until 4 p.m. on the second business day after their habeas corpus petition is filed.

The Justice Department, which filed the lawsuit in June, says the automatic pause impedes President Donald Trump's authority to enforce immigration laws.

But attorneys for the Maryland judges argue that the suit was intended to limit the power of the judiciary to review certain immigration proceedings while the administration pursues a mass deportation agenda.

""The executive branch seeks to bring suit in the name of the United States against a co-equal branch of government,"" said Paul Clement, a prominent conservative lawyer who served as Republican President George W. Bush's solicitor general. ""There really is no precursor for this suit""

Clement listed several other avenues the administration could have taken to challenge the order, such as filing an appeal in an individual habeas case.

Cullen also asked the government's lawyers whether they had considered that alternative, which he said could have been more expeditious than suing all the judges. He also questioned what would happen if the administration accelerated its current approach and sued a federal appellate bench, or even the Supreme Court.

""I think you probably picked up on the fact that I have some skepticism,"" Cullen told Justice Department attorney Elizabeth Themins Hedges when she stood to present the Trump administration's case.

Hedges denied that the case would ""open the floodgates"" to similar lawsuits. She said the government is simply seeking relief from a legal roadblock preventing effective immigration enforcement.

""The United States is a plaintiff here because the United States is being harmed,"" she said.

Cullen, who was nominated to the federal bench by Trump in 2020, said he would issue a ruling by Labor Day on whether to dismiss the lawsuit. If allowed to proceed, he could also grant the government's request for a preliminary injunction that would block the Maryland federal bench from following the conditions of the chief judge's order.

The automatic pause in deportation proceedings sought to maintain existing conditions and the potential jurisdiction of the court, ensure immigrant petitioners are able to participate in court proceedings and access attorneys and give the government ""fulsome opportunity to brief and present arguments in its defense,"" according to the order.

Russell also said the court had received an influx of habeas petitions after hours that ""resulted in hurried and frustrating hearings in that obtaining clear and concrete information about the location and status of the petitioners is elusive."" Habeas petitions allow people to challenge their detention by the government.

The administration accused Maryland judges of prioritizing a regular schedule, saying in court documents that ""a sense of frustration and a desire for greater convenience do not give Defendants license to flout the law.""

Among the judges named in the lawsuit is Paula Xinis, who found the administration illegally deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador in March — a case that quickly became a flashpoint in Trump's immigration crackdown. Abrego Garcia was held in a notorious Salvadoran megaprison, where he claims to have been beaten and tortured.

The administration later brought Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. and charged him with human smuggling in Tennessee. His attorneys characterized the charge as an attempt to justify his erroneous deportation. Xinis recently prohibited the administration from taking Abrego Garcia into immediate immigration custody if he's released from jail pending trial.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/DOJ_Maryland_AP_25225603751271_NAT_0814,N,,2025-08-14 09:57:28.027537

Newsweek has reached out to ICE via email and to the GoFundMe page for comment on Wednesday.

Why It Matters

Oyeneyin's detention comes amid an immigration crackdown under the Trump administration, with the president having pledged to launch the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.

Immigrants residing in the country both illegally and legally, with valid documentation such as green cards and visas, as well as those with criminal histories, have been detained. The Trump administration has deported thousands of people to their countries of origin, as well as a smaller percentage to third countries with U.S. agreements. It has also encouraged individuals without proper documentation to self-deport.

What To Know

A GoFundMe created on Oyeneyin's behalf says he was in a car accident ""but not as the person at fault,"" last week. The online fundraiser continued, ""he was arrested and charged with hit-and-run and evading arrest.""

Oyeneyin, 48, was then held by ICE due to his immigration status, the online fundraiser says.

Newsweek has confirmed in the ICE database tracker that he is held in the Montgomery Processing Center in Conroe, Texas. The center has a capacity of around 1,300 people and is run by the Geo Group.

The GoFundMe notes that Oyeneyin has lived in the U.S. for over 15 years and that ""his green card application has been pending for years."" His next immigration court date is reportedly in January 2027.

The fundraiser noted that Oyeneyin lost his job and was unable to pay his former immigration attorney, ""which caused delays in completing necessary steps for his case — steps he was determined to finish before his hearing.""

In 2018, Oyeneyin was charged with assaulting a family member in Houston, according to court documents reviewed by Newsweek. The charge was a misdemeanor class A. The judge placed him on probation in 2022.

Another Texas court report shows that in 2019, Oyeneyin was arrested by the Harris County Sheriff's office for driving while intoxicated.

What People Are Saying

Ikenna Ezeaju, who organized the GoFundMe for Oladipo Oyeneyin, wrote in the online fundraiser: ""Oladipo Oyeneyin is a kind, hardworking person who simply wants the chance to clear his name, continue his life here, and contribute to the country he's called home for most of his adult life.""

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement previously shared with Newsweek: ""Under Secretary [Kristi] Noem, we are delivering on President Trump's and the American people's mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens to make America safe. Secretary Noem unleashed ICE to target the worst of the worst and carry out the largest deportation operation of criminal aliens in American history.""

Without any mitigation, the proposed reforms in the Immigration White Paper, will work in direct opposition to the child poverty strategy, by continuing to limit household income for a further five years.
Increasing child poverty, household costs and inequalities Two key pillars of the government’s child poverty strategy aim to increase household income and reduce essential household costs; however, for many immigrant families these are dictated to a significant extent by immigration policies.
What is clear is that if more children remain subject to NRPF restrictions, child poverty will persist.
But if these reforms go ahead, we will continue to see high levels of poverty among children in families subject to immigration control.","Existing limits on immigrants’ social rights through the long-standing “no recourse to public funds” (NPRF) policy, already mean that most new arrivals living in the UK on a work, study or family visa are prevented from accessing income-based benefits like Universal Credit, children’s and disability benefits regardless of need. Once granted Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) – the status of permanent residence in the UK – families are permitted access to social security benefits on the same terms as British citizens. Yet proponents are calling for further limits to benefits access, including for permanent residents and mixed-status households.

Several studies have highlighted the disproportionately high rates of poverty and destitution among children in migrant and asylum-seeking families living in the UK.

In response, the Labour government plans to introduce a system of “earned settlement” through its Immigration White Paper, doubling the length of time that most individuals and families will be required to spend in the UK before they can access settlement from five to ten years. Although not confirmed, this reform may well apply to those already living and working in the UK as well as new arrivals. One reason behind this, is likely to be the fiscal cost of benefits access for those acquiring ILR in the coming years, particularly those in low wage social care professions. However, continuing to exclude children and families from the social security safety net also comes with costs – both fiscal and social – crucially to children who are growing up in the UK and who are more likely to remain here in the long-run.

Already excluded from most benefits

Recent debates have rarely acknowledged the impact of existing NRPF restrictions on children and families, which drive poverty and destitution, especially among families already on the ten-year route to settlement. A recent report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found that families on low income affected by NRPF restrictions are more likely to face financial hardship, food insecurity and debts than other low income households. Several studies have highlighted the disproportionately high rates of poverty and destitution among children in migrant and asylum-seeking families living in the UK.

Our analysis has highlighted that at the end of 2024, there were 3.67 million individuals who had a valid visa or leave to remain which allows them to live in the UK. But NRPF conditions on their visa prevent them from accessing social security benefits including Child Benefit, Universal Credit or the Scottish Child Payment in Scotland. Of these, half a million (578,954) were children (under 18s) based on their age at initial grant of leave.

While children are of course not expected to contribute fiscally, many immigrant adults who are of working age will be “paying into the system” in line with national tax policies. Contrary to the misleading and divisive narratives from some politicians and commentators, immigrants to the UK are also “British taxpayers” if our earned income is above the threshold determined by government policies.

Without any mitigation, the proposed reforms in the Immigration White Paper, will work in direct opposition to the child poverty strategy, by continuing to limit household income for a further five years.

Households also pay additional fees to government that are unique to those who are subject to immigration control and add to the essential costs that households have to maintain their status, such as the Immigration Health Surcharge and Home Office visa and settlement fees. Prior to the latest fee increase in 2025, our analysis found that a single parent with two children starting their settlement journey in 2017 would have had to pay £27,182 over a ten-year-period on this route in order to acquire Indefinite Leave to Remain. A family of two adults and three children would have had to pay £45,560 over a ten-year period given both Home Office application costs and the Immigration Health Surcharge (assuming no further increases after 2024).

Increasing child poverty, household costs and inequalities

Two key pillars of the government’s child poverty strategy aim to increase household income and reduce essential household costs; however, for many immigrant families these are dictated to a significant extent by immigration policies. Without any mitigation, the proposed reforms in the Immigration White Paper, will work in direct opposition to the child poverty strategy, by continuing to limit household income for a further five years. Increasing the qualifying period for settlement is also likely to increase the essential household costs for families who will have to pay twice as much to settle. IPPR has estimated that 1.7m individuals including children already living in the UK could be affected.

Planned reforms may also lead to increased inequalities. Allowing some individuals to “fast-track” their access to settlement through fiscal contribution, will likely reinforce existing inequalities particularly for women, families with children, those with a disability and those more likely to earn less. Neither Universal Credit nor Child Benefit are contributory benefits; British citizens are not required to “pay into the system” before they can access this support. Existing criteria stems from other needs such as having a low income, a limited personal safety net or having additional costs associated with having a child or being unable to work longer hours due to illness, disability or caring responsibilities. It remains unclear whether the government’s new approach to “earned settlement” will also require children to earn their right to settle or how children’s settlement rights will be further eroded by their parents’ status. What is clear is that if more children remain subject to NRPF restrictions, child poverty will persist.

Overlooked costs of prolonged poverty

While the fiscal costs of welfare spending would increase if more households gained ILR, there will also be costs – both fiscal and social – from prolonging and expanding NRPF restrictions. In 2022, our social cost benefit analysis found that lifting NRPF conditions for families with children with limited leave to remain would result in a positive net present value of £872 million over a 10-year period. The main costs of lifting conditions would be for Universal Credit and Child Benefit, while the biggest gains would come from enabling better housing stability and improvements to children’s education and development, both of which are key drivers of health and wellbeing.

Household income has important consequences for a range of children’s outcomes including educational, behavioural, social and health outcomes. Unsuitable housing can have long-term effects on health, and the financial burden of high housing costs can push families into poverty. Problem debt also has profound social, emotional and productivity impacts, as well as effects on physical and mental health. As well as the financial protection of social security, lifting NRPF conditions would enable families to access employment-related support, such as work coaches, and childcare provision, most of which is currently restricted for resident families, even when they are working. This could enable families, particularly women whose employment rates tend to be lower, to increase earned income.

Existing data does not allow us to estimate how many children are affected by NPRF restrictions but we know that in 2022/23, over a third of children (1.5 million) in relative poverty were in families with parents born outside of the UK. Further denying families access to vital protections like welfare benefits will only prolong and expand the detrimental effects of poverty experienced by children growing up in the UK. The Government has not yet published a child rights impact assessment of the Immigration White Paper nor any analysis of how many more children will be forced to live in poverty as a result of these proposed reforms. But if these reforms go ahead, we will continue to see high levels of poverty among children in families subject to immigration control.

Mamadou, who is from West Africa, was detained following a routine court appearance at Federal Plaza in Manhattan on August 4.

The 20-year-old Brooklyn Frontiers High School student is at least the third New York City public school student to be detained by ICE under the Trump administration's rigid immigration policies.

It is a transfer school, serving students who are overage and under credited, according to its website.

City officials have stressed, schools are the safest place for migrants to be.

City leaders say he has no family in the area, and for Education Chair and City Councilmember Rita Joseph, they have one goal in mind.

""He's a rising senior, he's a student working, with no family members in New York,"" Joseph said. ""That's why we're all coming together, all my colleagues and advocates are coming together to bring Mamadou home.""

""I am heartbroken to share that another one of our students was detained by ICE, while attending his immigration hearing. Our Project Open Arms team is standing with the student's family, working closely to connect them with legal support and other critical services,"" said Dept. of Education Chancellor Melissa Avilas-Ramos.

""This is a scary and unacceptable escalation in ICE's ongoing attempts to target asylum seekers and students,"" Councilmember Lincoln Restler said.

Diallo was seeking a special immigration juvenile status at the time of his detainment.

Eyewitness News is told he's now being fast tracked through the system for detention.

And while redistricting has taken center stage for the moment, when lawmakers return next week they will also have a full package of bills addressing interactions with the federal Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) to consider forwarding to Gov. Gavin Newsom.

The bills range from blocking ICE agents’ access to nonpublic areas of schools, hospitals, homeless shelters and domestic violence centers without a warrant; to prohibiting healthcare providers, cities and counties from sharing the immigration status information of patients and street vendors with federal authorities; to prohibiting law enforcement from wearing masks or face coverings.

While much of this legislation is simply reinforcing pre-existing law with additional protections, lawmakers have established it as necessary due to many of these raids being conducted without presentation of warrants and in subsequent violation of the constitutional right to due process.

It also attempts to reinstate the Biden administration’s “sensitive locations” memo on a state level — which was rescinded by the Trump administration on January 21 — as it had deemed raids at schools, hospitals, courthouses and other locations off-limits to immigration enforcement.

“Victims are skipping court hearings. Shelters are seeing women disappear even as they’re on their way to pick up their restraining order,” said Senator Susan Rubio, author of SB 841. “…If we stop someone from walking into any of these safe spaces, we have failed them. What we are doing is we’re siding with the criminals in that case.”

Christopher Negri, Associate Director of Policy at the California Partnership to End Domestic Violence, an organization that supports SB 841, says he too has seen a decline in domestic violence victims seeking help.

“We’ve heard from some of our agencies that they have observed decreases in demands for their services among certain clients,” Negri said. “I have heard of survivors being less willing to show up to court in particular, which is concerning because that’s the place where one would file for a protective order or deal with a child custody case.”

While the fate of the aforementioned package of bills remains to be seen amidst looming federal pushback, California lawmakers stand on strong ground, according to UC Berkeley School of Law Dean Erwin Chemerinsky.

While redistricting has taken center stage for the moment, when lawmakers return next week they will also have a full package of bills addressing interactions with the federal Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) to consider forwarding to Gov. Gavin Newsom.

“State and local governments do not have to cooperate with the federal government,” said Chemerinsky. “The federal government can’t make them do so, but they [local authorities] can’t interfere with ICE when it’s performing its duties.”

However, Chemerinsky noted that if the bills are passed and ICE officials enter these facilities without warrants, state and local law enforcement would be able to block them from entering.

Chemerinsky also said that the state government can have a general law that applies to all law enforcement, but that it can’t place a substantial burden on the federal government. However, he noted that because these bills are just enforcing pre-existing law, they do not qualify as a substantial burden.

“The Constitution is clear that the police can’t enter a dwelling without a warrant based on public laws, subject to some exceptions like the emergency exception,” said Chemerinsky. “To the extent that the state here is just saying to federal, state, local governments: you have to follow the Constitution.”

Legal immigrant representation

In addition to this legislative package, lawmakers have been fighting to include social programs centered around immigration rights in the 2025-2026 budget, such as the Children’s Holistic Immigration Project, or CHIRP.

Started in 2022 as a pilot program to provide lawyers and social workers to unaccompanied immigrant minors facing deportation, CHIRP was originally slated to last just through summer 2024. However, its timeline was extended to this June by a one-time $4.2 billion boost from the California Department of Social Services.

As Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed cuts to some immigrant social services to address the $12 billion budget deficit, the program was expected to be discontinued. And yet, CHIRP made it into the final cut of the budget at the end of June.

“Around when the budget for the legislature was released, that’s also when the LA rage exploded,” said Hortencia Rodriguez, Director of Community Partnerships and Local State Policy for Acacia Center for Justice, the non-profit manager of CHIRP. “The National Guard was deployed to Los Angeles, so there was a reawakening of the urgency of why these legal services are so important at this time.”

Although Acacia — alongside various Democratic lawmakers — has been advocating for more investment in immigration legal services since the special session in December, Rodriguez said they received much less funding than they had hoped for.

According to Rodriguez, they specifically asked for a total of $60 million to be split evenly between the two years, but only received $10 million in total. Rodriguez detailed that they asked for this amount of state funding “as a safety net” for the potential $20 million loss in federal funding for nearly 30 legal service providers for unaccompanied migrant children across California.

This ongoing federal divestment has put other programs that they manage, like the Unaccompanied Children’s Program, in jeopardy. Although services have still been allowed to resume under its preliminary injunction, the long-term future of the program remains uncertain. If funding is cut, organizations will have to withdraw from many ongoing cases with young clients at risk of being detained and deported, leaving them to fend for themselves in court.

“It’s well-documented that the current administration’s objective is to dismantle due process as a whole, but specifically also targeting migrant children,” said Rodriguez. “So we really needed to pressure the state of California to step up in this moment and protect especially those active cases.”

However, their financial shortcomings combined with the reported increase in need for immigrant legal aid has created a unique situation of vulnerability.

“It’s well-documented that the current administration’s objective is to dismantle due process as a whole, but specifically also targeting migrant children.”

“Many of the organizations that are funded under this program have massive waitlists,” said Rodriguez. “There’s just not enough capacity at this time to represent every child in need… So to have that federal funding eliminated means capacity will drop, as we’re seeing an exponential, explosive need in immigration legal services across the board.”

According to Jeannette Zapitin, immigration attorney and Director of Policy and Advocacy for the Coalition of Human Immigrant Rights Los Angeles, their organization has also noted a general uptick in the need for legal immigration services, specifically in Los Angeles County.

Rodriguez attributed this surge in need to the actions of the Trump administration, noting their dismantling of statutory protections, on-the-ground targeting, and attempts to terminate the Flores Settlement Agreement, which establishes guidelines the federal government has to abide by when holding minors in detention.

“It’s all being combined to superpower deportations in the most hidden and illegal ways possible,” said Rodriguez. “Kids are going to be at risk of being lost in the system and potentially ending up in a country that they’ve never been in, and that’s a really dangerous situation.”

The problem is heightened by a growing need for the health care and home care workers to support aging seniors.
Shortly after, the Department of Homeland Security’s E-Verify system alerted Tribute that anyone with CHNV parole status was no longer allowed to work.
“It’s like my main goal here, to become a doctor, maybe a specialty.” He also described how working with other health care professionals improved his medical knowledge and his English.","For more than a year, Robert spent his days getting seniors dressed, taking their vital signs and helping them eat at Edgewood LifeCare Community in North Andover.

But one day in May, that changed. A human resources officer said his work permit was no longer valid; he would be laid off.

“When they said, ‘you won’t be able to work,’ I’m like, my God. I cried. Because I had a good relationship with the clients and they love me so much. They love me so much because I took good care of them,” said Robert in a phone interview. GBH News agreed to use only his first name due to his fears of deportation.

Robert is one of thousands of health and nursing home workers in Massachusetts who has lost or is at risk of losing their employment due to the Trump administration terminating their legal status.

“We are starting to see an already nervous health care industry lose key staff,” said Jeff Thielman, CEO of International Institute of New England, which provides workforce training for many immigrants.

Parole for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans launched in 2022 as a path for immigrants from specific countries to flee persecution, environmental disasters, and economic instability. They applied for the program from their home countries with the help of a U.S. sponsor, were vetted, and allowed to live and work in the U.S. for two years at a time.

The Trump administration ended the CHNV program and moved up the dates the immigrants were told they stay in the U.S. until. After a Supreme Court decision reversed a temporary injunction barring the move, more than half a million immigrants across the country immediately lost their legal status, effectively becoming undocumented. While the injunction is off the books, the deeper legal issue could still eventually be decided in parolees’ favor as arguments play out in lower courts.

‘Something so out of our control’

International Institute of New England prepares refugees and immigrants of varying statuses for employment, including through a certified nursing assistant training program with Middlesex Community College. They’ve trained more than 140 CNAs since 2018. Nursing homes, rehab centers, hospitals and patients at home all need caregivers, and the industry is already tight on staff. Immigrants have filled key roles, and the industry has been a lifeline for them. And advocates like Thielman say they’ve brought what’s needed to the table.

“They’ve followed all the rules — they got trained in a new profession, they went into the workforce in a workforce that needs them, and they’ve now lost their jobs,” said Thielman. “So it is a very unfair system.”

In Massachusetts, one in four health care workers are immigrants, according to the Leah Zallman Center for Immigrant Health Research. The share is even higher for home health aides, which had a 46% foreign-born workforce even before the influx of immigrants to the state between 2022 to 2024. The problem is heightened by a growing need for the health care and home care workers to support aging seniors.

Of the thousands of personal care attendants represented by the 1199SEIU union, 500 have been recently terminated due to changes in their immigration status. That includes many who came to the U.S. through the CHNV parole program.

Local employers like Tribute Home Care are starting to see the impact of Trump’s immigration policies. The group recently had to lay off nine Haitian caregivers who had parole through the CHNV program.

Tribute Home Care CEO John Sneath said the agency was first alerted when a caregiver brought in a “very technical letter” saying he could no longer work, and needed to return to Haiti.

“We didn’t frankly know what to do because we knew that we had others under that program,” he said. Shortly after, the Department of Homeland Security’s E-Verify system alerted Tribute that anyone with CHNV parole status was no longer allowed to work. Sneath said there was no guidance on how and when to lay off staff, and the company struggled to determine if it was even allowed to pay severance.

“The folks that managed our caregivers and had to make the termination calls were literally in tears and struggling to go on with their day because this is something so out of our control,” said Regina McNally, Director of People & Culture at Tribute.

She said the company has about 100 senior clients in Massachusetts, with the average client needing about 100 hours of care weekly. That work is stretched across just 200 or so caregivers.

Demand for home-based care is higher than ever, with many people wanting services in the comfort of their residences.

But that will be harder with fewer people working in the industry, and could lead to dangerous and expensive situations, said Jake Krilovich, executive director of Home Care Alliance of Massachusetts, a trade association working with more than 200 home care providers.

“[Short staffing] puts people at risk from falls or complications from chronic disease, which would then make them have an event that they would have to go into a facility,” he said “From a policy perspective, it strains our health care system. It is more costly when people are admitted to the hospital.”

The Trump administration stands by its decision to terminate the program, despite any impact on the impact to the health and home care industries. “The Biden administration’s reckless CHNV program allowed hundreds of thousands of unvetted aliens to circumvent the traditional parole process,” said US Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesman Matthew Tragesser. He called the program “massively abused” and urged impacted immigrants to self-deport if they haven’t secured lawful status.

‘It’s still my passion’

Robert, 24, is originally from Haiti and studied nursing in the Dominican Republic because he had no educational opportunities in Haiti. He came to the U.S. through the CHNV program.

He said he “fled gang violence” in a country that is dealing with massive economic and humanitarian upheaval, and staying in the DR was not an option.

His certified nursing assistant job at Edgewood was a position he dreamed of; when he first arrived in the U.S., he could only get a job in manufacturing. Robert heard about a certified nursing assistant program through International Institute of New England, and took the necessary course while also studying English.

“It is my passion, it’s still my passion,” he said. “I like to make a positive impact in people’s lives — that’s why I love nursing.” He was thrilled to get a job he was qualified for right after getting certified in February 2024, and worked full-time to pay rent and support his grandmother, who he lives with.

“Right now ... I can’t even take care of myself because I don’t have a job,” he said through tears. “It’s hard for me to pay my bills. It’s hard for me to pay for our place to live,” he said, adding that he’s burning through savings quickly, and isn’t sure what to do next. He says he’s hoping the Trump administration will reverse its policy change so he and colleagues who also lost their jobs could return.

McKewan, 30, is also originally from Haiti. GBH News agreed to only use his first name over fears he could be detained by federal immigration authorities. McKewan studied medicine in the Dominican Republic and worked as a physician assistant in an emergency room there before coming to the U.S. through the CHNV parole program, with an aunt giving him sponsorship.

He became a certified nursing assistant in September 2023, and split his time working at Whittier Rehabilitation Hospital in Bradford, Mass. and at Amazon.

“It’s like entry-level,” he said. “It’s like my main goal here, to become a doctor, maybe a specialty.” He also described how working with other health care professionals improved his medical knowledge and his English.

But McKewan lost the nursing assistant job in June due to his work permit being revoked, and the separate job at Amazon soon after. McKewan said he’s upset about the lost opportunity. He’s hoping that eventually, courts will decide to reverse the Trump administration’s decision.

McKewan said he fears deportation constantly, particularly because of gang violence and lack of opportunity in his field in Haiti. But he wants to be as productive as possible, even with the constant anxiety of being detained. He’s taking coursework in biology and physiology at Middlesex Community College.",https://cdn.grove.wgbh.org/dims4/default/5709ab5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1008+0+136/resize/1200x630!/quality/70/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-gbh.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb9%2Fc5%2Fb0dec3c845ef857b370294ebd931%2Flowell-13-cna-cohort-6.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 12:58:36.896127

The Trump administration in January overturned the longstanding federal policy specifically limiting immigration enforcement in “sensitive locations” such as hospitals, churches, and schools.
The “presumption that hospitals and clinics will be free from ICE raids is no longer the case,” Arent Fox Schiff LLP partner Annie Chang Lee said.
Fourth Amendment Limits Health-care facilities’ first responsibility is to their patients.
ICE enforcement in a medical facility could interfere with that.","Medical facilities are increasingly concerned they’ll be the next targets of the Trump administration’s immigration raids, placing health-care workers whose first duty is to patient care in a precarious position.

President Donald Trump has redefined what’s traditionally been considered off-limits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. What were previously considered safe spaces, such as churches and courthouses, have been identified as targets, leading to a handful of lawsuits over the policy shift that so far have yielded mixed results.

Recent events at facilities in Southern California—especially one that led to federal criminal charges against two Ontario, Calif., surgery center employees—are fueling new fears that health-care facilities could be next.

“It doesn’t matter who you are or where you work, if you assault our agents or otherwise interfere with our operations, you will be arrested and charged with a federal crime,” acting US Attorney Bill Essayli said in a statement after the Ontario arrests.

The commitment hospitals have to their patients—including one to respect their privacy—may be “diametrically opposed” to those of ICE officers, and could lead to genuine conflicts, said Joan Feldman, the chair of Shipman & Goodwin LLP’s health law practice group.

The recent California arrests demonstrate that even non-immigrants could be at risk of prosecution if ICE raids a health-care facility, said Lynn Pearson, a senior attorney at the National Immigration Law Center.

Several attorneys suggested that health care organizations should prepare for a potential ICE raid by training employees about their patients’ rights and setting a protocol for reacting to the arrival of immigration enforcement officials.

Safe Space Shift

Law enforcement in hospitals isn’t new, said Feldman. Hospitals often call in police officers to deal with unruly patients, especially in their emergency departments.

The Trump administration in January overturned the longstanding federal policy specifically limiting immigration enforcement in “sensitive locations” such as hospitals, churches, and schools.

The “presumption that hospitals and clinics will be free from ICE raids is no longer the case,” Arent Fox Schiff LLP partner Annie Chang Lee said.

Facilities in states like California with large immigrant populations are currently experiencing higher enforcement levels. Lee and her colleagues identified three other recent interactions between immigration agents and California health-care centers that have occurred in parking lots, lobbies, and non-patient areas.

ICE activity also is “highly likely” to increase in states with policies requiring collaboration with the federal government, she said.

ICE and the Justice Department didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Legal Challenges

The end of the safe spaces policy resulted in several lawsuits from religious groups, the latest of which accused the administration of violating their rights under the First Amendment and Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

The coalition also said the Homeland Security Department, ICE’s parent agency, violated the Administrative Procedure Act by arbitrarily and capriciously rescinding the earlier policy.

“Faith communities, hospital workers, and educators should not have to choose between their commitments of service and the safety of those they serve,” said Skye Perryman, CEO & President of Democracy Forward, which represents the plaintiffs.

Similar suits have had mixed results. A federal judge in Washington denied a request to stop ICE from gathering at or near places of worship and raising people’s fears of attending religious services. The plaintiff group lacked standing because it didn’t show an enforcement action was imminent, the court found.

But a federal district court in Maryland put the enforcement policy on hold in February, finding that the plaintiffs had sufficient evidence that the policy caused their congregants to skip services and that they’re likely to succeed on their claims. DHS has appealed the injunction.

Health-care attorneys were unaware of any similar suits filed by hospitals or other medical facilities against DHS.

Fourth Amendment Limits

Health-care facilities’ first responsibility is to their patients. They’re committed to helping people regardless of their immigration status and federal law prohibits them from turning away patients with emergency medical conditions, Feldman said. ICE enforcement in a medical facility could interfere with that.

Despite the end of the safe spaces policy, the US Constitution’s Fourth Amendment still applies and prohibits government agents from searching private areas without a judicial warrant. Medical facilities have a Fourth Amendment right to refuse warrantless searches of private areas such as patient and treatment rooms, which should be clearly marked, attorneys said.

Additionally, staff can refuse to provide information about patients to law enforcement officers absent a judicial warrant or court order, according to NILC.

Any doubt about a warrant’s validity should be resolved by a facility’s attorney, who should be one of the first people workers call, Feldman said. Facilities should have clear policies and train workers on how to interact with officers in anticipation of an interaction, she said.

In the Ontario case, the Justice Department claims that the target of the immigration action was a man who sought refuge inside a surgery center, not a genuine patient. The health-care workers, one of whom allegedly interfered with the arrest in the facility’s parking lot, face a statutory maximum sentence of eight years in federal prison on an assault count and up to six years in federal prison on a conspiracy count, according to the DOJ.

Pearson said that different standards apply to searches or seizures in public areas such as lobbies and parking lots, where officers can enter spaces and seize items that are in “plain sight.”

The staff’s first obligation is to care for patents, not to respond to ICE, though a facility could designate responders in advance, Feldman said, noting she would never advise staff to confront officers.

Being confronted by a masked officer in tactical gear and carrying a gun is scary, and while hospital workers have been put in bad situations, these “everyday people are doing the best they can,” Pearson said.",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/77daa77/2147483647/strip/false/crop/6969x2686+6+363/resize/960x370!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F05%2F9b%2Fc7c270e940c7a501beb816753a56%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2226092155,N,,2025-08-14 13:58:00.784798

What are H-1B visas?
Congress caps new H-1B visas at 85,000 per fiscal year, including 20,000 for noncitizens who earned advanced degrees.
The debate around H-1B visas does not neatly fall along partisan lines.
“I have many H-1B visas on my properties,” Trump told the New York Post in late December.","President Donald Trump’s administration wants to overhaul the nation’s visa programme for highly skilled foreign workers.

If the administration does what one official described, it would change H-1B visa rules to favour employers that pay higher wages. That could effectively transform the visa into what one expert called “a luxury work permit” and disadvantage early-career workers with smaller salaries, including teachers. It could also upend the current visa programme’s lottery system used to distribute visas to eligible foreign workers.

“This shift may prevent many employers, including small and midsize businesses, from hiring the talent they need in shortage occupations, ultimately reducing America’s global competitiveness,” said David Leopold, a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association whose practice includes representing employers in the H-1B process.

It’s hard to find US workers in certain types of specialty fields, including software engineers and developers and some STEM positions.

A White House office proposed the change on August 8, Bloomberg Law reported. Once the proposal appears in the Federal Register – the daily public report containing notices of proposed federal rule changes – the plan will become subject to a formal public comment period. It could be finalised within months, although it is likely to face legal challenges.

Joseph Edlow, the director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, told The New York Times in July that H-1B visas should favour companies that plan to pay foreign workers higher wages. The proposal Bloomberg Law described was in line with that goal.

PolitiFact did not see a copy of the proposal, and the White House did not respond to our questions. But the Department of Homeland Security submitted the proposed rule to a Trump administration office in July, the Greenberg Traurig law firm wrote.

Trump sought to reform the H-1B program during his first term but made limited progress. In January 2021, near the end of Trump’s term, the Department of Homeland Security published a final rule similar to the current proposal, but the Biden administration did not implement it.

Work visas were not a central part of Trump’s 2024 immigration platform, but it was a point of debate in the weeks before he took office, with billionaire businessman Elon Musk – a megadonor to Trump who would briefly serve in his administration – speaking in favour of them.

What are H-1B visas?

The H-1B visa programme lets employers temporarily hire foreign workers in specialty fields, with about two-thirds working in computer-related jobs, according to the Congressional Research Service. Most H-1B visa holders come from India, followed by China.

Currently, prospective H-1B employers must attest that they will pay the H-1B worker actual wages paid to similar employees or the prevailing wages for that occupation – whichever would result in the highest pay.

To qualify for the non-immigrant visa, the employee must hold a specialised degree, license or training required by the occupation. The status is generally valid for up to three years and renewable for another three years, but it can be extended if the employer sponsors the worker for permanent residency, which includes permission to work and live in the US.

Leopold said that the proposed change goes beyond the law’s current wage mandate.

“This statutory mechanism is designed to prevent employers from paying H-1B workers less than their American counterparts, thereby protecting US workers from displacement,” Leopold said.

Congress caps new H-1B visas at 85,000 per fiscal year, including 20,000 for noncitizens who earned advanced degrees. The government approved 400,000 H-1B applications, including renewals, in 2024, according to the nonpartisan Pew Research Center.

Amazon has led the nation’s employers since 2020 in its number of H-1B workers, Pew found.

The New York metro area received more H-1B application approvals than any other metro area; College Station, Texas had the highest concentration of approvals.

What could change with H1-B visas?

The proposed policy favours higher-paid employees, experts said.

Malcolm Goeschl, a San Francisco-based lawyer, said the rule will likely benefit tech companies, including many specialising in artificial intelligence. Such companies pay high salaries, including for entry-level positions. He said it will harm traditional tech companies’ programmes for new graduates.

“There will likely be plenty of lottery numbers available at the top of the prevailing wage scale, but very few or none at the bottom,” Goeschl said. “You may see young graduates shy away from the US labour market early on because of this. Or you could see companies just pay entry-level workers from other countries much higher salaries to get a chance in the lottery, leading to the perverse situation where the foreign workers are making a lot more money than similarly situated US workers.”

The prevailing wage requirements are designed to protect US jobs from being undercut by lower paid foreign workers.

David Bier, director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said the change would likely make it nearly impossible for recent immigrant college graduates, who tend to earn lower wages, to launch their careers in the United States on an H-1B visa.

“The short-term benefit would be the people who get selected are more productive, but the long-term cost might be to permanently redirect future skilled immigration to other countries,” Bier said. “It would also effectively prohibit the H-1B for many industries that rely on it. K-12 schools in rural areas seeking bilingual teachers, for instance, will have no chance under this system.”

Amid a nationwide teacher shortage, some school districts have hired H-1B visa holders, including smaller districts such as Jackson, Mississippi, and larger districts, including Dallas, Texas. Language immersion schools also often employ teachers from other countries using this visa programme.

Why is there a debate about H-1B visas?

The debate around H-1B visas does not neatly fall along partisan lines.

Proponents say the existing visa programme allows American employers to fill gaps, compete with other countries and recruit the “best minds”. Critics point to instances of fraud or abuse and say they favour policies that incentivise hiring Americans.

In December, high-profile Republicans debated the visa programme on social media.

MAGA influencer Laura Loomer denounced the programme and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon called it a “scam”. On the other side, billionaire Elon Musk, a former H-1B visa holder whose companies employ such visa holders, called for the programme’s reform but defended it as an important talent recruitment mechanism.

Trump sided with Musk.

“I have many H-1B visas on my properties,” Trump told the New York Post in late December. “I’ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It’s a great programme.”

Senator Bernie Sanders disputed Musk, saying corporations abuse the programme as a way to get richer and should recruit American workers first.

Such visa debates have continued.

When US Representative Greg Murphy, a urologist, argued on X August 8 that the visas “are critical for helping alleviate the severe physician shortage”, thousands replied. Christina Pushaw, a Republican who works for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, pushed back: “Why not figure out the causes of the domestic physician shortage and try to pass legislation to address those?”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP25141584679644-1748476190_2db274-1748476283.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=80,N,,2025-08-14 07:58:06.665759

The strikes, during prisoners’ visiting hours, significantly damaged multiple buildings, including in prison areas known to hold many activists and dissidents.

Violations of the laws of war by Israeli and Iranian forces during the 12 days of conflict between June 13 to 25 should be fully investigated and those responsible for war crimes held to account.

(Beirut) – Israeli airstrikes on Iran’s Evin prison complex in Tehran on June 23, 2025, were unlawfully indiscriminate and an apparent war crime, Human Rights Watch said today. The strikes hit several buildings across the complex and killed at least 80 people, according to official Iranian statements, including prisoners, their family members, and prison staff, in the absence of any evident military target.

Over 1,500 prisoners are believed to have been held at Evin prison at the time of the attack, including many activists and dissidents held by the Iranian government in violation of their rights. The strikes, during visiting hours, significantly damaged the visitation hall, central kitchen, medical clinic, and sections where prisoners were held, including political prisoners.

“Israel’s strikes on Evin prison on June 23 killed and injured scores of civilians without any evident military target in violation of the laws of war and is an apparent war crime,” said Michael Page, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. “The Israeli attack placed at grave risk the already precarious lives of Evin’s prisoners, many of them wrongfully detained dissidents and activists.”

Between June 24 and July 29, Human Rights Watch interviewed 22 people about the attack, including relatives of victims and prisoners, former Evin prisoners, and others with extensive knowledge of the prison. Human Rights Watch wrote to Iranian and Israeli authorities on July 2 and 7, respectively, seeking information but has not received responses.

Human Rights Watch also analyzed and verified videos and photographs of the Israeli strikes published by media outlets and on social media, as well as material shared directly with researchers, and satellite imagery from before and after the strikes. Human Rights Watch was unable to visit the site, as Iran does not permit access to independent human rights organizations.

The investigation into the June 23 attack on Evin prison is part of a broader Human Rights Watch inquiry into the June 13-25 hostilities between Israel and Iran, including Iranian ballistic missile attacks on populated areas in Israel.

Israeli forces carried out strikes on Evin prison, a 43-hectare compound in Tehran’s District 1, between 11:17 a.m. and 12:18 p.m. on June 23. No advance warning is known to have been given. Satellite imagery, videos, and witness accounts show strikes damaging buildings hundreds of meters apart.

The strikes destroyed the prison’s main southern entrance and another in the north. The visitors’ information building, adjacent to the main entrance, was completely destroyed. Family members of prisoners and former prisoners said that many families frequent the visitors’ building, including to deliver clothing and medicine. The strikes also hit the visitation hall, a judicial complex housing assistant prosecutors, and significantly damaged or destroyed several buildings in the prison’s central premises, where the medical clinic and several prison wards are located.

Two political prisoners in the prison’s central Ward 4, Abolfazl Ghadiani and Mehdi Mahmoudian, described in a publicly available account the “sounds of repeated explosions” at midday near their ward. They saw the medical clinic burning, and the food and hygiene warehouse destroyed. By 2:00 p.m., they said, prisoners had extricated 15 to 20 bodies from the rubble, including those of other prisoners, medical clinic personnel, warehouse workers, and guards and officials from Section 209, a detention facility run by the Intelligence Ministry where dissidents are routinely detained.

Dr. Saeedeh Makarem, who volunteered at the medical clinic, posted on Instagram that after the strikes, prisoners rescued her from the rubble. She subsequently underwent major surgery, including hand replantation. State media reported that a physician was also killed in the clinic.

The strikes damaged buildings and vehicles outside the northern parts of the prison complex, killing and injuring residents, including Mehrangiz Imenpour, a 61-year-old artist. Domestic media reported that Ali Asghar Pazouki, a 69-year-old businessman, was killed outside the compound.

Human Rights Watch found damage either to, or in the vicinity of, prison sections used to hold people accused of national security offenses, including activists and dissidents. These included Wards 4 and 8, Sections 209, 240, 241, 2A, and the women’s ward. The main quarantine section, where transgender prisoners were held, was also damaged. Iranian authorities have not reported on the condition or whereabouts of many prisoners from these sections, which amounts to enforced disappearances in violation of international human rights law.

Under international humanitarian law, also known as the laws of war, prisons are presumptively civilian objects. Human Rights Watch’s investigation found no evidence of any military targets at the Evin prison complex at the time of the Israeli strikes. None of the sources interviewed, including recently released prisoners, family members, and lawyers who have repeatedly been to the prison said that they were aware of any Iranian military personnel, arms, or material within the compound.

Statements by Israeli ministers immediately after the attack made no claims of military targets within the prison compound but framed the strikes as part of Israel’s attacks on Iran’s repressive institutions. Israel Defense Minister Israel Katz wrote immediately after the attack that Israel struck Evin prison due to its function as an “agency of government repression.” Foreign Affairs Minister Gideon Sa’ar’s post on X indicated that Evin prison had been struck in retaliation for Iran’s attacks on civilians in Israel.

Several hours after the strikes, Israel’s military confirmed the attack, and a military spokesperson alleged, without evidence or details, that Iran carried out “intelligence operations against the state of Israel, including counter-espionage” in the prison. An Israeli military spokesperson repeated the same allegations that day in a media interview. The Israel Defense Forces’ statement reiterated previous government statements that Evin prison was a “symbol of oppression for the Iranian people.”

The laws of war applicable to the international armed conflict between Israel and Iran prohibit attacks that target civilians and civilian objects, that do not discriminate between civilians and combatants, or that are expected to cause harm to civilians or civilian objects disproportionate to any anticipated military advantage. Indiscriminate attacks include those not directed at a specific military target. Even if some individuals at Evin prison were Iranian military personnel, the large-scale attack would have been unlawfully disproportionate.

Serious laws of war violations committed by individuals with criminal intent – that is, deliberately or recklessly – are war crimes. Governments are obligated to investigate alleged war crimes by their forces, or on their territory, and appropriately prosecute those responsible. Both Israel and Iran have track records of impunity and unwillingness to investigate in line with international law, let alone prosecute possible war crimes by their forces. All governments have an obligation to cooperate with each other, to the extent possible, to facilitate the investigation and appropriate prosecution of alleged war crimes.

“The unlawful Israeli attack on Evin prison highlights the consequences of longstanding impunity for serious laws of war violations,” Page said. “To make matters worse, Israeli forces put at grave risk prisoners who were already victims of Iranian authorities’ brutal repression.”

The June 13-25 Conflict Between Israel and Iran

On June 13, Israel carried out a series of attacks on Iran that continued until a ceasefire went into effect on June 25. Israeli military attacks included strikes on populated areas; on oil, gas, and nuclear facilities; and on Evin prison. In response, the Iranian military launched a series of ballistic missile and drone attacks against Israel, hitting populated areas as well as a power station, an oil refinery, and a hospital.

On June 22, the United States became a party to the conflict by carrying out airstrikes on Iran’s Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan nuclear facilities. Iran responded on June 23 by launching missiles at a US airbase in Qatar.

Iranian authorities have not published detailed data regarding people killed and injured during the conflict, including a breakdown of civilian and military casualties. On July 16, an Iranian government spokesperson stated that 1,062 people, including 140 children and women, were killed as a result of Israeli strikes, and 5,800 were injured. Iran’s health minister stated on July 9 that about 700 of those killed were civilians. Human Rights Activists in Iran (HRANA), a US-based group, reported that 1,190 people were killed, including at least 436 civilians.

Israel’s Foreign Affairs Ministry reported 30 civilians, including 4 children, were killed in Israel during the hostilities and 3,343 people were treated in hospitals for injuries from Iranian strikes.

Casualties in Evin Prison Attack

On July 9, a spokesperson for Iran’s Judiciary announced that 80 people had been killed as a result of the strikes on Evin Prison. According to official statements, casualties included judicial and prosecution officials, prison staff, prisoners and their family members, other visitors to the prison, and people living in neighboring residential areas. Informed sources told Human Rights Watch they believe the casualty figures are most likely higher.

The authorities have not released the names of all 80 people reported to have died. Iran’s Prisons Organization and state media have published the names and images of 41 prison staff who died, including 5 female social workers, a social worker’s 5-year-old son, and 13 young men performing mandatory national service.

Those performing mandatory national service in prisons fall under the auspices of the Prisons’ Organization and the national police force, and typically guard the premises, transfer prisoners, and carry out administrative duties and other basic tasks. They are neither combatants under the laws of war nor civilians directly participating in hostilities and so cannot be targeted.

Officials have confirmed the deaths of five prisoners but have not released their names. This is particularly alarming and creates hardship for prisoners’ families, especially because the various Iranian intelligence agencies using Evin Prison have longstanding records of enforced disappearance of dissidents and activists.

Reza Khandan, a wrongfully detained human rights defender, stated in his account of the attack that among prisoners killed were those who worked in the prison compound or its administrative sections.

In addition to the list of prison staff published by state media and institutions, Human Rights Watch, drawing from publicly available information, as well as accounts from informed sources, identified several civilians killed during the attack. They are Hasti (Hajar) Mohammadi, who went to the prison to work for the release of debt prisoners; Leila Jafarzadeh, who was at the prison to post bail for her jailed husband; Ali Asghar Pazouki, a businessman who was near the northern judicial complex; and Mehrangiz Imenpour, an artist and neighborhood resident.

The authorities have not released any figures on the number of people injured in the attack. The relative of someone killed told Human Rights Watch that during their search for their loved one, they were given a list of names of 20 to 25 people injured from one hospital alone.

Accounts and Analysis of the Evin Prison Attack

Human Rights Watch confirmed, based on satellite imagery, thermal anomaly data, accounts of informed sources, and first online reports and videos, that the Israeli strikes on Evin prison took place on June 23 between 11:17 a.m. and 12:18 p.m. At 1:21 p.m. Tehran time, Israel’s Defense Minister Israel Katz confirmed on his X account that the Israeli military had struck targets in Tehran, including Evin prison.

Based on satellite imagery from June 25, Human Rights Watch identified eight apparent impact sites within the prison compound. However, given that satellite images collected on June 23 and 25 – before and after the strikes – were low resolution and debris clearance operations were underway as early as June 25, Human Rights Watch could not confirm with certainty that all eight sites were the result of a direct impact with a detonation at the point of impact.

Due to the resolution of satellite imagery, the exact number and precise locations of the impact sites are approximate. Similarly, in cases in which videos and photographs emerged after clearing operations had already begun, Human Rights Watch was not able to determine whether all visible damage was solely attributable to the Israeli attack.

Human Rights Watch was not able to obtain any images or videos depicting Israeli munitions used during the attacks. No identifiable weapon fragments or remnants of guidance systems are visible in the available media coverage or information released by Iranian authorities. Based on videos and satellite images reviewed, repair of damage to the prison began shortly after the attack and included filling in blast craters.

A visual comparison of each impact site shows that the scale of damage at locations varied, indicating that more than one type and size of munition was used in the attack. For example, based on the images reviewed, at least one munition appears to have penetrated the Administrative Building’s roof, with its detonation occurring only after it entered deeper in the structure, indicating the use of a delayed-action fuze.

On June 24, a spokesperson for Iran’s police force, FARAJA, announced that its bomb squad had successfully neutralized and disposed of two undetonated “missiles” from prison premises. But they did not provide further details on the type of munitions removed or provide any photos.

Strikes on Evin Prison’s Southern Premises

Visitors’ Information Building

Israeli strikes on the southern part of the prison compound almost totally destroyed the main entrance and its adjacent building. Human Rights Watch verified two videos of the immediate aftermath of the strike on the prison’s main entrance, published on June 23.

One video, posted online at 3:01 p.m. and composed of clips edited together, shows the near-total destruction of the eastern side of the entrance and a building east of the gate, identified by several informed sources as the “visitors’ information” building. Several sources and domestic media reports said that a facility for people performing mandatory national service was in the main entrance area, most likely behind the visitors’ information building. Sources said that people serving mandatory national service are stationed at the prison entrance, tasked with guarding, assisting visitors, and accompanying prisoners during transfers.

A video posted by state media on July 4 containing clips apparently filmed in the immediate aftermath of the attack shows a large crater caused by the munition in the northwestern angle of the visitors’ information building. A witness who was outside the main entrance immediately after the strikes told Human Rights Watch that they saw a crater at the entrance and several injured and possibly dead people, including those serving mandatory national service.

Shaheed Moghaddas Office of the Prosecutor

Human Rights Watch analyzed two videos and five photographs published by state and international media between June 29 and July 4 depicting destruction to the prosecutorial office within Evin prison, Shaheed Moghaddas Office of the Prosecutor, including a large hole in the ceiling and damage to walls. Leila Jafarzadeh, whose husband was imprisoned in Evin prison, was reported to have been in the prosecutor’s office at the time of the attack to post bail for his release and was killed. State media reported that her body was recovered several days later. Lawyers and others said that during office hours, the prosecutor’s office was packed with prisoners, summoned individuals, prisoners’ families, and lawyers.

Southeastern Corner of the Compound

Human Rights Watch identified, based on a verified video and two photographs, damage to the southeastern corner of the prison compound, including a surrounding wall, and dozens of vehicles parked along the southwestern parking lot.

Strikes in Central Premises

Human Rights Watch analyzed information that shows significant destruction and damage to buildings in the central premises of the compound. Based on satellite imagery analysis, videos, photographs, and accounts of prisoners and informed sources, at least four apparent impact sites were identified in the central section.

The Administrative Building

Videos and images Human Rights Watch analyzed show severe damage to the Administrative Building, in particular its eastern facade and second floor. Damages to an adjacent building, identified by sources who spoke with Human Rights Watch as the prison’s Security/Protection Unit, are also discernible. The unit operates under the head of Iran’s Prisons Organization, which is under the judiciary’s auspices, and based on regulations, is tasked with maintaining prison security, carrying out prisoner transfers, and preventing and controlling riots and escapes.

One verified video published by state media at 5:50 p.m. on June 23 appears to have been taken in the immediate aftermath of the attack. It shows the Administrative Building’s second floor windows completely blown out with debris falling out. Human Rights Watch also reviewed footage posted online on July 6 showing the floors of one section inside the multistorey building collapsed onto one another. A hole is visible in the ceiling above the damaged area.

Several human rights defenders and former Evin prisoners said that the Administrative Building was large, with several floors, including the social workers’ office and a “technology room,” where prisoners permitted to pursue their education would take exams. Domestic media reported that five female social workers at the prison were killed in the strike on the Administrative Building, along with a five-year-old boy.

Satellite imagery and two videos analyzed also show damage to the buildings east of the Administrative Building. Several formerly detained activists and journalists said the damaged building, which some former prisoners said they called the “motori building,” was used to register new prisoners and detainees and process prisoner transfers.

Based on publicly available accounts by prisoners and informed sources, the quarantine section of the prison, used to hold new detainees, adjacent to the “motori” building, was also damaged. Several sources said that transgender prisoners were held there. A verified video published by state media on the day of the attack shows damage to the general area where the quarantine section and a small road leading to Section 2A are located.

The Iranian singer Danial Moghaddam, in a post on his Instagram account, said that he was detained on June 22 and held in room 4 of the prison’s quarantine section. He said that around noon on June 23, as a result of the explosion, parts of the quarantine section’s walls, ceiling, and windows collapsed on prisoners. Moghaddam also said that after exiting the quarantine, he saw casualties and items of clothing under the rubble in the area.

Prison Medical Clinic, Central Kitchen, and Ward 4

The strikes also hit the area north of the prison clinic, severely damaging the clinic and nearby buildings, including Ward 4, the central kitchen, and a covered vehicle passage adjacent to the clinic. A human rights defender imprisoned at Evin until shortly before the attack told Human Rights Watch that besides the medical personnel, “the clinic is always full of prisoners.”

Political prisoners Abolfazl Ghadiani and Mehdi Mahmoudian, in a publicly available account, referred to two or three strikes in proximity to Ward 4. They described damage to Ward 4, the clinic and nearby facilities, and Section 209.

Human Rights Watch analyzed videos and photographs showing damage to the prison clinic and other buildings in the vicinity. One verified video posted online on the day of the attack shows smoke plumes rising from buildings surrounding the clinic. The clinic’s northern facade is burned. Another video, composed of several clips edited together and published by state media on June 25, shows significant damage to the buildings opposite the clinic, including the central kitchen and Ward 4.

Human Rights Watch corroborated videos and photographs of the clinic’s interior and various rooms with former prisoners who had been inside the clinic. The images show damage to a treatment room used for small procedures and injections, the nursing station, a doctor’s consultation room, a laboratory, and the CPR, physiotherapy, and medicine storage rooms.

In a statement published within hours of the strike, Evin prisoners referred to the partial destruction of Ward 4. Two prisoners’ family members said that their imprisoned relatives described damage to Ward 4 and injuries to prisoners. A Ward 4 prisoner, whose statement was obtained by a human rights group and shared with researchers, said that nearby strikes resulted in the collapse of part of the ward’s ceiling and walls.

Section 209 and Storage Building

The strikes on Evin’s central premises damaged a building opposite Section 209. Former prisoners told Human Rights Watch that the building was used for storage, with administrative and management functions for Section 209 in the southern part of the building. Satellite imagery from June 27 shows major destruction to the building, with roof sections collapsed. Debris and burn scars are visible along the road separating the building from Section 209.

Given the proximity between these two buildings, and extensive damage to the storage building, it appears likely that the eastern facade of Section 209 was also severely damaged, most likely exceeding what is visible in the satellite imagery. The Ward 4 prisoner whose account was obtained by a human rights group and shared with Human Rights Watch, said he saw several wounded people or bodies removed from Section 209 and the clinic.

An informed source said that prisoners in the women’s ward, where about 70 political prisoners were held, described a “terrifying blast impact.” An image identified as the ward by former prisoners showed ceiling damage. No other photos or video footage of this area were published. As a result, Human Rights Watch could not independently assess the extent of damages to Section 209 or to the women’s ward.

Northeastern Premises

Visitation Hall and Shaheed Kachoui Judicial Complex

Human Rights Watch identified at least two apparent impact sites in Evin Prison’s northern premises. The strikes destroyed the joint northern entrance to the prison’s visitation hall and Shaheed Kachoui Judicial complex, in the northeastern corner of the compound. Two videos that Human Rights Watch verified and geolocated to Ahmadpour Street, north of the prison compound, show the immediate aftermath of the strike. A shadow analysis indicates they were filmed around noon.

In one video, two men in civilian attire assist another man, dazed and apparently injured. In another, a man in a bloodied shirt is shouting instructions at others while smoke plumes rise from the prison compound.

Human Rights Watch verified another video posted online by state media on June 24 and composed of several clips edited together, showing destruction of the joint entrance, its parking area and the inside of the building. The first clip shows the gate completely destroyed and walls surrounding it significantly damaged. The rest of the video shows damage and destruction inside the building, including the offices of assistant prosecutors and the visitation hall waiting area, strewn with debris and staircases stained with blood.

Informed sources said that offices of assistant prosecutors in the Kachoui complex were on an upper floor of the visitation hall, a larger building stretching south of the compound. They said that the strikes took place during the office and visitation hours, running from 8 a.m. to 12.30 p.m., when a large number of visitors, including families of prisoners, would have been there. Former prisoners said that the Kachoui complex deals with the judicial affairs of convicted prisoners, including requests for prison leave and conditional release.

Vicinity of Wards 240 and 241

Strikes on the northeastern premises of Evin compound impacted the internal road connecting the north and central sections of the prison. The impact site is less than 20 meters from Sections 240 and 241. A video posted online on June 23 at 3:00 p.m. and verified by Human Rights Watch shows the walls on both sides of the road in front of Sections 240 and 241 almost completely destroyed. Satellite imagery recorded on June 27 also showed a large impact visible on the internal road connecting the north and central sections of the prison.",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph/public/media_2025/08/202508mena_iran_evin_prison.jpg?h=ac778ff2&itok=GesraIlD,N,,2025-08-14 11:56:49.158132

Israel’s restrictions on humanitarian aid are not only morally indefensible, they also violate both international and U.S. law.","Dear Members of Congress,

We, the undersigned organizations, write to express our grave concern regarding the preventable humanitarian catastrophe and mass starvation in the occupied Gaza Strip. We urge you to use all available tools, including the suspension of U.S. security assistance in compliance with section 620I of the Foreign Assistance Act, in order to secure an immediate surge in humanitarian assistance and an end to the ongoing atrocities. As many of our organizations argued previously, continued U.S. security assistance to Israel despite Israel’s near total siege and restrictions on humanitarian aid is a violation of U.S. law. We urge you to take swift action to comply with the law and end U.S. support for the catastrophic suffering Israel has imposed on Palestinians in Gaza.

As the United Nations and humanitarian organizations have been warning, starvation and the humanitarian crisis are rapidly worsening throughout Gaza. The humanitarian system is being deliberately and systematically dismantled by the Israeli government’s blockade and restrictions. Alarmingly, the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) warned on July 29 that the worst-case scenario—famine—is currently unfolding in Gaza. In addition, the IPC states that “humanitarian aid remains extremely restricted due to requests for humanitarian access being repeatedly denied and frequent security incidents. Despite the easing of the blockade on 19 May, only a trickle of humanitarian assistance, mainly food, has entered the Gaza Strip.” Food assistance, however, requires extraordinary risks to access. According to the UN Human Rights Office, the Israeli military has killed more than 400 Palestinians and injured more than 3,000 since May 27 while trying to access aid.

Since October 7, 2023, the Israeli government has dramatically tightened restrictions on U.S. humanitarian assistance into the Gaza Strip. The government has fully blocked the entry of humanitarian aid at various times, most recently between March and May of this year; conducted military strikes on humanitarian workers and sites; destroyed critical infrastructure essential to the survival of the civilian population; implemented a deadly new aid distribution mechanism that reduces the number of distribution sites across Gaza; and repeatedly killed civilians seeking assistance.

Such restrictions and attacks have been documented repeatedly throughout the war and therefore cannot be seen as isolated instances, but the policy of the government of Israel. Human Rights Watch determined that the Israeli government was committing a war crime by using starvation of civilians as a weapon of war in the Gaza Strip; and Oxfam documented war crimes committed by the Israeli government due to its destruction and weaponization of water in Gaza.

Meanwhile, the United States continues to provide Israel with unconditional arms transfers and other military support. Congress has appropriated more than $21 billion in security assistance for Israel since October 7, 2023. In part to fulfill that assistance appropriated by Congress, the Biden and Trump administrations have announced more than $30 billion in potential arms sales, including a sale two months ago for munition guidance kits that have been documented to have been used unlawfully in Gaza.

Israel’s restrictions on humanitarian aid are not only morally indefensible, they also violate both international and U.S. law. Section 620I of the Foreign Assistance Act (22 U.S.C. § 2378–1) prohibits the United States from providing security assistance or arms sales to any country that “prohibits or otherwise restricts, directly or indirectly, the transport or delivery of United States humanitarian assistance.”

Unconditional U.S. security assistance in violation of the law and continued support for the Israeli government as it restricts aid with impunity has resulted in an engineered humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. We urge you to take all actions at your disposal to end U.S. support for these horrors, enforce U.S. compliance with the law, and use your leverage to bring about an immediate and permanent end to the atrocities, the release of hostages and unlawfully detained prisoners, and access to life-saving humanitarian assistance.

“Ohio counties like Seneca and Geauga cannot hide behind federal immigration officials to avoid obligations under Ohio law.","The American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio is suing a second county, accusing it of violating the state’s open-records law.

The records are contracts and memoranda between the Seneca County Sheriff’s Office and federal agencies such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Marshal’s Service and the Department of Homeland Security.

As with some other counties in Ohio, Seneca has contracted with the federal government to detain those swept up in the Trump administration’s mass deportations. The ACLU filed a similar suit against Geauga County in May.

Seneca County is claiming that it’s not allowed to release the records because they “are federal records subject to the Federal Records Act (FRA) and thus not subject to disclosure under state law,” according to the lawsuit filed by the ACLU.

However, open-records laws are intended to combat corruption and other secret dealing by giving the public access to the inner workings of government. As a general matter, government documents can usually only be withheld or redacted if they contain sensitive personal information, business secrets, would compromise a law enforcement investigation or if their disclosure would endanger public safety or national security.

“The Seneca County Sheriff’s Office has a clear legal duty to provide the requested information,” Freda Levenson, legal director of the ACLU of Ohio, said in a written statement. “The sheriff’s office has never denied that they possess such records, and there is no provision in Ohio public records law that exempts them from the obligation to produce these records.”

Levenson also said the federal statutes cited by the sheriff’s office don’t exempt the information from disclosure.

“The public has a right to this information,” the statement continued. “Local law enforcement must be accountable; it cannot shroud itself in secrecy.”

The sheriff’s office didn’t immediately respond to a message sent Tuesday afternoon.

Advocates for immigrants have argued that jails are not appropriate places to hold people detained by ICE. For one thing, many — those not accused of illegal entry — are not criminal suspects. For another, there were lawsuits and other problems at Ohio jails under the arrangements during the first Trump administration.

Lynn Tramonte, founder of the Ohio Immigrant Alliance, in April listed the harms done to those held in county jails on immigration matters. Such detentions mean “taking them away from their families, jobs, and communities, making them rot in jail, while their immigration cases are pending. Making it harder for them to work with lawyers and win their cases. In the United States, you can be eligible for deportation and legal status at the same time.”

The ACLU of Ohio is asking the state Supreme Court to issue an order mandating that the records it asked for be released. Jocelyn Rosnick, its chief policy and advocacy officer, said sheriffs have to be accountable under state law.

“The ACLU of Ohio is deeply committed to protecting immigrants’ rights and our organization serves as a watchdog for government transparency and accountability,” she said. “Ohio counties like Seneca and Geauga cannot hide behind federal immigration officials to avoid obligations under Ohio law. Our lawful demands for timely and accurate information must not be ignored.”",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/icephoto_0-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 09:56:40.690614

Just as he did during his first term in office, President Donald Trump is trying to reshape the census to serve his political goals.

This time, he’s calling for an extraordinary mid-decade population count that would be used for apportioning congressional seats, and that would explicitly exclude undocumented immigrants. He announced his intentions where many of his policy pronouncements start out, on social media.

It’s another effort by his administration to influence redistricting and congressional apportionment in ways that could benefit the GOP, though it’s not clear what the outcome of such a census would be. Democratic-leaning states like California, New York, New Jersey, and Illinois have large numbers of undocumented immigrants, but so do some Republican strongholds like Texas and Florida.

Trump’s previous attempt to change census procedures involved the scheduled 2020 census, and ran into a wall at the Supreme Court. This time, he’s trying to do it mid-decade, and for the purposes of apportionment, which would run into many more obstacles.

Here, we address some key questions about Trump’s proposal: the legality, the logistics, and the political strategy driving it.

Can a president order a mid-decade census?

Not unilaterally. The 1790 Census Act governs the census and gives authority over this process to the secretary of commerce and the Census Bureau. Certainly, the president has influence over this part of the executive branch. But Congress still controls the pursestrings and decisions over timing. A process like the one Trump is proposing must be authorized by law and funded through congressional appropriation, which Trump doesn’t control.

What does the constitution say about excluding undocumented residents?

There’s not a lot of ambiguity in the Constitution’s language about the census, or the way the Supreme Court has interpreted it: A census used to determine congressional seats needs to count everyone.

The 14th Amendment requires that the “whole number of persons” residing in the United States should be counted — it doesn’t mention immigration status, or any other condition. The phrase “whole number of persons” was written to replace the Three-Fifths Clause in Article 1 (which said enslaved persons were to be counted as three-fifths of a person for the purposes of apportionment), and was deliberately written to be inclusive, experts say.

Historical interpretations of this amendment reaffirm that. In 2016, Texas residents challenged the state’s use of total population, rather than just citizens, in deciding how to draw districts of roughly equal size, the process that follows the census and reapportionment of seats among states. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld a ruling that total population was the correct standard, based on the 14th Amendment, saying it “promotes equitable and effective representation.”

“What constitutional history and our prior decisions strongly suggest, settled practice confirms,” Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the court. Switching to apportionment based on eligible voters “would upset a well-functioning approach to districting that all 50 States and countless local jurisdictions have followed for decades, even centuries.”

How feasible would a new census be at this time?

It would be very expensive, if it could be done at all, and especially difficult to pull off on Trump’s timeline for influencing next year’s midterm elections. Election administrators, campaigns, and parties have already begun preparations for those elections based on figures from the previous census.

It’s difficult to pull off even when both parties want to do it.

In 1975, there was bipartisan interest in conducting a mid-decade census in order to provide better data for federal programs. Congress passed legislation authorizing a census for data collection only, not for congressional apportionment. But it didn’t get done. It proved too expensive, and the Census Bureau lacked the time and the infrastructure.

Getting Trump’s politically motivated proposal would have a tougher time just getting through Congress. And any attempt to politicize the census would be fraught. The data collected and compiled by the Census Bureau informs not just apportionment and redistricting, but many other public and private endeavors, from emergency planning and housing construction to wildlife conservation and school lunch programs. People and institutions that depend on census data want the most complete picture possible, not one clouded by political motives.

What legal obstacles does Trump face?

Beyond the statutory and constitutional limitations we’ve already talked about, the Census Act limits the White House’s ability to do what Trump is trying to do. And the president has no authority to compel states to draw new maps even if he’s successful at forcing a new census.

Along the way, judging by past disputes, we should expect a deluge of lawsuits that would diminish any chance of a census, reapportionment, and redistricting all getting done in time for next year’s midterms.

Is this related to the current redistricting effort in Texas?

Both reflect efforts by Trump to manipulate regularly scheduled democratic processes for partisan motives.

Redistricting after the census every 10 years has long been a politically driven process, where the party in charge at the state level typically tries to solidify — and perpetuate — its advantage. Texas Republicans did so in 2021, and as we’ve reported, Trump wants them to do it again this year, midway through the cycle, in an attempt to create five new Republican-leaning congressional districts. That way, Trump and his allies figure, Republicans would have a better chance of retaining their narrow majority in the U.S. House after the midterms, when the party in power typically loses seats.

Other states are threatening to do the same, to either help Republicans or try to thwart them.

A midcycle census would effectively broaden this battle for political power to all states. The carve-out for undocumented immigrants in population counts would shift political influence away from large Democratic strongholds, like California, New York, and Illinois, though it could also affect some GOP-dominated states that have large and growing populations of undocumented immigrants.

Hasn’t Trump tried something like this before?

During his first administration, Trump sought to influence the 2020 Census by calling for it to include a citizenship question. His explanation then was that the data was necessary to enforce the Voting Rights Act. But others saw it as a first step toward ultimately excluding noncitizens from the population counts used to apportion congressional seats and diminishing the power of states with large immigrant populations.

The Supreme Court ultimately blocked the administration’s effort, ruling that it lacked the authority to push through the change, and the 2020 census went out without the citizenship question. But immigrant rights groups complained that the publicity over that dispute may have compromised the data anyway. They raised concerns that noncitizens, whether they were in the country legally or not, would be afraid to respond to the census. The court battle also compressed the preparation time for the census, leaving less time for people to complete the surveys.

In July 2020, while the census was underway, the White House issued a presidential memorandum directing the Census Bureau to exclude noncitizens in the count it issues for apportionment, even though it had no citizenship question from which to sort out this number. Multiple Democratic-led states sued, arguing that the policy was unworkable and unconstitutional. The courts agreed, and blocked the plan from moving forward.",https://www.votebeat.org/resizer/v2/PK3OVGCPGBBCBLQQEMDWMYUXV4.jpg?smart=true&auth=e54fa26e761799c1f34e1d27f90eedac19b60e829cf38f568ff23d62f0cafc95&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-08-14 05:56:20.167858

Mesa County Sheriff Todd Rowell, Mesa County Undersheriff Matthew King, and Mesa County Sheriff's Office Investigations and Special Teams Captain Curtis Brammer are plaintiffs in the lawsuit, Rowell et al. v. Weiser et al., which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado on Aug. 7. They claim state immigration law is too vague.

Lawrence Pacheco, spokesman for the Colorado Attorney General's Office, said in a statement Wednesday to CBS Colorado, ""Colorado law is clear that law enforcement does law enforcement and not federal civil immigration enforcement. It's unfortunate that Mesa County filed this lawsuit. The Department of Law has a responsibility to follow facts and defend and enforce state law. We'll continue to take this duty seriously.""

On June 5, Deputy Alexander Zwinck pulled over Caroline Dias Goncalves for allegedly following another vehicle too closely, and he let her go with a warning. Zwinck reportedly shared the personal information of Dias Goncalves, who is originally from Brazil, in a Signal chat, which included ICE officials, leading to her later detainment by ICE agents.[This track is repeated later. I think it makes more sense to remove this one.]

A few weeks ago, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser filed a lawsuit against a Mesa County sheriff's deputy, who Weiser claims led federal immigration officers to a woman allegedly in the U.S. on an expired visa after a traffic stop. That deputy was allegedly using an encrypted Signal chat with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials.

Dias Goncalves, a nursing student living in Utah, was detained for more than 2 weeks by ICE and then released. According to Weiser, who is running for governor, she described the experience as ""the worst experience of her life.""

The Mesa County Sheriff's Office has since removed itself from Signal.r

The lawsuit filed in July by Weiser asserts that Zwinck unlawfully asked about, and then shared, the driver's personal identifying information with ICE. Colorado law places limits on the information local law enforcement officials can provide to federal immigration agents.

The Board of Mesa County Commissioners unanimously voted on Aug. 5 to approve the authorization to file the lawsuit against Polis and Weiser to ""protect the constitutional rights of Mesa County employees and to approve the use of public funds for legal representation.""

After the initial lawsuit was filed by Weiser, Rowell apologized for the incident and asked that the lawsuit be dismissed.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/01/18/65ba2ff4-081c-491f-8e4b-2618bf19571c/thumbnail/1200x630/604c18c7295f82451964392f87809bd6/mesa-county-sheriffs-office-patrol-vehicle.png,N,,2025-08-14 05:56:28.938594

Asked if there would be consequences if Mr. Putin did not take steps to end the war, Mr. Trump answered: “There will be consequences.
“I think he’s one of the greatest talents I’ve ever actually seen,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Crawford on Wednesday.","While crime is a concern for many residents, the situation on the ground differs from Mr. Trump’s hyperbolic statements in justifying the moves: Official data shows that crime is falling — particularly violent crime, which hit a 30-year low last year — after surging during the pandemic.

Mr. Trump, who has stoked fears of violent crimes in America’s cities going back more than 35 years, delivered increasingly dire threats after returning to office in January that if he was not satisfied with the city’s efforts to combat crime, he would order a federal takeover of Washington — in effect dissolving the local government to rule it directly.

Mr. Trump took his first firm steps in that direction last week, after a prominent young administration official was beaten by a mob of young assailants in an attempted carjacking in Washington.

Here’s what to know.

What is Trump doing on law enforcement in Washington? And how is he able to do it?

In the span of a week, Mr. Trump rapidly ratcheted up moves going over the heads of D.C. leaders. He has invoked his authority in overseeing federal law enforcement and a 1973 law that gives the president the power to take temporary control of the city’s police.

He ordered a surge of roughly 500 federal agents into the city beginning last Friday, after the beating of Edward Coristine — an operative of the Department of Government Efficiency — that week.

Then on Monday, Mr. Trump used a provision of the D.C. Home Rule Act, the law that established a local government and granted the city limited autonomy, to temporarily take over the Metropolitan Police Department, the city’s main police force.

A White House official said the current takeover would last 30 days, the maximum outlined in the law before the president must seek an extension of that authority through Congress. Mr. Trump has expressed interest in seeking such an extension.

What powers do federal agents have on city patrols?

On Tuesday, National Guard troops began to deploy in Washington for the first time since 2020, when Mr. Trump ordered a crackdown on Black Lives Matter protests in the city. Unlike the 50 states, D.C. does not control its National Guard unit and has little ability to push back against a federal deployment, as Gov. Gavin Newsom of California did earlier this year.

About a dozen troops were spotted on the National Mall on Tuesday as others gathered at the D.C. Armory, the headquarters of the D.C. National Guard. The initial deployment near the Washington Monument was a far cry from the aggressive policing carried out by the D.C. Guard in 2020. The troops were seen snapping photos of themselves with visitors, and left roughly two hours after they arrived.

One complicating factor of using federal agents to patrol Washington is that those agents do not have the same authority as police officers to arrest people for minor criminal offenses.

Trump administration officials have suggested that if federal agents see someone commit such a crime, they can stop and detain the person until a local police officer arrives and makes an arrest. City officials have said the National Guard troops would not have the authority to make arrests, as the use of the military for civilian law enforcement is limited by the Constitution.

Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington said this week that the president “has the authority, by virtue of the statute, to request services.” But she said city officials retained the authority to hire and fire people in the Police Department. She added that the police chief would work “hand in hand with the people that the president has designated.”

Could Trump fully take over D.C.?

Even before the current crisis, Mr. Trump held a significant amount of control over D.C. The president nominates the city’s judges and top prosecutor. Much of the City Council’s powers to make laws and plan the annual budget is also subject to congressional oversight.

Mr. Trump in effect exercised his presidential powers to set aside some of the city’s autonomy, declaring a public safety emergency and temporarily commandeering the city’s police force.

In theory, Mr. Trump could go further, with the approval of the Republican-controlled Congress. Lawmakers could extend the emergency, keeping the police under Mr. Trump’s authority for the duration.

Mr. Trump may also be able to keep the National Guard and other federal agents deployed in the city indefinitely. In California, a fraction of the Guard force that Mr. Trump had federalized is still operating under federal control months after being called up.

He could also direct federal units to more forcefully police the city, using tear gas, riot gear, armored vehicles, low-flying aircraft and other aggressive tools and tactics. The White House had previously said that federal agents in the city would be “identified, in marked units, and highly visible,” but those restrictions are not mandated by law, and those units could quickly shift to crack down on city residents.

The most extreme — and most unlikely — outcome is that Mr. Trump calls on Congress to repeal the D.C. Home Rule Act. That would dissolve the local government and place the city directly under federal control. The city’s 700,000 residents — more than the population of Vermont or Wyoming — would lose the ability to elect their mayor and local council members.

Mr. Trump has in recent months expressed support for a federal takeover, and Republicans in both the House and the Senate have introduced legislation to do so. But the chances of those laws passing are still very low. Under current Senate rules, such a law would need 60 votes to advance, and there are only 53 Republicans in the Senate.

Has something like this happened before?

Mr. Trump is the first president to use a declared emergency to wrest control of D.C.’s police. But federal police and the military have previously been deployed in the city, most recently during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.

Mr. Trump had also deployed the National Guard to Washington in 2020 as part of a crackdown on racial justice protests after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.

The D.C. Guard was at the forefront of that deployment, which was widely seen as a debacle at the time. Mr. Trump had also considered a deployment of active-duty military units like the 82nd Airborne, and senior Army leaders warned National Guard officers that Army units would replace them on the ground if they were insufficiently aggressive in controlling the protests.

There have been other encroachments on the city’s autonomy during home rule. Before this week, the most significant was a financial control board, established by Congress in 1995 to steer the city out of a fiscal crisis.

Earlier, teams of federal agents and local police officers rolled out of the parking lot of a U.S. Park Police facility in Southeast Washington. Scores of National Guard troops gathered on the lawn of the facility by a U.S. Marshals tent, and hundreds of official vehicles filled the parking lot and grass outside the facility in the Anacostia neighborhood.

With about 800 National Guard members, 500 federal law enforcement agents and Washington’s municipal police department, under his command, Mr. Trump, who announced the federal crackdown on crime in the capital on Monday, has vowed that the city would be “essentially crime-free” under his watch.

In the next day or two, the D.C. National Guard will build up to sending out about 100 to 200 soldiers at any given time in support of federal law enforcement officials, Col. Dave Butler, an Army spokesman, said Wednesday. City officials have said the National Guard troops would not have the authority to make arrests. They began arriving on the streets Tuesday evening.

Speaking at the Kennedy Center earlier Wednesday, Mr. Trump appeared to suggest that he could maintain oversight of crime-fighting in Washington beyond the 30 days that the law allows his administration to be in control of the D.C. police.

While the president has described the city in apocalyptic terms as a crime-infested wasteland, violent crime in Washington fell to a 30-year low last year and has continued to fall sharply this year.

At least 66 people have been arrested in Washington since Monday, according to federal officials. A federal task force that includes some local officers made 23 arrests on Monday evening, said Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary. On Tuesday, 43 more people were arrested, according to Kash Patel, the F.B.I. director. He said that the F.B.I. had assisted in 18 arrests so far this week, on charges that included unlawful gun possession, assault with a dangerous weapon and theft.

By comparison, in the first 10 days of August 2024, D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department made 635 arrests, or about 63 per day, according to department statistics. About 10 percent of those arrested were juveniles. The number of crimes recorded during the first 10 days of August was virtually the same this year as last year.

Washington’s Democratic mayor, Muriel Bowser, has shifted her stance on the president’s takeover several times, initially criticizing it, then saying she would try to make good use of the federal law enforcement help, then condemning it Tuesday night as an “authoritarian push” and an “intrusion on our autonomy.”

By Wednesday morning, she had softened her tone again and suggested in an interview on Fox 5 Washington that additional federal resources could help drive down crime.

Ms. Bowser deflected questions about whether she believed the president’s crackdown was good for the city and pointed instead to the need for more money to recruit and retain municipal police officers. “To the extent that you see the federal surge creating more arrests, taking more guns, M.P.D. officers would do the same thing,” she said.

When asked where her relationship with the president stood, Ms. Bowser responded: “I’m the mayor, and he’s the president. That’s always been our relationship.”

Asked whether he could convince Mr. Putin to stop targeting civilians, Mr. Trump said that it was a discussion he had already had with Mr. Putin. Russian forces have pounded Ukrainians with drones and missiles, sending civilians scrambling for shelter. Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin have spoken at least five times since Mr. Trump was sworn in for a second term in January, and Russian forces have pushed forward all the while.

“I’ve had a lot of good conversations with him,” Mr. Trump told a reporter during an appearance at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington — one that was originally about announcing this year’s class of Kennedy Center honorees. “Then I go home and I see that a rocket hit a nursing home, or a rocket hit an apartment building and people are laying dead in the street. So I guess the answer to that is no, because I’ve had this conversation.”

Mr. Trump struck a similar tone when asked if he had seen reporting in The New York Times on Tuesday that Russia was behind a widespread breach of federal court systems. The system that was exposed holds highly sensitive records with information that could reveal sources and people charged with national security crimes.

“Are you surprised? You know?” Mr. Trump said. “That’s what they do. They’re good at it. We’re good at it. We’re actually better at it.”

He was also asked if he planned to bring up the reporting with Mr. Putin, but did not answer.

Mr. Trump has long bragged about his ability to make deals and use tough talk to get his way, but his relative softness toward Mr. Putin has long perplexed analysts. Some view the latest meeting as a haphazardly planned get-together that risks damaging American interests and blunting the power of the presidency, if Mr. Trump returns to Washington empty-handed.

“His rhetorical posture is completely acquiescent,” said Michael A. McFaul, a former ambassador to Russia under President Barack Obama. “The risk is that it makes the leader of the United States of America, the most powerful person in the world, look weak.”

When he has spoken of helping end the war, Mr. Trump has so far repeated proposals floated by the Russians, such as a swap of territory that could include the entire eastern region known as the Donbas, an idea already flatly rejected by President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that he had held a call with European leaders, including Mr. Zelensky, and that the Ukrainian president would be included in a quick follow-up meeting if everything went well. But even on that point, Mr. Trump doubled back.

“Now there may be no second meeting,” Mr. Trump said. “Because if I feel that it’s not appropriate to have it, because I didn’t get the answers that we have to have, then we’re not going to have a second meeting.”

Fiona Hill, who served as senior director for European and Russian affairs in the National Security Council during Mr. Trump’s first term, said that Mr. Trump was not the only leader taking a risk by taking the meeting. Mr. Putin’s campaign against Ukraine has extended far longer than he anticipated, a miscalculation that has chipped away at the idea that he is a grand strategist, Ms. Hill said.

There is the risk, she added, that Mr. Trump again loses patience with the peacemaking process, as he has in recent weeks.

“Maybe we’re getting there, where that view of Putin is going to shift,” Ms. Hill said of Mr. Trump. “And that is dangerous for Putin.”

Still, without Mr. Zelensky present, the conditions of the coming meeting favor Mr. Putin, who had issued the invitation to Mr. Trump to meet. Mr. Trump’s predecessor, Joseph R. Biden Jr., viewed Mr. Putin a “war criminal,” issuing sanctions meant to cripple the finances of the Russian leader and those around him. But on Friday, Mr. Trump will fly across the country to welcome Mr. Putin to an American military base to see what he has in mind.

That laid-back approach — Mr. Trump earlier this week described it as a “feel-out meeting” — seemed to conflict with his threat that Mr. Putin may actually face consequences if he does not agree to end the war. Since Mr. Trump took office, many of the U.S. sanctions levied against Russia have weakened, and Mr. Trump did not say on Wednesday if he would strengthen them or come up with something else.

Asked if there would be consequences if Mr. Putin did not take steps to end the war, Mr. Trump answered: “There will be consequences. I don’t have to say. There will be very severe consequences.”

Much of the leverage Mr. Trump could have used with Mr. Putin might have come in the weeks leading up to the meeting, said Steven Pifer, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former ambassador to Ukraine under President Bill Clinton. Mr. Trump had expressed public frustration over Mr. Putin’s ignoring his calls to halt his offensive against the Ukrainians.

But so far, none of the threats have materialized into the kind of punishments that could force Mr. Putin to change course. Mr. Trump could have chosen to divert some $300 billion of frozen Russian central bank assets to Ukraine, Mr. Pifer said, or could have prioritized the production and shipment of American weapons purchased by the Europeans to maximize quick assistance to Kyiv. Mr. Trump has done none of those things, instead wondering aloud if “tariffs and stuff” might be the solution.

“You’re not going to get Putin to change course until he concludes he cannot achieve his goals on the battlefield,” Mr. Pifer said. “Had Trump wisely used that leverage and persuaded Putin that this would start happening, he would have dealt himself some cards.”

But by a 2-to-1 vote, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled that under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, only the Government Accountability Office, which serves as Congress's independent watchdog, could challenge the president’s efforts to withhold foreign aid funding. The panel found that groups that receive government funding — in this instance, a number of global health nonprofits — do not have cause to challenge Mr. Trump’s funding cuts.

The decision lifted a lower court’s order that had required the administration to continue processing foreign aid payments with funds Congress had budgeted.

In finding that the Trump administration had unlawfully delayed money Congress appropriated, a lower court previously required the government to make available all the foreign assistance funds Congress allocated for fiscal year 2024.

That included nearly $4 billion to spend on global health activities until September, and more than $6 billion for H.I.V./AIDS programs through 2028. The decision on Wednesday noted that the administration had “paid out substantially all the amounts owed on existing contracts” as required by the lower court ruling.

Barring further action from the courts, the ruling gave the Trump administration leeway to slash the funds, cut the agencies that administer foreign assistance programs and terminate entire aid programs that Congress had funded.

On numerous occasions this year, the Government Accountability Office has found that the Trump administration illegally impounded funds authorized by Congress, including money meant for public infrastructure and early child education. By June, the legislative watchdog also had more than 40 additional investigations underway, with some of the impoundment inquiries focused on the government’s handling of foreign aid, according to documents previously viewed by The Times.

Under the law, the accountability office has the power to sue to force the release of impounded funds, but it has not done so thus far, letting lawsuits launched by outside groups play out. The agency’s leader, Comptroller General Gene Dodaro, previously described a legal challenge as a last resort.

Elisha Dunn-Georgiou, the president of the Global Health Council, one of the groups involved in the lawsuit, said the organization would continue to fight to make the funding available again.

“While today’s decision is very disappointing, Global Health Council will continue our efforts to protect the global health sector and the critical work being done around the world,” she said in a statement.

Wednesday’s ruling was the latest in a series of decisions by appeals courts that have in recent weeks overturned efforts by lower court judges to curb sweeping actions by Mr. Trump.

On his first day in office, President Trump announced a review of the country’s foreign aid policies. At the same time, he froze foreign development assistance and humanitarian aid while top aides, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, began dismantling the United States Agency for International Development, the main U.S. aid agency, and carried out a campaign to end funding for global projects.

Days later, the Trump administration also placed a moratorium on new funding for projects administered by the State Department or U.S.A.I.D. Both agencies followed by suspending or terminating thousands of grants and denying invoices.

A number of foreign aid nonprofits that had for years depended on federal funding filed lawsuits early this year, arguing that President Trump had overstepped his authority and usurped Congress’s power over spending.

Lower court judges in several cases agreed, finding that in unilaterally shutting down various funding streams, the Trump administration violated the separation of powers between Congress and the executive branch. In March, Judge Amir H. Ali of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia blocked the cuts involving foreign aid and ordered the Trump administration to keep paying out funds Congress had set aside.

Judge Karen L. Henderson, an appointee of President George H.W. Bush, who wrote Wednesday’s majority opinion, said the federal law lays out a clear process for challenging impoundment, requiring the head of the G.A.O. to sue on Congress’s behalf. She wrote that the grant recipients who had brought the early lawsuits in February could not, therefore, rely on the claim that Mr. Trump had exceeded his authority.

Lawsuits challenging the president, she wrote, “cannot be recast as constitutional claims through the mere invocation of the separation of powers.”

Judge Gregory G. Katsas, a Trump appointee, voted along with Judge Henderson.

In a dissenting opinion, Judge Florence Y. Pan, who was appointed by President Joseph R. Biden Jr., wrote that courts can and should still scrutinize instances in which a president appeared to have unlawfully overridden Congress. She said that applied even though Congress has tasked the head of the G.A.O. with bringing claims under the impoundment act.

“The court’s holding that the grantees have no constitutional cause of action is as startling as it is erroneous,” she wrote. “The majority holds that when the president refuses to spend funds appropriated by Congress based on policy disagreements, that is merely a statutory violation and raises no constitutional alarm bells.”

Tony Romm contributed reporting.

Mr. Trump’s announcement, which he made from the Kennedy Center, is his first since he purged the renowned concert venue of its Biden-appointed board members, fired the center’s president and made himself chairman.

It revealed his growing influence over the center and its programs as well as his veto power over the list of honorees. He had personally approved each of the recipients, he said, and rejected several other suggested artists because they were “wokesters.”

But while some of this year’s recipients have expressed support for Mr. Trump, the list doesn’t read like a blatantly political roster.

George Strait, country king

Mr. Strait, who was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2006, is credited with helping to bring country music back to a more traditional sound, at a time when the genre was gravitating toward pop influence. Mr. Strait, a Texan, looks as well as sounds the part of a country music legend, having preferred a signature urban cowboy style since his first breakout hits in the 1980s. In the decades since, he has enjoyed remarkable success, racking up 60 No. 1 hit songs on the country charts — the most of any artist in any genre.

Gloria Gaynor, disco queen

Ms. Gaynor, who was inducted into the Dance Hall of Fame in 2005, is one of the most recognizable voices of the disco movement that peaked in the United States during the 1970s. Her popularity, however, has far outlasted that era, thanks to the lasting commercial success of her biggest hit, “I Will Survive” — which also seems to be a personal favorite of Mr. Trump’s.

“Unbelievable song,” Mr. Trump quipped during his announcement, adding that “it’s one of those few that get better every time you hear it.” The song is so recognizable and popular that it has occasionally been repurposed as an anti-Trump anthem, including in 2017, when celebrities recorded themselves singing it in anticipation of Mr. Trump’s first inauguration.

Kiss, hard rock and heavy makeup

Kiss, known beyond its fan base for its members’ face paint, elaborate costumes and stage performances that feature theatrics and pyrotechnics, has had its style alternatively described as hard rock, heavy metal, glam rock and glam metal. Regardless of classification, the group, which formed in the 1970s, had a huge influence on bands that followed, helping to popularize grandiose live performances. Kiss, which continues to enjoy significant commercial success and crossover appeal, was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014.

Michael Crawford, the original Phantom

Mr. Crawford might not be a household name in the United States, but the decorated British stage actor has originated and popularized a series of iconic roles in musical theater. He was the original Phantom in Andrew Lloyd Webber’s “Phantom of the Opera” when it premiered in London, and won a Tony Award for the role after it moved to Broadway. Long before that, he sang the role of Cornelius Hackl in the 1969 film version of “Hello, Dolly!” starring Barbra Streisand.

“I think he’s one of the greatest talents I’ve ever actually seen,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Crawford on Wednesday.

Sylvester Stallone, action hero

For many moviegoers, Mr. Stallone’s visage is synonymous with title roles he popularized in two franchises that produced multiple films and more than $1 billion in revenue: Rocky, about a hapless Philadelphia boxer who becomes the heavyweight champion, and Rambo, about an Army special forces veteran of the Vietnam War who fights bad guys, including corrupt cops.

In addition to his film credentials, Mr. Stallone is a stalwart supporter of Mr. Trump, whom he called “the second George Washington” shortly after his election in November. Mr. Trump has also designated Mr. Stallone one of three “special ambassadors” to Hollywood, tasked with bringing film production that has been taking place overseas to the United States.

Mr. Farage confirmed the meeting, saying in a statement: “Good to catch up with my old friend JD Vance this morning. Everything we discussed remains confidential.”

Earlier, the official said, Mr. Vance met Robert Jenrick, a Conservative lawmaker who is viewed a rising force on the right flank of the Conservative Party. But he did not meet the party’s leader, Kemi Badenoch, an omission that both sides chalked up to logistical hurdles.

“The vice president met with a number of people during his trip to the United Kingdom,” Mr. Vance’s press secretary, Taylor Van Kirk, said in a statement. “He specifically tried to see Kemi Badenoch — a friend of his — but a meeting was not possible due to their scheduling conflicts.”

The vice president’s office also declined to disclose what Mr. Vance and Mr. Farage talked about. But the two share common ground on issues like free-speech rights, which both have claimed are under threat in Britain.

Mr. Jenrick, who endorsed President Trump before the American election, has likewise raised alarms over what he has described as an erosion of free expression under Britain’s Labour government.

“The left’s determination to shut down debate around immigration has created a chilling environment for free speech,” Mr. Jenrick said recently, in language that hews closely to Mr. Vance’s views.

In meeting Mr. Farage and Mr. Jenrick in the Cotswolds, a picturesque region west of London, the vice president got a glimpse of the intense battle for the right that is now raging in British politics. It was also a chance for two rivals to vie for validation from a potential heir to Mr. Trump’s MAGA movement.

“It’s difficult to see Vance’s failure to meet with Badenoch as any other than a calculated snub to her and a vote of confidence in Jenrick,” said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London.

Mr. Jenrick, Professor Bale said, “couldn’t make it more obvious that he wants her job if he tried and is well on the road to becoming a MAGA-friendly — indeed, MAGA-style — right-wing culture warrior.”

Mr. Jenrick has fashioned himself as an immigration hard-liner and is viewed by political analysts as a potential challenger to Ms. Badenoch as Tory leader. She has struggled to stabilize the Conservative Party’s poll ratings since its devastating defeat to Labour in a general election last summer.

In a recent column in The Mail on Sunday, Mr. Jenrick said he supported those who protest outside hotels used to house asylum seekers. Last summer, these hotels became targets for violent attacks after a British son of Rwandan migrants killed three young girls in a stabbing rampage.

“I care more for my daughters’ safety than the rights of foreign criminals,” Mr. Jenrick wrote, drawing a mocking reply from Mr. Farage, who claims the Conservatives are to blame for a wave of illegal immigration.

“Your party let 100,000 of them into the UK,” Mr. Farage posted on social media, referring to asylum seekers, many of whom cross the English Channel in rickety boats. “No wonder you’re frightened for the safety of your daughters, Robert.”

During a meeting with Prime Minister Keir Starmer in the Oval Office in February, Mr. Vance alluded to the arrest of people for posting inflammatory material on platforms like Facebook or X, saying it threatened “American technology companies and, by extension, American citizens.”

On this visit, Mr. Vance has softened his tone. That may reflect a desire not to spoil Mr. Trump’s planned state visit in September, as well as the fact that Mr. Vance was being hosted by Mr. Lammy, a minister in Mr. Starmer’s government, at a government-owned estate, Chevening, in Kent.

In addition to his political meetings, the vice president has been immersed in planning for Mr. Trump’s meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia later this week. On Wednesday afternoon, he joined a video conference call with Mr. Trump, European leaders and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.

After Mr. Vance leaves the Cotswolds, he plans to travel to Scotland, following Mr. Trump, who visited his golf courses there last month. There were other echoes of the boss on Mr. Vance’s social schedule.

He invited Thomas Skinner, a pillow salesman who appeared on the British version of Mr. Trump’s reality show, “The Apprentice,” to a barbecue on Tuesday evening. Mr. Skinner posted a picture of himself and the vice president, writing, “Cracking night in the beautiful English countryside with JD, his friends and family. Once in a lifetime. Bosh.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/13/multimedia/13Trump-news-promo-245am-pltc/13Trump-news-promo-245am-pltc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 05:56:25.221033

He will be detained until a deportation decision is made, according to the agency.

This comes after President Donald Trump's recent move to increase the presence of federal law enforcement in Washington in an effort to cut down on crime in the district, although the mayor has said crime had already been on the decline in the city.

""The media and Democrat politicians are force-feeding the public false information that U.S. citizen children are being deported,"" Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, told Newsweek.

The complaint contends that the deportation occurred without adequate notice, legal counsel, or arrangements for the child's ongoing medical care.

Why It Matters

Immigration authorities have been under heightened scrutiny amid allegations of misconduct, with the agency at the center of the national debate over immigration policy. That spotlight has widened since President Donald Trump ordered a ramp-up in arrests to fulfill his pledge of mass deportations, prompting renewed questions about the legality and human impact of ICE's enforcement practices.

What To Know

Though they are U.S. citizens and were born in Louisiana, the boy and his 7-year-old sister were deported to Honduras along with their 25-year-old mother, who is a Honduran citizen, on April 25, according to a federal lawsuit filed in the Middle District of Louisiana on July 31. The filing uses pseudonyms for the family, referring to the brother and sister as ""Romeo"" and ""Ruby"" and their mother as ""Rosario.""

Before their deportations, Romeo, now 5, was receiving ""life-saving"" treatment at a New Orleans children's hospital for his ""rare and aggressive form"" of cancer, following his diagnosis at age 2, a complaint says.

""It has been scary and overwhelming,"" Rosario said in a press release on July 31.

""As a direct consequence of ICE's unlawful conduct, Romeo was deprived of much-needed continuity in his treatment, and he has faced substantial health risks due to his inability to access emergency specialized care and the routine critical oncological care that was available to him in the United States,"" the family's attorneys wrote in court documents.

According to court documents, the family was detained during a routine ICE check-in and later transported to an airport for deportation. The complaint states that the mother was not informed that her attorney was attempting to contact her, nor that her husband was seeking custody of their U.S. citizen daughter.

Court filings also allege that the family was held in a van for approximately five hours without communication and later returned to a hotel, still without the ability to contact anyone outside their immediate environment. The complaint asserts that the deportations were executed without providing the family an opportunity to arrange for the care of the children, including the young boy undergoing treatment for advanced kidney cancer.

The lawsuit is being brought by the National Immigration Project, Gibson Dunn, Most & Associates, and Ware Immigration on behalf of Romeo's family and a second family who, according to the filing, were deported by ICE under similar circumstances on April 25.

The second family is identified in court documents as including ""Julia,"" a 30-year-old mother from Honduras, and her two daughters, ""Jade,"" age 2, a U.S. citizen born in Baton Rouge, and ""Janelle,"" age 11, a Honduran citizen. All names in the filing are pseudonyms.

The lawsuit alleges that ICE did not give Rosario or Julia the opportunity to decide whether their children would accompany them to Honduras or remain in the United States with other family members.

""The media and Democrat politicians are force-feeding the public false information that U.S. citizen children are being deported,"" Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, told Newsweek.

""This is false and irresponsible. Rather than separate their families, ICE asked the mothers if they wanted to be removed with their children or if they wanted ICE to place the children with someone safe the parent designates. The parents in this instance made the determination to take their children with them back to Honduras,"" she said.

""Further, when there is an underlying health issue, ICE makes sure that treatment is available in the country to which the illegal alien is being removed. The implication that ICE would deny a child the medical care they need is flatly FALSE, and it is an insult to the men and women of federal law enforcement. ICE ALWAYS prioritizes the health, safety, and well-being of all detainees in its care,"" she added.

The lawsuit, J.L.V. v. Acuna, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana, names Attorney General Pam Bondi, the Department of Homeland Security, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, ICE and ICE Director Todd Lyons, as well as New Orleans ICE Field Office Director Brian Acuna, Assistant Field Office Director Scott Ladwig, and the office's former director, Mellissa Harper, as defendants.

The lawsuit requests the immediate return of the family to the United States, as well as recognition of their legal rights and compensation for damages.

What People Are Saying

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin: ""DHS takes its responsibility to protect children seriously and will continue to work with federal law enforcement to ensure that children are safe and protected. Parents, who are here illegally, can take control of their departure. Through the CBP Home App—the Trump Administration is giving parents illegally in the country a chance to take full control of their departure and self-deport, with the potential ability to return the legal, right way and come back to live the American dream. It is free and available for all mobile devices.""

National Immigration Project attorney Stephanie Alvarez-Jones told McClatchy News: ""ICE put these families through a series of incredibly traumatizing experiences, taking actions that are completely shocking from a human perspective and illegal even by ICE's own standards.""

Rosario said in a press release: ""After so many years in the United States, it has been devastating to be sent to Honduras. Life in Honduras is incredibly hard. I don't have the resources to care for my children the way they need. Since returning, my daughter has gotten sick and struggled with anxiety, and I've been struggling with my own health issues too. I was diagnosed with high anxiety and prescribed medication for stress. It's not the same as living in your own country. It's been painful every step of the way.""

Sirine Shebaya, Executive Director of the National Immigration Project, said in a press release: ""ICE's actions in this case are not only unlawful, they are cruel and show a complete disregard for family values and the well-being of children.""

Court documents read: ""Romeo needs regular specialized care and follow-up treatment to this day.""

After leaving the military, Barco served 15 years in prison for attempted murder, according to Stout and Barco’s attorney.
Barco’s advocates and attorneys say they fear he will be deported to Venezuela or Cuba, where he has family ties.","AURORA, Colo. (KDVR) — A Colorado combat war veteran who is being held by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Aurora is anxiously waiting to see if he will be deported to a country where his attorneys say he could be tortured.

That combat veteran came to this country legally when he was four years old and later served in the military, where he was awarded a Purple Heart. How much longer 39-year-old Jose Barco must stay at the ICE detention facility in Aurora is now in the hands of an immigration judge.

That judge will decide whether Barco will be deported or have his removal deferred, according to Barco’s attorney. That attorney and an advocate spoke after Barco’s hearing at the detention center.

“This is a punishment that could result in his indefinite detention, torture and potential loss of his life,” Advocate Anna Stout said.

Barco came to the United States legally with his parents from Venezuela when he was four years old. He later joined the military and was stationed in Colorado Springs, and served two tours in Iraq, where he was injured in combat. He applied for citizenship status while deployed in 2006, but his representatives said his paperwork was lost.

His representatives said his family fled Cuba and went to Venezuela after his father was exiled before coming to the United States as political refugees. Barco has no ties in Venezuela or Cuba, which his advocates say further puts him at an elevated risk if he were to be removed to either country, according to Stout.

“The crux of this case is the fact that we shouldn’t be here today. This should not be a US veteran in removal proceedings because he should have been made a us citizen as this country promised him when he went to war for us and when he fought for us and bled for us,” Stout said.

After leaving the military, Barco served 15 years in prison for attempted murder, according to Stout and Barco’s attorney.

ICE arrested him immediately after he was paroled. Barco’s advocates and attorneys say they fear he will be deported to Venezuela or Cuba, where he has family ties.

“It’s unimaginable. He is being judged off one of his worst days instead of a lot of good things he had in the United States as far as serving the country,” Barco’s wife, Tia Barco, said.

His attorneys are asking that his deportation be deferred under a treaty designed to prevent torture. They say they fear he would be tortured because of his military service.

Attorneys say a better place might be a facility in Mexico, where he could get treatment for his PTSD and his past suicidal ideations. But the goal is to have him released in the U.S. until his future is more stable and secure.

A judge could rule on this case any day now, according to his attorney.",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/08/96489C5DCE2AE6D2BA7B1CD1C6C4D91C.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-14 05:56:47.295079

U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen didn’t issue a ruling following a hearing in federal court in Baltimore, but he expressed skepticism about the administration’s extraordinary legal maneuver, which attorneys for the Maryland judges called completely unprecedented.

Cullen serves in the Western District of Virginia, but he was tapped to oversee the Baltimore case because all of Maryland’s 15 federal judges are named as defendants, a highly unusual circumstance that reflects the Republican administration’s aggressive response to courts that slow or stop its policies.

At issue in the lawsuit is an order signed by Chief Maryland District Judge George L. Russell III that prevents the administration from immediately deporting any immigrants seeking review of their detention in a Maryland federal court. The order blocks their removal until 4 p.m. on the second business day after their habeas corpus petition is filed.

The Justice Department, which filed the lawsuit in June, says the automatic pause impedes President Donald Trump’s authority to enforce immigration laws.

But attorneys for the Maryland judges argue that the suit was intended to limit the power of the judiciary to review certain immigration proceedings while the administration pursues a mass deportation agenda.

“The executive branch seeks to bring suit in the name of the United States against a co-equal branch of government,” said Paul Clement, a prominent conservative lawyer who served as Republican President George W. Bush’s solicitor general. “There really is no precursor for this suit”

Clement listed several other avenues the administration could have taken to challenge the order, such as filing an appeal in an individual habeas case.

Cullen also asked the government’s lawyers whether they had considered that alternative, which he said could have been more expeditious than suing all the judges. He also questioned what would happen if the administration accelerated its current approach and sued a federal appellate bench, or even the Supreme Court.

“I think you probably picked up on the fact that I have some skepticism,” Cullen told Justice Department attorney Elizabeth Themins Hedges when she stood to present the Trump administration’s case.

Hedges denied that the case would “open the floodgates” to similar lawsuits. She said the government is simply seeking relief from a legal roadblock preventing effective immigration enforcement.

“The United States is a plaintiff here because the United States is being harmed,” she said.

Cullen, who was nominated to the federal bench by Trump in 2019, said he would issue a ruling by Labor Day on whether to dismiss the lawsuit. If allowed to proceed, he could also grant the government’s request for a preliminary injunction that would block the Maryland federal bench from following the conditions of the chief judge’s order.

The automatic pause in deportation proceedings sought to maintain existing conditions and the potential jurisdiction of the court, ensure immigrant petitioners are able to participate in court proceedings and access attorneys and give the government “fulsome opportunity to brief and present arguments in its defense,” according to the order.

Russell also said the court had received an influx of habeas petitions after hours that “resulted in hurried and frustrating hearings in that obtaining clear and concrete information about the location and status of the petitioners is elusive.” Habeas petitions allow people to challenge their detention by the government.

The administration accused Maryland judges of prioritizing a regular schedule, saying in court documents that “a sense of frustration and a desire for greater convenience do not give Defendants license to flout the law.”

Among the judges named in the lawsuit is Paula Xinis, who found the administration illegally deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador in March — a case that quickly became a flashpoint in Trump’s immigration crackdown. Abrego Garcia was held in a notorious Salvadoran megaprison, where he claims to have been beaten and tortured.",https://molawyersmedia.com/files/2025/08/Thomas-Cullen.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 09:57:31.726032

So far in 2025, ICE has arrested at least 1,032 people in Washington. July’s tally marked a slight decline from June, when the agency reported 275 arrests — the highest monthly total this year. From January through May, monthly totals ranged from 84 to 137.

The state’s trends mirror national figures showing fewer arrests in July but more deportations. The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse reported an average of 84 more removals per day in July compared to June.

ICE also “encountered” at least 909 people in Washington in July, up from 818 in June. The agency defines an encounter as any instance in which it considers taking enforcement action against a person.

In recent weeks, organizers cancelled two major local events celebrating Hispanic and Latino culture, citing “safety concerns” and a recent uptick in ICE raids.

THING NW Festival 2025 cancelled its Aug. 16 Latino musical performance lineup. The annual Pacific Northwest Folklórico Festival was also cancelled for similar reasons.

Del Castillo is represented by Upper Seven Law.
Del Castillo was leaving a work site with a coworker, in separate vehicles, this spring when Hingiss followed behind the two cars.
The complaint states that the Border Patrol agent noted that Del Castillo may have legal status.
“Del Castillo’s story shows why untrained municipal police should not masquerade as federal immigration cops,” the lawsuit states.","WHITEFISH, MT – A man who was held in a federal detention facility after Whitefish police pulled him over for an allegedly faulty taillight in April has filed a lawsuit alleging racial profiling and a violation of his constitutional rights against the city of Whitefish, Whitefish Police Chief Bridger Kelch, and Officer Michael Hingiss, who conducted the traffic stop.

Beker Rengifo Del Castillo, 33, is a Venezuelan citizen who was leaving a job near Whitefish Lake on April 24 when Hingiss stopped him, according to the lawsuit, allegedly for a broken brake light. Hingiss called Customs and Border Protection, and Del Castillo was left in the custody of a Customs and Border Protection officer and subsequently taken to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Tacoma, Washington, “a horrific and traumatic experience,” according to court documents.

Whitefish City Attorney Angela Jacobs told the Daily Montanan in an email that the city cannot comment on active litigation.

The lawsuit was filed in federal district court in Missoula. Del Castillo is represented by Upper Seven Law.

In the lawsuit, Del Castillo’s attorneys allege that Hingiss called Customs and Border Protection because Beker “only speaks Spanish” and Border Patrol may “want to check him,” despite Del Castillo providing “proof of his lawful presence in the United States in the form of his valid REAL ID compliant driver’s license.”

According to the complaint, Del Castillo entered the United States in July 2024 through the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela Parole Program. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services approved Del Castillo’s application for work authorization on July 23, 2024, and issued him a Social Security number.

Del Castillo was leaving a work site with a coworker, in separate vehicles, this spring when Hingiss followed behind the two cars. According to the complaint, Hingiss called Customs and Border Protection “due to a language barrier,” but then left Del Castillo with a federal officer to “continue” the immigration investigation. The complaint states that the Border Patrol agent noted that Del Castillo may have legal status.

“Del Castillo’s story shows why untrained municipal police should not masquerade as federal immigration cops,” the lawsuit states.

Following his transfer to an ICE detention facility, Del Castillo was held until April 30, and then released with “no place to stay and no way to get home.”

“Because of this incident, (Del Castillo) is reluctant to leave his home and attempts to avoid all contact with law enforcement, fearing he will again be detained and incarcerated based on discrimination and without cause,” the complaint states. “(He) quit his jobs to avoid the risk of being racially profiled and incarcerated without basis while driving to and from work.”

According to the complaint, the Whitefish Police Department has a policy about immigration violations that Hingiss broke while detaining Del Castillo and calling Border Patrol. The policies include prohibiting officers from detaining “any individual, for any length of time, for a civil violation of federal immigration laws or a related civil warrant;” and no one who is “otherwise ready to be released should continue to be detained only because questions about the individual’s status are unresolved.”

The policies, according to the lawsuit, also state that an officer must notify a supervisor when detaining someone for an immigration violation, and seek approval before conducting an arrest for an alleged immigration offense and before transferring an individual to federal immigration authorities.

During a Whitefish City Council meeting in May, Police Chief Kelch told councilors the city had policies that “that strictly prohibit biased-based policing and improper profiling,” according to reporting by the Flathead Beacon. Kelch also stated that “we did not call Border Patrol for interpretation services.”

The lawsuit seeks actual, general and punitive damages and legal costs from the city of Whitefish and the police officers.

The group says they’ve already gotten first-hand accounts of abusive behavior from President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration.

A BNHR volunteer recently described federal immigration agents arresting a parent in front of a school and forcing her children off the school bus. Other complaints include agents showing up for one person and arresting many.

By summer, Congress delivered.

The Republican Party’s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts that Trump signed into law July 4 included what’s arguably the biggest boost of funds yet to the Department of Homeland Security — nearly $170 billion, almost double its annual budget.

The staggering sum is powering the nation’s sweeping new Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, delivering gripping scenes of people being pulled off city streets and from job sites across the nation — the cornerstone of Trump’s promise for the largest domestic deportation operation in American history. Homeland Security confirmed over the weekend ICE is working to set up detention sites at certain military bases.

“We’re getting them out at record numbers,” Trump said at the White House bill signing ceremony. “We have an obligation to, and we’re doing it.”

Money flows, and so do questions

The crush of new money is setting off alarms in Congress and beyond, raising questions from lawmakers in both major political parties who are expected to provide oversight. The bill text provided general funding categories — almost $30 billion for ICE officers, $45 billion for detention facilities, $10 billion for the office of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — but few policy details or directives. Homeland Security recently announced $50,000 ICE hiring bonuses.

And it’s not just the big bill’s fresh infusion of funds fueling the president’s agenda of 1 million deportations a year.

In the months since Trump took office, his administration has been shifting as much as $1 billion from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other accounts to pay for immigration enforcement and deportation operations, lawmakers said.

“Your agency is out of control,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told Noem during a Senate committee hearing in the spring.

The senator warned that Homeland Security would “go broke” by July.

Noem quickly responded that she always lives within her budget.

But Murphy said later in a letter to Homeland Security, objecting to its repurposing funds, that ICE was being directed to spend at an “indefensible and unsustainable rate to build a mass deportation army,” often without approval from Congress.

This past week, the new Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York, along with a subcommittee chairman, Rep. Michael Guest of Mississippi, requested a briefing from Noem on the border security components of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or OBBBA, which included $46 billion over the next four years for Trump’s long-sought U.S.-Mexico border wall.

“We write today to understand how the Department plans to outlay this funding to deliver a strong and secure homeland for years to come,” the GOP lawmakers said in a letter to the homeland security secretary, noting border apprehensions are at record lows.

“We respectfully request that you provide Committee staff with a briefing on the Department’s plan to disburse OBBBA funding,” they wrote, seeking a response by Aug. 22.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to The Associated Press the department is in daily discussions with the committee “to honor all briefing requests including the spend plan for the funds allocated” through the new law.

“ICE is indeed pursuing all available options to expand bedspace capacity,” she said. “This process does include housing detainees at certain military bases, including Fort Bliss.”

Deportations move deep into communities

All together, it’s what observers on and off Capitol Hill see as a fundamental shift in immigration policy — enabling DHS to reach far beyond the U.S. southern border and deep into communities to conduct raids and stand up detention facilities as holding camps for immigrants.

The Defense Department, the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies are being enlisted in what Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, calls a “whole of government” approach.

“They’re orienting this huge shift,” Bush-Joseph said, as deportation enforcement moves “inward.”

The flood of cash comes when Americans’ views on immigration are shifting. Polling showed 79% of U.S. adults say immigration is a “good thing” for the country, having jumped substantially from 64% a year ago, according to Gallup. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults say immigration is a bad thing right now.

At the same time, Trump’s approval rating on immigration has slipped. According to a July AP-NORC poll, 43% of U.S. adults said they approved of his handling of immigration, down slightly from 49% in March.

Americans are watching images of often masked officers arresting college students, people at Home Depot lots, parents, workers and a Tunisian musician. Stories abound of people being whisked off to detention facilities, often without allegations of wrongdoing beyond being unauthorized to remain in the U.S.

A new era of detention centers

Detention centers are being stood up, from “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida to the repurposed federal prison at Leavenworth, Kansas, and the proposed new “Speedway Slammer” in Indiana. Flights are ferrying migrants not just home or to El Salvador’s notorious mega-prison but far away to Africa and beyond.

Homan has insisted in recent interviews those being detained and deported are the “worst of the worst,” and he dismissed as “garbage” the reports showing many of those being removed have not committed violations beyond their irregular immigration status.

“There’s no safe haven here,” Homan said recently outside the White House. “We’re going to do exactly what President Trump has promised the American people he’d do.”

Back in February, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Budget Committee, emerged from their private meeting saying Trump administration officials were “begging for money.”

As Graham got to work, Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a leading deficit hawk, proposed an alternative border package, at $39 billion, a fraction of the size.

But Paul’s proposal was quickly dismissed. He was among a handful of GOP lawmakers who joined all Democrats in voting against the final tax and spending cuts bill.

It’s time to talk about women’s economics with attitude. It’s time to laugh at what is often absurd and call out what is dangerous. By focusing on voices not typically part of mainstream man-to-man economic discourse, Women Unscrewing Screwnomics will bring you news of hopeful and practical changes and celebrate an economy waged as life—not as war.

Remember the old days, when here in America, you were innocent until proven guilty? Right now, a presumption of war is entering every corner of our land of the free, from trade wars to bloody wars in Ukraine to Gaza, and political wars between Texas vs. California and Illinois about illegal threats of gerrymandering.

Reserve forces of the U.S. Army, 800 National Guardsmen, and (for some reason) 120 FBI agents, are being newly assigned by El Presidente to patrolling our national capital. He cites crime as his motive, which has dropped by a third in recent (Biden) years.

He’s done this kind of deployment already in Los Angeles for the last 60 days and predicts other cities are on his list: Baltimore, Chicago, Oakland and New York City—all places that just happen to vote blue and elect Democrats.

Governor “Newscum”—yes, that’s what our nation’s top executive at his Aug. 11 news conference, called the top executive of our biggest state economy, the fourth biggest economy in the world—just requested on Aug. 6 that the federal government “provide the total cost to taxpayers for this unlawful deployment of 5,000 soldiers.”

Early on, the Pentagon testified to Congress that it would spend, oh, just about $134 million for the LA deployment.

I’m just a mom—one of those “people that people come out of,” as Pete Hegseth’s pastor recently described us women—but it seems to me that this estimate low-balls the price of fixing three meals a day with groceries these days, as well as transporting and lodging 5,000 hungry young men.

A federal court is currently hearing arguments in the case of Newsom v. Trump, with the state’s attorneys presenting evidence that the LA deployment was unlawful. An amicus brief has been filed on behalf of a bipartisan group of 25 former governors, who alone once had the sole authority to deploy their state’s National Guard.

So, is this the “political theater” that Newsom claims? If it is, its cost is something Congress, the so-called People’s House, with control of the nation’s purse, should take into account. If it isn’t, they are still responsible for how our money is spent. This Congress in particular should be accountable for government efficiency—or as DOGE might put it, waste and abuse.

California’s economy is expected to contract later this year, thanks to cruel immigration raids and global tariffs affecting construction, hospitality and agriculture, according to a UCLA forecast. These are industries our whole nation depends on. Did I mention those grocery prices?

Deportations, mass arrests and the cost of detention are estimated to cost California alone $275 billion, along with lost tax revenue of another $23 billion. In 2022, so-called “illegals” alone paid $8.5 billion in state and local taxes. If they could work lawfully, that figure would rise significantly.

“Working lawfully” brings to my mind our nation’s first concentration camp, playfully named Alligator Alcatraz. It’s placed on an old airstrip in the Florida Everglades and is a sad example of federal/state cooperation.

The federal government will reportedly send prisoners, but the state and FEMA and the U.S. Park Service built it and collaborate to run it. So, what genius among this clique of spite thought it “efficient” to air-condition tents parked where humid summer temperatures range in the 90s? What is that cost?

We only have a reported annual budget of $450 million a year to hold its current 600 migrants. That’s about $7,500 a year for each prisoner, half the lowest U.S. prison system’s annual cost—so excuse me for doubting official numbers again.

This compares with sex offender Ghislaine Maxwell’s recent new country-club minimum security accommodations at federal prison Camp Bryan. It’s located on 37 acres in Texas that looks like a golf course and costs approximately $55,172.30 per prisoner per year.

Of the 600 migrants in Florida’s Alcatraz, two-thirds of them are without any criminal record, a Miami Herald investigation found. Florida’s current regime projects it will grow in future to hold 3,000 people. So, is it fair to assume we’ll be spending at least $1.25 billion annually on this one facility in future? Not for at least two weeks, it seems, as a judge just ordered construction there stop, while she considers environmental damage concerns.

Reportedly “substandard” and “inadequate” food is shipped into the place by tractor trailers, and now some prisoners are reportedly refusing to eat, due to worms and such. Multiple lawsuits have been filed concerning prisoner conditions like unconstitutional “cruel and unusual punishment” and their lack of access to their lawyers. There’s another federal lawsuit filed by environmental group that argues the state and its governor, Ron DeSantis, “has bulldozed over federal rules for assessing environmental harm within Big Cypress National Preserve.” where Alligator Alcatraz is located.

Oh, but then the earth does appear to be getting warmer. Alligator Alcatraz’s Everglade utilities, like power for running water, sewers and air conditioning, are provided by mobile equipment. I’m going to predict we’ll need to buy much bigger mobile power utilities and air conditioners soon, just to avoid killing people in our tents in our national park prison there. But maybe that’s this regime’s goal?

Which raises another cost of our cruelties. If you are as sick about this as I am, it’s hard to admit these cruelties are “ours,” so long as we’re paying with our tax dollars. What are the costs of the multiple lawsuits challenging our Justice Department for their administration’s unlawful behavior? Is this really what we want our government to be defending?

We know that the so-called Department of Homeland Security had a hole in its pocket leaking more money than it had—or possibly a hole in the head of its chief executive, the puppy killing, horse-riding Dakota cowboy, wearing a Rolex. She needed and got an historic appropriation of $165 billion in H.1, the Republican budget bill, and now expects to pay ICE and Border Patrol agents a $10,000 yearly bonus, thanks to this raise from a Republican-led Congress.

More prisons, more ICE officials, and more money for more lawsuits is needed to defend ICE-y Homeland cruelties.

After the midterms, this new ICE bonus expense will be partially paid by those who can least afford it: Medicaid patients and food stamp shoppers.

Do I need to remind you that women and mothers are a big portion of these folks? And that your local hospital and grocery store will feel the hit too? The rest of this big, not-so-beautiful bill will be financed by our growing national federal debt and a dollar that is losing value.

Thankfully, Lawfare reports that there are now 321 active cases challenging Trump administration actions. The New York Times is now tracking the lawsuits against this regime. Lawsuits have been a rising trend since Reagan, but the number of lawsuits in this administration’s first six months promises to set a new and unsettling record.

“Hundreds [of suits] have been filed by state attorneys and media organizations, physicians and nonprofits, migrants, international students, law firms and unions, concerning immigration, tariffs, birthright citizenship, funding cuts and the Alien Enemies Act, DOGE, Firings, Climate, Funding Cuts, Trans Rights, Access to federal property, and others,” according to The New York Times.

As a general rule, the U.S. legal system holds “The American Rule,” which says each party in a lawsuit typically pays their own attorney’s fees regardless of who wins. This intends to promise access to the law by ensuring everyone’s ability to pursue claims without fear of incurring significant costs from the opposing side. But what does it mean when you’re facing off with the richest and most powerful class that has bought our politicians?

What does it mean when I am rooting for “The American Rule’s” side that is suing my own government?",https://msmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2229579545.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 21:57:06.989398

The court ruled that the administration can continue to freeze or terminate billions of dollars that Congress had earmarked for foreign aid spending.

In a 2-to-1 vote, a panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the plaintiffs in the case, a group of international aid groups, did not have the legal standing to bring a lawsuit.

Theforeign aid freeze was an action the President took on his very first day in office in January.

The money in question includes nearly $4 billion for global health programs through September and more than $6 billion for HIV and AIDS programs through 2028.

President Trump has called foreign aid spending on programs that tackle disease outbreaks and poverty overseas ""wasteful.""The administration dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development which oversaw and managed about $30 billion annually in global health and development programs.

A group of international aid groups that were recipients of foreign aid grants sued the administration on February 10, and in March U.S. district judge Amir Ali issued a preliminary injunction against the funding freeze, saying that the administration had unlawfully frozen funds that were allocated by Congress.

Wednesday's ruling reversed the lower court's preliminary injunction, but the panel of judges did not rule on whether the terminations of funds appropriated by Congress were constitutional.

""The grantees have failed to satisfy the requirements for a preliminary injunction in any event,"" wrote Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson, an appointee of George H.W. Bush. She was joined by Judge Gregory G. Katsas, a Trump appointee.

Judge Florence Pan, who was appointed by Joe Biden, wrote the dissenting opinion.

""The court's holding that the grantees have no constitutional cause of action is as startling as it is erroneous,"" Pan wrote. ""The majority holds that when the President refuses to spend funds appropriated by Congress based on policy disagreements, that is merely a statutory violation and raises no constitutional alarm bells.""

In a statement, Mitchell Warren, the executive director of the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition (AVAC) – one of the aid groups in the lawsuit challenging the freeze – condemned the ruling.

""Time and again, this administration has shown their disdain for foreign assistance and a disregard for people's lives in the United States and around the world. More broadly, this decision, which we will appeal to the extent possible, further erodes Congress's role and responsibility as an equal branch of government, and the majority opinion makes the court complicit,"" Warren said.

Sudden federal takeovers of America’s cities will apparently be the new normal under the Trump administration.
“He’s gonna do more of them,” one Trump administration official told Rolling Stone, referring to wielding the military against the nation’s metropolises.
Prior to entering the fold of the Trump administration, Antoni worked as the Heritage Foundation’s chief economist and helped develop Project 2025.","Three days into his federal takeover of Washington, D.C., Trump said he plans to extend the crackdown beyond its month-long limit—with or without congressional approval.

The president on Wednesday was asked if he considers the 30-day timeframe during which he’s allowed, under the Home Rule Act, to control D.C.’s police before needing Congress’s OK as sufficient to address his imagined crime spike.

Before today, his administration’s answer to this question was seemingly yes; a White House official has said the operation is “expected to last 30 days.”

Now Trump is looking to extend it.

The president indicated Wednesday that his plan A is to put a “crime bill” before Congress “very quickly.” The bill, he said, will “pertain, initially, to D.C.” and ask “for extensions on that—long-term extensions, because you can’t have 30 days.” Trump noted that he expects unanimous Republican support for this (though, as Semafor reports, Senate Democrats seem able and committed to block an extension).

But Trump also expressed his willingness to bypass Congress to draw out the takeover. “Well, if it’s a national emergency, we can do it without Congress,” he said, adding that while he expects all Republicans to fall in line, “if I have to [call a national emergency], I will.”

Trump has flogged national emergency power more than any other recent president, exhibiting, per libertarian legal scholar Ilya Somin, “a dangerous pattern of invoking spurious emergencies to undermine the Constitution, threatening liberty and circumventing Congress.” So far during his second term, he’s declared a dozen such national emergencies—and is apparently ready to add to that list in order to impose his will, unchecked, on the American people.

The man at the head of President Trump’s cruel, indiscriminate immigration crackdown also has perplexingly bad taste in condiments, according to his wife.

Katie Miller, herself a former Trump aide, hosted Vice President JD Vance on her new self-titled podcast aimed toward right-wing women. The conversation turned to a classic icebreaker question.

“If you could only eat one condiment for the rest of your life what would it be?” Miller asked Vance.

“One condiment?” Vance asked.

“Yeah.”

“Does barbecue sauce count?”

“Yeah.”

“Ok. Barbecue sauce.”

“Not mayonnaise?” Miller asked, entirely unprompted.

“No,” Vance said, with a look of slight repulsion. “Mayonnaise is like … in low doses it’s good, but it’s kind of … like I had a buddy who used to eat french fries with mayonnaise. I thought that was disgusting.”

“It’s the only thing my husband eats,” Miller said plainly.

“With french fries, or like period?”

“Period.”

“OK, wow. Didn’t realize.”

“Yeah he’s only a mayonnaise guy.”

“Ok, I learned something new about Stephen I didn’t know.”

“Yeah it’s … whatever,” Miller replied, while Vance offered up a canned chuckle.

If this is the administration’s attempt to humanize Miller, Vance, and the various other Trump cronies who are carrying out this brutal, culturally based anti-immigration campaign, it isn’t working. And it should come as no surprise that someone who looks and acts as cartoonishly evil as Miller has his fries with a side of mayonnaise. That is disgusting.

Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise went on Fox Business to display his wild, willful ignorance regarding “public broadcasting.”

Scalise, who represents Louisiana, helped lead GOP efforts to eliminate the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which will put hundreds of free, local stations and shows in jeopardy. His response? His constituents should just pay for it.

“Getting rid of the USAID, public broadcasting—look, if you wanna go watch public broadcasting you can pay for it,” Scalise told Fox Business’s Maria Bartiromo. “You know, people that wanna watch your show, and a lotta people do, they can pay good advertising dollars because it’s a popular show. If nobody’s watching your program—they’re too many options today in cable programming to have taxpayers funding to the tunes of tens of billions of dollars. We got rid of that wasteful spending, and it’s just the beginning.”

This is not how public broadcasting works, or any publicly funded service for that matter. American citizens already are paying for public broadcasting, and they were receiving worthwhile content in return, from emergency weather alerts to educational content like Ken Burns documentaries and Sesame Street. And even if they weren’t, Scalise’s argument would likely leave mostly poor Americans in rural areas he wants to take public broadcasting from paying even more.

This isn’t about waste, fraud, and abuse. It’s about Republicans and their yearslong war against Corporation for Public Broadcasting–funded institutions like PBS and NPR. For years, the networks have been targeted by conservatives, who frame them as deeply ideological propaganda rather than basic media. Only time will tell how their own constituents will be impacted.

In 1991, Donald Trump filed for bankruptcy for the first time. He is said to have posed as his own publicist in a phone interview. He judged a “Look of the Year” modeling event, whose contestants reportedly included teenage girls as young as 14. His friendship with Jeffrey Epstein was still in bloom.

And the Soviet Union was on its last legs: 1991 was the year it would dissolve. It was also the last year the Russian city now known as St. Petersburg would be called Leningrad.

It was this time to which the president’s mind apparently strayed on Wednesday morning, when he accidentally referred to St. Petersburg by its former name in a social media post.

Trump had taken to Truth Social to disparage the media for covering criticisms of his impending summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The choice to hold the meeting in Alaska had drawn critics, among them Trump’s onetime national security adviser John Bolton, who told CNN: “The only better place for Putin than Alaska would be if the summit were being held in Moscow. So the initial setup, I think, is a great victory for Putin.”

The president reprimanded the press for reporting on this, and for “constantly quoting fired losers and really dumb people” like Bolton.

“Very unfair media is at work on my meeting with Putin,” Trump said. So unfair, he wrote, that, “if I got Moscow and Leningrad free, as part of the deal with Russia, the Fake News would say that I made a bad deal!”

It’s unclear what “freeing” those cities would mean, even in the context of this hyperbolic hypothetical.

Anyway, many observers were quick to note the “Leningrad” slip—which, to be sure, was still not as egregious as a gaffe, also regarding the upcoming summit, that the president had made two days earlier, when he incorrectly stated twice that it was taking place in Russia. (If the president’s Wednesday post was a 34-year throwback to 1991, his Monday remarks turned back the clock over a century and a half, to when Alaska was still Russian territory.)

Also in Wednesday morning’s Truth Social post, Trump wrote, “The Fake News is working overtime (No tax on overtime!)”—offering a written example of his (usually verbal) tendency to “weave,” as the 79-year-old president likes to call his free-association-style rambling.

Sudden federal takeovers of America’s cities will apparently be the new normal under the Trump administration.

Several government officials, including one senior administration official, told Rolling Stone Wednesday that it is now a priority to normalize military deployments to cities across the country.

Trump deployed 800 National Guard members to Washington Monday, federalizing the capital’s police department to combat what he described as a crime-riddled hellscape. To justify the government infringement, the country’s most powerful Republican pointed to rising crime rates, immigrant populations, and homelessness—though the figures he used were from 2023, before violent crime plummeted across the nation.

“He’s gonna do more of them,” one Trump administration official told Rolling Stone, referring to wielding the military against the nation’s metropolises. “He promised he would do this and now he’s following through on those promises.”

During a press conference Monday announcing the imminent takeover, Trump warned that several of America’s liberal bastions could experience the same fate.

“We have other cities also that are bad. Very bad. You look at Chicago, how bad it is. You look at Los Angeles, how bad it is. We have other cities that are very bad. New York has a problem. And then, of course, you have Baltimore and Oakland. You don’t even mention them anymore, they’re so far gone,” Trump said, before promising that Washington would be cleaned up “very quick.”

When asked explicitly if other cities were next on his list, Trump said, “We’re just going to see what happens. We’re going to have tremendous success with what we’re doing.

“Other cities are hopefully watching this … and maybe they’ll self-clean up and maybe they’ll self-do this and get rid of the cashless bail thing and all the things that caused the problem,” he continued.“We’re going to look at New York in a little while. Let’s do this together.”

Other members of the administration quickly picked up on the rhetoric. Speaking with Fox Business on Tuesday, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin claimed that the White House’s efforts to forcibly clean up what she described as a “plague of crime” could be a “blueprint” for more federal takeovers across the country.

Speaking with Fox News that same day, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth refused to acknowledge a time limit on Trump’s capital takeover.

The timeline of Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump’s friendship is not adding up.

Despite Trump’s doing everything within his power to distance himself from the pedophilic financier, interviews conducted prior to Epstein’s death suggest that the pair were close long after Trump claimed to have thrown Epstein out of Mar-a-Lago for being a “creep.” A new timeline compiled by CNN reveals just how long the two men were entwined.

Their friendship spanned three decades, but in a 2019 interview, Epstein described Trump as his “closest friend for 10 years.” That would have been 15 years after they had a falling out over a bidding war on a Palm Springs oceanfront mansion, and 11 years after Epstein was first convicted on child sex offenses.

Three other individuals who knew the men have also described them as best buds. They include Maria Farmer, a visual artist hired by Epstein who provided the first criminal complaint of sex abuse to law enforcement; Stacey Williams, a model who referred to Trump as Epstein’s “wing man” after the Manhattan real estate mogul allegedly groped her; and Jack O’Donnell, the former president and chief operating officer of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, who recalled scolding Trump in the late 1980s after he arrived at the gambling floor with Epstein and three underage girls.

Trump has never been accused of wrongdoing by law enforcement with regard to the Epstein case, and has insisted that he had “no idea” that Epstein was abusing underage girls.

The White House claimed on July 23 that Trump and Epstein’s relationship ended after Trump kicked Epstein out of his Palm Springs resort for “being a creep.” But days later, Trump offered a different version of events to a crowd of reporters aboard Air Force One, revealing that he knew Epstein “stole” girls in his employ at Mar-a-Lago, and that Virginia Giuffre—one of Epstein’s most prominent accusers—was among them.

His remarks partially corroborated Giuffre’s account of being abducted in 2000 by Epstein’s longtime associate and girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, at Mar-a-Lago, where Giuffre worked at the time as a pool attendant.

The admission shocked Giuffre’s family, who have since questioned what else Trump may have remained tight-lipped about regarding his long friendship with the sex trafficker.

President Trump’s vaguely positive views on marijuana use and legalization have opened up yet another schism within the MAGA movement, as some hard-liners are reverting back to war on drugs–adjacent rhetoric to express their opposition to perhaps the most popular plant in America.

Last Friday it was reported that Trump told donors at an event that he is considering reclassifying marijuana from its current Schedule I level. It was the first time he’d made any real mention of the substance since he was on the campaign trail in September, where he also expressed support for rescheduling. Moving weed away from Schedule I would essentially make it easier to buy, sell, possess, and tax. It’s worth noting that Kim Rivers, CEO of the massive marijuana company Trulieve, was in attendance.

This news quickly sowed trouble on the right, as both the “western civilization is eroding” guys and the more traditional “just say no” crowd shared their grievances with marijuana.

“Our society thrived when everyone was smoking cigarettes and drinking whiskey,” wrote Daily Wire commentator Matt Walsh, completely ignoring the countless, well-documented, negative impacts (violence and death) of those two American vices. “We became the most powerful nation in the world with liquor and nicotine. No country of potheads has ever thrived, or ever achieved anything at all. Every city that legalized it became an even bigger shithole basically overnight. The entire history of western civilization tells us that marijuana is far, far worse for society.”

Far-right conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec called people smoking weed outside a “huge factor” in violent crime in Washington, D.C. “States with legal weed you can just smell it all over in public,” he continued. “Can’t take kids anywhere.”

“Not that I trust CNN’s reporting, but on the off chance this is true, I’d encourage the White House to nix it,” conservative Daily Wire podcaster Michael Knowles wrote on X. “Liberalizing the law around Haitian oregano gives big Kim Kardashian energy—not the sort of thing people voted for in November!”

Not everyone on the MAGA right shares the same antiquated, Nancy Reagan–level mythmaking around marijuana.

“You know who doesn’t want marijuana moved from Schedule I -> III? Big Pharma— they lose $$ on pain pills & sleeping meds. Big Alcohol—lower revenue. Big Prison—fewer inmates & lower revenue,” wrote Rogan O’Handley, a.k.a. DC Draino, one of the MAGA influencers who got one of those phony “Epstein Files Phase One” binders months ago. “You know who wants it rescheduled? Veterans with PTSD & sleeping issues who don’t want to keep taking pills. Rescheduling marijuana doesn’t legalize it, but it does allow for more medical research.” The weed for veterans angle is very popular within the movement’s pro-rescheduling wing.

This news underscores the evolving politics of marijuana on the right. To some Trump loyalists it’s a symbol of indolence, a sign of trashiness. To others it’s a drug safer than opioids and alcohol that is long overdue for a societal update. Their fearless leader has waffled hard on the issue for years now.

Far-right provocateur Laura Loomer has, in recent weeks, further solidified her status as a de facto personnel director in Trump’s White House. Over a dozen recent firings have been attributable to her pressure campaigns, and the self-described pro–white nationalist even created a tip line to help purge hundreds of supposedly disloyal Trump administration staff.

But her latest target, per Politico Playbook, is Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—or, more realistically, Kennedy’s deputy chief of staff, Stefanie Spear, who was formerly the press secretary for Kennedy’s 2024 presidential campaign.

“I’m not naive enough to think that the president is going to get rid of RFK,” Loomer told Politico, but she said “there are concerns about some of the staffing decisions over at [the Department of Health and Human Services].”

She also claimed, citing “sources in HHS,” that “there’s a clear intention by Stefanie Spear to utilize her position to try to lay the groundwork for a 2028 RFK presidential run.” An unnamed Trump administration official told Politico they “would not be surprised” if Kennedy is contemplating such a bid but said it’s not considered “a real threat.”

Politico’s report comes days after Loomer’s successful campaign against top Food and Drug Administration official Vinay Prasad unraveled before her eyes.

Prasad was ousted after Loomer alleged he was a “progressive leftist saboteur” due to his past criticisms of Trump and support for progressive politicians. His return was a victory for RFK Jr., who’d opposed his removal. Loomer called it “egregious” and pledged to ramp up her “exposés of officials within HHS and FDA.”

Loomer has, for months, railed publicly against Kennedy and Spear, as she has against other Trump officials she deems suspect.

In May, she wrote on X that there’s a “vetting crisis” under RFK Jr., pointing to Spear’s past environmental activism and role in founding the environmental news site EcoWatch. Days later, Loomer called Kennedy “Marxist,” and accused him of appointing “full throttled Marxists and Trump haters to work under him at HHS,” such as Spear.

Since then, she’s repeatedly cast aspersions on Kennedy’s deputy chief of staff as a “Marxist” and “National Security Threat.”

Last month, she said Kennedy “is one of the worst Trump Cabinet picks,” and, presaging her claims published in Politico Wednesday, ominously added, “People will fully understand why in 2028.”

The Trump administration appears to be inching away from the responsibility of issuing a monthly jobs report.

Speaking with reporters at a White House press briefing Tuesday, press secretary Karoline Leavitt failed to promise that the economic updates would continue, instead downgrading their existence to a “hope” while further undermining the credibility of the data the reports are built upon.

“Will the Bureau of Labor Statistics continue to put out monthly jobs reports?” asked a reporter.

“Well, look, what I’ll tell you about the Bureau of Labor Statistics—I believe that is the plan and that’s the hope, and that these monthly reports will be data that the American people can trust,” Leavitt said. “As you know, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has made massive revisions after the last several points reports that they have put out.

“And there has certainly been a decline in the quality and reliability of data coming from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and there’s been an increase in revisions,” Leavitt continued. “And this president and the administration is finally tackling this problem that so many have talked about. The president is actually doing something about it.”

Donald Trump’s new nominee for BLS commissioner, E.J. Antoni, told Fox Business Tuesday that “BLS should suspend issuing the monthly job reports” and instead only rely on quarterly data. Prior to entering the fold of the Trump administration, Antoni worked as the Heritage Foundation’s chief economist and helped develop Project 2025.

Trump abruptly fired BLS’s last commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, hours after the release of the last jobs report, claiming that the Biden-era appointee’s work analyzing the granular data of America’s economy was “faked” and could not be trusted.

Revisions to the monthly jobs report are far from out of the ordinary. Instead, it’s fairly normal for the reports to tell a different picture month-to-month, as more data is collected over time from late-submitting survey participants. The report has been published on a monthly basis since 1916, but there hasn’t been an issue with it until Trump 2.0.

At the core of Trump’s gripe with the July report was its revision of figures from the preceding months, which moved the three-month growth average to 35,000. A lag like that hasn’t emerged since 2010, and it made Trump’s first six months in office—and his controversial tariff overhaul—look particularly bad. The report’s downsizing also suggested that while some sectors, such as health care and social assistance, gained jobs, the vast majority of the market lost employment.

The absence of a monthly report would be yet another infringement on transparency and accountability between the federal government and the people it’s supposed to represent.

“We need to look at the means and the methods of how the United States is acquiring this very important data,” Leavitt said Tuesday. “The goal, of course, is to provide honest and good data for the American people to make very important economic decisions on.”

“I don’t have a very good poker face,” Judge Cullen told the department lawyer, Elizabeth Hedges, as she stepped up to the lectern to address him.
Because all 15 federal judges in Maryland were named as defendants, Judge Cullen, who normally sits in Roanoke, Va., was asked to cross state lines to preside over the matter.
In his arguments to Judge Cullen, Mr. Clement said the suit was a fundamental violation of the separation of powers laid out in the U.S. Constitution.
“This is an extraordinary standing order, and so we find ourselves in this position,” she said.","A federal judge signaled on Wednesday that he had doubts about an extraordinary lawsuit the Trump administration filed against the entire federal bench in Maryland, challenging a standing order intended to briefly slow down the government’s ability to deport undocumented immigrants.

During a hearing in Federal District Court in Baltimore, the judge, Thomas T. Cullen, said he had some reservations about the suit, making his remarks even before a lawyer for the Justice Department had the chance to offer any arguments on behalf of the administration.

“I don’t have a very good poker face,” Judge Cullen told the department lawyer, Elizabeth Hedges, as she stepped up to the lectern to address him. “And you probably picked up on the fact that I have some skepticism.”

It was clear from the outset of the hearing just how unusual the case was, which amounted to the administration’s latest attack on the judiciary. Because all 15 federal judges in Maryland were named as defendants, Judge Cullen, who normally sits in Roanoke, Va., was asked to cross state lines to preside over the matter. The judges themselves were excused from being in the courtroom and some in fact were on the bench in other proceedings as the hearing unfolded.

Moreover, the judges managed to get Paul Clement, a former solicitor general who has argued more than 100 cases in front of the Supreme Court, to represent them. Out of the gate, Mr. Clement emphasized the bizarre nature of the government’s efforts.

“This is, to state the obvious,” he told Judge Cullen, “not an ordinary lawsuit.”

The administration filed the suit in June, about a month after the chief federal judge in Maryland, George L. Russell III, issued the standing order saying that immigrants who sought to contest their removal from the country by filing what is known as a habeas petition would automatically be granted a two-day reprieve from being expelled by the government.

The order was put in place as a way to give judges time to figure out the complicated legal issues in a flurry of fast-paced cases being filed in Maryland contesting the White House’s aggressive deportation policies. The most prominent was a lawsuit challenging the removal of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant who was wrongfully returned to his homeland in March.

The suit came during a moment of excruciating tension between the administration and federal judges across the country, who in recent months have issued an avalanche of injunctions against several different parts of President Trump’s policy agenda. But the spectacle of the White House suing an entire district court in the name of the United States of America underscored just how rancorous relations between the two branches had become.

In his arguments to Judge Cullen, Mr. Clement said the suit was a fundamental violation of the separation of powers laid out in the U.S. Constitution. While federal agencies or specific government officials might be able to bring legal claims against the courts, he said, the executive branch as a whole could not do so.

After all, he reasoned, if the government could sue an entire district court, where would it end? Could the White House sue a federal appeals court that issued an order it did not like? Or could it sue the Supreme Court?

What the government should have done, Mr. Clement told Judge Cullen, was either to have challenged the district’s standing order in front of the state judicial council, which acts as an administrative body for the court, or to have appealed it in one of the individual cases in which it was actually imposed.

Mr. Clement also warned of the “nightmare scenarios” that could emerge if the lawsuit was allowed to move forward. He said there would be all kinds of thorny legal problems if, say, White House officials had to be deposed about why they had brought the lawsuit or the judges themselves were made to testify under oath about why they had issued the standing order.

Speaking for the Justice Department, Ms. Hedges sought to play down such concerns. As a preliminary matter, she said that the Trump administration had no plans to sue any other courts, acknowledging that the Maryland suit was something that was not likely to “occur more than once in a generation.”

Still, Ms. Hedges stood behind the administration’s claims that the two-day pause in deportation cases inhibited the White House’s ability to enforce federal immigration law. She also argued that because the order was imposed automatically, it failed to meet the normal legal thresholds needed to impose injunctions on the government.

“This is an extraordinary standing order, and so we find ourselves in this position,” she said.

Judge Cullen told both sides that he intended to hand down a decision in the case by Labor Day, acknowledging that it would most likely be appealed and make its way to higher courts.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/13/us/politics/dc-judges/dc-judges-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 21:57:15.978041

28-to-1 votes are lonely.” So far, Murphy isn’t slamming his colleagues for embracing bipartisan negotiations, and his peers aren’t directly criticizing his approach.
Nine days later, Senate Republicans banded together to pass that bill.
“The bills themselves are good, bipartisan bills,” said Murphy.
“And you know,” Murphy continued, “he’s going to use the money in this budget to treat immigrants like animals.”","“Every single day, there’s new evidence that our democracy is falling, and you’ve got to take stands. You have to take fights,” Murphy explained. “I just worry — every time that we go along with these appropriations bills, we’re putting a bipartisan veneer of endorsement on an illegal process that’s ultimately part of his campaign to destroy our democracy.”

As the top Democrat on the appropriations panel that funds the Department of Homeland Security, Murphy occupies a role that has historically demanded across-the-aisle collaboration. But in recent weeks, he opposed all spending measures advanced during Senate Appropriations Committee markups for which he was present, challenged his Republican counterpart on the DHS funding bill and voted “no” on the Senate’s first bipartisan funding package of the year.

“I’m nothing if not consistent. I don’t like the position I’m in,” Murphy said. “It’s lonely. 28-to-1 votes are lonely.”

So far, Murphy isn’t slamming his colleagues for embracing bipartisan negotiations, and his peers aren’t directly criticizing his approach. But they aren’t exactly praising him either.

“He has the right to his opinion,” said the top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, Patty Murray of Washington. “And I just have the opinion that the more we can do to get bills done, the better chance we have of getting better things for our country.”

Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, one of Murphy’s friends and another senior member of the Appropriations Committee, said Democrats have a duty to at least attempt to strike a cross-party compromise on federal spending ahead of the Sept. 30 shutdown deadline.

“I’m not his spokesperson,” said Schatz, who is in line to be the chamber’s Democratic whip in the next Congress. “So all I can say is: We’ve been demanding a bipartisan process. So when there’s a step in that direction, I think it’s our obligation to try to be constructive.”

While Murphy has never been a moderate, he has grown rapidly into a liberal firebrand in recent years. Once best known on Capitol Hill for his advocacy for gun control and his foreign policy expertise, he’s now a frequent anti-Trump voice on cable news shows and has waded into controversial social topics like the nation’s “male identity” crisis.

But Murphy’s latest political stand against Trump comes as his name is floated for a bigger-stage battle against Republicans — this time as a presidential contender in 2028.

If the 52-year-old senator seeks the Democratic nomination in three years, his protest of government funding bills could help differentiate him as a candidate who fought the Trump administration with more than just verbal criticism.

“It does fit, right? These are strategies that would make sense if he’s interested in a national platform and to run for office like president,” said Hans Noel, a Georgetown University professor who studies presidential nominations.

“There’s some appeal to a lot of voters — of fighting — especially at the national stage, where he doesn’t have to worry about winning over allies for legislative progress,” Noel continued. “Murphy has been somebody who’s been talking on a national stage for a long time. It’s not completely new. But he’s somebody who’s got that kind of appeal.”

This past week, Murphy spent his birthday at an event with progressives in Arizona, where he talked broadly about the need for Democrats to balance opposition with real policy commitments: “We can’t just be against Donald Trump. We’ve got to give people a vision of something different.”

Since Trump’s election last November, Murphy has grown a beard, announced the end of his 17-year marriage and sparked rumors about romantic ties to a prominent Democratic strategist. In April, he hosted a town hall back in rural North Carolina — more than 500 miles from his blue home state. Then this summer, he launched a PAC aimed at taking on Trump and Republicans in Congress.

Murphy hasn’t always resisted negotiations with Republicans. In 2022, after a gunman left 21 people dead inside a Texas elementary school, he undertook weeks of painstaking talks that resulted in the first significant federal gun-control legislation in two decades. It was the culmination of a nearly decade-long fight for Murphy, who represented Sandy Hook Elementary School in the House at the time of that devastating 2012 shooting.

His next foray into bipartisan talks did not have a happy ending. Last year he scrupulously crafted the high-profile bipartisan border deal with Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Lankford, in an attempt to enact Congress’ first major immigration overhaul in more than three decades. Then Trump chilled Republican support for the bill.

To Murphy, it signaled that Republicans couldn’t be trusted to be good-faith actors in negotiations to fund the government: “I think that drama was early proof that they’re never going to cross him,” he said of Republicans’ loyalty to Trump.

This belief was further cemented when Murphy’s GOP colleagues cleared Trump’s $9 billion rescission request last month targeting public broadcasting and foreign aid.

“They can say that they’re going to honor the words on the page,” Murphy said. Yet if Trump “decides to ignore the law,” he continued, “I just don’t think that my Republican colleagues are going to really fight to protect it.”

Democratic leadership’s interest in engaging in bipartisan funding negotiations, from which Murphy is abstaining, is a relatively new development. Just a month ago, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer penned a lengthy “dear colleague” letter insinuating that his members should cut off cross-party talks if Republicans accepted the White House’s rescissions package.

Nine days later, Senate Republicans banded together to pass that bill. And five days after that, Schumer stood with his House counterpart, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, to announce that Democrats still “want to pursue a bipartisan, bicameral appropriations process.”

It has left Murphy as the lone Democratic appropriator continually opposing the funding bills his colleagues are trying to advance, even as he readily admits it’s not the substance of the spending measures he’s against.

“The bills themselves are good, bipartisan bills,” said Murphy. “It’s just — I don’t believe that anything in there is actually going to be implemented.”

This is the case Murphy said he wants to get through to Sen. Katie Britt, the Alabama Republican who chairs the Homeland Security appropriations panel opposite Murphy. The two lawmakers were seen last month in a heated exchange in the well of the Senate floor after passage of the clawback request. Britt described the conversation, captured by C-SPAN cameras, as “a spirited dialogue,” vowing: “I’ll continue to work in good faith, as I always have.”

Murphy, however, said negotiations on the DHS funding bill will be meaningless if Trump and Republicans are going to undermine the spending directives when the measure becomes law. “We had an animated discussion,” Murphy said of his talk with Britt. “Obviously it’s hard to write a bill when the administration is going to stab you in the back as soon as you write it, especially in a space as difficult as immigration and DHS.”

He pointed to specific examples of how Trump has already undermined appropriators, including the president’s efforts to fund the controversial “Alligator Alcatraz” immigration detention center in Florida by diverting money Congress appropriated for “humane” alternatives to detainment.

“And you know,” Murphy continued, “he’s going to use the money in this budget to treat immigrants like animals.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F32%2F7c%2F0b7affef43898bd342f60d0c3c96%2Fu-s-congress-36768.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 20:56:21.511241

U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen, a Donald Trump appointee from the Western District of Virginia who was assigned to the case by the Fourth Circuit, took the bench at Baltimore federal court amid an unprecedented suit against his colleagues.

The Justice Department filed the suit on June 24, naming all 15 federal judges on the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland as defendants, to challenge Chief U.S. District Judge George Russell III’s block on any active removal efforts tied to a habeas petition for 48 business hours.

Paul Clement, of Clement Murphy and representing the judges, maintained that the injunctions provide a chance for judges to consider the petition before an immigrant is removed — as was the case for Kilmar Abrego Garcia — but the Justice Department argued the so-called “automatic injunctions” are an unlawful overreach of judicial authority.

Clement argued if Cullen adopted the Justice Department’s positions, it could open the door for similar suits against circuit courts, like the Fourth Circuit, further upending the ""judicial order.""

Cullen pushed the theory even further, saying the executive branch could even sue the Supreme Court.

Justice Department attorney Elizabeth Hedges defended the decision to bring the suit in Maryland, describing Russell's order as the unprecedented action rather than its suit, and denounced concerns that any “floodgates” would open for suits against circuit courts and the Supreme Court.

In its briefs, the Justice Department cited two cases — Stern v. U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts and Whitehouse v. U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island — as examples providing a roadmap for the administration’s challenge against the Maryland bench and Russell’s standing order.

Cullen acknowledged that the suits were able to avoid judicial immunity, but added that the case’s titles were “considerably more modest” when compared to this case, titled United States of America v. Russell.

“This is taking it up about six notches,” Cullen said.

Cullen pressed Hedges why the administration does not bring an interlocutory appeal challenging the application of a standing order in an individual immigration case to the Fourth Circuit, as per the usual procedure.

Hedges argued that the administration would face certain challenges bringing such appeals, and the time spent litigating each individual case in court was an undue burden on the government.

Cullen replied that the administration has been able to seek swift relief from appellate courts and the Supreme Court by bringing previously rare appeals for temporary restraining orders, like in J.G.G v. Trump.

On the merits, Hedges slammed the standing order as clearly violating the clear requirements needed for granting preliminary relief, particularly an assessment of any irreparable harm that would otherwise occur without relief.

Clement rejected that assertion, arguing that the standing order maintained the status quo and effectively provided an administrative stay. In practice, a temporary pause “doesn’t make a material difference,” as judges can still deny a habeas petition upon taking up the case.

The judges have maintained that the suit should be dismissed as Trump has failed to show why sovereign immunity or judicial immunity should not apply in the case.

In a Monday filing, the judges slammed the lawsuit as “not just novel, but deeply flawed,” noting that if the administration could clear the immunity hurdle, it would still fail on the merits.

“Every court has the inherent authority to issue administrative orders to ensure that it can do its job,” the judges wrote. “The exercise of that inherent authority here — a modest, two-business-day hold to allow the court to open a case and assess its jurisdiction — is eminently reasonable, entirely lawful, and far less of an imposition on the executive than comparable appellate-court stays.”

The suit has raised separation-of-power concerns among court observers amid the administration’s campaign to seemingly punish federal judges it views as obstructing its far-right agenda, in particular its mass deportation efforts. One of the named defendants, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, presided over Abrego Garcia’s case and has drawn particular ire from the administration.

Last month, the Justice Department filed a misconduct complaint against Chief U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington after he expressed concern that the Trump administration would not comply with court orders at a closed-door session of the Judicial Conference in March.

Cullen indicated he would issue a ruling before Labor Day on Sept. 1.

A federal appeals court ruled Wednesday that the Trump administration can slash up to roughly $2 billion in foreign aid payments that it halted earlier this year, delivering a victory to the Trump administration months after President Donald Trump sought to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).

Judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled 2-1 to vacate a lower court’s preliminary injunction handed down earlier this year. The lower court judge had required the Trump administration to resume its payments on nearly $1.98 billion in owed funds for USAID projects previously approved by Congress, after the Trump administration abruptly froze them earlier this year.

Writing for the majority, Judge Karen L. Henderson, a President George H.W. Bush appointee, said that the plaintiffs lacked the proper cause of action to sue the Trump administration over its decision to withhold the funds, or what is known as impoundment.

SCOTUS RULES ON NEARLY $2 BILLION IN FROZEN USAID PAYMENTS

The plaintiffs, Henderson said, ""may not bring a freestanding constitutional claim if the underlying alleged violation and claimed authority are statutory.""

""Nor do the grantees have a cause of action under the APA because APA review is precluded by the Impoundment Control Act (ICA),"" she added, though she noted the U.S. Comptroller General could technically sue under that law.

The 2-1 majority also ruled that the plaintiffs failed to show Trump had acted ""plainly"" in excess of his executive branch authorities.

Judge Henderson was joined in the majority opinion by Judge Greg Katsas, a Trump appointee.

It was not immediately clear whether the plaintiffs in the case would seek to have their case reviewed en banc— or by the full panel for the Democrat-majority U.S. Court of Appeals in D.C.— though doing so could afford them some near-term relief, if the full appeals court sided with the federal judge who had issued the preliminary injunction earlier this year.

Regardless, the ruling is a major victory for President Donald Trump, who issued an executive order on his first day in office in January to block nearly all foreign aid spending as part of his administration’s broader crackdown on waste, fraud, and abuse.

FEDERAL JUDGE ORDERS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO PAY 'UNLAWFULLY' RESTRICTED USAID FUNDS

Critics, meanwhile, have argued that the abrupt withdrawal of U.S. investment and presence around the world risks economic harm, reputational damage and new security risks at home and abroad.

Trump’s executive order sparked a flurry of federal lawsuits, and eventually made its way to the Supreme Court in February. Justices on the high court denied the Trump administration’s request in February to continue its freeze on USAID payments, ruling 5-4 that an earlier Feb. 26 payment deadline had already expired, and remanded the case back to the district court to clarify additional payment details.

Four conservative justices on the bench excoriated the slim majority ruling earlier this year.

Justice Samuel Alito issued a scathing, eight-page dissent in February blasting the narrow court majority's ruling as an ""unfortunate misstep,"" and one he argued ""rewards an act of judicial hubris"" by the lower court judge, U.S. District Judge Amir Ali.

LAWSUIT TRACKER: NEW RESISTANCE BATTLING TRUMP'S SECOND TERM THROUGH ONSLAUGHT OF LAWSUITS TAKING AIM AT EOS

""Does a single district-court judge who likely lacks jurisdiction have the unchecked power to compel the Government of the United States to pay out (and probably lose forever) 2 billion taxpayer dollars? The answer to that question should be an emphatic ‘No,’ but a majority of this Court apparently thinks otherwise,"" Alito wrote in the dissent, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.

""I am stunned,"" he added.

TRUMP TEMPORARILY THWARTED IN DOGE MISSION TO END USAID

Still, the Trump administration's efforts have sparked the ire of foreign aid groups and other recipients of the assistance, who argue that the quick dismantling of them risked ""immediate and irreparable harm.""

They have also raised concerns that slashing the funds could create new obstacles for U.S. businesses looking to open or expand into foreign markets.

Scott Greytak, a director at the group U.S. Transparency International, previously told Fox News Digital in a statement that cutting such a large amount of U.S. foreign aid carries significant economic and security risks— especially in countries with higher risks of corruption, could ""open the door for increased cross-border corruption, fraud, and other crimes,"" he said.",https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/08/donald-trump-fist-pump-copy.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 21:57:20.168461

The judge also barred the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from sharing Medicaid data with DHS, saying that Washington and the multistate coalition were likely to succeed on their claim that the action violated the Administrative Procedure Act’s prohibition on arbitrary and capricious agency action.

The preliminary injunction will remain in place either until after HHS and DHS complete a reasoned decision-making process that complies with the Administrative Procedure Act, or until litigation concludes.

“Protecting people’s private health information is vitally important,” Attorney General Nick Brown said. “And everyone should be able to seek medical care without fear of what the federal government may do with that information.”

On July 1, Washington joined a multistate coalition led by California to sue the Trump administration, arguing that the mass transfer of Medicaid data violates the law and asking the court to block any new transfer or use of this data for immigration enforcement purposes. The lawsuit highlighted that the administration’s illegal actions are creating fear and confusion, leading eligible noncitizens and their family members to disenroll, or refuse to enroll, in emergency Medicaid. This leaves states and their safety net hospitals to foot the bill for federally mandated emergency health care services.

Washington’s Medicaid program is operated as a part of the broader Apple Health suite of health benefits programs. Washington residents signed up for Apple Health understanding that their information would be confidential and not shared for reasons unrelated to the provision of health care.

Apple Health includes Apple Health Expansion, which provides full-scope medical services to Washington residents regardless of their immigration status. There are more than 1.9 million Apple Health clients in Washington, including about 49,000 whose immigration status makes them ineligible for some federally funded programs. Apple Health covers a range of health care services, including inpatient and outpatient hospital care, primary and preventative care, long-term services and supports, and behavioral health.

Brown joined the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaiʻi, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Vermont in filing the lawsuit.

Does that combination basically negate the sanctuary city status in Washington, D.C.?
“I think D.C. under federal control is not going to be a sanctuary city.
But Washington isn’t the only sanctuary city in the hot seat.
In the event that President Trump actually wants to help local law enforcement, Hodges offered some advice.","The Trump administration and the aviation companies working for it have been purposely hiding the tail numbers on immigration flights to avoid public scrutiny and accountability, CNN reports. This move comes as the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown ratchets up in frequency and aggression, as deportation flights are up 15 percent from last year.

A plane removing a tail number is the equivalent of a car removing a license plate. With the tail number, civilians, journalists, and immigration organizations alike can keep an eye on which deportation flights are leaving, and to where. It also helps loved ones track their deported family members.

The flights are run by multiple private charter companies and at least one commercial airline, each of which have lucrative contracts with ICE.

Flightradar24, one of the websites that covers immigration, noticed in March that those subcontractors requested that their tail numbers be hidden from public flight-tracking sites and records, making them extremely difficult to follow. The bulk of these flights are domestic, moving detainees from facility to facility.

“Flights operated on behalf of the United States government are often unidentified at the government’s request. As subcontractors to the United States government, we ask that you direct your questions to them,” said a spokesperson from Avelo Airlines, a company that has dedicated three of its planes to ICE deportations.

“This is vital information to be able to understand how ICE is conducting its enforcement and deportation activities,” ACLU National Prison Project senior counsel Eunice Cho told CNN. “Sometimes this is the only information that the public has with respect to where ICE is placing people because of a general lack of transparency around detention and deportation under this particular administration.”

The Department of Homeland Security has yet to comment.

“Does the fact that there’s National Guard now there—it’s a sanctuary city, like sanctuary cities across the country—but it’s unique in that it has federal control, and now you have the National Guard on the ground side by side with ICE. Does that combination basically negate the sanctuary city status in Washington, D.C.? At least for these 30 days, in terms of what you can do there, Tom?” asked host Martha MacCallum.

“Yes,” Homan said, plainly. “I think D.C. under federal control is not going to be a sanctuary city.

“We’re working with the police hand in hand, and when we encounter a criminal illegal alien, they will be turned over to ICE,” the former acting director of ICE continued. “And that’s the way it should be.

“I’m not saying every illegal alien in D.C. is a criminal. But many are,” Homan said. “There is no sanctuary for these people in the city of D.C.”

Washington’s City Council unanimously approved the Sanctuary Values Amendment Act in 2019, and Mayor Muriel Bowser signed the act into law that same year. But Bowser has worked to undo that legacy since Trump returned to the White House, attempting to repeal Washington’s sanctuary status law in a 300-page budget bill. In June, the D.C. City Council erased the language in the budget that would have killed the sanctuary law in the board’s effort to retain the designation.

But Washington isn’t the only sanctuary city in the hot seat. In late May, the Department of Homeland Security released a list of some 35 regions, including 13 states, that it considered to be “deliberately obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws and endangering American citizens.” The states included California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, in addition to the nation’s capital.

President Trump’s federal takeover of D.C. “doesn’t make a lot of sense” to D.C. Metropolitan Police Officer Daniel Hodges, he told MSNBC’s Chris Jansing on Wednesday. The interview highlights how the ongoing militarization of the nation’s capital is not only an authoritarian power grab but also a theatrical farce.

Hodges—who was attacked while defending the Capitol building on January 6, 2021—noted that the troops Trump has stationed in D.C. are not exactly cut out for the job.

The National Guardsmen patrolling the city’s streets are not “in their lane,” said Hodges, citing his six-year stint as a member of the Virginia National Guard. “I can tell you that this is not what they’re trained to do,” Hodges said. “Soldiers are trained to fight and win wars. We’re not in a war out here in D.C. There’s crime out here, but it’s not a war-torn hellscape like Trump has said. The troops are not trained to do law enforcement.”

As for the officers from various federal agencies now policing Washington, he said, “I don’t think this is really their specialization either. So many of these federal officers are investigators. They’re supposed to be behind a desk, you know, working that way.” Rather than helping local police in the harsher areas of the city, Hodges said, “you’re going to see [the federal agents] standing around in Chinatown or on the [National] Mall or walking around Georgetown.” (Social media footage from the first few days of Trump’s takeover shows them doing just that.)

In the event that President Trump actually wants to help local law enforcement, Hodges offered some advice. For one, he said, the president could “actually allow D.C. to spend its own money.” D.C., after all, is currently still “in the hole” by about $1 billion due to Republican cuts to the city’s budget. Further, Hodges suggested, the Federal Emergency Management Agency could undo its recent 44 percent cut in assistance to the city’s security funding.

“So there are things that they can do to help us out that they’re not doing, and I would love to know why,” he said.

There’s apparently much more of the nonsense Hodges describes to come. Trump on Wednesday announced plans to extend the D.C. occupation beyond 30 days, at which point—though he will require congressional approval under the Home Rule Act—he’s vowed to do so even without Congress’s green light. And the capital is apparently just a testing ground, as the president suggests he’ll bring similar crackdowns to cities across the country.

President Trump was accidentally caught in one of his favorite lies: that he finished the border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, one of the marquee promises of his first term.

“The Biden administration was auctioning off border wall materials, but we’re hearing now that … the auctioneer’s selling those materials back,” a reporter asked Trump while he took questions Wednesday at the Kennedy Center. “Are you finishing building the wall?”

“Well, I’ve built hundreds of miles of wall, and I was getting very close. I actually finished the wall, but then I added another 200 miles because when you do the original wall that I said I was gonna build—which I got built—and I got it to the specifications of the Border Patrol and ICE,” the president answered meanderingly. “They wanted steel, they wanted concrete inside, they wanted rebar inside that, they wanted it to have wires, the walls are wired for, you know, all of the internet stuff and security things.”

The president’s answer doesn’t make much sense. He said verbatim that he finished building the wall, but added on an extra 200 miles for the hell of it. How do you add 200 miles to a finished border wall without altering the border itself, which Trump never achieved?

He’s lying to avoid admitting that he failed at something. In reality, Trump only added 500 miles of border wall to a 2,000-mile border, and most of those wall pieces were for repair or reinforcement. And it wasn’t even a wall—it was a 30-foot fence.

“There’s new reporting that the Russians have hacked into computer systems that manage U.S. federal court documents. I wonder if you’ve seen this report, and do you plan to bring it up with Putin when you see him later in the week?” asked one reporter.

“I guess I could. Are you surprised? Are you surprised? They hack in, that’s what they do,” Trump said. “They’re good at it, we’re good at it, we’re actually better at it.”

The New York Times reported Tuesday that a Russian entity had accessed the court case document system, as well as “recently compromised sealed records,” as part of a yearslong effort.

“Some of the searches included mid-level criminal cases in the New York City area and several other jurisdictions, with some cases involving people with Russian and Eastern European surnames,” the Times reported.

But the president’s shocking reaction to the attack also undercuts Republican efforts to reframe the 2016 Trump-Russia scandal against Clinton and former President Barack Obama: If he doesn’t care about Russian meddling under the nose of his administration, why would he care so deeply about reframing the narrative around the foreign power’s intervention nine years ago?

Trump is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin Friday in Alaska to discuss a potential resolution to the war in Ukraine. It will be the first time that the Russian leader has stepped foot on U.S. soil in over a decade.

But more than 200 pages of Loomer’s transcribed deposition in her defamation lawsuit against Maher shed light on the influencer’s beliefs and prerogatives—and illustrate her as a raving conspiracist rather than a fine-tuned firing machine.

In sprawling answers to completely unrelated questions, Loomer rants about George Stephanopolous, her lack of boyfriends, and her inability to get a White House press credential, in an interview that quickly flies off the handle.

In one particularly wild exchange, Loomer practically roasted Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene as someone who puts “roast beef in her pants.”

“Because I know she likes to eat at Arby’s,” Loomer said, further clarifying that she believes Greene puts the meat sandwiches in her pants and that she believed Greene would agree with that statement.

“Are you making a derogatory comment about her sex life by talking about Arby’s in her pants?” the counsel asked.

“No. I’m talking about Arby’s, the sandwiches. I’m talking about Arby’s. I would—I’m a very direct person,” Loomer said. “If I was making a derogatory comment, I would have said it.”

Three days into his federal takeover of Washington, D.C., Trump said he plans to extend the crackdown beyond its month-long limit—with or without congressional approval.

The president on Wednesday was asked if he considers the 30-day timeframe during which he’s allowed, under the Home Rule Act, to control D.C.’s police before needing Congress’s OK as sufficient to address his imagined crime spike.

Before today, his administration’s answer to this question was seemingly yes; a White House official has said the operation is “expected to last 30 days.”

Now Trump is looking to extend it.

The president indicated Wednesday that his plan A is to put a “crime bill” before Congress “very quickly.” The bill, he said, will “pertain, initially, to D.C.” and ask “for extensions on that—long-term extensions, because you can’t have 30 days.” Trump noted that he expects unanimous Republican support for this (though, as Semafor reports, Senate Democrats seem able and committed to block an extension).

But Trump also expressed his willingness to bypass Congress to draw out the takeover. “Well, if it’s a national emergency, we can do it without Congress,” he said, adding that while he expects all Republicans to fall in line, “if I have to [call a national emergency], I will.”

Trump has flogged national emergency power more than any other recent president, exhibiting, per libertarian legal scholar Ilya Somin, “a dangerous pattern of invoking spurious emergencies to undermine the Constitution, threatening liberty and circumventing Congress.” So far during his second term, he’s declared a dozen such national emergencies—and is apparently ready to add to that list in order to impose his will, unchecked, on the American people.

If this is the administration’s attempt to humanize Miller, Vance, and the various other Trump cronies who are carrying out this brutal, culturally based anti-immigration campaign, it isn’t working. And it should come as no surprise that someone who looks and acts as cartoonishly evil as Miller has his fries with a side of mayonnaise. That is disgusting.

“Getting rid of the USAID, public broadcasting—look, if you wanna go watch public broadcasting you can pay for it,” Scalise told Fox Business’s Maria Bartiromo. “You know, people that wanna watch your show, and a lotta people do, they can pay good advertising dollars because it’s a popular show. If nobody’s watching your program—they’re too many options today in cable programming to have taxpayers funding to the tunes of tens of billions of dollars. We got rid of that wasteful spending, and it’s just the beginning.”

This is not how public broadcasting works, or any publicly funded service for that matter. American citizens already are paying for public broadcasting, and they were receiving worthwhile content in return, from emergency weather alerts to educational content like Ken Burns documentaries and Sesame Street. And even if they weren’t, Scalise’s argument would likely leave mostly poor Americans in rural areas he wants to take public broadcasting from paying even more.

This isn’t about waste, fraud, and abuse. It’s about Republicans and their yearslong war against Corporation for Public Broadcasting–funded institutions like PBS and NPR. For years, the networks have been targeted by conservatives, who frame them as deeply ideological propaganda rather than basic media. Only time will tell how their own constituents will be impacted.

In 1991, Donald Trump filed for bankruptcy for the first time. He is said to have posed as his own publicist in a phone interview. He judged a “Look of the Year” modeling event, whose contestants reportedly included teenage girls as young as 14. His friendship with Jeffrey Epstein was still in bloom.

And the Soviet Union was on its last legs: 1991 was the year it would dissolve. It was also the last year the Russian city now known as St. Petersburg would be called Leningrad.

It was this time to which the president’s mind apparently strayed on Wednesday morning, when he accidentally referred to St. Petersburg by its former name in a social media post.

Trump had taken to Truth Social to disparage the media for covering criticisms of his impending summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The choice to hold the meeting in Alaska had drawn critics, among them Trump’s onetime national security adviser John Bolton, who told CNN: “The only better place for Putin than Alaska would be if the summit were being held in Moscow. So the initial setup, I think, is a great victory for Putin.”

The president reprimanded the press for reporting on this, and for “constantly quoting fired losers and really dumb people” like Bolton.

“Very unfair media is at work on my meeting with Putin,” Trump said. So unfair, he wrote, that, “if I got Moscow and Leningrad free, as part of the deal with Russia, the Fake News would say that I made a bad deal!”

It’s unclear what “freeing” those cities would mean, even in the context of this hyperbolic hypothetical.

Anyway, many observers were quick to note the “Leningrad” slip—which, to be sure, was still not as egregious as a gaffe, also regarding the upcoming summit, that the president had made two days earlier, when he incorrectly stated twice that it was taking place in Russia. (If the president’s Wednesday post was a 34-year throwback to 1991, his Monday remarks turned back the clock over a century and a half, to when Alaska was still Russian territory.)",https://images.newrepublic.com/33ad946d63ced978b7bc5e73e43aa9a74450b789.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg,N,,2025-08-13 21:57:26.974859

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents detained at least six people in Oakland on Tuesday, Aug. 12, at a home on 79th Avenue near Hillside Street. Among the detainees are a 17-year-old and someone with a severe disability, according to Nikolas De Bremaeker, immigrants’ rights managing attorney at Centro Legal.

De Bremaeker said he met with the detainees Tuesday after a call was received through the Alameda County Immigration Legal Education Partnership’s rapid response hotline (ACILEP).

“I pressed with ICE the illegality of detention of a child under these circumstances, and they will either release or move to a child detention center tonight,” De Bremaeker told The Oaklandside in an email.

The detainees are being held at the San Francisco ICE Field Office, according to De Bremaeker.

“A child is supposed to be held in a facility appropriate for children with certain requirements, as dictated by the Flores Settlement,” he said, referring to a 1997 settlement that establishes rules and regulations for the treatment of children in U.S. federal custody.

Centro Legal is one of the organizations working with ACILEP, a county program launched in February in response to the Trump Administration’s targeted immigration enforcement. ACILEP connects people with legal aid and helps verify reported ICE sightings in Alameda County.

In June, the Oakland Police Department confirmed to The Oaklandside that ICE agents have conducted targeted enforcement in the city for specific individuals, but didn’t provide further information.

An ICE spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on the arrests prior to publication.

This is the first confirmed ICE sighting in Oakland that came through the hotline, according to Centro Legal’s program manager, Angel Ibarra.

“It was thanks to the calls we received from the community and family that we were able to verify the activity and connect them with Niko [De Bremaeker] for legal support,” said Ibarra via email.

California is the state with the largest population of people residing in the U.S. without legal authorization, with estimates ranging from 2.3 million to 2.6 million according to the American Immigration Council and the Pew Research Center. Texas and Florida have the second and third largest populations, at 2.1 million and 1.2 million respectively. In the first five months of the second Trump administration, Texas accounted for 26,341 ICE arrests, roughly a quarter of the total nationwide for that period, while Florida logged 12,982 arrests, and there were 8,460 in California, according to a Los Angeles Times analysis of data obtained from the UC Berkeley-based Deportation Data Project. In terms of ICE arrests per one million residents, California ranked 27th in the nation, according to the LA Times analysis.

According to a San Francisco Chronicle analysis of the records obtained by the Deportation Data Project, ICE arrests in the San Francisco “area of responsibility” (which includes Kern County and north in California in addition to Hawaii, Saipan and Guam) increased 70% in the first months of President Donald Trump’s second term when compared to final six months of the Biden administration, for a total of 1,730 arrests. In December 2024, approximately 10% of the people ICE arrested in the San Francisco area of responsibility had no criminal convictions. The proportion has been steadily increasing in 2025, according to the SF Chronicle analysis, with 40% of ICE arrests in May in the area involving people with no criminal conviction.

De Bremaeker reminded community members of their constitutional rights under the 4th and 5th Amendments.

“It is unclear why this home raid happened, but a resident opened the door. I want to remind all to use your constitutional right to remain silent. Do not open your door,” De Bremaeker said. “ICE can’t come into your home unless they have a signed court/judge warrant or you let them in.”

According to Kenner arrest records, at least 75 of them, more than half, were initially booked for traffic-related offenses following a stop or collision.
(Verite News and Gulf States Newsroom have requested all criminal background check information obtained by Kenner law enforcement.)
Though it is a crime, not all law enforcement agencies routinely arrest people for driving without a license.","This article was produced in partnership with Gulf States Newsroom.

Alexander Sanchez had only been in the United States for two months when police officers pulled him over one morning in December near a major intersection in Kenner, about 10 miles outside of New Orleans.

It was a routine stop — the Kenner Police officers who pulled him over said Sanchez had run a red light — but it ended with Sanchez in a federal immigration detention center.

According to the police report, when an officer asked Sanchez for his driver’s license and his car’s registration and insurance information, Sanchez – who was undocumented and could not obtain a driver’s license in Louisiana – handed him a Honduran passport.

Speaking through an interpreter in a phone interview in June, Sanchez said he told the officer, “No tengo permitido” — I’m not permitted.

Sanchez was booked into the Kenner jail for driving without a license and the traffic signal violation. He said he spent three days in jail and then he was taken to federal immigration detention in rural Louisiana.

Hours after his arrest, Kenner, officers filled out a second arrest report for Sanchez based on a procedural request from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — called an immigration detainer. Detainers are used to request that local law enforcement either let ICE know when they’re going to release detainees who may be subject to deportation or to hold them for 48 hours beyond when they would otherwise be released to facilitate their transfer to immigration detention.

Sanchez would be held for months inside a notorious former state prison in Winnfield — now used for immigration detainees — with a history of alleged human rights abuses. (Sanchez is no longer in immigration detention, he asked that his current location not be disclosed. He is identified by his middle name and second last name for the same reason.)

Sanchez’ case is hardly unique in Kenner, a suburb of New Orleans with a large Hispanic population.

Gulf States Newsroom and Verite News analyzed Kenner Police Department arrest records for the first five months of this year and found that traffic arrests from stops and crashes in that city are serving as a gateway to immigration detention — and possible deportation — for many.

President Donald Trump came into office this year promising a nationwide crackdown undocumented immigrants. Among the tools his administration has used more extensively are detainer requests, which were up more than 60 percent in the first five months of 2025 compared to the same period last year, according to federal data reported by the Deportation Data Project.

But in Kenner, the increase has been even more dramatic. ICE issued at least 129 immigration detainers through Kenner PD between January and May, a more than sixfold increase from the 20 detainers issued through Kenner PD during the same period in 2024.

The vast majority of people booked on immigration detainers after being arrested by Kenner police from January through May were born in Honduras, according to the data shared by the Deportation Data Project.

According to Kenner arrest records, at least 75 of them, more than half, were initially booked for traffic-related offenses following a stop or collision.

The most common traffic offense linked to an immigration detainer was driving without a license — under state law, undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Louisiana licenses — often accompanied by other traffic-related charges.

More than half of the people whom Kenner PD arrested for unlicensed driving between January and May 2025 became subjects of immigration detainer requests, like the one issued for Sanchez.

Asked for comment on Sanchez’s case, an ICE spokesperson said the agency “defers to KPD.”

Rachel Taber, a member of New Orleans-based immigrants rights group Union Migranté, said she has been consulting with people whose loved ones have ended up detained and in some cases deported after traffic stops in Kenner. She stressed that the arrests can traumatize families who may be separated over a traffic offense.

“The penalty doesn’t fit the crime,” Taber said. “A minor traffic infraction does not merit … never being able to hug your kids again.”

As of Tuesday (Aug. 12) it was not clear how many of the people for whom detainers were issued had more serious criminal records. (Verite News and Gulf States Newsroom have requested all criminal background check information obtained by Kenner law enforcement.)

ICE issued at least 129 immigration detainers through Kenner PD between January and May, a more than sixfold increase from the same period in 2024.

As more local departments, encouraged by Trump, are partnering with ICE, similar patterns are emerging throughout the country. In June, The Washington Post reported on how expanding partnerships between ICE and police agencies around the country have deployed traffic arrests as part of the machinery of immigration enforcement.

Though Louisiana law enforcement agencies have partnered with ICE in the past, no such formal partnerships were in place at the beginning of this year, when Trump took office. This year, however, Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry and his conservative allies in the state legislature have strongly pushed for their adoption. And in March, Kenner PD became one of the first Louisiana departments to ink a new agreement with the federal agency, although as of last month, that program had not been fully implemented, Kenner Police Chief Keith Conley said in an interview.

To Conley, ICE’s increased reliance on local law enforcement, and its use of detainers, shouldn’t come as a surprise, given the emphasis on local-federal partnerships from both Trump and Landry, who has pushed local agencies in Louisiana to cooperate with federal immigration agencies.

“I think it was the perfect storm, with a governor coming in that’s very law-and-order, and then you have the president coming in that ran on immigration reform and border security. So I don’t think it’s a coincidence now that we had these spikes,” he said.

Conley said traffic enforcement is the “number one” concern for Kenner constituents. Driving without a license is a particular concern because of the risk that unlicensed and uninsured drivers may cause an accident, and the other drivers involved may “never get made whole,” Conley said.

Michele Waslin, assistant director of the Immigration History Research Center at University of Minnesota, said that scenario is why some states have expanded eligibility for driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants.

“Obviously, people are driving without licenses. You’re not stopping them from driving,” Waslin said. “We want them to be licensed and insured … so in the case that there is an accident, what you described won’t happen.”

Waslin, who has studied the intersection of driver’s license policy and immigration enforcement, said laws blocking undocumented immigrants from accessing licenses “very clearly intersect with agreements with state and local police to identify people for deportation.”

Conley said his agency is not enforcing immigration law, but making arrests based on criminal laws.

“They’re in our lockup based on a lawful criminal arrest. If [Homeland Security Investigations] calls and puts a detainer on them, I’m going to honor the detainer,” Conley said, referring to a branch of ICE that investigates immigration violations.

‘You’re going to get brought to jail’

Sanchez fled Honduras after receiving death threats, according to his immigration attorney, Jeremy Jong. In October, he settled in the New Orleans metro area, near his aunt, Judith Cruz.

On the morning Sanchez was arrested, he was driving to Cruz’s house in St. Rose, which borders Kenner, to take her to church, Cruz said in an interview.

Sanchez couldn’t get a driver’s license because Louisiana requires applicants for driver’s licenses to show proof that they are in the country legally.

Driving without a license is considered a misdemeanor in Louisiana. According to a Kenner city ordinance, the penalty for driving without a license is up to $500 in fines and no more than 60 days behind bars, The state penalty is more stringent , with possible fines and a maximum of six months behind bars.

Though it is a crime, not all law enforcement agencies routinely arrest people for driving without a license. In Kenner, however, it’s required. For undocumented immigrants like Sanchez, an arrest can lead to an ICE detainer request, then a lengthy stay in immigration detention and possible deportation.

Conley said police in Kenner have long been required to arrest anyone suspected of driving without a license. In an interview in May, the police chief said his department has been “transparent” about its policy.

“Here in the city of Kenner, it’s very well known that if you’re operating a vehicle and you’ve never been issued a license, you’re going to get brought to jail,” he said.

Kenner PD is a potential outlier. Verite News and Gulf States Newsroom asked 10 law enforcement agencies in the region, including the Louisiana State Police, about their policies and practices for encounters with unlicensed drivers. Of the seven that responded, only one other agency – St. Charles Parish Sheriff’s Office – has a mandatory arrest policy on suspicion of driving without a license.

Through a translator, Cruz said she knows many immigrants in her community who have been arrested by Kenner Police and booked into the city’s local jail for traffic violations. She said some of them, like her nephew, ended up in the hands of immigration agents.

She said mothers who need to provide for their children and cannot always get a ride will take the risk of driving without a license in order to get to and from work.

“Mothers have no choice but to work to provide for our families. And when you drive to work, you’re taking your life in your hands,” Cruz said. “It’s just very painful to think about all the children that could be left home without their families.”

There are two main ways that ICE learns of people in local jails who may have violated federal immigration law. When someone is booked into jail, that person’s information is often electronically shared with multiple federal agencies, according to Lindsay Williams, a public information officer for ICE.

If agents at ICE find the person is suspected of immigration violations, they’ll contact the ICE office responsible for the region where the arrest was made, and that office will issue a detainer, Williams said. Local or state agencies can also inform ICE agents in their area about people in custody. Williams said officials in the New Orleans ICE office learn about arrests by Kenner PD through both methods.

The records obtained by the newsrooms do not shed light on why authorities requested an immigration detainer for each individual in Kenner.

A boom in federal-local immigration enforcement partnerships under Trump

The jump in detainers issued to Kenner PD aligns with a national increase in ICE’s use of these requests that may be attributed to pressure from the Trump administration to ramp up immigration arrests in order to fulfill his campaign promise of mass deportations.

In the early days of his second term Trump urged homeland security officials to secure more agreements with local agencies to collaborate on immigration enforcement. These partnerships – called 287(g) agreements – deputize local officials to perform some ICE duties.

“If you want to increase the number of deportations, if you want large numbers, then you’re going to use these partnerships more and more,” Waslin said.

In Louisiana, Landry, an immigration hardliner and Trump ally, began laying the groundwork for increased state and local participation in immigration enforcement in 2024. During that year’s legislative session, Landry worked with Republican lawmakers on a civil law that prohibits law enforcement agencies from following so-called “sanctuary” policies that limit cooperation with ICE. This June, Landry signed a new piece of legislation with sharper teeth into law, making it a crime, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, for local officials to refuse to comply with immigration detainer requests.

As of mid-August, ICE has 897 active partnerships with agencies around the country for the 287(g) program, according to the agency – compared to 135 in December near the end of the Biden Administration. In Louisiana, which had no participants enrolled in the program at the end of last year, 17 agencies, including Kenner PD, have signed up.

While the department is not yet fully accredited in the program, Williams, the ICE representative, said Kenner PD’s existing relationship with the agency was a “main contributing factor” to securing the partnership.

“The relationship is a stellar example of state and local cooperation with ICE for upholding public safety and has been for many years across multiple presidential administrations,” Williams said in an email.

Once accredited, Kenner PD will operate under what is called a “jail enforcement model,” which authorizes police officers to investigate immigration statuses of people booked into the city’s jail, place them into immigration proceedings and issue immigration detainers themselves.

‘A failure to yield upended her life’

In some cases in Kenner, people were involved in traffic crashes other people had a hand in — only to be arrested and later booked by immigration agents, Kenner PD records show.

In an incident on March 7, a woman spoke to police as the victim of an alleged hit-and-run, according to a probable cause statement in arrest reports.

Police arrested her for driving without a license, and she was booked on an ICE detainer the next day. Conley said people involved in an accident will be asked if they have a driver’s license and will “be held to the law.”

In Kenner, records do show arrests of some people who were accused of crimes with serious penalties and then booked on immigration detainers. For example, between January and May, 2025, Kenner police took at least three people into custody who were suspected of sex-related crimes and then booked on detainers.

Nationally, the share of people arrested by immigration officers who also have past criminal convictions has fallen when compared to the previous presidential administration, one recent analysis showed.

Jong, an attorney at immigrants rights organization Al Otro Lado, said he’s had a few clients who have been detained after being arrested for traffic offenses in Kenner.

He still thinks about a client, a woman from El Salvador, who was arrested by Kenner police officers for allegedly failing to obey a traffic sign back in 2017. Jong said the woman’s family was “ruined” by her deportation.

“A failure to yield upended her life and split up this family,” Jong said. “Her husband was torn up.”

Jong said knowing the possible consequences for arrests of immigrants in Kenner, he doesn’t understand the department’s policy of arresting people who are unable to obtain driver’s licenses in the state for not having them.

“There’s so much discretion for a police department to determine what laws you’re gonna put people in jail for,” Jong said. “It does seem like they are making the conscious decision to do something that is gonna lead to many of their residents getting deported.”

In an email, Conley said the responsibility lies with the individual who isn’t licensed, and that Kenner is “diverse and inclusive.”

Sanchez was detained for five months at Winn Correctional Center. He said near the end of his time there, he experienced headaches daily and became paranoid – fearful of the danger he said he escaped in Honduras.

He said he thinks fondly about his time in Louisiana before he was arrested because he felt safe.

“Things were going pretty well for me,” he said. “I wasn’t in danger.”

He said he tries not to think about his time in immigration detention.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/84debb5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+142/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4b%2F24%2F871f4ab14d4aa1043c3d34f2cea7%2F20250811-czb-kenner-02-2000x1334.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 19:56:48.750762

ICE recruitment efforts have also targeted active local law enforcement officers.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced on Tuesday that the agency has received over 100,000 applications in less than two weeks. The statement was released only a day after The New York Times reported that immigrant detainees in ICE custody had reached a ""modern record"" high of 60,000 people.

President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) on July 4, which appropriated nearly $75 billion to increase ICE's capacity to detain immigrants and conduct immigration-related arrests—making ICE the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the country. With this funding, the Trump administration plans to reach its stated goal of deporting 1 million undocumented immigrants a year and reach an unprecedented quota of 3,000 immigrant arrests per day.

To keep up with these demands, ICE has launched an aggressive recruitment campaign—bankrolled by the nearly $30 billion from the OBBBA appropriated for hiring—and seeks to add 10,000 officers to the agency's more than 20,000 law enforcement and support personnel by 2029. To meet this end, Uncle Sam has been repurposed by ICE to recruit ""patriotic Americans"" to apply. The agency has also sweetened the deal by offering high starting salaries—some can reach $90,000—a maximum $50,000 signing bonus over three years, up to $60,000 in federal student loan repayments, and retirement benefits.

Last week, the agency also announced it was ending the age limitations for applicants—previously set between 21 and 37 or 40 years old, depending on the position—and began reaching out to retired federal law enforcement agents. The ICE recruitment website has a specific page dedicated to those who wish to ""return to mission,"" encouraging retirees to apply for ICE openings and ""secure our communities and uphold our laws"" during a ""pivotal moment in our country's history."" Selected retired federal law enforcement officers may also receive a salary from ICE while still collecting their pension.

Some speculate that the change to age limits and other policies means that ICE is having a hard time finding qualified applicants. But Tom Homan, the White House border czar, defended the move. ""There are a lot of roles at ICE for people who are over 40,"" he told Time magazine. ""Just because someone comes in and they're 55—maybe they can't carry a badge and a gun, they can certainly do administrative duty, they can do targeting on the intelligence team.""

John Sandweg, acting director of ICE under the Obama administration, told Time that recruiting from retired federal law enforcement was a ""pretty creative solution"" to quickly fill thousands of openings and get boots on the ground. Retired law enforcement officers won't need as much training as fresh recruits, who take much longer to hire, undergo a background check, receive security clearances, and get trained at Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers with limited capacity.

ICE recruitment efforts have also targeted active local law enforcement officers. At the end of July, ICE sent recruitment emails to Florida law enforcement seeking ""officers like you who are committed to serving with integrity, professionalism, and a deep sense of duty,"" reports CNN. The recruitment effort angered local sheriffs who previously agreed to partner with ICE on deportation efforts and are unable to match the hiring benefits offered by the agency.

Despite the heavy-handed recruitment efforts, Sandweg told Time that it will likely take ""three years before you see a significant increase of ICE agents on the street.""",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/08/8-13-25-v1-a.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 18:56:58.715230

Dan Goldman (NY-10), one week after he and two congressional colleagues, Rep. Espaillat and Rep. Velázquez, were turned away.

Lawmakers have been trying to enter MDC to see the conditions in which around 100 immigrants are being held.

Goldman says that last week, Bureau of Prisons (BOP) officials promised to accommodate a tour of the facility if given advanced notice of a visit, so he gave notice on Friday, August 8th.

Despite the advanced notice, he wasn't allowed in.

Under Section 527(a) of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024, members of Congress are given the authority to inspect any facility being used by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to detain or house immigrants -- without any prior notice needed.

""I want to understand why they are not letting me in,"" Goldman said.

In July, Goldman and 11 other members of Congress filed a suit against the Trump administration over its refusal to allow members of Congress to access ICE detention facilities, including 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan.

""A federal judge found that DHS was holding immigration detainees in illegal and unconstitutional conditions at 26 Federal Plaza and ordered DHS to immediately improve those inhumane conditions,"" Goldman said in a statement. ""For months, DHS denied allegations of dreadful conditions and prevented me from accessing the 26 Federal Plaza detention facility to inspect the conditions. Now we know that DHS has been lying to the American people for months.""

Last month, videos obtained by Eyewitness News purported to show the conditions inside the facility at 26 Federal Plaza.

Videos shared by a detainee with a local civic group appeared to show over a dozen people inside the room, with several detainees laying on the cement floor on thermal blankets. It also showed two toilets that were separated from the rest of the men by only a waist-high wall.

Goldman pointed out that the denial of access came less than 24 hours after a federal judge ordered the Department of Homeland Security to improve conditions at a separate ICE detention facility at 26 Federal Plaza in Lower Manhattan, where Goldman has also been trying to enter the facility to expose inhumane conditions.

""BOP is now helping DHS stash immigrants in their jails and preventing members of Congress from conducting oversight,"" Goldman said. ""The American people deserve a government that tells the truth, follows the law, and does not cover up abuse.""

Rural communities would see programs shutter, and family providers lose their jobs, she wrote.
Colleen Chawla, chief of San Mateo County Health, wrote that her organization — the county’s “safety-net” care provider — has worked for years to build up trust in immigrant communities.
The administration’s changes would threaten all of them, but also everyone else in the county, she wrote.
The Trump administration has defended the new rules, including in court.","If the Trump administration succeeds in barring undocumented immigrants from federally funded “public benefit” programs, vulnerable children and families across California would suffer greatly, losing access to emergency shelters, vital healthcare, early education and life-saving nutritional support, according to state and local officials who filed their opposition to the changes in federal court.

The new restrictions would harm undocumented immigrants but also U.S. citizens — including the U.S.-born children of immigrants and people suffering from mental illness and homelessness who lack documentation — and put intense stress on the state’s emergency healthcare system, the officials said.

Head Start, which provides tens of thousands of children in the state with early education, healthcare and nutritional support, may have to shutter some of its programs if the new rules barring immigrants withstand a lawsuit filed by California and other liberal-led states, officials said.

In a declaration filed as part of that litigation, Maria Guadalupe Jaime-Milehan, deputy director of the child care and developmental division of the California Department of Social Services, wrote that the restrictions would have an immediate “chilling effect” on immigrant and mixed-status families seeking support, but also cause broader “ripple effects” — especially in rural California communities that rely on such programs as “a critical safety net” for vulnerable residents, but also as major employers.

“Children would lose educational, nutritional, and healthcare services. Parents or guardians may be forced to cut spending on other critical needs to fill the gaps, and some may even be forced out of work so they can care for their children,” Jaime-Milehan said.

Rural communities would see programs shutter, and family providers lose their jobs, she wrote.

Tony Thurmond, California’s superintendent of public instruction, warned in a declaration that the “chilling effect” from such rules could potentially drive away talented educators who disagree with such policies and decide to “seek other employment that does not discriminate against children and families.”

Thurmond and Jaime-Milehan were among dozens of officials in 20 states and the District of Columbia who submitted declarations in support of those states’ lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s new rules. Six other officials from California also submitted declarations.

The lawsuit followed announcements last month from various federal agencies — including Health and Human Services, Labor, Education and Agriculture — that funding recipients would be required to begin screening out undocumented immigrants.

The announcements followed an executive order issued by President Trump in which he said his administration would “uphold the rule of law, defend against the waste of hard-earned taxpayer resources, and protect benefits for American citizens in need, including individuals with disabilities and veterans.”

Trump’s order cited the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, commonly known as welfare reform, as barring noncitizens from participating in federally funded benefits programs, and criticized past administrations for providing exemptions to that law for certain “life or safety” programs — including those now being targeted for new restrictions.

The order mandated that federal agencies restrict access to benefits programs for undocumented immigrants, in part to “prevent taxpayer resources from acting as a magnet and fueling illegal immigration to the United States.”

California and the other states sued July 21, alleging the new restrictions target working mothers and their children in violation of federal law.

“We’re not talking about waste, fraud, and abuse, we’re talking about programs that deliver essential childcare, healthcare, nutrition, and education assistance, programs that have for decades been open to all,” California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta said.

In addition to programs like Head Start, Bonta said the new restrictions threatened access to short-term shelters for homeless people, survivors of domestic violence and at-risk youth; emergency shelters for people during extreme weather; soup kitchens, community food banks and food support services for the elderly; and healthcare for people with mental illness and substance abuse issues.

The declarations are part of a motion asking the federal judge overseeing the case to issue a preliminary injunction barring the changes from taking effect while the litigation plays out.

Beth Neary, assistant director of HIV health services at the San Francisco Department of Public Health, wrote in her declaration that the new restrictions would impede healthcare services for an array of San Francisco residents experiencing homelessness — including undocumented immigrants and U.S. citizens.

“Individuals experiencing homelessness periodically lack identity and other documents that would be needed to verify their citizenship or immigration status due to frequent moves and greater risk of theft of their belongings,” she wrote.

Colleen Chawla, chief of San Mateo County Health, wrote that her organization — the county’s “safety-net” care provider — has worked for years to build up trust in immigrant communities.

“But if our clients worry that they will not be able to qualify for the care they need, or that they or members of their family face a risk of detention or deportation if they seek care, they will stop coming,” Chawla wrote. “This will exacerbate their health conditions.”

Greta S. Hansen, chief operating officer of Santa Clara County, wrote that more than 40% of her county’s residents are foreign-born and more than 60% of the county’s children have at least one foreign-born parent — among the highest rates anywhere in the country.

The administration’s changes would threaten all of them, but also everyone else in the county, she wrote.

“The cumulative effect of patients not receiving preventive care and necessary medications would likely be a strain on Santa Clara’s emergency services, which would result in increased costs to Santa Clara and could also lead to decreased capacity for emergency care across the community,” Hansen wrote.

The Trump administration has defended the new rules, including in court.

In response to the states’ motion for preliminary injunction, attorneys for the administration argued that the rule changes are squarely in line with the 1996 welfare reform law and the rights of federal agencies to enforce it.

They wrote that the notices announcing the new rules that were sent out by federal agencies “merely recognize that the breadth of benefits available to unqualified aliens is narrower than the agencies previously interpreted,” and “restore compliance with federal law and ensure that taxpayer-funded programs intended for the American people are not diverted to subsidize unqualified aliens.”

GEO contended Washington can’t regulate the detention center differently than similar state facilities, since the state’s minimum wage law exempts prisons and jails.
“For example, any defense contractor could refuse to pay minimum wage.
Lawmakers tried to get it shut down in 2021 through a state law that was later deemed unenforceable.","A federal appeals court on Wednesday refused to give the operator of the immigrant detention center in Tacoma another chance to make its case for paying detainees as little as $1 per day.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied the request from The GEO Group, the for-profit company that runs the facility, to reconsider its decision from earlier this year, siding with lower courts that found GEO violated state minimum wage law.

The decision affirms that the Florida-based GEO Group will need to pay more than $23 million that a jury and federal judge previously awarded. The next step in the company’s fight could be the U.S. Supreme Court. The case, brought by detainees and the state of Washington, has been ongoing since 2017.

GEO Group has run the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma since 2005. Its current contract with the federal government, signed in 2015, awarded the company at least $700 million to operate the facility over the following decade. The facility holds people detained by federal immigration enforcement on civil violations as they await potential deportation or release back into the United States.

The company used to run a voluntary work program for detainees. For years, hundreds at the Tacoma detention center were paid $1 per day, the minimum federal pay required in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. When necessary to attract workers, pay would go up to $5.

The program allowed GEO to avoid hiring 85 full-time employees, according to court filings. The detainees would cook and serve food, wash dishes, do laundry and clean the facility.

GEO’s federal contract requires it to comply with “all applicable federal, state, and local laws and standards,” including “labor laws and codes.” This includes state minimum wage laws, courts have ruled.

The company had argued federal contractors couldn’t be forced to pay Washington’s minimum wage under the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution, which holds that federal law takes precedence over state law.

GEO contended Washington can’t regulate the detention center differently than similar state facilities, since the state’s minimum wage law exempts prisons and jails.

A U.S. District Court jury in 2021 found GEO Group violated Washington’s minimum wage statute, and awarded nearly $17.3 million in back wages. A federal judge ordered the company to pay the state an additional $5.9 million in penalties. The work program has been suspended since then.

Between 2010 and 2018, GEO made around $20 million per year running the 1,575-bed detention center.

Washington’s state Supreme Court also sided with the detainees and the state, finding in 2023 that the detained workers should be considered employees.

On this go-around, GEO asked the original three-judge 9th Circuit panel either to rehear the case or send it to the full appeals court in what is known as a rehearing en banc. The Trump administration’s Department of Justice also urged the court to reconsider. The court denied the requests Wednesday.

Dissenting from the decision, Judge Patrick Bumatay, an appointee of President Donald Trump, wrote that “the effect of this decision will be widespread.”

“Our court provides a ‘roadmap’ for States seeking to undermine federal policies with which they disagree,” Bumatay wrote. “Our court’s message is clear: So long as States focus their regulation on federal government contractors — rather than on the federal government itself — the States may frustrate the performance of any federal government activities they wish.”

Chief Judge Mary Murguia, who President Barack Obama appointed, disagreed. She wrote that Bumatay equating the federal government and its contractors is “contrary to long-settled black letter law.”

“Adoption of his position would allow any government contractor to refuse to pay state-mandated minimum wage to its employees,” she continued. “For example, any defense contractor could refuse to pay minimum wage. No one in this case, not even GEO, has suggested that this is the law.”

The facility, the only private, for-profit detention center in Washington, has a history of allegations of human rights violations. It has come under renewed scrutiny as more detainees have been sent there with Trump’s return to office.

The Legislature has long had the detention center in its sights. Lawmakers tried to get it shut down in 2021 through a state law that was later deemed unenforceable.

Washington has also been ensconced in years of legal back-and-forth with GEO over state laws calling for greater oversight of the facility. Another court case tackling that issue is currently awaiting a ruling from the 9th Circuit.

A total of 372 organizations have coalesced to oppose the administration’s decision to make more federally funded health and human service programs off-limits to immigrants with some form of permission to be in the country.

The groups say the administration wrongly promotes the expanded restrictions as part of its efforts to target illegal immigration. The policy actually “directly targets lawfully present immigrants” by turning early learning centers, community health centers and mental health and addiction treatment programs “into immigration checkpoints” where providers would have to check a person’s immigration status, according to the groups.

“Undocumented immigrants already are not eligible for most federally funded programs. This is another case where the administration is lying to the public,” said Adriana Cadena, director of the Protecting Immigration Families coalition, which led the organizations’ opposition to restrictions to be implemented by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

As a result, the restrictions will harm millions, the groups stated in official comments filed in response to the administration's expanded restrictions, published in the Federal Register July 14.

The deadline for public comment on the new restrictions was set for 11:59 p.m. Wednesday.

One in 4 children in the U.S. are in a family with at least one immigrant parent. In 2023, 86% of those children were born in the U.S., making them U.S. citizens, according to Migration Policy Institute, an immigration think tank. (President Donald Trump also wants to change such birthright citizenship.)

Even if a U.S. citizen child is entitled to use a program, the Trump administration's restrictions are likely to cause confusion and misunderstanding, Cadena said, because of the many children who are in families whose members have different types of immigration status.

""This is going to have long-term consequences we cannot begin to grasp,"" she said.

In response to an NBC News request for comment, the White House sent a link to a July 10 news release by HHS announcing the new restrictions. The administration said in the release that it was ensuring that public benefits were not “diverted to subsidize illegal aliens.”

“For too long, the government has diverted hardworking Americans’ tax dollars to incentivize illegal immigration,” HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., stated in the July 10 release. “Today’s action changes that — it restores integrity to federal social programs, enforces the rule of law, and protects vital resources for the American people.”

Expanding the programs restricted to 'qualified' immigrants

The 1996 Personal Responsibility Reconciliation Act restricted the eligibility for federal public benefits to certain “qualified” immigrants, according to KFF, a health policy group.

Qualified immigrants have been defined as those lawfully present in the U.S. and do not include people with Temporary Protected Status, those who have Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and others, KFF reported.

The HHS has added 13 more programs to the list of programs open only to qualified immigrants.

Those newly added by the administration include Head Start, some of the funding for community health centers, family planning services, child welfare prevention, kinship guardian assistance, substance abuse prevention, treatment and recovery and mental health services and the Community Services Block Grant, the groups said. The federal government has said the list is not comprehensive and more programs could be added later.

The groups argue that the programs and immigrants' access to them have a larger benefit to society as a whole and that ""reducing access to these vital programs will make all of our communities less healthy, less safe, less stable, less able to thrive.""

Restrictions on the HHS programs announced in July were to be effective immediately. Groups said little guidance has been given to providers regarding their implementation, creating confusion and having a chilling effect on people who are eligible for the programs and benefits as well as on the nonprofits, local governments and others who provide them.

Several states have sued over the changes, which they said would also affect programs such as Meals on Wheels, domestic violence shelters, housing assistance and more. A lawsuit also was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and others on behalf of parent groups challenging Trump’s policies on Head Start.

The administration provided a 30-day comment period for the new restrictions.

""We do not necessarily expect that there is a real interest from the administration to seek comment on public policy that will impact millions of people,"" Cadena said.

""This is all about the Trump administration's governmentwide attack on immigrant families, and to dismantle the safety net system that many Americans rely on,"" she said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250813-miami-headstart-program-education-ac-448p-878f3c.jpg",N,,2025-08-13 19:56:54.102805

Stripping away half of that workforce during the height of hurricane season, he said, puts every coastal state at risk.
Shifting more than 100 key FEMA employees to ICE to carry out your mass deportation initiative puts Americans at risk.
We are in the height of hurricane season, where a major storm is a true all-hands-on-deck moment.
I strongly urge you to immediately reverse this decision and bring these key employees back to FEMA before it’s too late.","Congressman Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ) today sent a letter to Trump’s Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem demanding she reverse her decision to reassign half of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) human resources and security employees to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for 90 days – in the middle of peak hurricane season.

Pallone called the move “short-sighted” and “extremely dangerous,” warning it would gut FEMA’s ability to respond to hurricanes and other disasters during the most critical months of the year for coastal states like New Jersey.

“A mass detail during hurricane season is unheard of precisely because past leadership recognized that doing so would kneecap FEMA’s ability to keep Americans safe,” Pallone wrote. “…The Trump Administration fired and pushed into early retirement one-third of FEMA’s workforce, crippling its ability to respond to back-to-back disasters. FEMA’s workforce is now stretched perilously thin managing numerous ongoing disasters.”

Pallone’s letter cites the recent devastating floods in Texas as well as ongoing recovery issues in North Carolina and other major flooding events across the country. He warned that removing more than 100 key FEMA employees now will slow or block the delivery of lifesaving aid in the aftermath of storms.

The Trump Administration’s reassignment of FEMA staff is also part of a broader shift in federal priorities under Trump’s so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill” (OBBB) which dramatically expands ICE funding, enabling a mass deportation initiative, while slashing key social safety net programs like Medicaid and food assistance. Pallone noted that Republicans in Congress passed the OBBB with over $30 billion specifically to expand ICE staffing, making the poaching of FEMA staff unnecessary for immigration enforcement.

“When it comes to disaster response, our nation should not shoot from the hip,” Pallone wrote. “Emergency management isn’t just FEMA’s job, it’s America’s promise to our citizens.”

Pallone emphasized that FEMA’s human resources and security teams are essential to disaster operations – rapidly hiring recovery workers, securing contracts, conducting background checks, and protecting field operations. Stripping away half of that workforce during the height of hurricane season, he said, puts every coastal state at risk.

With experts forecasting an above-average hurricane season, including the likelihood of multiple major storms, Pallone urged Noem to “bring these key employees back to FEMA before it’s too late.”

The full letter is available here and below:

Secretary Noem:

I urge you to immediately reverse your decision to detail half of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) human resources and security staff to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Making this decision in the middle of peak hurricane season is yet another example of dangerous decisions you and FEMA’s Acting Director David Richardson have demonstrated and put the health and safety of my constituents on the Jersey Shore at risk.

Reassigning more than 100 key FEMA employees to ICE for 90 days during the months of August, September, and October is not only short-sighted, but also extremely dangerous. A mass detail during hurricane season is unheard of precisely because past leadership recognized that doing so would kneecap FEMA’s ability to keep Americans safe. I was already concerned about the agency’s capacity to respond to hurricanes impacting the Jersey Shore after learning that FEMA got rid of 2,000 employees.

Based on the evidence, FEMA is understaffed, poorly managed and woefully unprepared for what forecasters claim will be an above-average hurricane season. The Trump Administration fired and pushed into early retirement one-third of FEMA’s workforce crippling its ability to respond to back-to-back disasters. FEMA’s workforce is now stretched perilously thin managing numerous ongoing disasters. This includes the recent devastating Texas floods, which left Americans without promised services, and ongoing recovery issues in North Carolina and other major flooding events across the country.

Shifting more than 100 key FEMA employees to ICE to carry out your mass deportation initiative puts Americans at risk. In response to a major disaster, FEMA depends on their human resources and security teams to surge assistance into impacted communities with hundreds of local hires, recovery contracts, background investigations, and field operations security. Poaching employees from FEMA is also unnecessary given that Republicans in Congress passed the One Big Ugly Bill that supercharges ICE with over $30 billion for the sole purpose of hiring additional agents that they do not even need.

When it comes to disaster response, our nation should not shoot from the hip. Asking communities and states to face extreme weather alone is wrong. Emergency management isn’t just FEMA’s job; it’s America’s promise to our citizens.

We are in the height of hurricane season, where a major storm is a true all-hands-on-deck moment.

Both Republican and Democratic state attorneys general filed amicus briefs in the case, with Republicans siding with the Trump administration.
The case originated when Trump signed an order on Inauguration Day freezing certain foreign aid spending.
Trump administration sees 'big win' Several members of the Trump administration, including Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought and Attorney General Pam Bondi, cheered the Circuit Court’s ruling in social media posts.
“In a 2-1 ruling, the DC Circuit lifted an injunction ordering President Trump to spend hard-earned taxpayer dollars on wasteful foreign aid projects,” Bondi wrote.","WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court on Wednesday overturned a lower court’s ruling that had required the Trump administration to spend foreign aid dollars approved by Congress.

But instead of addressing the central argument of the lawsuit — that a president cannot refuse to spend money approved by lawmakers, who hold the power of the purse — the Circuit Court in a potentially significant decision said the organizations that filed the case didn’t have the authority to do so.

Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson wrote in her 33-page opinion that only the comptroller general, who leads the Government Accountability Office, has the power to bring lawsuits when a president impounds, or refuses to spend, congressionally approved funds. The GAO is an independent, non-partisan watchdog agency that works for Congress.

“Because the grantees lack a cause of action, we need not address on the merits whether the government violated the Constitution by infringing on the Congress’s spending power through alleged violations of the 2024 Appropriations Act, the ICA and the Anti-Deficiency Act,” Henderson wrote. The ICA is the Impoundment Control Act, which is the legal mechanism through which the president can delay or withhold funds.

Henderson was nominated to the Circuit Court in 1990 by President George H.W. Bush, a few years after President Ronald Reagan nominated her as a federal district judge in 1986.

Henderson wrote that she and Judge Gregory G. Katsas, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, concluded “the district court abused its discretion in granting a preliminary injunction” for several reasons.

Both Republican and Democratic state attorneys general filed amicus briefs in the case, with Republicans siding with the Trump administration. The case originated when Trump signed an order on Inauguration Day freezing certain foreign aid spending.

Henderson wrote that “within weeks, the State Department and USAID suspended or terminated thousands of grant awards.”

‘It is our responsibility to check the president’

Judge Florence Y. Pan, who was nominated by President Joe Biden, issued a 46-page dissenting opinion, arguing the ruling from her two colleagues was “procedurally and substantively flawed.”

“It is our responsibility to check the President when he violates the law and exceeds his constitutional authority,” Pan wrote. “We fail to do that here.”

Pan wrote she disagreed with the majority’s opinion that Trump withholding certain foreign aid funding was “a mere violation of the Impoundment Control Act that should be addressed by the Comptroller General.”

“In this case, the President’s violation of the Impoundment Control Act is a sideshow,” Pan wrote. “That statute provided a mechanism for the President to lawfully attempt to impound the funds, and his failure to follow its prescribed procedures is evidence that he was, in fact, refusing to obligate the funds in defiance of Congress.”

Public media funding targeted

The Trump administration has used the Impoundment Control Act one time this year, when it requested Congress cancel $9.4 billion in funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and various foreign aid programs.

The House voted mostly along party lines to approve the full request in mid-June.

Senate Republicans approved the bill in July after preserving full funding for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR.

House GOP lawmakers then cleared the bill for Trump’s signature just before a 45-day clock ran out.

Trump administration sees 'big win'

Several members of the Trump administration, including Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought and Attorney General Pam Bondi, cheered the Circuit Court’s ruling in social media posts.

“In a 2-1 ruling, the DC Circuit lifted an injunction ordering President Trump to spend hard-earned taxpayer dollars on wasteful foreign aid projects,” Bondi wrote. “We will continue to successfully protect core Presidential authorities from judicial overreach.”

Vought wrote the ruling was a “Big win!”

An OMB spokesperson wrote in a statement the ruling represented a victory for the White House.

“Radical left dark-money groups have been using the court system to seize control of U.S. foreign policy,” the spokesperson wrote. “Today’s decision stops these private groups from maliciously interfering with the President’s ability to spend responsibly and administer foreign aid in a lawful manner and in alignment with his America First policies.”

Lauren Bateman, attorney at Public Citizen Litigation Group and lead counsel on the suit, wrote in a statement that the court's ruling represented ""a significant setback for the rule of law and risks further erosion of basic separation of powers principles.

""We will seek further review from the court, and our lawsuit will continue regardless as we seek permanent relief from the Administration's unlawful termination of the vast majority of foreign assistance. In the meantime, countless people will suffer disease, starvation, and death from the Administration’s unconscionable decision to withhold life-saving aid from the world’s most vulnerable people.""",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/2025-08/trumpjan202025_0.jpg?h=a580faff&itok=qIC4g4WA,N,,2025-08-13 17:56:40.760457

Judge Thomas Cullen of the Western District of Virginia questioned the DOJ over the lawsuit, which alleges that the Maryland district court overstepped its authority by imposing a standing order that automatically pauses deportation cases for two days when they are first filed.

Cullen, a Trump appointee, told DOJ attorneys early on in the hearing he was wary of their position.

""One of the things about me is that I don’t have a very good poker face, and you probably picked up on the fact that I have some skepticism,"" Cullen said.

TRUMP DHS SUES ENTIRE BENCH OF FEDERAL JUDGES IN MARYLAND DISTRICT COURT OVER AUTOMATIC INJUNCTIONS

The Virginia federal judge is presiding over the case in Baltimore because the Maryland judges recused themselves. Cullen said he would issue a decision by Labor Day on whether he would block the standing order.

DOJ attorney Elizabeth Hedges argued during the hearing that the Maryland court's order had the effect of ""tampering with the [U.S.] attorney general’s discretion"" over immigration enforcement matters.

The order requires clerks to immediately enter administrative injunctions that last two business days in cases brought by alleged illegal immigrants who are challenging their detentions or removals. The injunctions have the effect of temporarily barring the Department of Homeland Security from deporting or changing the legal status of an immigrant until a judge has time to review the case.

Hedges argued that the judges automatically enter the orders in these cases even if the court lacks jurisdiction in some of them.

The lawsuit, brought in June, comes as the Trump administration has taken an aggressive public posture against individual federal judges who have blocked enforcement of many of the president's executive actions, including in areas of immigration, education and federal agency cuts.

President Donald Trump has complained his agenda has been hamstrung and has called for the impeachment of certain judges whose orders he disagrees with. But the Supreme Court has, in many cases, overrode judges and allowed Trump to temporarily implement his executive actions while the lawsuits proceed in the lower courts.

Attorney Paul Clement, arguing on behalf of the Maryland judges, said during the hearing that there were ""less confrontational"" alternatives to resolving differences with the courts than suing every member of a district court.

Clement, a renowned conservative lawyer who served as former President George Bush's solicitor general, defended the standing order, calling it a ""modest effort to preserve the judiciary's ability to perform its constitutionally assigned role.""

'LAWLESS AND INSANE': TRUMP ADMIN READIES FOR FIGHT AFTER JUDGES BLOCK ABREGO GARCIA REMOVAL FOR NOW

Chief Judge George Russell of Maryland said he issued the standing order as a scheduling convenience to make sure the ""status quo"" is preserved when a deportation case is filed. He cited a ""recent influx"" of cases involving detained immigrants that were being filed after normal court hours, including on weekends and holidays.

The lawsuit represents a test of the independence of the judiciary branch. Clement said it was ""fundamentally incompatible"" with the separation of powers.

""We just don’t have a tradition of suits that are executive versus judiciary, executive versus Congress, Congress versus the executive,"" Clement said, adding that ""we don’t really expect one branch to sue another to try to vindicate its institutional interests.""

The lawsuit also comes as Trump's mass deportation agenda has encountered some roadblocks as immigrants raise court challenges and appeals to their removals.

Other immigration advocates have also raised concerns about conditions at the Baltimore ICE facility.","A group of Maryland lawmakers toured a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Baltimore on Wednesday after they were denied a visit in late July.

A spokesperson for the agency said the lawmakers initially arrived without giving advanced notice and were denied a tour for the safety of those in custody and ICE employees.

Wednesday's tour comes after a federal class-action lawsuit criticized the conditions at the George H. Fallon federal building.

ICE has denied those allegations, saying the agency is ""committed to enforcing immigration laws fairly, safely and humanely,"" and complies with federal laws and ICE policies.

Touring the Baltimore ICE facility

U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen and U.S. Representatives Kweisi Mfume and Sarah Elfreth participated in a guided tour of the facility on Wednesday morning.

The group said they left with more questions after being denied the opportunity to speak with detainees and being told that ICE officials would get back to them with answers.

""We leave here with more questions than we came in with, and it was that way the last time we were here,"" Mfume said. ""They've promised to get back to us on at least 20, 25 issues that have come up.""

""We just want answers, we want the truth, the facts, and we want to find a way to make sure that's public and transparent,"" he added.

According to Van Hollen, the group was told they could not talk to detainees at the ICE facility under Maryland law. However, the senator said the state law that the agency referred to does not prohibit members of Congress from talking with detainees.

""Clearly, they don't want us talking to the people who are detained here today or in the future,"" he said.

""As a senior member of a House oversight committee and as the ranking member of the government operations committee, we have clear congressional jurisdiction over ICE,"" Mfume said.

Following the visit from lawmakers on Wednesday, Van Hollen argued that the Baltimore holding facility serves as a detention center, claiming that there are reports of people being held for eight days.

Under ICE policy, holding facilities are designed to keep detainees for up to 12 hours.

""If you look at the people in these rooms, they are clearly being detained,"" Van Hollen said.

The agency previously responded to those allegations in a statement saying, ""ICE Baltimore operates a holding room, not a detention facility, and therefore is not subject to the standards outlined in the 2011 Performance-Based National Detention Standards.""

Van Hollen also mentioned that, according to ICE data, nearly 84% detainees fall under a category of ""no threat level,"" conflicting with the Trump administration's claim that ICE would be going after the ""worst of the worst.""

""They said they were going after the worst of the worst,"" Van Hollen said. ""That would be warranted, and that would be totally appropriate if that were true.""

The lawmakers said they are hoping to get answers after leaving ICE leaders with a list of questions.

WJZ has reached out to ICE for comment.

Claims of inhumane conditions

In June, the Amica Center and National Immigration Project filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of two women who were being held at the Baltimore ICE facility.

According to the lawsuit, the women were held for long periods in ""inhumane"" holding rooms, which allegedly violate ICE policies.

The lawsuit claimed ICE detainees can only be held for 12 hours in holding facilities. However, during a hearing in July, the Department of Justice argued that the lawsuit was incorrect.

Other immigration advocates have also raised concerns about conditions at the Baltimore ICE facility.

In March, the Amica Center and the nonprofit CASA held a rally where attendees criticized the size of the holding rooms, the lack of medical staff, and the lack of a food service contract.

ICE responded in a statement, saying its Health Service Corps is on site to provide necessary medical services.

""In the event of a medical emergency, detainees are promptly transported to nearby hospitals to receive immediate and appropriate care,"" the agency said.

U.S. Rep. Sarah Elfreth, during her tour, described the detainment rooms as tight.

""If there were 40 people in one of those rooms, you wouldn't be able to sit down all at the same time,"" she said.

Mfume questions how those with medical and sanitary needs are being treated,

""Some of our concerns are, what happens with women who have sanitary needs? What happens to people who have daily medications that were not on them when they're apprehended, and what happens to those who come in not being classified by nationality?"" Mfume said.

Initial ICE visit denied

In July, the lawmakers claimed their initial plans to visit the facility in July were ""unlawfully denied.""

""This does not bode well here in Baltimore or anywhere if members of the United States Congress, who are duly authorized to come in and to inspect, visit, or walk through a federal facility, are not allowed in,"" said Mfume, who is a senior member of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.

In response, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) posted on social media, saying the lawmakers should have scheduled a tour at least one week in advance.

""Congressman, if you need a photo op with the violent criminal illegal aliens you are protecting, schedule a TOUR,"" the DHS posted on X.

US lawmakers sue over access to ICE facilities

In late July, 12 Democratic Congressmembers filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, claiming there was an effort to limit access to detention centers that hold immigrants.

U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md) was among the leaders who joined the lawsuit. In the lawsuit, leaders alleged that the Trump administration is blocking their attempts to enter ICE detention centers and delaying plans to inspect the facilities.

The suit alleges that despite the government’s own directives, the parents “were never given a choice as to whether their children should be deported with them and were prohibited from contacting their counsel or having meaningful contact with their families to arrange for the care of their children.” The mothers, named in the suit as Rosario and Julia, allege they wanted their children to remain in the U.S.

Instead, the families were “illegally deported without even a semblance of due process,” the lawsuit states.

Romeo, as the now 5-year-old is identified in the lawsuit, was diagnosed with a “rare and aggressive form of kidney cancer,” at age 2. He immediately began receiving ongoing “critical, life-saving medical treatment” in the U.S., according to the lawsuit, which was filed by immigrant advocacy group National Immigration Project and three law firms.

“The failure to allow his mother to arrange for his care, in violation of ICE’s own directive, and his unlawful deportation to Honduras interfered with his needed medical treatment,” the suit said.

The suit was filed on behalf of the two mothers and their children in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana on July 31. The plaintiffs’ names in the lawsuit are pseudonyms to protect their identities and safety, attorneys said. The case against the federal government is in its early stages, and plaintiffs are seeking a jury trial and damages, and for their arrests and removals to be found unlawful and to be returned to the United States.

“This is emblematic of what happens when the administration is laser-focused on deportation, that when the end result is all that matters, you are going to end up with wrongful and unlawful deportations,” Stephanie Alvarez-Jones, an attorney with the National Immigration Project, told NBC News.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that U.S. children were not being “deported” and denied that the parents were not given a choice regarding the care of their children before being sent to Honduras.

“Rather than separate their families, ICE asked the mothers if they wanted to be removed with their children or if they wanted ICE to place the children with someone safe the parent designates,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said. “The parents in this instance made the determination to take their children with them back to Honduras.”

McLaughlin said that when there is “an underlying health issue, ICE makes sure that treatment is available in the country to which the illegal alien is being removed. The implication that ICE would deny a child the medical care they need is flatly FALSE, and it is an insult to the men and women of federal law enforcement.”

NBC News has previously reported on U.S. citizen children being sent with their deported immigrant parents to other countries, including a 10-year-old girl recovering from a rare brain tumor sent to Mexico.

Rosario and Julia and their children were put on a plane to Honduras on April 25 after being detained at immigration check-in appointments where they were told to bring their U.S. citizen children and their passports, according to the lawsuit.

Both women had settled in the U.S. some years ago, the lawsuit states. Rosario came to the U.S. in 2013 as a 13-year-old unaccompanied minor. She gave birth to her first child, Ruby, in 2018 in New Orleans, and her second child, Romeo, in 2020.

In the lawsuit, Rosario claims she didn’t know an immigration case against her was playing out while she was in the U.S. She said she only found out she had a removal order dating back 10 years after she was taken into ICE custody during a traffic stop in February.

The mother of two was given an ankle monitor and had check-ins with ICE both at her home and at their local office, the suit states.

On April 24, Rosario showed up at her immigration check-in with her attorney and children, along with their passports, per ICE’s instructions. At the appointment, Rosario and her children were taken to a back room without their attorney and told they would be deported, according to the lawsuit.

ICE allegedly asked Rosario to sign a document without telling her what it was and Rosario refused. Agents allegedly dismissed her pleas to speak with her attorney about Romeo’s condition.

Her attorney then learned that the family had been transferred to a facility in Alexandria, Louisiana, three hours away. The attorney filed a stay of removal for Rosario’s family that included evidence of Romeo’s Stage 4 cancer diagnosis.

The family was boarded on a plane the next day.

According to the lawsuit, Rosario “explicitly opposed her U.S. citizen children’s deportation and had never provided consent for such action. Indeed, given Romeo’s cancer and specialized medical needs, Rosario wanted both of her U.S. citizen children to remain in the United States.”

Like Rosario, Julia was also denied access to an attorney when she and her children were detained by ICE and deported, the lawsuit states.

Julia first arrived at the U.S. border in 2019 fleeing Honduras, after her daughter Janelle was kidnapped there, according to the details in the lawsuit. After applying for asylum, they were forced to wait in Mexico at the time under Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy. They said in the lawsuit they were kidnapped in Mexico before they were able to return to the U.S. in August 2021.

Her daughter Jade was born in Louisiana in 2023.

Julia was told in February 2025 to begin bringing both of her daughters to her regular ICE check-ins, the lawsuit states.

On April 22, Julia, who was now pregnant, attended a check-in with her daughters as her partner waited outside. She said she was told her family was being transferred to Alexandria and that a judge would determine their fate in the U.S., according to the lawsuit. Her partner alleges he was told his family was transferred hours later and he was not given time to speak to Julia.

Later that night, Julia was told she would be deported along with her children.

Her attorney was allegedly told by ICE that Jacob, Julia’s partner and also an immigrant, would be detained as well if he attempted to pick up his daughter Jade, who is a U.S. citizen.

While Jacob and the family attorney fought to temporarily stop the removal of Julia and her children, an ICE officer allegedly told Julia to write on a piece of paper that her daughter Jade would be going with her to Honduras.

“When Julia objected, the officer threatened Julia that Jade would be immediately sent to a foster home in the United States if Julia did not write a note stating that Jade would be deported to Honduras with her,” the lawsuit states, adding that Julia did as instructed under duress.

“At no point was Julia provided an opportunity to arrange for care of her U.S. citizen daughter Jade in the United States.”

DHS said in its statement to NBC News that it “takes its responsibility to protect children seriously and will continue to work with federal law enforcement to ensure that children are safe and protected.” The agency said parents “can take control of their departure” by self-deporting.

Julia and her children were sent to Honduras on April 25 on the same plane as Rosario’s family.

Rosario said in a statement that in Honduras she lacks the resources to care for her children the way they need.

“Since returning, my daughter has gotten sick and struggled with anxiety, and I’ve been struggling with my own health issues too,” she said.

Julia said in a statement she thought she and her children were going to a regular appointment, but she was lied to. “I never imagined they would send me and my children to Honduras,” she said.

“Returning to Honduras has meant leaving my husband behind, and that’s been very hard,” she said. “We were deprived of the opportunity to be and make decisions as a family.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/250616-ice-officer-vl-506p-9f45d8.jpg",N,,2025-08-13 17:57:30.406094

President Donald Trump said he may declare a national emergency to maintain control of Washington, D.C.'s police force if Congress doesn't work with him to extend the current federalization plan.

Trump made the statement during a press conference at the Kennedy Center in Washington, arguing he can maintain control over the Metropolitan Police Department indefinitely if he declares a national emergency. Under the current structure, the federal government took control over the MPD for a 30-day period on Monday.

""Your federalization of the police has a 30-day limit unless Congress acts to extend it. Are you talking to Congress about extending it, or do you believe 30 days is sufficient?"" asked Daily Signal White House reporter Elizabeth Troutman Mitchell.

""Well, if it's a national emergency, we can do it without Congress. But we expect to be before Congress very quickly. And again, we think the Democrats will not do anything to stop crime, but we think the Republicans will do it almost unanimously. So we're going to need a crime bill. That we're going to be putting in, and it's going to pertain initially to DC. We're going to use it as a very positive example.""

Trump went on to confirm that his administration would be seeking ""long-term extensions"" to the 30-day limit.

""You can't have 30 days,"" he said. ""We're going to do this very quickly, but we're going to want extensions. I don't want to call a national emergency, but if I have to I will.""

TRUMP'S PLAN TO DEPLOY NATIONAL GUARD IN DC SPARKS BACKLASH FROM RESIDENTS—BUT SOME WELCOME IT

Trump announced his D.C. crime and homelessness crackdown last week, calling in the National Guard and federal law enforcement in addition to federalizing the MPD.

Law enforcement has arrested more than 100 people since Aug. 7, which includes 43 who were arrested Tuesday, a White House official told Fox Digital Wednesday morning. The arrests are part of Trump’s March executive order, which established the Making DC Safe and Beautiful Task Force, ahead of Trump's Monday announcement federalizing the D.C. police department.

""President Trump’s bold leadership is quickly making our nation’s capital safer,"" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Fox Digital. ""In less than one week, over 100 violent criminals have already been arrested and taken off of the streets in Washington, D.C. President Trump is delivering on his campaign promise to clean up this city and restore American Greatness to our cherished capital.""

The White House says those living in homeless encampments in the nation's capital will have two choices in the coming days: accept treatment at a homeless shelter, or go to jail. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt delivered the message during a Tuesday press conference.

""Seventy homeless encampments have been removed by the U.S. Park Police,"" Leavitt said, adding that the Metropolitan Police Department would be joining the Park Police in the effort. ""There are only two homeless encampments remaining in D.C. federal parks under the National Park Service's jurisdiction, and the removal of those two remaining camps is scheduled for this week.""
